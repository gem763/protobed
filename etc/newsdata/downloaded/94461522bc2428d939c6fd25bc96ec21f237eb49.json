Al.com reports the test is the result of a new state law that requires third graders to read on grade level starting with the 2021-22 school year in order to advance to fourth grade. Critics say the testing will result in students with disabilities and English language learners to be held back. At a recent meeting in Montgomery, Decatur Superintendent Michael Douglas said that if teachers are not properly trained, it could become a \u201cbig train wreck.\u201d This year\u2019s first graders have three years to get ready for the make-or-break reading test.\n\nAlaska\n\nYellow cedars grow in the West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness, north of Sitka, Alaska, in 2005. (Photo: Paul Hennon/USDA Forest Service via AP)\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency has rejected an iconic Alaska tree for listing as a threatened species due to climate warming. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday that yellow cedars do not warrant additional protections because trees affected by warming grow in areas representing less than 6% of the overall area where they can be found. A spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity calls the yellow cedar decision reckless. Shaye Wolf says yellow cedars face harm from climate change and logging. Yellow cedar trees can live more than 1,000 years. Alaska Native people have used wood and bark for canoe paddles, totem poles, baskets and backing in blankets. Yellow cedar\u2019s shallow roots rely on snow for protection, and warming has made them vulnerable to freezing.\n\nArizona\n\nThe Piestewa family and members of the Hopi Tribe participate in the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening up the new vehicle/pedestrian bridge Friday. (Photo: Alyssa Stoney/The Republic)\n\nPhoenix: The city celebrated the grand reopening of the Piestewa Peak trailhead\u2019s new and upgraded amenities Friday morning. The event featured a tribal blessing from the Gila River Indian Community, along with remarks from Phoenix officials and members of the Hopi Tribe. The ceremony ended with a ribbon-cutting opening the new 104-foot-long pedestrian and vehicle bridge. The trailhead improvements included renovated parking lots that doubled the amount of parking at the trail, an 84-ton bridge connecting the parking lots to improve traffic flow, and access to trails. The summit was renamed Piestewa Peak in 2003 after fallen soldier Lori Ann Piestewa, who was the first Native American woman to die in combat.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Department of Human Services has temporarily taken over three more nursing homes after complaints were made about how they were being run. The agency previously put the private operator\u2019s other two nursing homes into receivership. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that Facebook posts tipped off DHS about potential problems with resident care, payroll and the purchasing of supplies, which led state inspectors to visit the five locations. While the state is the temporary receiver, it will ensure that the homes remain open, that residents are taken care of and that employees are paid until DHS is assured the homes are operating as they should. No residents are expected to be moved.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDirector of Central Library Kren Malone, left, watches as City Librarian John F. Szabo unveils a long-lost sculpture, recently discovered in Arizona, on Friday at the Central Library in Los Angeles. (Photo: Dania Maxwell/Los Angeles Times via AP)\n\nLos Angeles: A bronze sculpture that mysteriously disappeared from the Los Angeles Central Library 50 years ago has returned to its original home. One of three panels of the Well of Scribes was unveiled at the downtown library Friday, the Los Angeles Times reports. The sculpture depicting writers from different cultures vanished in 1969 when the library underwent a renovation. The story of its disappearance was revived in Susan Orlean\u2019s 2018 novel \u201cThe Library Book,\u201d which inspired Alta magazine\u2019s managing editor to investigate its whereabouts. An article published in the magazine\u2019s July edition caught the attention of an antiques dealer in Arizona who bought the panel from a woman for $500 years earlier. City Librarian John Szabo says the discovery has given him hope the other two panels might turn up one day.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Real estate experts say a state agency has left an office building unoccupied for about a decade, representing millions in lost potential revenue. The Denver Post reports the five-floor Capitol Hill building is one of three owned by the state Public Employee Retirement Association, which manages the retirement fund for about 600,000 current and former public employees and retirees. Officials say the agency has lost $1.8 billion on investments in 2018, and the losses cost the workers who pay into the agency and the retirees who receive benefits. City appraisers say the 40,000-square-foot building would be worth about $8 million in a sale. An agency spokesperson says officials have been looking for a tenant for more than two years but have been unsuccessful.\n\nConnecticut\n\nErnest \u201cMac\u201d McCauley, a veteran pilot who volunteers with the Collings Foundation, works on one of the nine-cylinder radial engines on a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber on display July 1 at the Spokane International Airport in Spokane, Wash. (Photo: Jesse Tinsley/The Spokesman-Review via AP)\n\nHartford: The educational group that owns the B-17 bomber that crashed at an airport, killing seven people, says it is suspending flights and its Wings of Freedom Tour for the remainder of the year. The Collings Foundation said Friday that the decision comes in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s tragic crash. The plane carrying 13 people crashed and burned after experiencing mechanical trouble on takeoff from Bradley International Airport. The foundation says its flight team is cooperating with officials to determine the cause. The propeller-driven 1945 B-17 Flying Fortress was part of the foundation\u2019s extensive Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display. The group says it will refund tickets for flights through December.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington City Council President Hanifa Shabazz in the City Council chambers in 2018. (Photo: Jerry Habraken/Delaware News Journal)\n\nWilmington: The City Council president is pressing criminal charges against a man who regularly criticizes her and other officials at public meetings. Dion Wilson was arrested at his home Wednesday on misdemeanor charges of harassment and disorderly conduct. Court documents show City Council President Hanifa Shabazz told police she feared for her safety. Wilson is free pending a December arraignment, but his release conditions bar him from entering the city government building. Wilson says his arrest is an overreach of power and an attempt to silence him. A board member for the Delaware Coalition for Open Government called Wilson\u2019s arrest an outrage. At one council meeting last month, Shabazz prevented Wilson from speaking during public comments, and Wilson responded with profanity.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A public psychiatric hospital has been without drinking water for more than a week. News outlets report bacteria that can cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease were found in the water system of St. Elizabeths Hospital last month, leading staff and patients at the district-owned facility to rely on bottled water. The District Department of Behavioral Health director, Barbara J. Bazron, says no one has shown any signs of illness as a result of the bacteria discovered during a routine water supply test. Emergency protocols were put into place, and staff and patients are now using substitutes for running water, including wipes and body wash spray. Despite the problems first reported by the Washington City Paper, St. Elizabeths continues to admit patients.\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida trappers Jonathan Lopez, left, and Cynthia Downer pose with a record-setting python they captured at the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of Miami, Fla. (Photo: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission via AP)\n\nBig Cypress National Preserve: Officials say trappers have captured a record-setting python as part of a growing effort that encourages hunters to remove the invasive snakes from the Everglades. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says the 18-foot, 4-inch female python weighed 98 pounds and 10 ounces. A statement by the Fish and Wildlife Commission says it was the largest snake captured by the new Python Action Team and the largest ever captured at the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of Miami. The agency says it is the second-largest python ever caught in the wild in Florida. The commission says hunting female Burmese pythons is critical because they add between 30 and 60 hatchlings each time they breed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTyler Perry attends the grand opening gala for his Tyler Perry Studios on Saturday in Atlanta. (Photo: Paul R. Giunta/Getty Images)\n\nAtlanta: Tyler Perry officially christened his massive new film studio Saturday, beaming as his fellow entertainment industry luminaries descended on Atlanta and strode a red carpet to his sprawling complex for an opening gala. The attendees warmly greeted Perry, a man who had once been homeless and yet now helmed his own studio, one of the nation\u2019s largest. Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee, Cicely Tyson, Samuel L. Jackson, Halle Berry and others helped Perry christen his new facility, a 330-acre studio that once served as a Confederate army base. Winfrey praised Perry and said the new studio head is a force to be reckoned with. Jackson pointed to Perry\u2019s vision as the key to his ascent. Tyler Perry Studios has 12 soundstages, each named after seminal black actors and actresses.\n\nHawaii\n\nNahiku: Scientists have used helicopters to launch an aerial attack against an invasive ant species on east Maui. Maui News reports the Maui Invasive Species Committee and Hilo-based Hawaii Ant Lab sprayed low-toxicity gel bait from helicopters Tuesday to curb the stinging pests in the Nahiku forest. Scientists say 15 helicopters were part of a joint-island effort to treat an infestation of little fire ants called one of the worst invasive species in the world. Crews from Maui and Hawaii island say the spray combines food-grade ingredients and a birth control-like growth regulator. Experts say the South American native insects are smaller than the average friendly ant and have a burning sting that can permanently blind cats and dogs and cause irritation for humans.\n\nIdaho\n\nWinchester: A public health advisory is in place for Winchester Lake after testing indicated elevated levels of toxins produced by blue-green algae. The Lewiston Tribune reports health officials and the Nez Perce Tribe have urged people to use caution when spending time in or near the water. A release from Public Health Idaho North Central District says blue-green algae is a natural part of Idaho\u2019s water bodies. But when temperatures rise, their populations can bloom, and toxic chemical compounds can be released into the water. Those spending time near surface water with a health advisory are urged to avoid swimming, wading or other activities. Health officials say people should not drink or cook with water containing a bloom.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker is self-funding hundreds of thousands of dollars of renovations to the historic Governor's Mansion. (Photo: Justin L. Fowler/The State Journal-Register via AP)\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker is spending $850,000 of his own money to continue renovations to the historic Illinois Governor\u2019s Mansion, including fixing tile on the first floor, remodeling guest rooms and modernizing current plumbing. The estate built in 1855 will be closed for tours until Nov. 23 due to the latest overhaul. The Chicago Sun-Times reports the billionaire businessman has given at least $3.45 million of his money to cover government costs that include doubling some salaries. The Democrat broke campaign finance records last year by giving his own campaign $171.5 million. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner, also a wealthy businessman, launched his own privately funded $15 million mansion makeover, leading a fundraising campaign that started in early 2015.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Bureau of Motor Vehicles is putting on hold a policy allowing nonbinary gender designations on driver\u2019s licenses while officials develop new formal regulations for gender changes on state-issued IDs. The agency had proposed allowing such changes with an amended birth certificate or a special state Department of Health form signed by a doctor. State Attorney General Curtis Hill stalled the proposal last month, citing insufficient public notification. The BMV says it is working on a revised proposal and set a public hearing for Nov. 15. BMV spokeswoman Susan Guyer tells The Journal Gazette it will continue processing male-to-female and female-to-male gender modifications with a doctor\u2019s statement.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court has apologized to a legislative committee investigating the break-ins at courthouses and the court system\u2019s own state-owned building as part of a cybersecurity vulnerability test. Speaking Friday to the Senate Government Oversight Committee, Mark Cady acknowledged mistakes as the judicial branch worked to protect confidential information and promised they wouldn\u2019t happen again. Senators criticized several judicial branch administrators for signing contracts with a cybersecurity company without properly vetting them for inconsistencies or errors. Information technology employees say they believe the men who burglarized the court buildings acted outside the scope of the contract. Sen. Tony Bisignano called it a \u201ccovert stupid operation\u201d that put law enforcement officers and the men involved in the break-ins at risk.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has joined a legal battle to save a federal program that shields young immigrants from deportation. Kelly\u2019s move Friday puts the Democratic governor and Republican Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt on opposite sides of a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly signed onto written legal arguments opposing President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Kelly joined Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and the Democratic attorneys general of Michigan and Nevada. Schmidt has joined 11 other GOP state attorneys general and Mississippi\u2019s Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in a court filing arguing that the DACA program established by President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t lawful.\n\nKentucky\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks to a gathering of soldiers at the University Club at the University of Louisville on Friday. (Photo: Timothy D. Easley/AP)\n\nLouisville: U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell says he\u2019s working to secure sufficient funding for the state\u2019s military posts, including a new middle school at Fort Campbell. The Trump administration announced plans last month to divert $3.6 billion in funding from military projects like schools to pay for the construction of a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. McConnell made the remarks Friday during an appearance in Louisville with Defense Secretary Mark Esper where they highlighted the importance of Kentucky\u2019s military installations to national security. McConnell called last month\u2019s announcement a \u201cbump along the way\u201d to getting the sufficient long-term military funding and pledged to \u201cfully fund a new middle school at Fort Campbell, something they\u2019ve wanted for years and I secured in the first place.\u201d\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A southeastern Louisiana university has released its first branded beer. Nicholls State University launched Colonels Retreat, a lager brewed by Bayou Tech Brewery, at Saturday\u2019s football game against Central Arkansas. The Houma Courier reports that the first pours came at an alumni tailgate on the Thibodaux campus, for members of the Nicholls Alumni Federation who were 21 and older. Colonels Retreat sales will bring in revenue for the university and the alumni association. Nicholls\u2019 lager is the latest in a trend of beers named for or licensed by Louisiana colleges and universities. Arnaudville-based Bayou Teche Brewing also brews branded beers for McNeese State and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Universities with licensed beers from other brewers include Tulane, Northwestern State and the University of Louisiana at Monroe.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state\u2019s Supreme Court says Goose Rocks Beach belongs to the town of Kennebunkport and not the beachfront landowners who spent years fighting to keep the public off the beach. Goose Rocks Beach landowners contend Maine law says waterfront property extends all the way to the low tide mark, allowing them to exclude the public. However, there\u2019s also a long-established public rights doctrine from 1674 that allows the use of the \u201cintertidal zone\u201d between the high and low tide watermarks for fishing, fowling and navigation. The Maine Supreme Judicial concluded there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d that beachfront owners failed to establish ownership. The beach has been the subject of litigation for a decade.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, right, holds a news conference in Baltimore in July 2016. (Photo: Steve Ruark/AP)\n\nBaltimore: The city\u2019s top prosecutor has begun asking judges to throw out nearly 800 convictions she says were tainted by officers linked to a corruption scandal. The Baltimore Sun reports State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby\u2019s review found 790 criminal cases handled by 25 city officers whom she says she has reason to distrust. Mosby updated the number of officers being scrutinized Friday, saying it could fluctuate as her office investigates. Eight members of the Gun Trace Task Force were convicted of racketeering crimes and sentenced to prison. Many of the other 17 officers cited by Mosby\u2019s office were named in testimony during the federal trial, though not necessarily charged with crimes. Mosby\u2019s office hasn\u2019t disclosed all their names because of ongoing federal investigations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nConcord: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has recommended replacing the two narrow and often backed-up bridges that carry vehicular traffic across the Cape Cod Canal. The Corps, which oversees the Bourne and Sagamore bridges, issued its draft report Thursday following a study that weighed the advantages of rehabbing the nearly 85-year-old bridges versus replacing them entirely. The Corps determined replacing them would be more cost-effective than paying $1.5 billion to rehabilitate them. The report recommends replacing the four-lane bridges with new, wider four-lane structures that include auxiliary acceleration-deceleration lanes, plus bike and pedestrian access. Construction of new bridges, in roughly the same location as the current bridges, could start as early as 2025.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city is receiving $9.7 million from the federal government to help remove lead from homes, the largest single amount awarded to a local government. The Detroit News reports the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the lead abatement grants Thursday at nonprofit Urban Neighborhood Initiatives. Mayor Mike Duggan says the subsidies will help 450 homeowners living in zip code 48209, a southwest neighborhood with 75% of its houses constructed in the 1940s or earlier. The Detroit Health Department will run the program and post information for prospective homeowners in January. Duggan says Detroit expects to start work on the first set of houses before the end of spring.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The mother of a girl whose videotaped arrest sparked an angry backlash on social media says her 13-year-old daughter has a mental illness, and officers were overly aggressive in handling her. Prosecutors filed a juvenile delinquency petition Friday charging the girl with fourth-degree assault in connection with her arrest in St. Paul last week. Police say the incident began after the teen violated a no-trespassing order, fled officers and ultimately resisted arrest. But the girl\u2019s mother, Davida Conover, says her daughter was \u201cbasically treated like an animal.\u201d Video of the arrest recorded by a witness shows three white officers struggling to arrest the black teen as she screams and thrashes on the floor of a UPS store. Conover has accused the officers of racial bias.\n\nMississippi\n\nClay Chandler, director of communications for Gov. Phil Bryant, holds Mississippi\u2019s new standard license plate at the Capitol in Jackson. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis/AP)\n\nGulfport: The state\u2019s blue guitar license plates are disappearing, and any vehicle that still wears one come January will be an easy target for a traffic ticket. By the end of the year, \u201cLucille\u201d will be retired. The blue-and-white plate honored musician B.B. King and his guitar Lucille. But many people in the state aren\u2019t crazy about the \u201cdirty\u201d brown color and design of the new plate. There\u2019s a fix for that \u2013 actually, more than 225 options \u2013 and nearly 1 in 4 of Mississippi\u2019s 2.9 million vehicles now sports a specialty plate or a vanity plate with a personalized message. Sales of specialty plates are up 10% from January through August compared to the same time last year, says Kaitlin O\u2019Dougherty, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Revenue.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A federal judge has declined to block a state law that bans companies from labeling plant-based meat products or meat substitutes as meat. U.S. District Judge Fernando Gaitan Jr. said last week that he wouldn\u2019t issue a preliminary injunction to stop Missouri agriculture officials from enforcing the law, which says a product cannot be marketed as meat unless it comes from an animal with two or four feet, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Turtle Island Foods, which produces Tofurky products, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Good Food Institute appealed the decision Wednesday. They argue the law violates their free-speech rights. Gaitan wrote in his opinion that Tofurky would not be affected by the law because its labels disclose that its products are plant-based or grown in labs.\n\nMontana\n\nThe Crazy Mountains as seen from Mission Creek Road. (Photo: Custer Gallatin National Forest)\n\nBillings: U.S. forest officials have announced details of a proposed land exchange that would increase public access. The Billings Gazette reports the Custer Gallatin National Forest proposed trading portions of forest lands to the Crazy Mountain Ranch, Rock Creek Ranch and Wild Eagle Mountain Ranch. The deal includes 5 square miles of forest lands for about 6 square miles of private land. Officials say entire sections are privately owned, and the forest has worked to consolidate its holdings since 1934. Forest officials say exchange discussions have been underway since 2005 but picked up recently after dedicating more staff to the project. The Forest Service is expected to host an open house in Livingston on Oct. 23 to discuss the proposal.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Proposed social studies standards for the state\u2019s schoolchildren would encourage them to look at history from multiple perspectives. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the draft proposal was written by a group of Nebraska educators and suggests what students should know about and be able to do in history, government, civics, geography and economics. If the standards are approved by the Nebraska State Board of Education next month, school districts must adopt the standards or their own of equal or greater rigor. The new proposal emphasizes the importance of understanding different points of view and provides examples to emphasize the point. It mentions, for example, the different perspectives among religious, racial and ethnic groups, immigrants, women, LGBTQ people and Native American nations.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed amendment to a county ordinance has renewed a debate about the rights of sex workers in the state. The Las Vegas Sun reports the Nye County ordinance would restrict the hours when legal prostitutes are permitted to leave licensed brothels. Officials say workers would be prohibited from leaving brothels for more than six hours within a 10-day period. Brothel officials say they are concerned workers could have unprotected sex off the premises. Some current and former sex workers say the ordinance infringes on the rights of legal prostitutes. Nye County Commission officials declined to comment when asked if the ordinance discriminates against or violates the rights of prostitutes. The draft is set to be introduced Oct. 15.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGrateful Dead band members, from left, Mickey Hart, Phil Lesh, Jerry Garcia, Brent Mydland, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir. (Photo: AP)\n\nManchester: Scholars and die-hard fans of the Grateful Dead will soon gather in the state for a weeklong conference that looks at the cultural impact of the band. Saint Anselm College in Manchester will host \u201cA Long Strange Trip: The Culture of the Grateful Dead\u201d on Oct. 22-25. The event will feature panels and discussions that touch on subjects such as how the iconic band with songs like \u201cFriend of the Devil\u201d and \u201cTerrapin Station\u201d influenced pop culture as well as drug culture. The event concludes with something that the band\u2019s late lead guitarist Jerry Garcia would have loved \u2013 a musical jam. Among the speakers will be Thomas Mangan, a filmmaker and executive producer of a four-part documentary on the Grateful Dead, titled \u201cLong Strange Trip.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMarty Small, center, speaks at a swearing-in ceremony in Atlantic City, N.J., on Friday after becoming the gambling resort\u2019s acting mayor. With him are daughter Jada and wife La\u2019Quetta. (Photo: Wayne Parry/AP)\n\nAtlantic City: Marty Small intends on bringing big changes to this city, where yet another political corruption scandal has propelled him to the office he has sought for so long. Small, the City Council president, became acting mayor Friday, a day after Frank Gilliam Jr., a fellow Democrat, admitted stealing $87,000 from a youth basketball club he founded, and resigned. It was the latest spin of the mayoral wheel in this seaside gambling resort, where political corruption has such a long, rich history that HBO created an award-winning TV series about it, \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d As recently as 2007, four of the city\u2019s last eight mayors had been arrested on corruption charges, and one-third of the nine-member City Council was either in prison or under house arrest. And Small himself was indicted twice \u2013 and acquitted twice \u2013 of election fraud-related charges.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A tree to be displayed outside the U.S. Capitol building over the holidays is supposed to come from a forest in the state \u2013 if the U.S. Forest Service can get an exception from a tree-cutting ban across all New Mexico national forests and one in Arizona. The agency says it\u2019s trying. The ban came in a 2013 lawsuit filed by WildEarth Guardians that accused the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of failing to track the threatened Mexican spotted owl for more than 20 years. A federal judge has OK\u2019d personal firewood permits but sidelined other timber management activities. The Capitol Christmas Tree is scheduled to be cut from Carson National Forest early next month. WildEarth Guardians says the ban wouldn\u2019t prevent that from happening.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is taking most 17-year-olds with offenses out of the adult criminal justice system. The change is effective this month under the second part of 2017 legislation that raised New York\u2019s age of criminal responsibility to 18. The first part of the law addressing most 16-year-olds went into effect last year. New York had been among the last states that automatically prosecuted 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Supporters say incarcerating youth alongside adults is connected with higher suicide rates and increased recidivism. This year\u2019s state budget includes $200 million in funding for programs such as diversion services. Under the legislation, such young people charged with misdemeanors would have their cases tried in family court proceedings.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican lawmakers are defending how they redrew state House districts at the direction of state judges who found lines drawn two years ago were tainted by extreme partisan bias favoring the GOP. The legislators\u2019 attorneys filed a brief Friday urging the three-judge panel that ordered the remap to leave recent changes intact. They are responding to the victors in a partisan gerrymandering lawsuit. Common Cause and state Democrats questioned last week how Republicans redrew nearly 20 House districts last month and asked the court to fix them. The GOP attorneys rejected accusations that lawmakers violated the court\u2019s prohibitions of using partisan data. The judges have a redistricting expert at their disposal to remake some or all of the districts that the legislature approved last month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nSwedish climate activist and student Greta Thunberg smiles on stage after addressing the Climate Strike in Montreal, Quebec, on Sept. 27. (Photo: Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nCannon Ball: A 16-year-old climate activist who garnered international attention when she scolded world leaders at the United Nations is visiting American Indian reservations in the Dakotas to talk about oil pipelines. Greta Thunberg appeared at panel discussions on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota on Sunday evening and is scheduled to do the same on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota on Tuesday. The Lakota People\u2019s Law Project says Thunberg is concerned about the proposed path of the Keystone XL pipeline and plans to double oil flowing through the Dakota Access pipeline. Thunberg traveled to the United States in August on a sailboat to promote her climate change campaign.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A bill that would require public middle and high school students to take an annual class in suicide and violence prevention training is headed to the state Senate. The bill passed last week by the Ohio House also would require every public school to have a student-led anti-violence club and a threat assessment team composed of school staff. The proposed Safety And Violence Education For Students Act, or SAVE Students Act, would also mandate that schools contract with an anonymous, round-the-clock reporting system to field and report tips about potential safety threats. Republican Rep. Gayle Manning, of North Ridgeville, introduced the legislation in March. She says it aims to reduce social isolation and give schools and students the necessary tools and resources for suicide-prevention and threat-assessment training.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEnid: A woman was shot in the thigh when a dog inside the vehicle with her jumped onto a back-seat console, causing a gun under the console to fire. The Enid News & Eagle reports Tina Springer was in the passenger seat of the vehicle that had stopped Thursday to wait for a train. The yellow Labrador retriever, which belongs to the 79-year-old driver Brent Parks, was in the back seat and jumped onto the folding console. That\u2019s when the .22-caliber handgun under the console went off. Police say cloth from the seat covers could have gotten into the trigger well of the gun, making it discharge. The 44-year-old Springer, who lives in Nash, Oklahoma, and is Parks\u2019 caretaker, was taken to a hospital for treatment. Police say Parks told them the gun isn\u2019t usually loaded.\n\nOregon\n\nFour wolf pups walk with an adult in Umpqua National Forest, Ore. (Photo: Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife via AP)\n\nSalem: A newly established pack of wolves has something to howl about. At least four pups have been born to the pack in the western part of the state, where they are still listed as endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday that a photo from a trail camera confirmed the pups\u2019 existence. Their fur gray with cream-colored streaks, three of them were photographed walking on an unpaved road with a larger wolf, with the fourth pup on the other side of the road and farther back. The existence of the pack was officially confirmed only early this year, when it numbered three wolves. The pups are growing fast. Officials with the federal and state wildlife departments say they placed a GPS collar on a pup suspected to be from the pack Sept. 26 in the Umpqua National Forest.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state law is ending a requirement that telephone customers who want to remain on the state\u2019s do-not-call registry have had to renew their listing every five years. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday signed changes to the Telemarketer Registration Act that also allow business phone customers to sign up for the do-not-call list. The legislation requires that robocalls start with a clear way for recipients to opt out of them and that telemarketing voicemails must include a phone number to prevent future calls. It bans telephone solicitation on legal holidays in the state. Lawmakers voted unanimously for the legislation. It takes effect in two months.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: The University of Rhode Island is holding a ceremony to celebrate the opening of a $150 million engineering complex. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation and URI officials plan to attend the event Monday morning at the South Kingstown campus. Voters approved $150 million in bond measures to build the Fascitelli Center for Advanced Engineering and renovate and expand Bliss Hall, which opened in 1928. Work began on the project \u2013 the largest construction project in the university\u2019s history \u2013 in February 2017. The Fascitelli Center opened for classes in September. It was designed with open spaces to foster collaboration across academic disciplines.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville County Sheriff's Department officers investigate the scene of an officer-involved shooting near Poe Mill on Monday, March 19, 2018. (Photo: JOSH MORGAN/Staff)\n\nGreenville: An investigation into law enforcement shooting records found that Greenville County deputies have pulled the trigger more than any other agency in the state. At least 31 times in 10 years, Greenville County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies fired their weapons at a person. Someone died in 19 of those shootings. In each case, authorities determined the shootings were justified, and no deputies were disciplined. Yet the fallout from each of the shootings lingers. Someone dies or is seriously injured; families grasp for explanations; communities become hesitant to interact with the people sworn to protect them; and officers\u2019 careers \u2013 and sometimes their mental state \u2013 are changed after a pressure-filled, split-second decision. The investigation found 1 in 8 fatal shootings by law enforcement officers in the state involves a Greenville County deputy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWind Cave National Park: More black-footed ferrets have been released at this southwestern South Dakota park. The National Park Service says 29 ferrets were released into their new home at the park Thursday. The ferrets, which will add to the park\u2019s estimated ferret population of 18 to 20 animals, were raised at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in northern Colorado. Park Superintendent Vidal Davila says the goal is to increase the ferret population and enhance the animal\u2019s genetics that have existed in the park since ferrets were originally reintroduced in 2007. Crews will perform surveys in the next week to monitor the newly released ferrets. Black-footed ferrets are considered among the rarest animals in North America.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: Two bear cubs were rescued after they locked themselves in a van and then honked the horn for help. News reports say security technician Jeff Stokely had parked his van outside a customer\u2019s home in Gatlinburg and went to work. Soon he heard a horn honking and realized it was his van. He went back to the van and was surprised when he saw two small bear cubs locked inside and repeatedly hitting the horn. Stokely says the cubs must have climbed in through the driver-side door and locked themselves inside by hitting the lock button. Stokely took video and photos of the cubs before opening a door to let them out. He says he didn\u2019t see Mama Bear nearby.\n\nTexas\n\nA women dressed as Selena has her photo taken during Fiesta de la Flor on April 13, 2019. (Photo: Courtney Sacco/Caller-Times)\n\nCorpus Christi: An annual celebration honoring the life of slain Tejano music queen Selena will no longer be held in her South Texas hometown. Officials in Corpus Christi were caught by surprise after learning their city would be losing the Fiesta de la Flor event, an annual two-day festival first held in 2015. The family of Selena Quintanilla-Perez announced Thursday that the festival was moving but didn\u2019t say where it would be held next year. Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb says losing the festival is a blow. The event had a nearly $11 million economic impact on the city this year. Next year\u2019s festival will coincide with the 25th anniversary of Selena\u2019s death. A former president of Selena\u2019s fan club is serving life in prison for killing her.\n\nUtah\n\nOfficials with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and State Parks carry a bighorn at a ranch on Antelope Island, where the sheep received vaccinations and health checks, on Jan. 5, 2018. (Photo: Rick Bowmer/AP)\n\nAntelope Island State Park: The state has announced plans to restore the bighorn sheep population a year after a respiratory illness outbreak killed more than 100 sheep. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources unveiled plans Thursday to release 35 sheep on Antelope Island in January with the goal of increasing the island\u2019s sheep population to 125. Wildlife biologist Jace Taylor said only 26 out of 150 sheep survived the November 2018 outbreak on Antelope Island, but they were later euthanized. Taylor said officials still haven\u2019t determined how the sheep contracted the disease. State park employees are planning to build a fence on the south end of the island to help monitor and contain the sheep. There are currently an estimated 4,150 bighorn sheep throughout Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A new historic site marker on the Lake Champlain waterfront commemorates the first documented international hockey game. The marker in Burlington\u2019s waterfront park was dedicated Saturday morning. The marker says the first recognized international ice hockey game took place on the ice of Lake Champlain in Burlington on Feb. 26, 1886. Organizers say the game between the Montreal Hockey Club and a local team assembled by the Van Ness House hotel is the first documented ice hockey game between teams from different countries. Montreal won 3-0. The game was part of the Burlington Carnival of Winter Sports in February.\n\nVirginia\n\nBuchanan: Agricultural producers in the state\u2019s southwest are feeling the pain of drought conditions. The Roanoke Times reports most of the Roanoke and New River valleys are experiencing moderate drought, with some parts reaching severe levels. The last areawide rainstorm fell July 23. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 40% of pasture in Virginia in very poor condition. In addition, 67% of apples have been harvested this year, down from 74% during the same time last year. Botetourt County farmer Kevin Marshall says conditions forced him to feed hay to cattle starting in mid-September, two months early. He says he thinks he\u2019ll have enough hay for the winter but won\u2019t make extra cash selling some.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Orange, yellow, white and purple carrots of all shapes and sizes were harvested last week as part of a research trial to test carrots\u2019 genetic resistance to disease. The Skagit Valley Herald reports plant pathologist Lindsey du Toit said 220 breeding lines of carrots were planted in a research plot this summer at the Washington State University Mount Vernon Research Center. She said the goal is to find varieties that have the best nutrition and flavor and are genetically resistant to disease. Volunteers helped harvest the carrots and sort them based on the severity of fungus growing on them. The fungus was added to the soil earlier in the growing season to expose the carrots to disease. Du Toit said the research could help organic carrot growers in Skagit County.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A project to digitize historical newspaper archives has landed another grant. The West Virginia University Libraries\u2019 West Virginia & Regional History Center received a nearly $202,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to keep digitizing newspapers published in the state from 1790 to 1923. It\u2019s the fifth grant contribution from the National Endowment for the Humanities, bringing the group\u2019s total contribution to the center\u2019s efforts to $968,000. The West Virginia center so far has contributed 400,000 pages from more than 50 historic newspapers to the Chronicling America website. The grant will allow another 100,000 pages to be added. This round of newspapers focuses on the Civil War and the West Virginia Mine Wars.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers plans to announce four pardons Monday. (Photo: Scott Bauer/AP)\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers will issue the state\u2019s first pardons in nine years, invoking his constitutional power to grant clemency to four people. Evers plans to issue the pardons Monday \u2013 the first he\u2019s making as governor after he restarted the pardons board in June. Evers\u2019 predecessor, Republican Scott Walker, never issued a single pardon over his eight years as governor. The planned pardons are the first in the state since Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle pardoned more than 100 people in his final three months in office in 2010. Evers is to pardon Eric Pizer, Kevin Sorenson, Mwangi Vasser and Steven Nichols. All four \u201chave paid their debt to society, made amends, and contributed to their communities,\u201d Evers said in a statement. \u201cI believe they deserve a second chance.\u201d\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor\u2019s office has introduced a hunger initiative aimed at creating a united effort against food insecurity across the state. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports Gov. Mark Gordon\u2019s wife, Jennie, announced the Wyoming Hunger Initiative\u2019s launch Friday. The Republican governor says the initiative aims to bring various groups together to work on food security. Officials say the state Governor\u2019s Residence Foundation board is expected to raise grant money for organizations and school districts throughout the state. They say more than 12.3% of Wyoming residents are food insecure, meaning they lack access to enough food for a healthy life. The national average is 12.5%. The state Department of Education says more than 36% of students in the K-12 system qualify for free or reduced-cost lunch.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/07/grateful-dead-greta-dakotas-aerial-ant-attack-news-around-states/40276147/", "description": "Proposal would limit brothel workers\u2019 freedom of movement in Nevada, Baltimore convictions targeted for tossing amid police scandal, and more", "authors": ["Usa Today Network", "Wire Reports", "Published A.M.
