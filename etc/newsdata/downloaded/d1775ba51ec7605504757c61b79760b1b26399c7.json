The team has yet to formally announce the hire, though Heyman indicates it\u2019s all but a done deal at this point.\n\nCallaway was fired by the Mets shortly after the conclusion of their 2019 campaign, though, as Nightengale points out, he\u2019s still owed $1.05 million in 2020. He lasted just two seasons in the skipper\u2019s seat, guiding the club to a disheartening 163-161 record from 2018-2019 and failing to help them qualify for the postseason in either run. Overall, he\u2019s seen far more success as a pitching coach \u2014 both in the majors and minors \u2014 and played a pivotal role in the Indians\u2019 2016 and 2017 playoff appearances.\n\nCallaway will work under newly-hired manager Joe Maddon, who is set to make his return to the organization for the first time since 2005. Although Callaway operated out of the Angels\u2019 rotation and bullpen for a brief time in 2002-2003, overlapping with Maddon\u2019s five-year stint as Mike Scioscia\u2019s bench coach, this will be the first time the two have worked together in a management capacity.", "description": "Callaway will join newly-returned skipper Joe Maddon in 2020.", "authors": ["Ashley Varela"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zkMOeKaKs86GQPQeALTnUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kzQ273W50bPunf8dFN.maA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/dd03c70f55803b3f219bcb399ab96cc0", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
