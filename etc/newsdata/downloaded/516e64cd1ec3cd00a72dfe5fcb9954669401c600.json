That's when she witnessed the exchange between Stanley Nelson, 62, and Officer Jeremy Thomas of the Detroit Police Department.\n\nThomas said he had no idea anyone was watching when he walked up to Nelson.\n\n\"I walked up and I said, 'Excuse me, sir' and at that point, he's like, 'Ok, ok, I'll leave and I said, 'No, do you need some help?'\" Thomas told ABC affiliate WXYZ. \"And he turned around blindly and said, 'Yes, thank you. God bless.'\"\n\nWXYZ\n\nNelson was attempting to shave after receiving a razor and shaving cream as a handout from a Good Samaritan.\n\n\"What he did for me, that was alright,\" Nelson told WXYZ of Thomas' gesture. \"I really appreciate that because I'm going through my thing and I feel bad about myself, but I'm going to be alright.\"\n\nHe went on, \"God's going to bless him for doing that for me.\"\n\nThomas' message is to help others whenever you can.", "description": "Jill Metiva Schafer captured the inspiring moment as Officer Jeremy Thomas of the Detroit Police Department, assisted Stanley Nelson, 62.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/officer-helping-homeless-man-shave-street-ht-jc-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
