It would have been a titanic struggle for the snake to subdue the frog and swallow it.\n\n'The frog must have noticed the movement of the snake's head as it slid over the reeds in front of it and it reacted instinctively, taking the whole of the snake's head in its mouth and clamping down hard with its jaws.\n\n'I was totally amazed and intrigued to see what was going to happen next! The frog was large but he was never going to be able to swallow the 18-inch snake whole.\n\n'As the frog's jaws clamped around the snakes head the snake began to writhe around frantically trying to free itself.\n\n'I think it had suddenly dawned on him that he now had a 'tiger by the tail' so to speak, or a 'snake by the head'.\n\nThe snake writhed around to try to get free (pictured) but the frog braced its front legs on the surrounding reeds and stabilised itself\n\n'If he let go roles could rapidly be reversed and he could end up as lunch. Realising this lunch item was way too big for him to swallow, he must have been desperately pondering how to extricate himself from this ordeal in one piece.\n\n'I'm sure the snake had little idea of who had him in its jaws as the lightning reactions of the frog meant the snake's head had disappeared into the abyss of the frog's mouth before it had time to see what was attacking.'\n\nMr Barnard, a father of two who has liked photography from an early age, said people have been stunned by the unique images.\n\nThe serpent went quiet and its body lay still as if admitting defeat. But suddenly the frog spat out the snake and hopped away as the ophidian lay stunned before slithering off\n\nHe said while everyone has seen pictures of snakes eating frogs on wildlife programmes, but it was rare to see something like this in the UK.\n\nMr Barnard spends most days at the reserve either helping out with habitat management, taking photos or adding to the invertebrate database collected on site.\n\nHe said: 'This is nature in action on our doorsteps. A lot of local people have not visited this amazing reserve before but have been intrigued by the spectacles available on their doorsteps.\n\nRetired assistant headteacher and former elite rugby union referee John Barnard snapped the surreal scene on September 15 while sat watching frogs hunt dragonflies in the reeds\n\n'Every time I visit the reserve there is always the expectation and excitement of finding something new to photograph, whether that be an insect I have not seen before, a new species to record or an amazing interaction between two species never witnessed or recorded before.\n\n'So far this year I have found and recorded at least four insects never recorded before on-site. Some are also the first records for this part of the country.\n\n'Nature is amazing and we should never take for granted the wildlife we have a responsibility to protect and conserve for future generations.'", "description": "The marsh frog came face-to-face with an 18-inch grass snake in Tophill Low Nature Reserve in East Yorkshire before clamping down on its head (pictured).", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/12/19294334-0-image-a-47_1570187960655.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
