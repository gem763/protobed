She also has more than 200 million followers on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nBillboard named her \"Woman of the Year\" in 2018 after she raised $29m for victims of the Manchester suicide bombing attack, the lawsuit said.\n\nMs Grande is one of a long line of celebrities to sue over trademarks.\n\nFor example, in July, Kim Kardashian-West won $2.7m in damages after accusing fashion brand Missguided USA of ripping off her outfits and using her name to sell clothes.\n\nJohn Coldham, a partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said the Ariana Grande case \"should act as a stark warning to brand owners to be very careful about using celebrity images and ensuring they are not implying an endorsement.\"", "description": "The singer is asking for $10m in damages from the US retailer, accusing it of trademark infringement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2A54/production/_108363801_ariana2.jpg"}
