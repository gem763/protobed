Her account must have been hacked,\u2019 said Carlos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I felt I had to say something because my daughter is so upset by the whole thing. Rebekah has only ever had praise for Colleen \u2013 I\u2019m just stunned. Why would my daughter want to make money from something like this?\u2019\n\nColeen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy (top) in 2016 (Picture: PA)\n\nSpeaking to the Mail Online, he added that Becky was \u2018completely devastated\u2019 and revealed that he found out about the scandals on the news.\n\n\u2018I know people are sick of Brexit, but I came home at lunch and put on the TV and my daughter\u2019s face was on nearly every channel,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018I had to switch the TV off in the end. I went to the Liverpool versus Leicester game last week and we had simply no idea this was about to kick off.\u2019\n\nColleen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of selling stories to the press (Picture: Instagram)\n\nRebekah and Coleen became pals as their husbands played alongside each other for England.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday morning Coleen sent shockwaves through the media when she alleged Rebekah had been selling fake stories about the Rooneys to newspapers.\n\nColeen wrote: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nRebekah Vardy is reportedly in tears over the drama with Coleen Rooney (Picture: REX)\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n\u2018The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house. \u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\u2018Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
