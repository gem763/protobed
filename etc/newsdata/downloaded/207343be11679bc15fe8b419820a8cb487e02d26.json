That makes five openings - San Francisco\u2019s Bruce Bochy and Kansas City\u2019s Ned Yost stepped away after previously saying they would retire, and San Diego\u2019s Andy Green was fired on Sept. 21.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s Gabe Kapler and the New York Mets\u2019 Mickey Callaway are thought to be in danger of losing their jobs this week.\n\nKapler\u2019s Phillies have gone 161-163 over two seasons, including 81-81 this year after signing Bryce Harper to a $330 million, 13-year contract, also adding Andrew McCutchen and David Robertson and trading for star catcher J.T. Realmuto and shortstop Jean Segura.\n\nCallaway\u2019s Mets are 163-161, including 86-76 this year after first-year general manager Brodie Van Wagenen proclaimed New York the NL East favorite, telling rivals \u201ccome get us.\u201d\n\nHitting and pitching coaches across the majors could be in jeopardy, too, on teams that missed the playoffs.\n\nHEALING UP\n\nThe Brewers hope outfielders Lorenzo Cain and Ryan Braun will be OK for Tuesday night\u2019s wild-card game at Washington. Cain sprained his left ankle sliding home Saturday, and while manager Craig Counsell was \u201cencouraged\u201d Sunday, he also didn\u2019t have a timeline for Cain\u2019s potential return. Counsell is more optimistic on Braun, who left a game Friday with a left calf strain but is expected to be ready for the Nationals.\n\nCounsell, meanwhile, has yet to say who will start against Washington ace Max Scherzer.\n\nHOW YOU DOIN\u2019?\n\nThe Twins and Yankees have players in need of treatment before they open an AL Division Series in the Bronx on Friday. Minnesota rookie Luis Arraez sprained his right ankle Saturday, and head athletic trainer Tony Leo said it could be anywhere from a few days to a week before he\u2019s ready to return. Arraez hit .334 in 92 games.\n\nNew York third baseman Gio Urshela sprained his left ankle Sunday, but the Yankees say it was mild with no swelling. Urshela said he expects to be ready for the opener. The Yankees are less certain on slugger Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n and his left oblique injury, although he\u2019s been adamant he\u2019ll be set.\n\nWAIT AND SEE\n\nThe Astros are awaiting an update on shortstop Carlos Correa heading into their ALDS opener at home Friday against the winner of the Tampa Bay-Oakland wild-card game.\n\nCorrea sat out the final week of the regular season with a back injury and was expected to work out early this week to determine whether he can play in the first round. Correa has barely played since Aug. 19, making only 11 plate appearances since. He is batting .279 with 21 homers and 59 RBIs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Monday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/cubs_cardinals_baseball_69512_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
