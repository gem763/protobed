When my cousin excitedly told me she bought them after getting a targeted Instagram ad, I rolled my eyes, sure that this was another gimmicky \u2019gram product that nobody needed. We cracked our second round, and as I sipped at my seltzer, wondering (for the thousandth time this summer) whether I even liked these in the first place, my Michelob Ultra-loving uncle (who only drinks his beer in slim cans, never bottles) explained that he had conducted tests with the Hopsulator. His conclusive scientific findings are hard to argue with: The cans could sit out for close to an hour in direct sunlight on a hot day without losing their cool, due to the double-walled stainless steel.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, as I was choking down the last lukewarm dregs of my drink, my cousin passed me her can of black cherry-flavored spiked seltzer nestled safely in the Br\u00fcMate. \u201cNow try this,\u201d she said. I took a sip and discovered that her drink was as ice cold as when she first cracked it open straight from the cooler.\n\nThe Hopsulator Slim presents a solution to a problem I hadn\u2019t really noticed before becoming a hard-seltzer drinker: Most koozies are only designed to fit standard 12-ounce cans. And trying to fit a slim can in one of those creates a twofold problem: not only does your drink lose its cool faster, it\u2019s an awkward fit. (Of course, Br\u00fcMate also sells a can cooler for standard 12-ounce cans, and even 24-ounce cans, to fit whichever beer brand you prefer.) And a soft koozie doesn\u2019t really compare: They don\u2019t have nearly the same degree of insulating power.\n\nI was also surprised to find that my family of hardcore Yeti users thought the Br\u00fcMate Hopsulator was just as good. And while they are about the same price, Yeti has yet to make a cooler designed for slim cans. The Hopsulator also comes in a variety of kicky colors ranging from standard blush pink to the more daring \u201cglitter merlot,\u201d as well as more subdued tones like matte gray and navy. And I am not alone in my undying love for the Hopsulator: over 1,300 devotees have left glowing reviews on Amazon (91 percent of which give it five stars.)\n\nWhile the summer of hard seltzer may be winding down, the Br\u00fcMate Hopsulator Slim Double Insulated Can Cooler will keep your beverage of choice frosty year-round \u2014 especially if that drink is packaged in a slim can.\n\nBr\u00fcMate Hopsulator Slim Stainless Steel Insulated Can Cooler, Glitter Merlot Here is the Hopsulator in the aforementioned Glitter Merlot. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nBr\u00fcMate Winesulator Triple-Walled Insulated Wine Canteen, Seafoam Green I also love this Winesulator, which can hold 25 ounces of your favorite natural wine, and is perfect for outdoor picnics. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBr\u00fcMate Insulated Champagne Flute With Flip-Top Lid, Walnut And if you want to get really fancy, this champagne flute with a clever flip-top lid should do the trick. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
