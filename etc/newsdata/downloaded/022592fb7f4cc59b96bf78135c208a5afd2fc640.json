Eleven days. It\u2019s what we waste while stuck in rush hour Joburg and Pretoria traffic. Get more time for your life with Gautrain.\"\n\nIn an accompanying Twitter campaign the Gautrain invited road users to switch to its service, and so find the time to learn to bake cakes or ride motorcycles.\n\nBut the ARB agreed with a complainant that the train service was pushing the truth.\n\nThe \"11 days\" claim is based on the INRIX 2018 Global Traffic Scorecard, but the ARB said those numbers reflected the time lost by commuters within Johannesburg and Pretoria every year \u2013 not those driving between the two cities.\n\nThe regulator believes the Gautrain took the numbers for each city, added them together, and used that as the basis for a claim about time wasted when driving between Johannesburg and Pretoria.\n\nThere are two other problems of logic with the ads, the ARB says. One, commuters still have to travel to and from train stations, and spend time on trains. Two, Gautrain users \"will not be able to magically combine this saving into some sort of extra days that can be used for some new activity\".\n\nInstead, the regulator said, using the Gautrain rather than commuting by car may save users 15 minutes a day.\n\n\"While this may be a benefit, it is far from the impression created by the commercial.\"\n\nCompiled by Phillip de Wet.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\n\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "An advertising regulator says the Gautrain's numbers are dodgy \u2013\u00a0and so is its logic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9224/083fab7550b4420b8466017434a78451.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
