The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador.\"\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament moments after Darroch's resignation that the criticism he faced was \"beyond unfair and wrong\".\n\n\"I think he's given honourable and good service and he should be thanked for it,\" she said.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday's publication of Darroch's cables set off a political firestorm in London and saw Trump launch two successive days of Twitter attacks against the envoy and May.\n\nOne of the cables called the Trump administration \"uniquely disfunctional\" and another characterised the US leader as \"inept\" and \"insecure\".\n\nTrump tweeted on Monday that Darroch \"is not liked or well thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him.\" He also welcomed the \"good news\" that Prime Minister Theresa May was stepping down in two weeks.\n\nThe US leader followed that up on Tuesday by calling \"wacky Ambassador\" Darroch \"a very stupid guy\".\n\nThe scandal saw Darroch taken off the guest list of a dinner attended by Trump on Monday.\n\nHe also missed visiting UK Trade Minister Liam Fox's talks in Washington on Tuesday with the president's adviser and daughter Ivanka Trump.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
