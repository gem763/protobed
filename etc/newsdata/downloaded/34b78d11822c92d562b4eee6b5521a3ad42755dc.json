She was undertaking work for Disney at the stage show, The Lion King,' he states.\n\nMs Standish (pictured above) alleges the injury deprived her of a 'lucrative' opportunity to appear in a show in Dubai\n\n'During the course of the show, she was given the all clear by another crew member to push scenery out on stage.\n\n'As she was pushing a rolling platform out onto the stage, it collided with a lighting tower which should have been moved out of a position where she could make contact with the tower, causing the rolling platform to ricochet backwards, hitting her right shoulder and causing her to sustain injury loss and damage.\n\n'Prior to this incident, there had been issues where the rolling platform had come into contact with the lighting tower at the same course of the performance.'\n\nDuring a brief pre-trial hearing, Mr Moat told the court that her shoulder injury caused her to miss out on the opportunity to star in the Dubai stage show.\n\n'The crux of this case is Ms Standish says she worked as a dancer and had a lucrative contract she was going to undertake abroad,' he said.\n\n'As a result of the injuries sustained, she wasn't able to undertake that contract and thus has lost income.\n\n'What she is saying is that, for a limited period of time, she was deprived of the opportunity to earn more lucrative sums,' he concluded, adding that she is claiming around \u00a380,000 in damages.\n\nMs Standish (pictured) was a gymnast and competed for Great Britain in the European Youth Olympics and the European championships before training as a dancer for musical theatre\n\nShe now works as a personal trainer (pictured above) but is suing The Walt Disney Company, claiming the accident torpedoed her dream of being on the stage, putting her 'back to square one.' Disney barrister Matthew Brunning claimed Miss Standish had pre-existing problems and would probably not have been able to fulfill the Dubai contract, even if there had been no accident\n\nAlthough Disney is 'primarily liable' for the accident, the court heard Disney plans to fight the case, arguing that it was not to blame for all the losses which Ms Standish claims.\n\nDisney barrister Matthew Brunning claimed Miss Standish had pre-existing problems and would probably not have been able to fulfill the Dubai contract, even if there had been no accident.\n\nMs Standish trained at prestigious dance school LABAN and the Bird College of musical theatre after her gymnastics career ended.\n\nOn an online blog, she describes how, whilst she was a stage technician on the West End production, she landed 'a dream job as a gymnast and acrobat on a show in Dubai'.\n\n'I was going, the dream was real, then an accident at work caused a major shoulder injury and I was back to square one,' she said.\n\nA trial of the case is set to go ahead next summer over three days.", "description": "Jodie Standish says her stage career was wrecked after she damaged her shoulder working as backstage crew.
