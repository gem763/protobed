As of Sunday night, the Tick Fire was 70 per cent contained.\n\nThe biggest evacuation was in Northern California\u2019s Sonoma County where 180,000 people were told to pack up and leave, many in the middle of the night.\n\nTo prevent its power lines from sparking in the high winds and setting off more blazes, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said on Sunday that preventative shut-offs impacted 965,000 customers and another 100,000 lost electricity because of strong gusts, bringing the number of residents impacted by blackouts to nearly 2.7 million people.\n\nPG&E officials said they were expecting strong winds to whip up again on Tuesday and that they have notified 500,000 customers \u2013 or more than 1 million people \u2013 that they are likely to have their power turned off for the third time in a week.\n\nChief executive officer and president of PG&E Andrew M Vesey said: \u201cWe recognise the hardship of not having power.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard with all our partners to ensure the most vulnerable customers are being cared for.\u201d\n\nSome of those people might not have their power restored from the current outage before the next major shutdown, which would leave them without electricity for five days or longer, said Mark Quinlan, PG&E\u2019s emergency preparedness and response director.\n\nThe fear that the winds could blow embers and spread fire across a major highway prompted authorities to expand evacuation orders that covered parts of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 that was devastated by a wildfire two years ago.\n\nSonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office tweeted on Sunday: \u201cThis is the largest evacuation that any of us can remember. Take care of each other.\u201d\n\nHundreds of people arrived at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa by Sunday.\n\nSome came from senior care facilities. More than 300 people slept inside an auditorium filled with cots and wheeled beds. Scores of others stayed in a separate building with their pets.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nMillions face blackouts as wildfires continue rage across California", "description": "California\u2018s governor has declared a state-wide emergency, ordering nearly 200,000 people to flee from the threat of wildfires fuelled by ferocious winds.Millions of people were left without power as hurricane-force winds whipped through the state.", "authors": ["Matt Drake"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rw9OhLXI4d_MPrTi9NM9Fw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/f4e553f3f1eec064dbf2c6181e8a3d7c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
