And free Chick-fil-A? Even tougher with their new macaroni and cheese and famous chicken sandwich. However, for a Louisiana charter school, declining the offer of complimentary lunch from the fast-food chain was an easy decision.\n\nRecently, Lusher Charter School was offered gratuitous Chik-Fil-A lunches for its teachers from the Louisiana College Football Foundation, but principal Steven Corbett turned down the donation \u201cto support our staff members who are LGBTQ,\u201d noting that the chicken-centric company has infringed upon LGBTQ individuals\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThe number one rule at Lusher is to \u2018Be Kind\u2019 and we live this motto every day,\u201d Corbett said in a statement, WWL-TV reports (Yahoo Lifestyle has reached out for comment and will report if we hear back). \u201cChick-Fil-A has been politically outspoken about its views, and we feel it is not part of Lusher\u2019s culture of kindness and community.\u201d\n\nIn #Nola @LusherPride (Lusher Charter School) is declining free lunches for staff on Friday because the meals are from @ChickfilA and the school wants to be \u2018sensitive to the LGBTQ \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 community\u2019 - Principal Steven Corbett \ud83d\udc47\n\nMore on this @wdsu at 4/5/6. pic.twitter.com/lbEKr1oAeF \u2014 Travers Mackel (@TraversWDSU) October 10, 2019\n\nDan Cathy, the son of Chick-Fil-A's founder and its current CEO, has been criticized in the past for his homophobic comments and views on gay marriage. Cathy has also been called out for donating millions of dollars to groups that openly push anti-LGBTQ agendas. According to Vox, in 2010 alone, Cathy donated more than $1.9 million to anti-gay groups, including Marriage and Family, a group that opposes gay marriage and divorce, and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an athletic organization that requires those who apply to sign a \"sex purity statement\" to condemn their perceived notion of the LGBTQ community living an \"impure lifestyle.\"\n\nReactions to Corbett\u2019s decision are mixed.\n\nMany supported the move on Twitter.\n\nthat's awesome, we need more of them! \u2014 Michael Giardino (@MJGiardino) October 10, 2019\n\nLusher, your community supports and thanks you in this effort! \u2014 Jonathan Gerhardt (@spikenola) October 10, 2019\n\nI am proud to see this, taking a stand for equality. Good on you @LusherPride, you are setting a wonderful example for the children at your school. Accept all, love all \u2764 \u2014 SuperPotatoCat (@ubatuber) October 10, 2019\n\nOn Facebook, Brandi Lotz wrote, \u201cSetting a great example to his students.\u201d Alyisen Gisleson, a self-described proud parent of 3 Lusher graduates, said, \u201cthanks, Mr. Corbett!\u201d\n\nThis is not supportive of all people. What about my faith? Support should also be for the Christian!!!! \u2014 Alicia (@awnolanurse90) October 10, 2019\n\nDamn! Might want to remove your kids from the school. These ppl are teaching the future. \u2014 Nikki Venable Brooks (@NikkiVbrooks) October 10, 2019\n\nOne fool making a decision for many \u2014 mike vernace (@bayougame) October 10, 2019\n\nChickfilA might have certain opinions that dont jive with those of the LGBTQ community, but they respect their opinions, and serve everyone. Whats sad is that this my-way-or-die, mentality that is tearing this country apart, thrives here at Lusher Charter School. Shame on them. \u2014 Janell (@janelly6512) October 10, 2019\n\nStephen Harrell was also in the questioning camp, sharing: \u201cDon\u2019t you think teachers have a rough enough time without denying them a generous offer of gratitude.\u201d Ruth Necaise offered a diplomatic opinion reminiscent of Ellen DeGeneres saying, \u201cEveryone has opinions, but kindness should not be denied.\u201d Jennifer Post Genaro called the situation ridiculous, adding, \u201cAccept a gift with thanksgiving and praise. Very rude to the foundation that paid for the food.\u201d\n\nAccording to WDSU, Corbett emailed staff letting them know his decision and that they would be provided another free lunch.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Principal Corbett said, \u201cThe number one rule at Lusher is to \u2018Be Kind\u2019 and we live this motto every day,\u201d", "authors": ["Megan Sims"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VxEOf8GlkLlCul8RdWzooQ--~B/aD02MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/709f4b80-ec74-11e9-bfec-53e5a809ff2e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
