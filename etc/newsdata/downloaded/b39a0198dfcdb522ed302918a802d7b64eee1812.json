Tyson said on Thursday that PG&E\u2019s shut-offs are affecting at least four hospitals, but the system was prepared.\n\n\u201cThis is when, as an individual who approves a lot of the expensive stuff it takes to do these kinds of things...this is where it really shows up of why it is so important,\u201d Tyson said at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit.\n\nNew reality\n\nThe entrance to the newly constructed Kaiser Permanente San Diego Medical Center hospital is shown in San Diego, California, U.S., April 17, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake More\n\nSince wildfires and the impact on the grid have become more commonplace, the executive said the generators are tested regularly, and could easily run for days. In 2018, a similar emergency situation hampered Kaiser\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cLast year we had a fire in the Napa area, where the fire actually called us to evacuate one of our hospitals,\u201d Tyson said \u2014 underscoring the gravity of the situation, and the need for PG&E to turn off sections of the grid.\n\n\u201cI get what we are trying to prevent, with the fire situations in California, and so this is a new reality that we\u2019re all coping with,\u201d he said.\n\nPG&E\u2019s move reflects how the company is moving preemptively, given that the fire could spread or become more severe, Tyson added.\n\n\u201cAnd so I get what they\u2019re trying to do, which is prevention,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is also based, in addition, on the infrastructure that may not withstand some of the pressure that we\u2019re talking about. And so this is more of a preventative measure.\u201d\n\nHospitals, with the massive amount of resources used and their large carbon footprints, have become part of the conversation on how to mitigate the environmental impact of certain industries.\n\nTyson said Kaiser is helping to spearhead change, and aims to cut its carbon footprint by 2025. The hospital system is also moving to waste fewer materials and resources.\n\n\u201cWe are paying close attention to issues in the healthcare system, and from everything from consumption of energy to waste materials, you name it,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cWe\u2019re rethinking the whole ecosystem that impacts Earth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
