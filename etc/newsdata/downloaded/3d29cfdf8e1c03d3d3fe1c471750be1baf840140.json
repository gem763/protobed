Elizabeth Warren sought Sunday to bolster her shaky claims of Cherokee ancestry with the story of how her racist grandparents drove her parents to elope.\n\nBut Cherokee genealogist Twila Barnes says that account has its own credibility issues.\n\nMs. Barnes, who said her research into Ms. Warren\u2019s family found \u201cno evidence\u201d of Native American ancestry, has challenged key elements of the senator\u2019s tale of how her parents, Pauline Reed and Donald Herring, defied his parents by running off to marry.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Warren\u2019s story is that none of the evidence supports it,\u201d said Ms. Barnes in a 2016 post on her Thoughts from Polly\u2019s Granddaughter blog. \u201cHer genealogy shows no indication of Cherokee ancestry. Her parents\u2019 wedding doesn\u2019t resemble an elopement. And additional evidence doesn\u2019t show any indication of her Herring grandparents being Indian haters.\u201d\n\nFaced with renewed scrutiny over her heritage, however, Ms. Warren appeared Sunday on three morning news shows to give context to her claim of minority status made during her stints on the Harvard and University of Pennsylvania law faculties.\n\n\u201cYou know, my mom and dad were born and raised out in Oklahoma, and my daddy was in his teens when he fell in love with my mother,\u201d said the Massachusetts Democrat. \u201cShe was a beautiful girl who played the piano. And he was head over heels in love with her and wanted to marry her. And his family was bitterly opposed to that because she was part Native American.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Elizabeth Warren: \u2018I am not running for president\u2019 in 2020\n\nAs a result, \u201ceventually my parents eloped,\u201d Ms. Warren said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe Berkshire [Massachusetts] Eagle called last week on Ms. Warren to take a DNA test, a suggestion seconded by Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi, saying she \u201chas nothing to lose but her Achilles\u2019 heel\u201d as the issue comes back to haunt her reelection campaign.\n\nMs. Warren deflected the DNA question Sunday by saying \u201cI know who I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who I am because of what my mother and my father told me, what my grandmother and my grandfather told me, what all my aunts and uncles told me, and my brothers,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of who I am and no one\u2019s ever going to take that away.\u201d\n\nThe senator is not an enrolled member of any tribe, but has cited family lore to support her claim.\n\nWhile Ms. Warren may genuinely believe the story of her star-crossed parents, Ms. Barnes has argued that the documentation doesn\u2019t back it up.\n\nShe cited the friendship between Grant Herring, Ms. Warren\u2019s paternal grandfather, and Carnall Wheeler, who was listed on the Cherokee Nation roll and mocked in his Virginia Military Institute yearbook as an \u201caboriginal.\u201d\n\nDocuments show that the two played golf together and that Mr. Wheeler attended a 25th anniversary party for the Herrings in 1936.\n\n\u201cClearly, Wheeler experienced some degree of racism in his life due to his being Indian,\u201d said Ms. Barnes. \u201cDespite this, there is one person we know who did not have a problem associating with him \u2014 Grant Herring, the grandfather of Elizabeth Warren, the same grandfather she claims was racist against Indians.\u201d\n\nThe post was headlined, \u201cDid Warren invent the story of racist grandparents?\u201d\n\nAfter Ms. Warren said in the Globe that her mother told her \u201cnobody came to her wedding at all,\u201d Ms. Barnes looked it up and found that her mother\u2019s friend witnessed the ceremony, which was performed by a prominent Methodist clergyman, not a justice of the peace.\n\n\u201cThis marriage does not look like an elopement. It looks very much like a Depression-era marriage ceremony instead,\u201d said Ms. Barnes in an August 2012 post. \u201cSometimes people didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on a wedding so they just obtained their license, got married and then went back home.\u201d\n\nShe also found a detailed wedding announcement posted in the local newspaper in Wetumka, Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cIf Ms. Warren\u2019s parents eloped due to her mother being \u2018Cherokee and Delaware\u2019 and it was such a disgrace, why did they rush back to Wetumka the same day they were married and proudly announce it to everyone?\u201d asked Ms. Barnes. \u201cIf there was shame associated with the marriage and it caused so many problems, why was it happily announced in the local paper?\u201d\n\nGiven that Ms. Warren\u2019s father had just turned 21, the age after which he could legally marry in Oklahoma without his parents\u2019 permission, \u201cMaybe his parents feared if he got married, he would drop out of college. And according to the evidence, that is exactly what happened,\u201d she said.\n\nCornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson vouched for the credibility of Ms. Barnes\u2018 fact-finding.\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything that called into question the integrity of Twila Barnes\u2018 research,\u201d said Mr. Jacobson, who runs the Legal Insurrection blog. \u201cTo the contrary, she has meticulously researched Warren\u2019s family lineage demonstrating no Native American ancestry, as well as facts rebutting Warren\u2019s family lore stories.\u201d\n\nAccusations that Ms. Warren gamed the system to advance her legal career have dogged her since her first Senate race in 2012, although she has insisted \u2014 and the universities have backed her up \u2014 that she received no preferential treatment in hiring by citing Native American ancestry.\n\nPresident Trump has drawn attention to the issue by dubbing her \u201cPocahontas,\u201d prompting Ms. Warren to accuse him of making racial slurs and increase her focus on Native American issues.\n\n\u201cI went to speak to Native American tribal leaders, and I made a promise to them, that every time President Trump wants to try to throw out some kind of racial slur, he wants to try to attack me, I\u2019m going to use it as a chance to lift up their stories,\u201d Ms. Warren told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the high rates of violence against Native American women.\n\n\u201cNative women are subjected to sexual violence at rates much higher than any other group in our country,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cWe need to put some focus on this, and we need to make some changes on this. We owe it to people living in Native communities.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
