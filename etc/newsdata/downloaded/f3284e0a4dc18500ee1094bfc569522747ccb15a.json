Today, Manchester City announced a new collaborative partnership with Faze Clan, which the club says will \u201cbring the two audiences together in exciting new ways.\u201d\n\nThe details are a bit vague, but it sounds like the two sides will collaborate on what Faze does best: creating really popular content and limited edition merchandise. City says that the two will \u201ccreate engaging content with talent and players, as well has hosting exclusive fans events in the US and around the world\u201d and launch \u201climited edition, co-branded retail products.\u201d On the e-sports side, City and Faze will be bringing their existing FIFA players together in a shared training facility.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that fans want to celebrate their love for football across many aspects of their lives,\u201d Nuria Tarre, chief marketing officer at City, said in a statement, \u201cincluding fashion, music, and gaming, to create a culture that goes beyond what happens on the pitch.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a merger of two big names and also something that\u2019s becoming a trend among large-scale soccer clubs. European e-sports giant Fnatic partnered with Italian club AS Roma in 2017, while Paris Saint-Germain teamed up with Chinese team LGD for a co-branded Dota 2 squad. Other clubs have entered into e-sports on their own: German team Schalke 04 has a successful League of Legends squad, for instance, and Barcelona operates its own Rocket League team.\n\nFor Faze Clan, meanwhile, the new deal is the latest in a growing list of high-profile partnerships. That includes apparel deals with Champion and New Era and collaborations with rappers Lil Yachty and new investor Offset. \u201cThe actual players, they\u2019re like rock stars,\u201d Offset told The Verge of his decision to work with Faze. \u201cThey\u2019ve got great followings, they influence kids, and that\u2019s what I do. It was just organic. These guys are cool.\u201d", "description": "E-sports giants Faze Clan have teamed up with Premier League soccer club Manchester City for a deal that will include collaborations on apparel and content.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOiqOdaL0tEf9FQJMsVg2sebc9I=/0x131:1655x997/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19234381/1130134007.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
