But it is far from clear what will happen to them, and a host of issues arose from Trump\u2019s abrupt, if still murky, change in policy.\n\nWhat is going on in northern Syria?\n\nThe situation is deeply complicated. For now, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces control northern Syria. They have been the primary American ally inside Syria in the war against the Islamic State, carrying out the brunt of the ground-level fighting with support from U.S. airstrikes and weapons. They operate prisons where Islamic State members are detained.\n\nThe Kurds are menaced from the north by Turkey, which has been fighting separatist Kurds inside its borders for years and considers the Syrian Kurds to be terrorists, too. Meanwhile, President Bashar Assad of Syria, backed by Russia, controls the southern part of the country and wants to eventually retake it all, raising the possibility of a deal with the Kurds.\n\nThe presence of American troops has helped maintain a fragile peace. But the White House said that Trump has given a green light for a Turkish military operation into northern Syria, and Trump said on Twitter that it was time to pull out. \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\u201d he said, \u201cand what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWho are the Islamic State detainees?\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces operate an archipelago of ad hoc wartime detention sites for captive Islamic State fighters, ranging from former schoolhouses in towns like Ainissa and Kobane to a former Syrian government prison at Hasaka.\n\nThe prisons hold about 11,000 men, of whom about 9,000 are locals \u2014 Syrians or Iraqis \u2014 and about 2,000 come from some 50 other nations whose home governments have been reluctant to repatriate them. They also operate camps for families displaced by the conflict that hold tens of thousands of people, many of them non-Syrian wives and children of Islamic State fighters.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey attacks these Kurdish soldiers, there is a grave risk that the ISIS fighters they guard will escape and return to the battlefield,\u201d a bipartisan group of lawmakers who recently visited the Middle East said in a joint statement Monday.\n\nWould a Turkish invasion reach the prisons?\n\nThis is one of many unknowns. A U.S.-brokered plan in the works would create a demilitarized \u201csafe zone\u201d a few miles deep along a roughly 78-mile portion of the Syrian-Turkish border to reassure Turkey and forestall any military conflict with the Kurds. That would not affect the Kurds\u2019 ability to keep running the prisons.\n\nBut Erdogan, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last month, has instead pushed for a much longer and deeper zone. A broader invasion could reach the prisons, and it would set off an armed conflict that could prompt the Kurds to pull guards from prisons so they could instead join the fight.\n\nThe \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d is that the Kurds are so frustrated and angered by the United States\u2019 action that \u201cthey decide to release wholesale some of the detainees,\u201d said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism on Trump\u2019s National Security Council who now heads the International Spy Museum.\n\nIs Turkey planning to take custody of Islamic State prisoners?\n\nIt was not clear. The White House said Turkey would \u201cnow be responsible for all Islamic State fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d But Turkey has given no public sign that it has agreed to take over that headache.\n\nFor now at least, the Kurds have told American officials that they will continue to hold the Islamic State detainees. But a senior State Department official acknowledged that the best-trained guards could be pulled away in the event of a conflict with Turkey, calling it a \u201cbig concern\u201d that some Islamic State fighters could go free.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's sudden blessing of a Turkish military operation in northern Syria and his announcement of an American troop withdrawal from that region raised questions about the fate of thousands of Islamic State detainees that the Turks' targets, U.S-backed Syrian Kurds", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
