Starship, currently in parallel development at SpaceX\u2019s South Texas and Florida facilities, is intended to be an all-purpose successor to, and replacement for, both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, with a higher payload capacity and the ability to reach the Moon and eventually Mars.\n\n\u201cAspirationally, we want to get Starship to orbit within a year,\u201d Shotwell said. \u201cWe definitely want to land it on the Moon before 2022. We want to [\u2026] stage cargo there to make sure that there are resources for the folks that ultimately land on the moon by 2024, if things go well, so that\u2019s the aspirational timeframe.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious timeline, and as Shotwell herself repeatedly stated, these are \u201caspirational\u201d timelines. In the space industry, as well as in tech, it\u2019s not uncommon for leadership to set aggressive schedules in order to drive the teams working on projects to work at the limits of what\u2019s actually possible. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is also known for working to timelines that often don\u2019t match up with reality, and Shotwell alluded to Musk\u2019s ambitious goal setting as a virtue in another part of her on-stage interview at IAC.\n\n\u201cElon puts out these incredibly audacious goals and people say \u2018You\u2019re not going to do it, you\u2019ll never get to orbit, you\u2019ll never get a real rocket to orbit, [\u2026] you\u2019ll never get Heavy to orbit, you\u2019ll never get Dragon to the station, you\u2019ll never get Dragon back, and you\u2019ll never land a rocket,'\u201d she said. \u201cSo, frankly, I love when people say we can\u2019t do it, because it motivates my fantastic 6,500 employees to go do that thing.\u201d\n\nSpaceX has previously discussed its goal of starting its first orbital test flights of Starship within as little as a year. So far, the company has built and tested a so-called \u2018Starhopper\u2019 demonstration vehicle, which consisted of just the base of the vehicle and one of the Raptor engines it will use for its new Starship launch system and Super Heavy booster. After completing successful low-altitude flights with that vehicle, SpaceX moved on to assembling its Mk1 and Mk2 Starship test vehicles, which represent the full scale of the ultimate orbital spacecraft, and which are being built by teams in Boca Chica and Cape Canaveral, respectively. These will perform high-altitude testing, before SpaceX builds additional prototypes for orbital, and ultimately human test flights.\n\nSpaceX already has already been contracted by Intuitive Machines and ispace, both companies working with NASA to delivery payloads to the Moon ahead of its 2024 Artemis program human Moon landing, but these payload missions all specify using Falcon 9 to deliver their payloads.", "description": "Speaking at a quick series of interviews with commercial space company\u2019s at this year\u2019s annual International Astronautical Congress, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell shed a little more light on her company\u2019s current thinking with regards to the mission timelines for its forthcoming Starship spacefaring vehicle.
