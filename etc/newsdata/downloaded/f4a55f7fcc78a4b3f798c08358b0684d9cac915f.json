If police conclude Crusius wrote the manifesto, it would pave the path for a federal domestic terrorism case.\n\n\"The key factor here is that it appears to be an intent to coerce or intimidate a civilian population,\" Bash said. \"That's met here.\"\n\nAuthorities have not released information about the victims in the attack.\n\nOn Saturday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador confirmed three Mexican nationals were among the dead. Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard reported six Mexicans were among the injured, including a 10-year-old girl.\n\nPolice say the shootings began at 10:39 a.m. local time at the Walmart next to Cielo Vista Mall. Police were on scene six minutes later. Video from witnesses captured rapid and repeated firing inside the building.\n\nOn Saturday, Gov. Greg Abbott said that what should have been a leisurely day of shopping \"turned into one of the most deadly days in the history of Texas.\"\n\nThe shooting marked the third major mass shooting in Texas in the past two years. In November 2017, 26 people were killed at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs. The following May, 10 were killed at a high school in Santa Fe.\n\nThis is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.", "description": "The U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, John Bash, said the investigation into the deadly attack is proceeding with a \"view towards bringing federal hate crime charges.\"", "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/04/el-paso-flowers_wide-997e7ba55f2b81b2f061eb33cf0e6a27183aa297.jpg?s=1400"}
