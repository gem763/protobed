The study found travel time between Kansas City and St. Louis could be as little as 28 minutes, compared to 3 \u00bd hours today. Travel time for trips from either Kansas City or St. Louis to Columbia could be 15 minutes, compared to nearly 2 hours. The cost to take a hyperloop from St. Louis to Kansas City could be lower than the cost to drive (based on gas alone), while still cutting down the time by three hours, the report concluded.\n\nThe technology, developed by Elon Musk, is now being pursued by several firms.\n\nIt would transport people at roughly 700mph between distant locations through closed off vacuum tubes.\n\nThe initial cost estimate for building the I-70 hyperloop route would be $30 million to $40 million per mile of track, the report found - giving a total price tag of $7 billion to $10 billion.\n\nDozens of possible routes were proposed across the United States, including connections between Los Angeles and San Francisco; New York City and Washington, D.C.; Denver and Houston.\n\nFurther feasibility studies will likely be released within the next year for states like Colorado, Ohio and Texas, said a Hyperloop One employee, but Missouri has the distinction of the first.\n\nThe firm says the report is a major step forward for the transport technology invented by Elon Musk.\n\nIt examined the social impact, station locations, regulatory issues, route alignments and rights-of-way associated with the route.\n\n'A feasibility study of this depth represents the first phase of actualization of a full-scale commercial hyperloop system, both for passengers and cargo in the United States,' said Virgin Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd.\n\n'We are especially proud that Missouri, with its iconic status in the history of U.S. transportation as the birthplace of the highway system, could be the keystone of a nation-wide network.\n\n'The resulting socio-economic benefits will have enormous regional and national impact.'\n\nThe study found Travel time between Kansas City and St. Louis could be as little as 28 minutes, compared to 3 \u00bd hours today, and travel time for trips from either Kansas City or St. Louis to Columbia could be 15 minutes, compared to nearly 2 hours\n\nThe study found travel time between Kansas City and St. Louis could be as little as 28 minutes, compared to 3 \u00bd hours today.

Hyperloop is a proposed method of travel that would transport people at roughly 700mph between distant locations. It was unveiled by Elon Musk in 2013, who at the time said it could take passengers the 380 miles (610km) from LA to San Francisco in 30 minutes - half the time it takes a plane. It is essentially a long tube that has had the air removed to create a vacuum. For safety reasons, Hyperloop tunnels need escape hatches in case of fire. The tube is suspended off the ground to protect against weather and earthquakes. There are now a number of firms vying to bring the technology to life, including Elon Musk himself, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, and Virgin Hyperloop One. As several firms vie to create the first operational Hyperloop, Elon Musk\u2019s vision of a radical transport system that could ferry passengers above land at 760 miles per hour continues to inch closer to reality\n\n'We found this project is a case of solid engineering meeting up with Virgin Hyperloop One's innovative vision to create a network transforming the very concept of community.'\n\nTwo other states are currently studying hyperloop through in-depth feasibility studies\u2014Ohio and Colorado.\n\nVirgin Hyperloop One already has a working demo track in Nevada\n\nThe firm has tested pods on its test track at low speeds\n\nIn addition, Ohio is also participating in the first U.S. Environmental Impact Studies (EIS) of a hyperloop system and Texas has announced its intent to start the process.\n\nHowever, experts have warned the technology is likely to appear elsewhere in the world first.\n\n\"I think the U.S. will be one of the last places where you'll see this,\" said Rick Geddes, director of the Cornell Infrastructure Policy program, told CNBC.\n\nThe biggest obstacles facing hyperloop aren't the technical ones, he said, but instead policy ones.", "description": "The 'heartland hyperloop' would run along the I-70 corridor, the major highway traversing Missouri, and would connect Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis.", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/18/5208864-0-image-a-38_1539970171533.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-19"}
