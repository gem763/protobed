For 27 years in a row, China has attracted more foreign investment than any other developing countries.\n\nAlthough accounting for less than 3 percent of total companies in China, the foreign-invested enterprises have become an important player in the Chinese economy, contributing nearly half of the country's foreign trade, a quarter of the output value and profits of industrial enterprises and a fifth of tax revenue, according to the report.", "description": "QINGDAO - China has set up 961,000 foreign-invested enterprises by the end of 2018, with its actual use of foreign capital reaching $2.1 trillion, said a report released by the Ministry of Commerce.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/20/5dab98d8a310cf3e97a20c0c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
