Every Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts film ranked 1/10 10. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald JK Rowling gifted herself a whole new world to explore with the Fantastic Beasts franchise, with five films to dial back and explore the Wizarding World as it stood in the early 20th century. While the first, and far superior entry, took place in New York, The Crimes of Grindelwald shifts the action to Paris. And, for the majority of the film, it continues in the spirit of originality and creativity, with new beasts for Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) to tame and magical delights to be uncovered. All this good will is swiftly undone, however, in the film\u2019s closing chapter. What follows is a baffling series of expositional conversations and meaningless connections, dragging The Crimes of Grindelwald down into the murky depths occupied by the Star Wars prequels. Rex Features 2/10 9. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Harry Potter franchise\u2019s greatest weakness, perhaps, was its need to mature at the same pace as its audience. And as that audience plunged into awkward adolescence, so too did the movies. The Order of the Phoenix may have its ardent supporters, but it most acutely represents the lag between the franchise\u2019s bright-eyed, whimsical beginnings and the epic weight of its conclusion. In the attempt to adapt the longest Potter book into the shortest Potter film, the rush to maturity looks all the more thorny. Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) is suddenly transformed into a chain-wearing thug, while the plot works overtime to sidetrack Harry (Daniel Radcliffe)\u2019s inevitable confrontation with Voldemort with a handy political metaphor. 3/10 8. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I Splitting the last Potter book into two films was, inevitably, the right decision in order to save audiences from a rushed conclusion to one of the most popular franchises ever. Yet The Deathly Hallows Part II could only shine if The Deathly Hallows Part I was willing to take the fall and act as pure set-up to its successor. It\u2019s arguably the most emotionally unsatisfying of the series, following Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) as they attempt to evade Voldemort\u2019s clutches and destroy the Horcruxes, the artefacts containing the Dark Lord\u2019s soul, the keys to his final destruction. The film trades on conflict between the trio, as Ron\u2019s jealousy (as influenced by the locket) serves only to prefigure his eventual future with Hermione. Even the film\u2019s animated history lesson isn\u2019t enough to make this film memorable. 4/10 7. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets The franchise\u2019s second instalment certainly has its standout moments \u2013 it introduces both all-time legend Dobby into the game and lets Kenneth Branagh steals scene after scene as the vainglorious Gilderoy Lockhart. However, its bloated 161-minute runtime can make it tough work. Director Chris Columbus returned with as much enthusiasm as he expressed in The Philosopher\u2019s Stone, delivering thrills in Aragog, the basilisk, the petrifications, the Whomping Willow, and the Quidditch matches. That isn\u2019t enough, regrettably, to fully distract from its rather dry narrative, which delivers endless plot twists about the dark history of Hogwarts and the truth behind Tom Riddle\u2019s diary. 5/10 6. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Another of the adolescent-stage films of the franchise, The Half-Blood Prince could just as easily have fallen prey to The Order of the Phoenix\u2019s tonal awkwardness, but there\u2019s a much keener sense of the wider stakes here \u2013 Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)\u2019s machinations make for particularly gripping viewing, culminating in a face-off that still has the propensity to shock years later. What\u2019s crucial, however, is the sense of balance that\u2019s also brought to this film, as the students of Hogwarts find moments for the old magic: a Butterbeer shared with friends, or a game of Quidditch. Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) provides a light sense of comic relief, alongside the now-infamous \u201cHermione\u2019s got nice skin\u201d moment between Ron and Harry. 6/10 5. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II Director Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves faced the ultimate challenge with The Deathly Hallows Part II: to satisfactorily conclude a story 10 years in the making. Few would argue against their success, since the film is actually the highest rated of the entire Potter series (at 96 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes), although its reliance on narrative tricks and deceptions have made it slightly less appealing on repeated viewing. That said, there are some bold creative decisions here that save The Deathly Hallows Part II from simply feeling like a procession of notable character deaths, including the decision to relegate some of those deaths to offscreen. It\u2019s a film that knows how to manipulate its audience, but also knows when to show restraint. 7/10 4. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them The Harry Potter series became the Wizarding World with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film that incites instant curiosity for its cinematic frontier: 1920s New York, divided between the slick Art Deco design of MACUSA, The Magical Congress of the United States of America, the smoke-filled speakeasies (complete with goblin jazz singers and bartenders), and the dark corners inhabited by the Second Salemer witch hunters. In one film, screenwriter Rowling and director Yates were able to establish both a visual and thematic depth to their world that feels equal to the universe of Harry and his friends. Add to that, they found an empathetic protagonist in Eddie Redmayne\u2019s Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist with a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rex Features 8/10 3. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire At this point, the Potter series was four films in, so a change of pace had become essential to the franchise\u2019s survival. The Triwizard Tournament fulfilled that need magnificently, allowing the introduction of a more global perspective thanks to Fleur Delacour (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), alongside a neat sequence of set pieces, from deadly mermaids to dragons. The Yule Ball also remains a visual delight. It\u2019s an almost comically elegant backdrop for Ron, Harry, and Hermione\u2019s youthful angst over dates and relationships. Add to that, the film boasts both Brendan Gleeson\u2019s brilliant performance as Mad-Eye Moody and the film debut of Robert Pattinson, as Hufflepuff\u2019s tragic hero Cedric Diggory. 9/10 2. Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u201cYou\u2019re a wizard, Harry.\u201d And, with that, thousands of childhoods became instantly filled with wonder, never mind the looming disappointment of realising a letter from Hogwarts was never going to turn up in the post. As tempting as it may be to ridicule The Philosopher\u2019s Stone for its badly aged special effects (poor Fluffy) and objectionable child acting, there is no replacing the magic conjured in our very first look at Hogwarts, a soft glow emanating from its many towers. The film is a sugary sweet delight that rightly deserves its place as a modern children\u2019s classic. It relishes in its air of joy and fantasy \u2013 and that cannot be underestimated, no matter how epic the series\u2019 conclusion. 10/10 1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The franchise\u2019s biggest risk is also its biggest triumph. As unexpected as the move may have been to hand the reins over to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, fresh from his sensual coming-of-age tale Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, The Prisoner of Azkaban has become the ultimate Harry Potter movie. Cuar\u00f3n could subtly warp the look and feel of this word to progress towards maturity, without disrupting what had been established in the first two films. It\u2019s the most successful in doing so of the entire series. The balance between light and dark provides risk without sacrificing enchantment. The Dementor is the most frightening creation of this universe, while the Patronus is the most beautiful. And yet it\u2019s still a film grounded in character, and Cuar\u00f3n does not allow the pain haunting the likes of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) to be lost in the visual fray. 1/10 10. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald JK Rowling gifted herself a whole new world to explore with the Fantastic Beasts franchise, with five films to dial back and explore the Wizarding World as it stood in the early 20th century. While the first, and far superior entry, took place in New York, The Crimes of Grindelwald shifts the action to Paris. And, for the majority of the film, it continues in the spirit of originality and creativity, with new beasts for Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) to tame and magical delights to be uncovered. All this good will is swiftly undone, however, in the film\u2019s closing chapter. What follows is a baffling series of expositional conversations and meaningless connections, dragging The Crimes of Grindelwald down into the murky depths occupied by the Star Wars prequels. Rex Features 2/10 9. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Harry Potter franchise\u2019s greatest weakness, perhaps, was its need to mature at the same pace as its audience. And as that audience plunged into awkward adolescence, so too did the movies. The Order of the Phoenix may have its ardent supporters, but it most acutely represents the lag between the franchise\u2019s bright-eyed, whimsical beginnings and the epic weight of its conclusion. In the attempt to adapt the longest Potter book into the shortest Potter film, the rush to maturity looks all the more thorny. Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) is suddenly transformed into a chain-wearing thug, while the plot works overtime to sidetrack Harry (Daniel Radcliffe)\u2019s inevitable confrontation with Voldemort with a handy political metaphor. 3/10 8. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I Splitting the last Potter book into two films was, inevitably, the right decision in order to save audiences from a rushed conclusion to one of the most popular franchises ever. Yet The Deathly Hallows Part II could only shine if The Deathly Hallows Part I was willing to take the fall and act as pure set-up to its successor. It\u2019s arguably the most emotionally unsatisfying of the series, following Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) as they attempt to evade Voldemort\u2019s clutches and destroy the Horcruxes, the artefacts containing the Dark Lord\u2019s soul, the keys to his final destruction. The film trades on conflict between the trio, as Ron\u2019s jealousy (as influenced by the locket) serves only to prefigure his eventual future with Hermione. Even the film\u2019s animated history lesson isn\u2019t enough to make this film memorable. 4/10 7. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets The franchise\u2019s second instalment certainly has its standout moments \u2013 it introduces both all-time legend Dobby into the game and lets Kenneth Branagh steals scene after scene as the vainglorious Gilderoy Lockhart. However, its bloated 161-minute runtime can make it tough work. Director Chris Columbus returned with as much enthusiasm as he expressed in The Philosopher\u2019s Stone, delivering thrills in Aragog, the basilisk, the petrifications, the Whomping Willow, and the Quidditch matches. That isn\u2019t enough, regrettably, to fully distract from its rather dry narrative, which delivers endless plot twists about the dark history of Hogwarts and the truth behind Tom Riddle\u2019s diary. 5/10 6. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Another of the adolescent-stage films of the franchise, The Half-Blood Prince could just as easily have fallen prey to The Order of the Phoenix\u2019s tonal awkwardness, but there\u2019s a much keener sense of the wider stakes here \u2013 Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)\u2019s machinations make for particularly gripping viewing, culminating in a face-off that still has the propensity to shock years later. What\u2019s crucial, however, is the sense of balance that\u2019s also brought to this film, as the students of Hogwarts find moments for the old magic: a Butterbeer shared with friends, or a game of Quidditch. Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) provides a light sense of comic relief, alongside the now-infamous \u201cHermione\u2019s got nice skin\u201d moment between Ron and Harry. 6/10 5. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II Director Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves faced the ultimate challenge with The Deathly Hallows Part II: to satisfactorily conclude a story 10 years in the making. Few would argue against their success, since the film is actually the highest rated of the entire Potter series (at 96 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes), although its reliance on narrative tricks and deceptions have made it slightly less appealing on repeated viewing. That said, there are some bold creative decisions here that save The Deathly Hallows Part II from simply feeling like a procession of notable character deaths, including the decision to relegate some of those deaths to offscreen. It\u2019s a film that knows how to manipulate its audience, but also knows when to show restraint. 7/10 4. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them The Harry Potter series became the Wizarding World with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film that incites instant curiosity for its cinematic frontier: 1920s New York, divided between the slick Art Deco design of MACUSA, The Magical Congress of the United States of America, the smoke-filled speakeasies (complete with goblin jazz singers and bartenders), and the dark corners inhabited by the Second Salemer witch hunters. In one film, screenwriter Rowling and director Yates were able to establish both a visual and thematic depth to their world that feels equal to the universe of Harry and his friends. Add to that, they found an empathetic protagonist in Eddie Redmayne\u2019s Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist with a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rex Features 8/10 3. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire At this point, the Potter series was four films in, so a change of pace had become essential to the franchise\u2019s survival. The Triwizard Tournament fulfilled that need magnificently, allowing the introduction of a more global perspective thanks to Fleur Delacour (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), alongside a neat sequence of set pieces, from deadly mermaids to dragons. The Yule Ball also remains a visual delight. It\u2019s an almost comically elegant backdrop for Ron, Harry, and Hermione\u2019s youthful angst over dates and relationships. Add to that, the film boasts both Brendan Gleeson\u2019s brilliant performance as Mad-Eye Moody and the film debut of Robert Pattinson, as Hufflepuff\u2019s tragic hero Cedric Diggory. 9/10 2. Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u201cYou\u2019re a wizard, Harry.\u201d And, with that, thousands of childhoods became instantly filled with wonder, never mind the looming disappointment of realising a letter from Hogwarts was never going to turn up in the post. As tempting as it may be to ridicule The Philosopher\u2019s Stone for its badly aged special effects (poor Fluffy) and objectionable child acting, there is no replacing the magic conjured in our very first look at Hogwarts, a soft glow emanating from its many towers. The film is a sugary sweet delight that rightly deserves its place as a modern children\u2019s classic. It relishes in its air of joy and fantasy \u2013 and that cannot be underestimated, no matter how epic the series\u2019 conclusion. 10/10 1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The franchise\u2019s biggest risk is also its biggest triumph. As unexpected as the move may have been to hand the reins over to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, fresh from his sensual coming-of-age tale Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, The Prisoner of Azkaban has become the ultimate Harry Potter movie.
