Merkley tells House committee on impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "The House Judiciary Committee got an unexpected vote of no confidence Thursday in its timetable to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s late and it\u2019s not expeditious enough,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., when asked about the panel\u2019s vote to proceed with a wide-ranging impeachment investigation into the president.\n\nMerkley\u2019s comments \u2014 made during an interview with the Yahoo News podcast \u201cSkullduggery\u201d \u2014 underscored the political difficulties facing House Democrats pushing to remove the president from the office before next November\u2019s election.\n\nMerkley is among the Senate\u2019s most progressive members and a sure vote, if it ever comes to that, to convict Trump of obstruction of justice and abuse of power. But he seemed anything but enthusiastic about how the House Judiciary Democrats were proceeding, especially regarding their current timetable, which calls for investigating the president for the next four months and then voting on a bill of impeachment near the end of the year.\n\nMerkley said in the interview that the House should have moved to impeach Trump as soon as it received special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report documenting multiple instances in which the president attempted to obstruct the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a four-month's inquiry, I just kind of grabbed my head and said, \u2018What are you thinking?\u2019\u201d Merkley said about the timetable laid out by House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler. \u201cThere\u2019s so much information. Hold one month, hold the vote, either impeach or don\u2019t. Get it done. ... Speed it up.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee got an unexpected vote of no confidence Thursday in its timetable to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.", "authors": ["Michael Isikoff", "Chief Investigative Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dd_r_8lXVQaSryblpTbHpg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/253d52c0-d5ba-11e9-afff-358732cc3db3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
