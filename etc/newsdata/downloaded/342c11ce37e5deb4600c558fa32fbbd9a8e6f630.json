The president brings on a conga line of deranged sycophants, including a couple of conspiracy nuts, mealy-mouthed Lindsey Graham, a recently freed fighter who thanks Trump for \u201cbringing jobs back \u2026 to Isis\u201d and a robotic Mark Zuckerberg, fresh off \u201cgetting his ass completely owned by AOC\u201d.\n\nSaturday Night Live: Lin-Manuel Miranda as Juli\u00e1n Castro and other, stranger things Read more\n\nEventually, Trump is joined by a wandering Bill Clinton (former cast member and current announcer Daryl Hammond), who wishes him good luck on his forthcoming impeachment, and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Fred Armisen), who offers to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, or, better yet, \u201cjust make him disappear\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s another rushed, messy cold open with little in the way of cleverness, commentary or laughs.\n\nChance the Rapper returns, as both host and musical guest. Recalling his previous appearance, in which he donated a million to Chicago public schools, he gives a shout out to the city\u2019s teachers, currently on strike. Joined by Kyle Mooney, he performs a song in honor of \u201cthe Second City\u201d, extolling the virtues of all things second best \u2013 Pepsi, Burger King fries, Sega Genesis, Scottie Pippen. He ends with a shout out to his wife and newborn daughter, wrapping up a clever and heartfelt, if not particularly funny, musical monologue.\n\nSaturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) Some special guests at the Trump rally \u203c\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/HvgumqdEXO\n\nThe League of Legends World Championship is covered by Lazlo Holmes, a basketball reporter who finds himself very confused by his new e-sports beat. As Holmes, Chance is noticeably stilted and awkward, tripping over his lines. This does not bode well. He acquits himself better in First Impressions Court, playing a Chicago judge who declares the defendants \u2013 including a smooth-talking hustler, a nerdy white ventriloquist, a male exotic dancer and a hunky gigolo (surprise guest Jason Momoa) \u2013 guilty on sight. Momoa wins the audience over by taking off his shirt, showing off his pierced nipples.\n\nA commercial for Tasty Toaster Tarts sees a group of happy-go-lucky teens freak-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that their host, Jason, has murdered his parents and stashed their bodies in the refrigerator. Perfectly succinct and surprisingly unnerving, this pre-filmed sketch is the night\u2019s high point.\n\nIn Spooky Song, a canoodling couple happen upon a group of graveyard ghosts, who regale them with sing-song stories of their earthly demises \u2013 all save one spirit, who really doesn\u2019t want to talk about how he died. Eventually, he admits to a fetish for sitting on high voltage charges, which led him to stick a metal pole up his butt and wait for lightning to strike. He sums up the result in enjoyably gruesome fashion, singing, \u201cAnd my ass burnt off and my thing caught on fire and my face caught on fire and I went in my pants \u2013 Happy Halloween!\u201d\n\nA clever self-introduction and cute animated short featuring Chance\u2019s young daughter leads into his first musical performance, It\u2019s Possible.\n\nWeekend Update kicks off on another bad week for the president. Colin Jost covers Trump\u2019s foreboding tweets from earlier in the day, including an unexplained ellipsis (with four dots instead of three) and the announcement that \u201cSomething very big has just happened\u201d. This unnerves Jost, since, coming from Trump, that something \u201ccould mean we just invaded Mexico \u2026 or the McRib is back.\u201d Che lays into Rudy Giuliani butt-dialing a reporter while talking about the Ukraine investigation: \u201cSomehow, Giuliani went from the Mayor of 9/11 to the 9/11 of mayors.\u201d\n\nThe segment\u2019s sole guests are Eric and Donald Trump Jr (Alex Moffatt and Mikey Day), who accuse Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter of profiting from nepotism (or as Eric calls it, \u201cnipple teasing\u201d) while showing zero self-awareness about their own unearned status and wealth. The portrayal continues to grate, not only because it\u2019s intentionally muggy. It also gives short shrift to how Donald Jr continually proves himself the dopier of the two in real life.\n\nSaturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) Oh, he's \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude3a guilty. #ChanceOnSNL pic.twitter.com/BAblTN7kJn\n\nNext, Chance and Cecily Strong play singles who meet cute at a restaurant and literally sweep each other off their feet, floating through the air and crashing into everything in sight. Strong excels at the awkward physical comedy but the sketch is completely thrown by the wonky wire effects. The whole thing is a disaster, but not necessarily an unwelcome one, as its chaos proves mesmerizing.\n\nSaturday Night Live: Phoebe Waller-Bridge can't save mediocre episode Read more\n\nSpace Mistakes is \u201canother film about the dangers of space\u201d which \u201casks the question: what if you messed up at work \u2026 but your work was in space\u201d. Even though it\u2019s one-note and drags on far too long, it\u2019s a solid parody of the current glut of big budget space dramas, the accuracy put in sharp relief during the following break, which included an ad for Apple\u2019s upcoming web series For All Mankind.\n\nMomoa and his pierced nipples make a brief return, introducing Chance for the second musical spot of the night. Joined by Megan Thee Stallion, he performs Handsome.\n\nThe closing sketch is a silly and grating bit involving an Earth, Wind and Fire dance troupe and their werewolf choreographer. It aims for random weirdness but falls completely flat.\n\nChance sends things off with by randomly praising Jesus Christ \u2013 trying to one-up Kanye perhaps? \u2013 thereby ending an awkward episode on an awkward note. As a comedic actor, the Rapper is not without some chops. But he\u2019s simply not well-suited to live comedy. That didn\u2019t stop SNL from having him back, so it\u2019s unlikely it\u2019ll keep him from hosting again in the future.", "description": "He\u2019s a star and he\u2019s winningly sincere about Chicago and his love for his family \u2013 but he\u2019s not very good at live comedy", "authors": ["Zach Vasquez"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d447e2aa97e391a138f79b5d6418a3c5a0ae22d/0_201_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45603f5fcbba7679c472fc380c555dbd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
