Yet every time a woman comes forward and speaks openly about her experience with this pervasive issue, the details are staggering whether she works on or off-screen. In the latest instance of this to come to light, actress and filmmaker Julie Delpy shares that she has faced the gender pay gap multiple times while working on both sides of the camera.\n\nIn a recent interview in the Variety Lounge at the Zurich Film Festival, Delpy opens up to Variety film critic Guy Lodge about her support of both the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, and her personal experience with the wage gap in Hollywood. \u201cAs a woman, you know you\u2019re paid less than a man as a writer or as a director or as an actress\u201d she states matter of factly. Delpy then goes on to reveal that for her break out film role in Before Sunrise, the first in a series of films she made with director Richard Linklater and actor Ethan Hawke, she was paid \u201cmaybe a tenth\u201d of what her co-star Hawke was paid.\n\nJulie Delpy reveals that in #BeforeSunrise she was paid \"maybe a tenth\" of what Ethan Hawke was paid, in #BeforeSunset she was paid \"half\" and that for #BeforeMidnight, she demanded equal pay https://t.co/9jJoNgvRqE | Variety Lounge at #ZFF2019 presented by @creditsuisse pic.twitter.com/R0MlQP0KRU \u2014 Variety (@Variety) October 3, 2019\n\nFor the next film in the franchise, Before Sunset, Delpy says she was only paid \u201chalf\u201d of what Hawke was paid even though both she and Hawke co-wrote the film with Linklater. However, this story does have a (somewhat) happy ending as Delpy refused to do Before Midnight, the final film in the franchise, unless she was paid the same amount as Hawke. \u201cAnd the third movie,\u201d Delpy tells Lodge, \u201cI said, \u2018Listen guys, if I\u2019m not paid the same I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d While it appears to be a better late than never situation for Delpy, it seems clear that Hollywood could do a much better job of compensating women fairly from the very beginning.", "description": "Julie Delpy opens up about her thoughts and feelings regarding #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up and reveals that she was paid \u201cmaybe one tenth\u201d of what Ethan Hawke was paid for their film Before Sunrise.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/02-Julie-Delpy.w1200.h630.jpg"}
