Parliament TV via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nBut with the main opposition Labour Party waiting for the European Union to grant a Brexit delay and two other parties launching their own bid for an even earlier election, the government\u2019s bid so far looks set to fail.\n\nBritain was due to leave the EU on Thursday, but despite the government arguing this is still the legal default date, few expect Johnson to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 after the bloc agreed to another delay.\n\nMore than three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, the divided country and its parliament are still debating over how, when and even whether Brexit, Britain\u2019s biggest policy shift for more than 40 years, should happen.\n\nAll Britain\u2019s political parties agree an election is needed to break the standoff over Brexit, but do not see eye-to-eye on its timing. For many lawmakers, an attempt by Johnson to set the terms of a new election raises concerns that he might renege.\n\nBut a source at Johnson\u2019s Downing Street office said the prime minister would do all he can to force an election to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, including considering options offered by other opposition parties.\n\n\u201cParliament cannot hold the country hostage any longer,\u201d Johnson said late on Saturday. \u201cMillions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures, this paralysis is causing real damage and the country must move on in 2020.\u201d\n\nHis culture minister, Nicky Morgan, doubled down on the message on Sunday, warning lawmakers that Thursday was still \u201cthe default leaving date\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo that should focus minds,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\nLABOUR WAITS\n\nLast week, Johnson called for a general election on Dec. 12, offering parliament until Nov. 6 to ratify his Brexit deal - the first time Britain\u2019s prime minister had conceded he would not meet his Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nIt is his third attempt to get the required backing in parliament, where he needs the support of two-thirds of its 650 lawmakers for a new election.\n\nSeveral parties quickly rejected the bid, with the government\u2019s Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party also seemingly ready to oppose the move.\n\nThe easiest path for the governing Conservatives would be if the prime minister\u2019s move was supported by the Labour Party, which so far has said it needs to see what kind of delay the EU would offer before making a decision.\n\nThe EU has agreed there should be an extension but has set no departure date, saying it would wait to see how parliament voted on Johnson\u2019s call for an early election.\n\n\u201cOf course we want a general election but we\u2019ve got to make sure that we get those absolute reassurances that Boris Johnson won\u2019t use a general election and the campaign to crash us out of the European Union with a disastrous no-deal Brexit,\u201d said Jon Ashworth, Labour\u2019s health policy chief.\n\n\u201cThat is what we\u2019re waiting for.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, a Downing Street source gave a veiled warning to Labour lawmakers, saying the government would consider all options, including those proposed by other opposition parties, if Labour opposed \u201cbeing held to account by the people yet again\u201d.\n\nThat could suggest the government may consider backing a move by two other opposition parties, the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats, which have written to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, to ask for a delay until Jan. 31. They want a new poll on Dec. 9.\n\nEarlier, Morgan and Labour\u2019s Ashworth described the move as a stunt, putting into question whether the two parties\u2019 alternative bid could be passed by parliament.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWith the government looking likely to lose its vote on Monday, former finance minister Philip Hammond had a word of warning for the prime minister.\n\n\u201cI shall be voting against him. This is not the time to be holding a general election, it is a time for cool heads and grown-up government,\u201d Hammond told Sky News.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop making threats, stop throwing tantrums and get on with the grown-up business of doing its business.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson's government stepped up pressure on lawmakers on Sunday to back the prime minister's bid to hold an early election and break the Brexit impasse, saying Britain was being held \"hostage\" by parliament.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445486930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0DE", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
