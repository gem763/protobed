REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nSunday\u2019s exit polls showed the moderate Islamist Ennahda as the largest party, but its modest projected vote share means it would need to bring many other parties into any workable coalition. Official results are not expected until Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe task will be very difficult and complicated to reach an agreement to form a government,\u201d said Yamina Zoglami, a senior Ennahda official.\n\nSeveral of Ennahda\u2019s rivals have already said they will not join a government it leads, and Tunisians are confronting the prospect of protracted negotiations and the possibility of another election if no coalition can be agreed.\n\nThe parliamentary vote comes amid a separate presidential election in which one of the two candidates who advanced to next Sunday\u2019s runoff vote is being held in detention on corruption charges, entailing a possible challenge to that result.\n\nEight years after ending autocratic rule, many Tunisians are disillusioned by the failure of repeated coalition governments to address economic problems and their rejection of major parties threatens a new period of upheaval.\n\nIf official results confirm Ennahda\u2019s first place, it has two months to form a coalition. After that the president can ask a politician of his choice to try. If that also fails after two months, Tunisians will go back to the ballot box.\n\nNext week\u2019s presidential runoff pits Kais Saied, an independent, against Nabil Karoui, a media mogul detained on corruption charges that he denies. If he loses, he might appeal to overturn the result citing his detention.\n\nRED LINES\n\nSpeaking on Sunday night, another senior Ennahda official, Abdelkarim Haloumi, said he hoped a new parliamentary election could be avoided and that the party would attempt to build a coalition from among the parties opposed to corruption.\n\nA governing coalition requires 109 seats in government. Ennahda\u2019s vote share projected by the exit poll would translate into about 40 seats, the polling company Sigma Conseil said.\n\nIt and Karoui\u2019s Heart of Tunisia, which exit polls projected as coming second with about 33 seats, had already ruled out going into coalition with each other before the election. A spokesman for Karoui repeated that after Sunday\u2019s vote, calling it \u201ca red line\u201d.\n\nAttayar, another party that appeared on course for more than a dozen seats in parliament, also said it would not enter government with Ennahda, with its leader Mohamed Abbou saying \u201cwe will be a responsible and serious opposition\u201d.\n\nHowever, the conservative Karama said it would be ready to enter coalition negotiations with Ennahda if asked.\n\nAny political paralysis entails new risks for a fragile economy that has never really recovered from the shock of the 2011 revolution that ended decades of autocracy, introduced democracy and set off the \u201cArab spring\u201d.\n\nUrged on by the International Monetary Fund, Tunisia is trying to rein in a public debt that swelled as political leaders sought to buy goodwill with rampant state employment.\n\nHowever, there is unemployment of 15% nationally and 30% in some cities, inflation remains high at 6.8%, and tourism is only this year recovering from two jihadist attacks in 2015 that caused many countries to warn off their citizens.\n\nEconomic pain has contributed to an anti-establishment mood among Tunisian voters, who punished the main parties in the first round of the presidential election last month.\n\nThough exit polls showed Ennahda coming first on Sunday, its projected vote share of 17.5% represented a sharp decline from the last parliamentary election in 2014, when it had 27.5%.", "description": "Tunisia faced political deadlock on Monday after Sunday's election delivered a fragmented parliament and no obvious path to forming a government that must urgently address chronic economic and fiscal problems.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Angus Mcdowall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438082275&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960W9-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
