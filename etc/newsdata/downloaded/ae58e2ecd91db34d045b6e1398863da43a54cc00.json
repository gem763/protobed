Successfully evading Orca whales, things get even worse when they\u2019re stranded on melted ice, with seals waiting to pounce.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s some moments where we were toying around with how big or how small to get,\u2019 Jacob said, before elaborating, \u2018Like the stand-off between a penguin and the leopard seal.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a moment I desperately wanted to not go over the top with it. I did something subtle and played to the uncertainty and tension instead of a stand-off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It really was a case of less is more, and we really pared it back to a significant degree. It usually commands a huge, climactic ending. We did the opposite.\u2019\n\nIt took the filmmakers seven weeks to capture this phenomenon on camera (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe Whale Bubble-Net Phenomenon\n\nOne of the most stunning pieces from the show was the moment the team managed to capture from above a rarely captured behaviour from Humpback Whales \u2013 bubble-net feeding.\n\nIt was something that took seven weeks to captures by the filming team, but the results were clearly worth it.\n\nIn fact, it was this scene in particular that had a massive impact in the creation of the show\u2019s main themes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s kind of beyond, like when I saw it, I didn\u2019t know that so many whales could congregate in one area, and it blew me away,\u2019 Jacob explained. \u2018Musically, it was about celebrating the spectacle of it, and I can\u2019t imagine what it must\u2019ve felt like to finally capture something you\u2019ve been waiting and invested so much energy on, nearly missing it and finally getting it.\n\n\u2018I just took my cue from imagining that kind of release and exhilaration. It\u2019s a beautiful scene and it\u2019s never been captured like that.\u2019\n\n\u2018It really felt like a moment that the themes Hans and I wrote, it felt appropriate to have that kind of scale,\u2019 he continued. \u2018The sweep gets to a giant place in terms of its orchestration. The spectacle and the size of the main theme that Hans and I composed, and it really was a case of going back to that piece and reshaping it and composing it to match that on screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was one of those happy accidents. I sent a rough idea of the theme against the images and [the director] thought it was perfect. It worked, and then we just had to tailor it to make it as epic as possible.\u2019\n\nThe baby albatrosses fight for acceptance was heartbreaking (Picture: BBC)\n\nBaby Albatross fights to be accepted by its father\n\n\u2018That was gut-wrenching!\u2019 Jacob said. \u2018I think I spent a week on that scene writing it because it\u2019s such a heartbreaking story, but also beautiful because it pulls all these themes about what our effect on the world is to these creatures that aren\u2019t within eyesight.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was an emotional exercise to write that,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018It seemed to be the simpler, the better, so a lot of the score is piano and a bit of strings, but it\u2019s primarily just a kind of a soloistic piece, and that lends towards the singular story we were working on. It brought it into focus.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to use that, it was a trial and error exercise about what feels right about the scene.\u2019\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to overblow it to a place where it felt melodramatic,\u2019 Joshua added. \u2018That was really where I started out from.\u2019\n\n\u2018The story is so heart-wrenching, that I ultimately decided to stay out of the way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s haunting in how powerful it is.\u2019\n\nThe four-tonne elephant bull seals were caught in a fight for dominency (Picture: BBC)\n\nElephant Bull Showdown\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most brutal moments of the episode comes when an elephant seal tries to attack another, alpha seal, in a bid to overthrow him.\n\nIn a scene that knocked over cameras as the four-tonne animals went after one another, the pair were seen literally tearing chunks off the other in a bid for the territory \u2013 and the 60 females that come with it for fertilisation.\n\nIt was this creature that had previously nearly knocked over and potentially killed Sir David, who had his own experiences on the beach with the animals.\n\nMore: David Attenborough Seven Worlds, One Planet hailed 'perfect viewing' as Sir David Attenborough returns David Attenborough reveals why he doesn't let crew save animals on documentaries Drag Race UK's Sum Ting Wong praises Geri Horner as she reveals 'fairytale coming out' David Attenborough believes new series will 'build on unstoppable climate change movement'\n\n\u2018It\u2019s kind of awe-inspiring, the commitment to tell these stories. So the fight was about capturing an intensity. There\u2019s a harem, and the stakes are high,\u2019 Jacob explained.\n\n\u2018So it was really just teasing it out kind of. If you could be in one of those bull\u2019s minds and emote what it would be like to have to protect their territory at that scale was incredible.\n\n\u2018So that\u2019s what I kept in the back of my mind. Keeping that intensity at a fever pitch no matter what.\u2019\n\nSeven Worlds, One Planet airs 6.15pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
