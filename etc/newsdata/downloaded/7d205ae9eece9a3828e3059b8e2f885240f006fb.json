But the social media boss claims he wouldn\u2019t mind the 8% hit to his net worth.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: \u2018No one deserves to have that much money\u2019\n\nIn a live-streamed Q&A session, the Facebook billionaire eagerly affirmed Sanders\u2019 bold claim that the 0.1% of wealthiest Americans hold obscene amounts of wealth.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg declined to say what constituted the maximum wealth that an individual should be allowed to have, per CNBC:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d\n\nWhile the Facebook CEO agreed that entrepreneurial efforts ought to be financially rewarded, he added a disclaimer, saying that \u201csome of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.\u201d\n\nIn September, the U.S. senator from Vermont unveiled the \u201cTax on Extreme Wealth\u201d plan targeting the richest 0.1% \u2013 or 180,000 U.S. households. At the time, the Democratic presidential candidate said: \u201cbillionaires should not exist.\u201d\n\nHow much would Facebook CEO lose under Bernie\u2019s wealth tax plan?\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cTax on Extreme Wealth\u201d plan levies a 1% tax on households with a net worth of over $32 million. That tax rises to 8% on households whose wealth exceeds $10 billion.\n\nUnder the plan, Zuckerberg would pay $5.36 billion in wealth tax during the first year of a Sanders presidency. Currently, he has a net worth of $67 billion, making him the fourth wealthiest individual in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nFellow Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has also released a competing plan known as the \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d which would see billionaires incur an annual wealth tax of 3%. That means Mark Zuckerberg would pay about $2 billion in the first year of a Warren presidency.\n\nElizabeth Warren vs. Bernie Sanders: Is Zuckerberg barking up the wrong tree?\n\nClearly, Zuckerberg would be better off with Warren\u2019s tax plan, to the tune of more than $3 billion in just one year.\n\nHowever, at least according to a recently leaked audiotape, he seems more concerned about Warren\u2019s plans for Silicon Valley.\n\nThe leak exposed Zuckerberg\u2019s fear that if Warren is elected president, there would be an attempt to break up large tech companies like Facebook. He promised to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to stop her from achieving her goal.\n\n\u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-tax-reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
