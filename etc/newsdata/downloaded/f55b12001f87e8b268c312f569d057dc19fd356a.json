We\u2019re not fighting. We\u2019re policing.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official denied Trump had given a \u201cgreen light\u201d to an invasion, which raised the threat that thousands of Islamic State fighters that the Kurds hold prisoner could be freed amid a fresh conflict.\n\n\u201cIt appears the Turks are intent on some sort of military operation,\u201d the official said on grounds of anonymity, adding: \u201cThere will be no US armed forces involvement.\u201d\n\n\u2013 US allies abandoned? \u2013\n\nEven Trump\u2019s allies accused him of turning his back on the Kurds, who say they lost some 11,000 fighters taking the lead in the battle against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\u201d said Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, one of the senior Republicans who criticized Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that the operation could \u201ccome any night without warning,\u201d while Kurds in the area girded for fighting.\n\n\u201cThe prudent should prepare for war,\u201d said Mustefa Bozan, a 79-year-old shopkeeper in Ras al-Ain, where a contingent of US Special Forces had been until early Monday.\n\nThe Kurds lead the Syrian Democratic Forces, who were essential in the US-led coalition that defeated the Islamic State.\n\nTurkey regards Kurdish forces within the SDF as a terror threat because it maintains ties to Kurdish militants inside Turkey, and has vowed to crush them.\n\nAnkara says it wants to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border where it could send back some of the 3.6 million refugees from the eight-year civil war.\n\nKurds argue that Ankara\u2019s goal is to dilute their dominance in the region with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees now living in southwestern Turkey.\n\n\u2013 Pentagon warns of destabilization \u2013\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement appeared to have caught many US officials by surprise, and they spent Monday seeking to discourage Ankara from acting.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman warned Turkey of destabilizing blowback to the region if it invades.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustefa Bali said Washington\u2019s decision \u201cis about to ruin the trust and cooperation between the SDF and US.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Syrian Democratic Forces, we are determined to defend our land at all costs,\u201d the group said.\n\nA Turkish attack raised the specter of some 10,000 Islamic State fighters currently held by the SDF being let loose if SDF soldiers have to battle Turkish troops.\n\nAround 2,000 of them are IS \u201cforeign fighters\u201d, and Trump assailed US allies in Europe for not taking back their nationals.\n\nIf they escape or are released, the could reconstitute the Islamic State, less than one year after it was defeated and its \u201ccaliphate\u201d disintegrated.\n\nTrump declared that it would be the responsibility of Turkey and other countries to deal with the IS prisoners.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood,\u2019\u201d he said, using another acronym for the jihadists.\n\nFearing yet another chapter of bloodshed and mass displacement, the United Nations said it was \u201cpreparing for the worst.\u201d\n\nThe European Union warned that civilians would once again bear the brunt of a military assault.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US President Donald Trump warned Turkey on Monday against going too far in Syria, one day after giving Ankara a green light to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/8f1a2a_us-president-donald-trump-warned-turkey-too-far-if-it-decided-invade-northern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
