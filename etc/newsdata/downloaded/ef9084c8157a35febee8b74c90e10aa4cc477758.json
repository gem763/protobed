On his way out the door, he suggested that the homeless problem in San Francisco was so bad that it was creating an environmental disaster and the Environmental Protection Agency might have to step in and take action. The homeless camps are clearly creating a mess with human waste and used needles from drug addicts littering the streets. But does it add up to a matter the EPA needs to step in on? (NY Times)\n\nPresident Trump said late Wednesday that his administration would issue a notice of environmental violation against the city of San Francisco because of what he described as its homelessness problem. Traveling aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington from a three-day trip to California and New Mexico, Mr. Trump told reporters that San Francisco was in \u201ctotal violation\u201d of environmental rules because of used needles that were ending up in the ocean. \u201cThey\u2019re in total violation \u2014 we\u2019re going to be giving them a notice very soon,\u201d the president said, indicating that the city could be put on notice by the Environmental Protection Agency within a week that its homelessness problem was causing environmental damage.\n\nLondon Breed, the Mayor of San Francisco, is pretty much laughing off this threat of EPA action. She insists that the city\u2019s sewer and water treatment systems are up to the job and no \u201cdebris\u201d (presumably including used hypodermic needles) is discharged into the bay or the ocean. And she might be right. After doing some digging around this morning, I\u2019m not seeing any reports of such contamination in the bay or previous complaints of environmental hazards.\n\nThey definitely get some plastic refuse, but that\u2019s unlikely to be coming through the sewers. They also get the occasional oil or gas spillage, but that\u2019s coming from shipping traffic, not the water treatment facilities.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s possible that the EPA was already engaged in an investigation of needles in the ocean, but if so I\u2019m not seeing any records of it. And they can\u2019t just lash out and hit San Francisco with a fine unless they can document the contamination. Or if they tried to, they\u2019d probably run into an immediate appeal that would be tied up in the courts for years.\n\nI\u2019m just going on a hunch here, but I think that threat from the President was just a throwaway line allowing him to take another swing at California before leaving. Either that or someone else has looked into this and is giving the President some (probably) bad advice. I\u2019m guessing that Mayor Breed isn\u2019t losing much sleep over it, at least yet.", "description": "Doesn't sound right", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LA-homeless-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
