Egypt production was 13,750 barrels of oil per day (\"bbls/d\") and Canada production was 2,193 boe/d. Production for the quarter was within the full year 2019 guidance of between 15,500 to 16,000 boe/d and 6% lower than the previous quarter, due to natural declines.\n\nTransGlobe's Egyptian crude oil is sold at a quality discount to Dated Brent. The Company received an average price of $54.58 per barrel in Egypt during the quarter. In Canada, the Company received an average of $49.94 per barrel of oil and $0.70 per thousand cubic feet (\"mcf\") of natural gas during the quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company had funds flow from operations of $9.4 million and ended the quarter with positive working capital of $47.2 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $24.4 million. The Company had net earnings in the quarter of $3.0 million, including a $2.6 million unrealized derivative gain on commodity contracts which represents a fair value adjustment on the Company's hedging contracts as at September 30, 2019.\n\nIn Egypt, the Company sold 380.4 thousand barrels (\"mbbls\") of entitlement crude oil during the quarter and had 902.6 mbbls of entitlement crude oil inventory at September 30, 2019. The increase in inventoried crude oil is attributed to higher oil production than forecasted in the first half of 2019 due to successful drilling and well workover results. All Canadian production was sold during the quarter.\n\nThe Company continued its negotiations in Egypt throughout the quarter with the government to amend, extend and consolidate its Eastern Desert operations.\n\nIn the Eastern Desert, the NWG 38D-1 exploration well drilled in the second quarter of 2019 was completed, perforated, and is currently producing oil to surface at a low rate, confirming the well as an oil discovery in the Red Bed formation. NWG 38D-1 will require stimulation in Q4-2019 prior to being put into full production. Data recovered and analyzed from the well shows it in pressure communication with the adjacent NWG 38A pool.\n\nIn the Western Desert, the SGZ-6X discovery well (tested at 3,840 bbls of light oil per day) was completed during the third quarter of 2019 as an oil producer in the upper Bahariya formation. Construction of an Early Production Facility (\u201cEPF\u201d) in South Ghazalat is on schedule, from which oil will be transported to the nearby South Dabaa receiving facility and onwards via existing pipeline infrastructure to market. First oil is expected late in Q4-2019. Concurrently, the Company has submitted permits and is sourcing a drilling rig to drill an appraisal well in the SGZ-6X pool during Q4-2019 which, if successful, will be completed and connected to the new South Ghazalat EPF. In addition, a project to merge and reprocess two existing 3D seismic surveys over the development lease area will also be completed in Q4-2019.\n\nIn Canada, the Company drilled and cased three Cardium development oil wells (one mile horizontal wells) in the Harmattan area and one Cardium outpost appraisal well (two mile horizontal well) in the South Harmattan area which completed the 2019 drilling program. Subsequent to the quarter, the four horizontal wells have been completed and stimulated and are being equipped for production.\n\nThe Company paid a dividend of $0.035 per share on September 13, 2019 to shareholders of record on August 30, 2019.\n\nSTRATEGY UPDATE\n\nThe Company\u2019s management and board held its annual strategy session in early October, and reconfirmed its commitment to growth through material cash generative mergers and acquisitions to build significantly greater scale, profitability, and long-term sustainability within the next three to five years. To achieve these growth ambitions, the Company intends to leverage its operating and financial capabilities as well as its unique position as a recognized partner of choice in the region, and is actively assessing several opportunities.\n\nOPERATIONS UPDATE\n\nARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT\n\nEASTERN DESERT\n\nWest Gharib, West Bakr, and North West Gharib (100% working interest, operated)\n\nOperations and Exploration\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company completed and perforated the NWG 38D-1 exploration well drilled in the second quarter of 2019. This well is currently producing oil to the surface at a low rate, confirming the well as an oil discovery in the Red Bed formation. NWG 38D-1 will require stimulation, similar to NWG 38A-1, in Q4-2019 prior to being put into full production. Data recovered and analyzed from the well shows it in pressure communication with the adjacent NWG 38A pool. While encouraging, any potential for additional drilling and reserves additions will be assessed following stimulation and production of the well.\n\nProduction\n\nProduction averaged 13,750 bbls/d during the quarter, a decrease of 6% (913 bbls/d) from the previous quarter. This decrease is primarily due to natural declines, the completion of the 2019 Eastern Desert drilling program in the second quarter, and pressure management of the shared M-pool, consistent with production guidance for fiscal 2019 of 15,500 to 16,000 boe/d.\n\nProduction to date in October averaged ~ 13,228 bbls/d.\n\nSales\n\nThe Company sold 380.4 mbbls of inventoried entitlement crude oil to EGPC during the quarter.\n\nQuarterly Eastern Desert Production (bbls/d) 2019 2018 Q-3 Q-2 Q-1 Q-4 Gross production rate1 13,750 14,663 13,616 12,970 TransGlobe production (inventoried) sold (1,821 ) (967 ) (877 ) (787 ) Total sales 11,929 13,696 12,739 12,183 Government share (royalties and tax) 7,795 8,320 7,711 7,292 TransGlobe sales (after royalties and tax)2 4,134 5,376 5,028 4,891 Total sales 11,929 13,696 12,739 12,183 1 Quarterly production by concession (bbls/d):\n\nWest Gharib - 4,003 (Q3-2019), 4,256 (Q2-2019), 4,238 (Q1-2019), and 4,512 (Q4-2018)\n\nWest Bakr - 8,978 (Q3-2019), 9,389 (Q2-2019), 8,132 (Q1-2019), and 7,323 (Q4-2018)\n\nNorth West Gharib - 769 (Q3-2019), 1,018 (Q2-2019), 1,246 (Q1-2019), and 1,135 (Q4-2018) 2 Under the terms of the Production Sharing Concession Agreements, royalties and taxes are paid out of the Government's share of production sharing oil.\n\nWESTERN DESERT\n\nSouth Ghazalat (100% working interest, operated)\n\nOperations and Exploration\n\nAt South Ghazalat, the SGZ-6X discovery well (tested at 3,840 bbls of light oil per day) was completed during the third quarter of 2019 as an oil producer in the upper Bahariya formation.

Many factors could cause TransGlobe's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, TransGlobe.\n\nForward-looking information and statements contained in this document include the payment of dividends, including the timing and amount thereof, and the Company's intention to declare and pay dividends in the future under its current dividend policy. Without limitation of the foregoing, future dividend payments, if any, and the level thereof is uncertain, as the Company's dividend policy and the funds available for the payment of dividends from time to time will be dependent upon, among other things, free cash flow, financial requirements for the Company's operations and the execution of its strategy, ongoing production maintenance, growth through acquisitions, fluctuations in working capital and the timing and amount of capital expenditures and anticipated business development capital, payment irregularity in Egypt, debt service requirements and other factors beyond the Company's control. Further, the ability of the Company to pay dividends will be subject to applicable laws (including the satisfaction of the liquidity and solvency tests contained in applicable corporate legislation) and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing its indebtedness.\n\nIn addition to other factors and assumptions which may be identified in this news release, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, anticipated production volumes; the timing of drilling wells and mobilizing drilling rigs; the number of wells to be drilled; the Company's ability to obtain qualified staff and equipment in a timely and cost-efficient manner; the regulatory framework governing royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts and will conduct its business; future capital expenditures to be made by the Company; future sources of funding for the Company's capital programs; geological and engineering estimates in respect of the Company's reserves and resources; the geography of the areas in which the Company is conducting exploration and development activities; current commodity prices and royalty regimes; availability of skilled labour; future exchange rates; the price of oil; the impact of increasing competition; conditions in general economic and financial markets; availability of drilling and related equipment; effects of regulation by governmental agencies; future operating costs; uninterrupted access to areas of TransGlobe's operations and infrastructure; recoverability of reserves and future production rates; that TransGlobe will have sufficient cash flow, debt or equity sources or other financial resources required to fund its capital and operating expenditures and requirements as needed; that TransGlobe's conduct and results of operations will be consistent with its expectations; that TransGlobe will have the ability to develop its properties in the manner currently contemplated; current or, where applicable, proposed industry conditions, laws and regulations will continue in effect or as anticipated as described herein; that the estimates of TransGlobe's reserves and resource volumes and the assumptions related thereto (including commodity prices and development costs) are accurate in all material respects; and other matters.\n\nForward-looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the Company and described in the forward-looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements or information include, among other things, operating and/or drilling costs are higher than anticipated; unforeseen changes in the rate of production from TransGlobe's oil and gas properties; changes in price of crude oil and natural gas; adverse technical factors associated with exploration, development, production or transportation of TransGlobe's crude oil reserves; changes or disruptions in the political or fiscal regimes in TransGlobe's areas of activity; changes in tax, energy or other laws or regulations; changes in significant capital expenditures; delays or disruptions in production due to shortages of skilled manpower equipment or materials; economic fluctuations; competition; lack of availability of qualified personnel; the results of exploration and development drilling and related activities; obtaining required approvals of regulatory authorities; volatility in market prices for oil; fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates; environmental risks; ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; failure of counterparties to perform under the terms of their contracts; and other factors beyond the Company's control. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Please consult TransGlobe\u2019s public filings at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml for further, more detailed information concerning these matters, including additional risks related to TransGlobe's business.\n\nThe forward-looking statements or information contained in this news release are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws. The forward-looking statements or information contained in this news release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\n\nOil and Gas Advisories\n\nMr. Darrin Drall, P.Eng., - Manager Engineering for TransGlobe Energy Corporation, and a qualified person as defined in the Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies, June 2009, of the London Stock Exchange, has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. Drall obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering from the University of Manitoba. He is a Registered Professional Engineer in the province of Alberta (Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta) and in the province of Saskatchewan (Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Saskatchewan) and has over 30 years' experience in oil and gas.\n\nBOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\n\nReferences in this press release to production test rates, are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for TransGlobe. A pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells. Accordingly, the Company cautions that the production test results should be considered to be preliminary.\n\nThe following abbreviations used in this press release have the meanings set forth below:\n\nBopd\n\n\n\nMBopd\n\n\n\nBoepd\n\n\n\nMBoepd\n\n\n\nMBbl\n\nbarrels of oil per day\n\n\n\nthousand barrels of oil per day\n\n\n\nbarrels of oil equivalent per day\n\n\n\nthousand barrels of oil equivalent per day\n\n\n\nthousand barrels\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nTelephone: +1 (403) 264-9888\n\nEmail: investor.relations@trans-globe.com\n\nWeb site: http://www.trans-globe.com TransGlobe Energy Via FTI Consulting Randy Neely, President & Chief Executive Officer Eddie Ok, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Canaccord Genuity (Nomad & Joint Broker) +44 0 20 7523 8000 Henry Fitzgerald-O'Connor James Asensio GMP First Energy (Joint Broker) +44 0 20 7448 0200 Jonathan Wright FTI Consulting (Financial PR) +44 0 20 3727 1000 Ben Brewerton transglobeenergy@fticonsulting.com Genevieve Ryan\n\nnr-fin", "description": "", "authors": ["Transglobe Energy Corporation"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/451765?filename=451765.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
