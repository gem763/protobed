Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nAnother of the blacklisted firms, Hikvision, has also expressed dismay at the DoC's decision. On Wednesday, a Hikvision spokesman told Reuters that \"punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision's US businesses partners and negatively impact the US economy.\"\n\nAlthough the DoC's decision is likely to exacerbate US-Chinese tensions over trade, it was revealed Wednesday that the Federal Reserve expressed concerns over the trade war's potential impact on the US economy.\n\nUS and European stocks dropped on Tuesday, and according to a report from Bloomberg, China's Foreign Ministry has hinted at possible retaliation. When a journalist asked a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman if China would retaliate to the blacklisting, he replied \"stay tuned,\" the report said.\n\nMajor investors are reportedly concerned, too. Amid the wave of disappointing tech IPOs in 2019, one major investor, Goldman Sachs, is reportedly reviewing its involvement in Megvii's planned listing after the tech firm was put on the list. The financial services firm told BBC News it was weighing up its role \"in light of the recent developments.\"\n\nLike SenseTime, the Beijing-based image recognition firm develops image recognition and deep learning for use in commercial and public-sector contexts. It has raised $1.4 billion to date, including a huge $750 million Series D raise in May that was led by the Bank of China.", "description": "In a statement on its website, SenseTime said it \"will work closely with all relevant authorities to fully understand and resolve the situation.\"", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f0b043b33a7669c117352?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
