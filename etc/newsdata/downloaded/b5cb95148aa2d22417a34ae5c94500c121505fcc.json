For that reason, opening the airline's co-branded credit card may not be as obvious a choice as, say, getting a Delta or United card.\n\nBut if you're planning a Hawaiian vacation, Hawaiian Airlines miles can help get you there. And now's a particularly good to sign up for the Hawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard, as it's offering an elevated sign-up bonus that can get you enough miles for a round-trip flight to Hawaii from anywhere in the US.\n\nHowever, this offer is only available until September 4, so your time is running out.\n\nUse this offer to get a free flight to Hawaii\n\nYou'll earn 60,000 Hawaiian Miles if you spend $2,000 on the card in the first 90 days from account opening.\n\nHawaiian Airlines' award chart breaks mileage costs down by region. Flights from the East Coast will naturally cost you more than flights from the West Coast, but no matter where in the US you're flying from, 60,000 miles is enough to get you to Hawaii and back \u2014 provided you can find award flights at the cheapest mileage price (there are various levels based on demand).
