FFS. \ufe0f #billy #strangerthings\n\n\"*Guesses I\u2019ve had so far..... George Michael. Pat Sharp. Jason Donovan. Patrick Swayze. Chris Waddel (?!?) Barry Venison (?!) The bloke who tries to knick Ted in the film Ted.\"\n\nThe post left her fans in stitches.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nOne said: \"Omg this is the absolute best ever . I had to look twice to see it was you\"\n\nAnother commented: \"OMG that\u2019s genius\"\n\nAnd one reassured her: \"You have nailed it!!! I knew you were Billy before I read the caption!!!!\"\n\nRosie, who has confessed on her podcast that her weekly Strictly parties have been leaving her a little worse for wear, also posed up for an adorable snap with son Robin, who she shares with husband Chris.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe little one, who turns four tomorrow, was dressed up as a Ghostbuster in a cute pair of beige overalls bearing the logo, and with his very own proton pack.\n\nOn tonight's Strictly, Chris, who is paired with Karen Hauer, sent a special birthday message to his son.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
