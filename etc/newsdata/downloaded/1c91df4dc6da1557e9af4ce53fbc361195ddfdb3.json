Many had camped out on the streets overnight.\n\nSecurity forces responded by firing live bullets to disperse the crowd near Tahrir.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi spoke in a televised address to the nation following three days of demonstrations that have spread across many provinces in the country. Since Tuesday, security forces have fired live rounds and tear gas every day to disperse the protesters, leaving 33 people dead and hundreds wounded.\n\nAuthorities have also cut internet access in much of Iraq since late Wednesday, in a desperate move to curb the rallies.\n\nThe rallies have erupted spontaneously, mostly spurred by youths wanting jobs, improved services such as electricity and water, and an end to endemic corruption in the oil-rich country\n\n\u201cWe will not make empty promises ... or promise what we cannot achieve,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi said in his televised speech, broadcast at 2:30 a.m.\n\nHe said there is \u201cno magic solution\u201d to Iraq\u2019s problems but pledged to work on laws granting poor families a basic income, provide alternative housing to violators and fight corruption.\n\n\u201cThe security measures we are taking, including temporary curfew, are difficult choices. But like bitter medicine, they are inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to return life to normal in all provinces and respect the law.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister also defended the nation\u2019s security forces, saying they abide by strict rules against use of \u201cexcessive violence.\u201d He said the escalation of the protests leads to violence.\n\nHe also said, without elaborating, that he \u201cregrets some have successfully derailed some of the protests from their peaceful path\u201d in order to \u201cexploit\u201d them for political reasons.\n\nThe unrest is the most serious challenge for Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s year-old government, which also has been caught in the middle of increasing U.S.-Iran tensions in the region. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran.\n\nThe mostly leaderless protests have been concentrated in Baghdad and in predominantly Shiite areas of southern Iraq, bringing out jobless youths and university graduates who are suffering under an economy reeling from graft and mismanagement.\n\nAfter Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s speech, Iraqis awaited what Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the country\u2019s top Shiite cleric, would say about the protests in his Friday sermon.\n\nThe city of Nasiriyah, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Baghdad, has witnessed the most violence in the protests, with at least 16 people, including a policeman, killed.\n\nNasiriyah protester Haidar Hamid dismissed the speech of the prime minister, who also hails from the city. Instead, Hamid said he was looking to the Shiite religious authority for a resolution.\n\n\u201cWe wait until Friday prayers,\u201d said Hamid, an unemployed 32-year-old. \u201cIf the government is not dissolved, we will avenge our martyrs.\u201d\n\nA group that monitors internet and cybersecurity, NetBlocks, said internet was briefly restored before al-Mahdi\u2019s speech but by the time he was on screen access was again shut as new videos emerged of the protests. The internet in Iraq\u2019s northern Kurdish region has not been affected.\n\nOn Thursday, Iraq closed a border crossing with Iran in the eastern province of Diyala, saying it will remain closed until further notice.
