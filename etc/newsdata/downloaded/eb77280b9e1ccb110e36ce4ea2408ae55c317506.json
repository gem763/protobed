He\u2019s like every mom watching a movie: \u2018Is that the bad guy?\u2019\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a Trump scandal, Mike Pence never seems to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d the \u201cDaily Show\u201d host observed.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570153970/TN_57_qhiogm", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
