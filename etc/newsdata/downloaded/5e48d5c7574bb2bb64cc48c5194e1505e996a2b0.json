So he\u2019s still in my life. And so it\u2019s on the new album.\n\n\u2018But why he gave me this CD is [because] at the beginning, John says, \u201cOh, that would be great for Richard Starkey.\u201d\n\nThe group in 1963 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I well up every time I think [about it] \u2014 he\u2019s talking about me. He says, \u201cHey, Ringo, this\u2019d be great for you.\u201d And I can\u2019t help myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m emotional now thinking of him 40 years ago talking about me on his tape and thinking of me. The four of us were great friends with a couple of side issues. And it was far out.\u2019\n\nAnd, well, now we\u2019re crying, too.\n\nRingo, 79, admitted he still feels emotional about the circumstances surrounding John\u2019s death and the surreal aftermath.\n\nJohn was killed in 1980 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe recalled to Dave \u2018When John went, I was in the Bahamas. I was getting a phone call from my stepkids in LA saying, \u201cSomething\u2019s happened to John.\u201d And then they called and said, \u201cJohn\u2019s dead.\u201d And I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u2018And I still well up that some b*****d shot him. But I just said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a plane.\u201d\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018We got a plane to New York, and you don\u2019t know what you can do. We went to the apartment. \u201cAnything we can do?\u201d And [John\u2019s wife] Yoko [Ono] just said, \u201cWell, you just play with Sean. Keep Sean busy.\u201d And that\u2019s what we did. That\u2019s what you think, \u201cWhat do you do now?\u201d\u2019\n\nRingo said it was when he returned to LA he grieved and has since become an \u2018old crybaby\u2019, also recalling his final moments with fellow Beatle George Harrison, who died of cancer aged 58 in 2001.\n\n\u2018And George, the same\u2026 I\u2019m such an old crybaby. He\u2019s laying there very ill \u2014 not long,\u2019 Ringo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And I\u2019ve got to go to Boston, \u2019cause my daughter\u2019s having an operation. And so I said, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019ve got to go, George,\u201d and he says, \u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d You know, he\u2019s dying in a bit, \u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d How many people say great things like that to you, really give themselves?\u2019\n\nEnlisting the help of the only other remaining Beatle, Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo asked him to perform on the version Grow Old With Me, on his new album, What\u2019s My Name.\n\nIn a fitting tribute to the legacy of the group, they\u2019ve got John on it from the demo recording, now Paul, and, according to Ringo, \u2018Jack puts in a very recognisable George Harrison riff\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
