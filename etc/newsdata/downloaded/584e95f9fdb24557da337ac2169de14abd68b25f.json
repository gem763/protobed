How dare you?\n\n\u201cHow dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.\u201d\n\nShe told the gathered politicians she did not believe they understood the situation, because if they did and continued to fail to act, they would be \"evil\" and she refused to believe that.\n\nMr Guterres said his generation had \u201cfailed\u201d, and that they needed to make amends.\n\n\"My generation has failed in its responsibility to protect our planet. That must change. The climate crisis is caused by us, and the solutions must come from us,\" he said.\n\nBrazil and Australia were notably absent from the summit, after Mr Guterres said he would only invite those countries who made concrete promises to reduce climate change.\n\nThe UN estimates there needs to be between a three-fold and five-fold increase in efforts to cut greenhouse gases, to prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nChina, which by far emits the most carbon but is also the world leader in renewable energy, called on developed countries to lead by example and cut emissions.\n\nBoris Johnson, the Prime Minister, announced that scientists will be able to use up to \u00a31 billion of the aid budget inventing new technology to tackle the climate crisis in developing countries, alongside funding to protect wildlife.", "description": "Environmental activist Greta Thunberg\u00a0furiously attacked world leaders at the United Nations on Monday for not doing more to tackle climate change, berating the assembled delegates and asking: \u201cHow dare you?\u201d Greta, 16, who began the\u00a0\"climate strike\" movement encouraging\u00a0children to miss school", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9dz9cj_HwDupHmWdXxJSxw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d8eff107f79e2b5e59e0b224ba680438", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
