This one will presumably have sharper claws. There\u2019s a new sheriff in number-town!\n\nOne does, of course, have to be a bit careful with this sort of data. It\u2019s inevitably lumpy and can be distorted by one or two big penalties in a particular year or even a particular month.\n\nIt also depends on when you look.\n\nIn July, for example, the FRC reported that its fines had nearly trebled from \u00a315.5m to \u00a343m. The difference between the two sets of numbers can be explained by dint of the fact that the two organisations were looking at different 12-month periods.\n\nIt\u2019s nonetheless interesting that Thomson Reuters found a similarly sharp increase in US fines on auditors, from $12.5m to $64.7m (\u00a39.9m to \u00a351.1m).\n\nIt all feeds into the general perception of regulators moving to force auditors to shape up.\n\nStill, while that\u2019s very welcome if it ultimately leads to them taking a more assertive approach with their clients, we shouldn\u2019t forget that it\u2019s extremely rare for accountancy firms to play active roles in corporate collapses.\n\nEnron is one example where that happened. You may remember Andersen and its involvement in helping the collapsed energy-trading giant to create its \u201coff-balance sheet vehicles\u201d where there were all sorts of nasties.\n\nIt\u2019s because of them that Andersen followed clients down into corporate hell and the big four accountants were created from what had been a big five.\n\nMore often the auditors are guilty of sins of omission.\n\nAll this does rather raise the question of whether other failings at big companies are being targeted with equal vigour. Those, say, of directors, executives, or maybe other advisers?\n\nTurning a blind eye to corporate rot is bad, and should be punished. But shouldn\u2019t we also be looking at the cause of the problem?\n\nAt the core of nearly all corporate failures can be found failures of corporate governance and failures in the boardroom. If we\u2019re lining up villains perhaps we might also include politicians who\u2019ve sat back and done nothing about corporate malfeasance just as the auditors have.\n\nAs I wrote recently, the Insolvency Service was called in to take a look at Thomas Cook, just as the FRC decided to investigate the work of its auditor.\n\nThe chances of the latter taking action are far higher than the former, in part because the bar for doing so is set lower.\n\nA fine, perhaps a heavy one, shouldn\u2019t buy people off and be allowed to divert attention from the fact that bigger problems aren\u2019t being looked at because it\u2019s just too much damn effort. But it might do that.", "description": "The number crunchers are on the naughty step like never before.\u00a0 Fines levied by the Financial Reporting Council\u00a0(FRC) jumped 44 per cent to a record high of \u00a324.3m in the year ending 30 September, according to Thomson Reuters, the tech and media outfit.
