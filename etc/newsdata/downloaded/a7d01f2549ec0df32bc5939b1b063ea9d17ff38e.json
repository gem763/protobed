In Mexico, the worst affected nation, that number is 4.2 years\n\nObesity has slashed the average life expectancy in the UK by three years and costs Britons an extra \u00a3409 in tax each year (file)\n\nIf the crisis was eradicated it would reduce both country's GDP by more than three per cent.\n\nTackling the crisis accounts for 15 per cent of the entire health budget in the US and eight per cent in the UK.\n\nCOUNTRIES WHERE LIFE EXPECTANCY IS WORST HIT BY OBESITY MEXICO - 4.2 YEARS POLAND - 3.9 YEARS RUSSIA - 3.9 YEARS US - 3.7 YEARS HUNGARY 3.7 YEARS LATVIA - 3.6 YEARS CHILE - 3.5 YEARS CROATIA - 3.5 YEARS CZECH REPUBLIC 3.5 YEARS ROMANIA - 3.5 YEARS\n\nObesity is responsible for 70 per cent of all treatment costs for type 2 diabetes, 23 per cent for heart diseases and nine per cent for cancers.\n\nThe OECD, made up of 36 countries around the world, predicted 90million lives will be lost to illnesses related to overeating in the next 30 years.\n\nThe body revealed that more than half the population is now overweight in 34 of the nations it operates in and almost one in four people are obese.\n\nAverage rates of adult obesity in OECD countries have increased from 21 per cent in 2010 to 24 per cent in 2016, meaning an additional 50million people are now obese.\n\nIt said children in particular are paying a high price for the epidemic, with overweight youngsters achieving worse grades at school then their healthy peers.\n\nData shows they are also up to three times more likely to be bullied, which in turn may lead to worse performance at school.\n\nThese children are also more likely to miss school and less likely to complete higher education, The Heavy Burden of Obesity report said.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said: 'There is an urgent economic and social case to scale up investments to tackle obesity and promote healthy lifestyles.\n\n'These findings clearly illustrate the need for better social, health and education policies that lead to better lives.\n\nTackling the obesity epidemic accounts for 8 per cent of the entire health budget in the UK and 14 per cent in the US\n\nThe number of new cases of chronic illnesses caused by obesity in the 36 countries the OECD operates in\n\n\u2018By investing in prevention, policymakers can halt the rise in obesity for future generations, and benefit economies. There is no more excuse for inaction.'\n\nTam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum UK, said: 'Predictions about obesity's effect on longevity have been thrown around for years.\n\n'Earlier one-off guesstimates that people have made have been somewhat fanciful but a prediction, such as the OECD's based on a stream of data has to taken seriously.\n\n'It is also difficult for people to grasp what damage to the UK economy a \u00a360bn deficit really means so the \u00a3405 per capita tax figure is used to ram the message home.\n\n'Whatever the figures, the NHS will continue to be at crisis point until the government gets a grip on obesity and takes tackling it seriously.\n\n'Downing St was presented this morning with 48 high-profile measures to take by England's feisty outgoing Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sally Davies.\n\n'In order to leave no stone unturned she will have undoubtedly left a note pinned to her desk reminding her successor to oversee their implementation.'\n\nKatharine Jenner, nutritionist and campaign director at Action on Sugar added: 'This report makes for grim reading and reinforces the separate recommendations made today by Professor Sally Davies in her call for \u2018bold action\u2019 if we are ever to achieve the UK government\u2019s target to half childhood obesity in 10 years.\n\n'It seems that reaching this target would put money in everyone\u2019s pockets too, so why is more not being done?\n\n'There is no magic bullet to reverse the rise in childhood obesity, but the Government\u2019s Childhood Obesity Plan was supposed to deliver a range of measures that together could have a significant impact such as calorie reductions, a ban on junk food displayed at the checkouts and of energy drinks to children, calorie labelling on restaurant and cafe menus, and the extension of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy to sugary milk drinks.\n\n'The UK\u2019s food and drinks industry is shortening children\u2019s lives by three years by plying them with food full of sugar, salt and fat, making it all too easy for them to become overweight. To not take action and force the industry to play their part in improving child health is immoral.'\n\nThe OECD report also found that in the European Union, men and women in the lowest income group are 90 per cent and 50 per cent more likely to be obese than wealthy people.\n\nIndividuals with at least one chronic disease associated with being overweight are 8 per cent less likely to be employed the following year.\n\nThe OECD claims a 20 per cent reduction in calories in sweets and confectionery could prevent more than 1m cases of obesity-related diseases every year\n\nThe international coalition's major report found that 50 per cent of people have unhealthy diets and one in three do not get sufficient exercise\n\nWhen they have a job, they are up to 3.4 per cent more likely to be absent or less productive.\n\nOECD said that investing in initiatives like better labelling of food in shops or regulating the advertising of unhealthy foods to children can generate major savings.\n\nEvery dollar invested in preventing obesity would generate an economic return of up to six dollars, according to the report.\n\nIt claimed that reducing by 20 per cent the calorie content in energy-dense food, such as crisps and confectionery, could avoid more than 1m cases of obesity-related diseases every year.\n\nInitiatives targeting the whole population, such as food and menus displaying nutritional information and mass media campaigns, could lead to gains of between 51,000 to 115,000 life years up to 2050 in the 36 countries included in the analysis.\n\nThis would be equivalent to preventing all road deaths in the EU, the report found.\n\nThe report follows damning NHS statistics that today revealed that almost a quarter of England's children were obese or severely obese by the age of 12.\n\nThe NHS today said the shock figures show the Government is 'clearly not on track' in attempts to curb childhood obesity.\n\nEngland's 10 and 11 year olds are fatter than ever before, damning NHS statistics today revealed. Almost a quarter of Year Six children are obese or severely obese\n\nChildren are more than four times likely to be obese if they live in a poor area, such as Wolverhampton, compared to a rich area, such as Richmond.\n\nThe latest NHS data shows a staggering 24.6 per cent of Year 6 children are either obese (20.2 per cent) or severely obese (4.4 per cent).\n\nThe rate of children that are severely obese is the highest rate on record, up from 4.2 per cent in 2017/18 and 3.2 per cent 12 years ago in 2006/7.\n\nOverall, more than a third of Year 6 pupils (34.3 per cent) are overweight or obese. This is 205,923 children.\n\nChildren aged four to five are also fatter than they were a decade ago, when the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) began recording data.", "description": "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report said 62 per cent of adults in the UK are overweight, putting them\u00a0at risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, strokes and cancer.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19538156-0-image-a-6_1570711237254.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
