But the gatherings turned into melees, with protesters hurling firecrackers and other objects at anti-riot officers and kicking temporary fences around the official buildings.\n\nIn Barcelona, protesters sang the Catalan anthem and shouted \u201cThe streets will always be ours\u201d and \u201cIndependence,\u201d while they called Spanish police \u201coccupying forces\u201d and urged them to leave Catalonia. Demonstrators erected improvised barricades with trash bins, fences and piles of cardboard that they set on fire.\n\nThe greatly outnumbered riot police went in with shields and batons striking protesters in their path. They hit people on the legs mostly and fired foam-type anti-riot bullets that dispersed the crowds.\n\nThere were also clashes in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona as well as smaller towns across Catalonia.\n\nMost impromptu protests were responding to an online campaign by Tsunami Democratic, a loose, leaderless grassroots group that uses encrypted messaging apps to call for peaceful disobedience.\n\nSpain\u2019s caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said authorities were investigating the group.\n\nProtests were initially called by ANC and Omnium, two grassroots pro-secession groups whose leaders Jordi S\u00e1nchez and Jordi Cuixart were sentenced Monday to nine years in prison for sedition.\n\nIn written answers to questions sent to S\u00e1nchez in prison, the activist-turned-politician defended the non-violent nature of the Catalan independence movement.\n\n\u201cThe risk of frustration is always there among certain people when there is a movement so big of millions,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any future for violence. We don\u2019t practice it, nor do we defend it.\u201d\n\nSeven politicians were also given prison terms of around a decade in Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling and three more were fined for disobeying the laws as they pushed ahead with a banned referendum on Oct. 1, 2017, and briefly declaring independence based on its results before Spain crushed the defiance.\n\nOn Tuesday, protesters also blocked highways, smaller roads and railway tracks for brief periods following an attempt to besiege Barcelona\u2019s international airport Monday night that left thousands of travelers stranded. Many, desperate to catch their flights, were forced to walk with their luggage on highways and across fields.\n\nThe airport authority said 110 flights were canceled Monday and 45 Tuesday, when nearly 1,000 operated normally.\n\nOfficials said six people had been arrested \u2014 three on Monday and three on Tuesday. More than 170 people were reported injured, including about 40 police officers and a protester who lost an eye.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling Monday also barred the 12 convicted Catalan separatists from holding public office. That has an immediate impact in the upcoming Nov. 10 Spanish election because six of them were planning to run as candidates to the national parliament.\n\nThe verdict is likely to be a central issue in the election campaign but \u201cit is unlikely to substantially alter the electoral outlook unless the situation worsens significantly in the region,\u201d said Antonio Barroso, a political risk analyst with the London-based Teneo consulting firm.\n\nHe said Catalan separatist politicians wanted to use the backlash against the ruling to woo pro-independence voters to the polls.\n\nOthers have feared that swelling support for Catalan separatism because of the sentences could make the next political term even more key to either breaking the deadlock with separatists or making it a chronicle problem.\n\nSpain\u2019s caretaker prime minister and Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who won the April election but failed to get support for a minority government, is hoping to remain in office.\n\nEven from the early hours after the Supreme Court ruling was issued, very different views emerged from Madrid and Catalonia. While S\u00e1nchez called for beginning a \u201cnew phase\u201d and urged Catalan separatists to abide by the law, the ruling invigorated the wealthy region\u2019s independence movement, with many of its leaders making new calls to work toward effective secession or repeating the slogan \u201cwe will do it again.\u201d\n\nCuixart told The Associated Press by email via his lawyer that he and the others sentenced by the Supreme Court will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n\u201cWe have the moral obligation to denounce (Spain\u2019s) authoritarian drift and appeal to European citizens to defend human rights,\u201d Cuixart wrote Tuesday.\n\nThe Catalan regional president, Quim Torra, said secessionists won\u2019t give up their fight.\n\n\u201cA referendum is the most positive solution for solving this situation,\u201d he told foreign reporters in Barcelona on Tuesday.\n\nThe caretaker Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, soon due to become the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, said the court\u2019s ruling would not resolve the underlying political problems. Only dialogue \u201cin the framework of the constitution\u201d could do that, he said. Spain\u2019s constitution says the country is indivisible.\n\n\u201cYesterday, today and tomorrow it is and remains a political problem that has to be solved,\u201d Borrell told foreign reporters, adding that Catalan separatists shouldn\u2019t ignore Catalans like him who are against independence.\n\nProtests are likely to extend throughout the week. A three-day student strike begins Wednesday in the region, and a worker\u2019s union has called a separate strike for Friday.", "description": "Violent clashes erupted for a second night in Barcelona between police and protesters angry about the conviction of a dozen Catalan separatist leaders, as...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT373_catala_ZG_20191015175324.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
