Overnight, an additional 60 million Americans would be able to save for their own out-of-pocket health costs, tax-free.\n\nAnd \u2014 a nice plus \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t bust the budget. Indeed, it would tend to reduce deficits.\n\nUnder current law, if you\u2019re on Medicare, you basically cannot have an HSA. The new bill would end that discrimination.\n\nHSAs are popular because they give patients additional resources to pay for health care, resources you own and control. It\u2019s your property. Whether you lose your job or change jobs, your account is there for you, growing tax-free.\n\nIn 2003, there were no HSAs. Today, there are more than 25 million nationwide, with total account balances approaching $60 billion.\n\nSo why can\u2019t seniors have HSAs? Because under current law, to be able to contribute to an HSA you must have \u201cqualified coverage,\u201d which is defined as a specific kind of health insurance policy with a high deductible. Legally, Medicare does not fit the definition. So simply by enrolling in Medicare, you end your ability to save for health care tax-free.\n\nThe Bera-Smith bill would fix that oversight by simply declaring Medicare to be HSA-qualified coverage. Elegant.\n\nIf anyone deserves access to these accounts, it\u2019s seniors. Health care costs typically rise with age, and Medicare doesn\u2019t cover everything (routine dental, vision, and hearing items, for example).\n\nEven seniors with supplemental \u201cmedigap\u201d coverage can never completely shield themselves from unexpected medical bills. The average elderly couple needs $280,000 to cover health care costs in retirement. And the typical enrollee in original, fee-for-service Medicare spends 19 percent of his or her income on out-of-pocket health costs.\n\nHSAs can help fill these gaps.\n\nHow much would the bill cost? According to Adams Auld LLC, a public policy consultancy of which I\u2019m a partner, H.R.3796 as introduced would reduce federal outlays by an estimated $12.8 billion over 10 years (2020-29).\n\nYes, reduce. While more income would escape taxation, thanks to an estimated 2.6 million new HSAs created, which would dampen federal tax receipts by around $1.2 billion, this revenue loss would be offset by an estimated $14 billion in outlay reductions.\n\nRoughly $2.2 billion of that savings would come from two places: Medicaid (the joint federal-state health program for the poor), because seniors with new and growing HSA balances have more assets; and Social Security, because working seniors with employer-funded HSAs tend to file for their benefits a bit later than those without.\n\nBut the bulk of the projected savings, roughly $10.6 billion, would occur within Medicare, thanks to the HSA effect.\n\nThe HSA effect is the tendency of HSA account owners to be more frugal in their health care spending without harming their health. This effect is well-attested. Numerous studies, including those reviewed by RAND Corporation and the American Academy of Actuaries, have found that simply having an HSA tends to diminish personal health spending by somewhere in the range of 1 percent to 20 percent. (Adams Auld assumes 10 percent.) And happily, HSA owners tend to increase their use of preventive-care services.\n\nIn short, HSAs help bend the health care cost curve by eliminating waste. And it stands to reason: People make more careful choices when spending their own money.\n\nBut suppose the HSA effect is a myth? In that case, the Bera-Smith bill would still save about $2.2 billion.\n\nIn sum, this elegant proposal has something for everyone: A tax cut for Republicans; a stronger Medicare for Democrats; lower long-term health costs for patients; and, for 60 million elderly and disabled Americans, greater peace of mind.\n\nAnd \u2014 a nice plus \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t bust the budget.\n\n\u2022 Dean Clancy, a former senior White House budget official, is president and founder of HSAs for All.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
