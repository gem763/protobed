Fund managers' exposure to cash rose compared to September, signaling a buying opportunity for risk assets. However, it remains below the high reached in June.\n\nClouds continue to gather around growth expectations, with about a third of surveyed investors expecting the world economy to weaken over the next 12 months. This sentiment follows a stream of disappointing US data releases at the start of October, which halted the September and year-to-date rally in risk assets and fueled a retreat in global equities as fund managers retreated to havens.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the UK's political risks remain elevated, with the Brexit deadline quickly approaching and major questions persisting in US-China trade negotiations. Investors view the end of the trade spat as the most bullish factor for equity markets in the next six months, according to BofA.\n\n\"If trade war and Brexit fears are unrealised in the fourth quarter, then macro can beat expectations, validating our contrarian bullish view,\" said BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett.", "description": "Clouds continue to gather around growth expectations, with about a third of surveyed investors expecting the world economy to weaken over the next 12 months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2835%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_323%2C$y_351/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f1d4a91fdd132e1398d9cf838f15cddcc50abd7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
