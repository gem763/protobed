When news is deeply-reported and well-sourced it gives people information they can rely on. When it\u2019s not, we lose an essential tool for making good decisions,\" said Brown and Sarantakos.\n\nThe company has faced some criticism for its handling of news in the past.\n\nCritics have said the company has not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation on its platform, although it has taken down accounts linked to fake news.\n\nFacebook has also been accused of inflating its video metrics, which many called a factor in the \u201cpivot to video\u201d that resulted in layoffs of nonvideo journalists.", "description": "Facebook on Friday announced the launch of its news tab on the social media platform.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/facebook_043019getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
