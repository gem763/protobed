(Matthew Lupu/CBC)\n\nAn idea \u2018worth considering\u2019\n\nThe discussion began almost 50 years ago when it was lowered from 21 to 18.\n\nSome Canadians even wondered back then, why stop there?\n\nFormer Miss Teen London, Kelsey Johnson, 18 at the time, at a Vote Mob gathering to encourage the youth vote in London, Ont., on April 30, 2011, for the federal election. (Dave Chidley/The Canadian Press)\n\nWhile 18 is widely considered the \"age of majority,\" kids across the country are granted other rights at age 16, such as driving a car.\n\nSo if kids are considered responsible enough to drive, have jobs and pay taxes, why can\u2019t they vote at a younger age, too?\n\nTahja Ali, who wants to \u2018help the environment,\u2019 was nine years old when he participated in a mock student vote at Bel Ayr Elementary in Dartmouth, N.S. (Haydn Watters/CBC)\n\nMore than 10 countries that have lowered their voting age to 16, including Scotland, Austria, Cuba, Nicaragua, Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador.\n\nAccording to Canada\u2019s chief electoral officer, Stephane Perrault, it\u2019s an idea \u201cworth considering.\u201d\n\n\"Voting when you're 16 is voting at a time when most Canadians at that age are still in school, at a place that we can actually get to them and engage them,\" he said in an interview with CBC in 2018.\n\nA student in Burnaby, B.C., participates in a mock vote at her high school. (Civix)\n\nVancouver NDP MP Don Davies said many 16-year-olds work and pay taxes, yet they have no say in how those tax dollars are spent.\n\n\"Young people today are more involved, engaged and plugged into what's happening in our country and there's no reason they shouldn't be allowed to vote,\" he said in 2018.\n\nThe David Suzuki Foundation took the idea one step further by creating 18to8, a playful campaign that suggests eight-year-olds would vote with more wisdom than adults when it comes to prioritizing climate change.\n\n18to8 is a satirical campaign launched by the David Suzuki Foundation that suggests eight-year olds should vote. (David Suzuki Foundation)\n\n\u201cThink lowering the voting age is crazy? Doing nothing is crazier,\u201d reads the campaign website.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t suggesting eight-year-olds should really get to vote, but we are suggesting that adults vote with the best interests of future generations in mind this October,\u201d said David Suzuki Foundation CEO Stephen Cornish.\n\n\u201cYouth in Canada and around the world are speaking up, petitioning and organizing strikes to prioritize the climate crisis. Adults have the power to make changes.
