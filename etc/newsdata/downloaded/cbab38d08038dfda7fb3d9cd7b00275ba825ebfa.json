A jury will determine whether he's criminally responsible.\n\nThree days of jury selection is expected to start on Wednesday. The final jury selection will be on Monday, according to Terri Charles, a spokesperson with the courts.\n\nHannah Gaskill/Capital News Service, University of Maryland, via AP\n\nRamos, a 39-year-old resident of Laurel, Maryland, is accused of fatally shooting five employees at the Capital Gazette, the daily local newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 28, 2018. It's the largest killing of journalists in U.S. history.\n\nFour journalists -- Wendi Winters, Rob Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman and John McNamara -- and a sales assistant -- Rebecca Smith -- were killed. A garden with five rose bushes and a memorial plaque was dedicated in their honor this year at Acton's Cove Waterfront Park in Annapolis.\n\nBrian Witte/AP\n\nProsecutors allege Ramos had a long grudge against the newspaper and planned the attack.\n\nRamos was allegedly armed with a legally-purchased, pump-action shotgun when he arrived at the multi-office building in Annapolis on that fateful day. Authorities said he \"looked for his victims as he walked through the lower level\" where the Capital Gazette newsroom is located. He \"hunted\" his victims, including those who tried to flee, and barricaded the back exit of the newsroom, according to authorities.\n\nPolice arrived at the scene of the shooting within a minute and arrested Ramos after finding him hiding under a desk in the newsroom.", "description": "A man accused of killing five people in a newsroom last year has changed his plea to guilty but maintained that he's not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/capital-gazette-reporters-survivors-presser-201910_hpMain_20191029-061742_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
