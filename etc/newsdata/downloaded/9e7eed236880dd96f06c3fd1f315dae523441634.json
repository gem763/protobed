The current deadline for the U.K. to leave the European bloc is Oct. 31.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement that Johnson struck with the EU last week has been met with fierce opposition by U.K. lawmakers, many of whom said it was worse than the deal forged by his predecessor Theresa May.\n\nRecent research has also suggested that Johnson's new Brexit deal could have a worse impact on the U.K. economy than May's.\n\nThe government's long-term economic analysis published in November 2018 identifies a potential scenario as costing the U.K. 6.7% of its GDP, or \u00a3130 billion ($167.5 billion) in growth by 2034, according to a report from The Guardian. That amounts to an average of \u00a32,250 less per person per year, 15 years from now.", "description": "Leaving the European Union will hit Scotland badly, and the country now wants another go at choosing whether it should leave or stay, a Scottish member of parliament told CNBC.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105935198-1559021712620gettyimages-1152009610.jpeg?v=1559021998", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
