It was the second accidental knee Hager landed on Garrett in the first round.\n\nAt a post-fight news conference after the event, Hager gave his thoughts on the situation and blamed his opponent for the final ruling. \u201cThe Big Hurt\u201d said he has no interest in a rematch with Garrett.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed with the finish tonight,\u201d Hager said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I hit him at all. Is it something I\u2019d be interested in running back? I don\u2019t know. It didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to fight tonight, so what\u2019s going change the next time? Is he really going to want to fight next time? I\u2019m a competitor. I\u2019m a fighter. I\u2019m doing so much right now trying to get myself better. For him to do something like that? Whatever.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he went back and watched the tape to affirm his perception of the event, Hager said he didn\u2019t \u201cfeel a cup\u201d when his knee connected on Garrett.\n\n\u201cWe all have cups on out there,\u201d Hager said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a cup. You can watch it back. I saw his leg lift up from the knee. But I can\u2019t control that. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve got to move on from. Like I said, I\u2019m here to fight. I just don\u2019t think he was tonight.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I believe he wanted out of the cage, yes. You saw how he reacted after the first one. That was clear. It hit him right in the arm, so I think that\u2019s all that needs to be said about it. He didn\u2019t want to be in there any more.\u201d\n\nHager plans on redirecting his focus to participating in AEW wrestling on Wednesday nights. The former WWE champion made his debut Oct. 3 and will have a recurring role going forward.\n\nOverall, Hager thinks Friday\u2019s situation will make him a better fighter. The 37-year-old heavyweight deemed the ordeal \u201ca bump in the road\u201d and hopes to get back inside the cage soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I got paid, and I still have a TV show Wednesday nights on TNT,\u201d Hager said. \u201cThere could be worse things. There could be a way worse finish. I think this will be a great learning curve for me. It\u2019ll be a bump in the road, but I\u2019ll only keep getting better. I\u2019m only going to keep working harder. Stuff like this only motivates me.\n\n\u201cI think sooner (rather) than later, you\u2019re going to see me back in here to get that next \u2018W.'\u201d", "description": "If you think Jake Hager's Bellator 231 fight with Anthony Garrett ended due to a low blow, the former WWE superstar has a message for you.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jake-hager-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
