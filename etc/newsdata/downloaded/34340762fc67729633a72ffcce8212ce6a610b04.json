Another minister is a technocrat not affiliated to any party.\n\nConte said the new government would \"dedicate ... our best energies\" to \"make Italy better.\"\n\nA PD official said Gualtieri received strong support from former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who wanted him at the Treasury and wanted Nicola Danti \u2014 who will take Gualtieri's seat as an MEP and is considered close to Renzi \u2014 to take over at the helm of the ECON committee.\n\nDanti declined to comment.\n\nConte also confirmed that Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the 5Stars, will become foreign minister. Di Maio was deputy prime minister and development minister in a government formed last year with the far-right League. That government's collapse, at the start of August, paved the way for a tie-up between the 5Stars and the PD, two parties which have long been at odds.\n\nAnother key position is the interior ministry, which had been in the hands of League leader Matteo Salvini, whose campaigns against NGOs rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean were considered an essential component of the League's success. The PD wants a radical change of course and Salvini will be replaced by the only technocrat in the Cabinet, Luciana Lamorgese, a former senior interior ministry official and migration expert.\n\nLamorgese is one of seven women in the government.\n\nDefense minister will be Lorenzo Guerini of the PD, who is close to Renzi and was in charge of Copasir, a parliament committee that oversees the intelligence services. Also from the PD is the new Europe minister, Enzo Amendola.\n\nOne of the few surprises was the nomination of Roberto Speranza as health minister. Speranza is the only minister from Leu, a small far-left party. The health ministry was expected to remain in the hands of the 5Stars.\n\nFormer general, Sergio Costa of the 5Stars, remains environment minister. Paola De Micheli of the PD, who is very close to party leader Nicola Zingaretti, is the new transport and infrastructure minister. Paola Pisano (5Stars) will be in charge of technology and digitalization.\n\nThe nominee to become Italy's next European commissioner is expected to be former Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. The new government will be sworn in on Thursday at 10 a.m.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
