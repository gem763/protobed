Will It Help Him Escape Execution?", "language": "en", "text": "A death-row inmate in Texas who murdered a grandmother during a robbery is hoping that his diagnosis of a birth defect caused by exposure to alcohol in the womb will spare him from execution Tuesday evening.\n\nMark Soliz, 37 , is set to be the 15th prisoner put to death this year unless he can convince the courts he is mentally disabled and exempt from capital punishment.\n\nHis lawyers are citing a decision two weeks ago by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which stayed the execution of Dexter Johnson based on new standards for evaluating mental disability.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re almost identical,\u201d Soliz\u2019s lawyer, Seth Kretzer, said of the two cases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply not right to execute the mentally disabled,\u201d Kretzer said, adding that he knows they may not prevail. \u201cHope is a very dangerous thing to have in prison. We\u2019ve used every legal tool we can to fight this and now we just have to wait.\u201d\n\nUnder the old medical standards, Soliz\u2019s IQ of more than 70 meant he did not qualify as mentally disabled. But under new criteria, Soliz\u2019s lawyers say his diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome should qualify him as mentally disabled and ultimately save him from a lethal dose of pentobarbital.\n\n\u201cBecause Mr. Soliz suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, he should be categorically exempted from the death penalty under the eighth amendment to the United States constitution,\u201d his lawyers argued in court documents.\n\n\u201c[Fetal alcohol syndrome] is the functional equivalent of the conditions already recognized as disqualifying exemptions to the death penalty such as intellectual disability.\u201d\n\nSoliz\u2019s mother was a prostitute who drank and huffed glue during her pregnancy. He scored 75 on his last IQ test, which falls within the 70-84 range considered borderline intellectual functioning, according to an evaluation paid for by his lawyers and reported in the Austin Chronicle.\n\nGreg Westfall, who represented Soliz during his 2012 trial, said that in a different jurisdiction, his client would have received a life sentence.\n\n\u201cJohnson County has a huge evangelical presence and a large amount of people who believe in the death penalty,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cand there\u2019s racial overtones to the case. He\u2019s a Hispanic who killed a white grandmother.\u201d\n\nSoliz\u2019s deadly crime spree began in June 22, 2010, when he and co-defendant Jose Ramos stole several guns. The pair went on to steal from several stores and killed a man in one of the robberies, making a widow of his eight-months pregnant wife. (Ramos pleaded guilty and was given a life sentence for the slaying.)\n\nOn June 29, 2010, Nancy Weatherly, a grandmother and engineer at an aerospace company in Godley, Texas, heard her doorbell ring around 10:30 a.m. and opened her front door to find Soliz pointing a Hi-Point 9 mm semiautomatic handgun in her face.\n\nSoliz brought her inside and began to search the house for valuables. When she asked him not to take her deceased mother\u2019s jewelry box, he told her she would join her mother shortly and shot her in the back of the head.\n\nJohnson County Assistant District Attorney Martin Strahan told a local paper last week that Soliz deserved death. \u201cHe was a very dangerous person who would hurt other people if there was ever any chance he might be let loose, which is why we decided to go with the death penalty option,\u201d Strahan said. Fort Worth Detective Danny Paine called Soliz \u201cthe most dangerous person he had ever come in contact with during his law enforcement career.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, Soliz scratched his gang name, \u201cKilo,\u201d into the defense table and managed to memorize the mailing address of a potential female member of the jury and wrote her a romantic letter that was intercepted according to the Celburne Times Review.", "description": "He\u2019s scheduled to die Tuesday night but is hoping for an eleventh-hour reprieve based on intellectual disability.", "authors": ["Summer Eldemire", "Cheat Sheet Intern"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568083158/190909-eldemire-Soliz-tease_x7yo7c", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
