And I'm still here.\n\n\"I managed to survive, and this is just the scar I walked away with.\"\n\nMaes was stationed in Poland as part of a NATO operation last year when he and two crew members fell asleep in their tank on an overnight training exercise, according to reports.\n\nWhen they woke up, they found the tank hurtling down a hill as the brakes had failed.\n\nThe group had no choice but to brace as they crashed into an embankment at full speed.\n\nMaes was launched forward and his leg was caught in the turret gear - but his concerns remained with his team.\n\nThe driver of the tank had reportedly smashed his head through the driver's hatch.\n\nAnother had dislocated her leg and was bleeding profusely from a deep cut to her thigh.\n\nDetermined to help, Maes maneuvered his body to dislodge himself from the mangled metal.\n\n\"I pushed and pulled at my leg as hard as I could to get loose and felt a sharp tear,\" Maes told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I thought I had dislodged my leg, but when I moved away, my leg was completely gone.\"\n\nBlood began pouring from his wound but it didn't stop him persevering and he immediately started shock procedures on himself and his crew.\n\nHe ordered them to focus on breathing and guided them through making makeshift tourniquets to stem any bleeding.\n\nMaes then managed to call for help.\n\nThe soldier was rushed to hospital and spent four months in intensive care.\n\nBut he said he and his crew still feel lucky, knowing so much more could have gone wrong.\n\nA year later, Maes continues to have physiotherapy and occupational therapy and works with service dogs.\n\nHe is also in the process of being fitted with a prosthetic leg.", "description": "Ezra Maes reportedly said the freak accident has given him a second chance at life and \"this is just the scar I walked away with\"", "authors": ["Danya Bazaraa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662379.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_201019Slug_2512JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
