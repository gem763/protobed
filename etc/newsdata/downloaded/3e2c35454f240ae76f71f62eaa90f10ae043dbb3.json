(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2013 An Indiana man faces federal criminal charges after authorities say he walked hundreds of miles to Wisconsin to have sex with who he thought was a 14-year-old girl.\n\nTommy Lee Jenkins, 32, began exchanging messages Oct. 1 with a girl named \"Kylee,\" who he believed to be living with her mom in Neenah, Wisconsin. Jenkins demanded sexually explicit photos from the girl and made plans to engage in sexual activities with her, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nJenkins, who moved to Whitestown, Indiana, from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, also asked \"Kylee\" to join him in Indiana multiple times. When those requests were rebuffed, he began walking from Whitestown to Neenah, which is a 351-mile trek, the DOJ said.\n\nWhile walking to Wisconsin, Jenkins continued to engage in sexually explicit conversations with \"Kylee\" and updated her on his location. He sent \"Kylee\" selfies, plus photos of exit signs and landmarks such as churches, according to a federal criminal complaint.\n\nSex sing gone wrong: Teens tried to lure a man looking for underage sex. Then, one was kidnapped, police say\n\nJenkins said he wanted to have multiple children with the girl, and told \"Kylee\" he'd like to have the first one with her within a year, according to the complaint.\n\nJenkins told \"Kylee\" on Oct. 10 that he had made it to Wisconsin. \"Kylee,\" however, was a Winnebago County, Wisconsin, sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, the DOJ said.\n\nWhen Jenkins arrived in Winnebago County, deputies and a special agent with the FBI arrested him. He faces federal charges of using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce, or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the DOJ said.\n\nJenkins faces a minimum of 10 years and up to life in prison if convicted, the DOJ said.\n\nFollow Andrew Clark on Twitter: @Clarky_Tweets.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/11/sex-sting-snares-indiana-man-who-walked-to-wisconsin/3949803002/", "description": "\"Kylee\u201d turned out to be a Winnebago County, Wisconsin, sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, the DOJ said.", "authors": ["Andrew Clark", "Published P.M.
