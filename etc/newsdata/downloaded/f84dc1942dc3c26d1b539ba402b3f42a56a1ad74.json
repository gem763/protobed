Here's how fellows and apprentices are changing the way we train our youngest workers.", "language": "en", "text": "Experts say internship programs can cater to privileged people, and don't always best prepare participants for the job.\n\nNow, companies across industries are turning to fellowships and apprenticeships to better prepare entry-level talent.\n\nUS employers posted 145% more fellowship job openings in the last year, and listings for apprenticeships grew 131% between 2017 to 2018, according to ZipRecruiter.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nLast year, Kayla Usmani worked at Accenture, one of the country's largest consulting firms, for an apprenticeship program \u2014 an alternative to their internship.\n\nUsmani wasn't grabbing coffee and performing mindless busywork typical to traditional internship programs. Instead, she was working for months honing in her computer science skills to eventually land her a job at the company.\n\nUnlike traditional interns, Usmani wasn't getting paid peanuts and relying on mom and dad to help her out. In fact, she'd been jumping around foster homes and hadn't finished college before the program \u2014 a rarity in elite internship programs.\n\nUsmani called the program \"life changing\" and said she would not have been able to get a job at a top company like Accenture without the apprenticeship program.\n\n\"Everything that I'm learning, like the new technology, and being able to have the support that I have now, I don't know if I would have gotten that anywhere else,\" she said.\n\nAs internship programs continue to get bad press \u2014 and even sued \u2014 for underpaying young workers, alternative options like apprenticeships and fellowships are rising to fill the gaps. (Business Insider itself recently switched its internship program to a higher paying, more specialized fellowship.)\n\nRead more: 20 high-paying jobs you can get with just an associate degree\n\nThe exact responsibilities for these recently prominent \"ships\" vary, but they typically last longer, are higher paying, and provide more in-depth job training than traditional summer internships.\n\nAnd they're growing in popularity: US employers have posted 145% more fellowships in the past nine months than all of 2018, according to an exclusive report that job-marketplace site ZipRecruiter drafted for Business Insider. The average listings for apprenticeships per month grew 131% between 2017 and 2018.\n\n\"The word 'fellowship' applies greater academic prestige; it also typically implies higher pay,\" Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter, told Business Insider. \"It makes sense that there are more fellowships than internships in a tight labor market because employers need to do more to attract more talent.\"\n\nAt a time when companies are considering diversity and inclusion efforts, plus preparing their entry-level talent for the ever-changing future of work, fellowships, apprenticeships, and other alternative internship programs are leading the charge.", "description": "US employers posted 145% more fellowship job openings in the last year than in 2018, according to ZipRecruiter.", "authors": ["Allana Akhtar"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da868bb4af90909460b0698?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
