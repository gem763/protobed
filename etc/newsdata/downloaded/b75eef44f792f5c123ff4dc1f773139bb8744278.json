They couldn\u2019t leave them lying there, so cleared the threat, buried them together and said a quick payer, it wasn\u2019t much but they could in difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nDespite IS\u2019s defeat in Syria there are thousands of Islamic State extremists still at large in sleeper cells bent on revenge.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe heavily- armed SAS patrol had been operating in north east Syria with other special forces units when it was ordered to withdraw to the Iraq border following the decision by the Turks to mount an offensive against the Kurds.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s sudden move to pull out 1,000 American special forces troops paved the way for the Turkish invasion which has threatened genocide against Kurds.\n\nYesterday Russian troops, who along with Syrian regime forces, have come to the rescue of Kurdish troops in \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d rescue pact, continued their advance towards Turkish lines.\n\nBut Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defied pressure for a ceasefire in Syria and said the only way the offensive would end was if Syrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area.\n\nRussia said it was working to prevent a conflict between Turkish troops and Syrian government forces that have moved into Kurdish-held areas in the northeast.\n\nThe American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the US and cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s invasion aimed at crushing them.\n\nIn an address to his ruling party legislators, Erdogan said Turkey would not be coerced into stopping its offensive.\n\nHe vowed to press ahead with the incursion until Turkish troops reach a depth of 18-20 miles inside Syria along a border area where Turkey intends to form a \u201csafe zone\u201d.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe brands YPG Kurdish forces inside Syria - who make up the western-backed YPG - as terrorists with little distinction between them and the Kurdish PKK terror group.\n\nThe approach has attracted widespread condemnation since the YPG/ SDF have not operated inside Turkey.\n\nIt is suspected Erdogan is terrified the Kurds\u2019 successful state of Rojava would encourage 14 million Kurds inside Turkey also to pursue an independence.\n\nMr Erdogan ruled out direct or indirect talks with the Kurdish fighters, saying Turkey will not negotiate with \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201c\u201cWe are not looking for a peace mediator nor do we need one.\u201d\n\nYesterday Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters were still battling heavily on Wednesday over the border town of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nTurkey captured the town days ago, but its hold now appeared uncertain after the Kurds fought back.", "description": "The small SAS convoy noticed 14 hidden grenades when they stopped to check on two kids lying by the road in north-eastern Syria", "authors": ["Chris Hughes", "Image", "Getty", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636957.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-980978928.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
