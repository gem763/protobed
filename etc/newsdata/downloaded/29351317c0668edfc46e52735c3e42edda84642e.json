(Jeremie Richard, AFP, file)\n\nWomen bear the brunt of climate change because they are more acutely subject to poverty, says Gender Links.\n\n\"The gender equality struggles on climate change have forced thousands of women to lose control of land, clean water, energy sources and food security,\" said Sifisosami Dube, head of governance and sexual reproductive health and rights at Gender Links.\n\n\"As women bear the brunt of climate change, the message is clear that women and youth have to be at the centre of the climate action movement,\" Dube added.\n\nClimate activism has jumped onto the global agenda as young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg implored world leaders to declare a climate emergency.\n\nREAD | #ClimateStrike: 'You'll die of old age.

High inequality is perpetuated by a legacy of exclusion and the nature of economic growth, which is not pro-poor and does not generate sufficient jobs. Inequality in wealth is even higher: The richest 10% of the population held around 71% of net wealth in 2015, while the bottom 60% held 7% of the net wealth,\" said the global organisation.\n\nREAD | Trump slammed for trolling Greta Thunberg climate speech\n\nFocus areas\n\nIn his State of the Nation Address, Ramaphosa said extreme weather was a threat to South Africa's economy.\n\n\"Together with all the nations of the world, we are confronted by the most devastating changes in global climate in human history.\n\n\"The extreme weather conditions associated with the warming of the atmosphere threaten our economy, they threaten the lives and the livelihoods of our people, and - unless we act now - will threaten our very existence.\"\n\nRamaphosa argued that SA needed to focus on economic transformation, education, service delivery, spatial integration, social cohesion and others in order to achieve the goals of the National Development Plan.\n\nAs part of the response to gender-based violence, the president announced in Parliament on September 18 that the government would prioritise women for training opportunities and procurement of services.\n\n\"Government is committed to reach its target to set aside 30% of the value of its procurement for women-owned businesses, and to progressively increase that to 40%,\" Ramaphosa said at the time.\n\nHe also told the UN that 6 422MW (Megawatts) of electricity had been procured from 112 independent renewable energy providers, the government had introduced a carbon tax and would be decommissioning coal fired power plants older than 50 years.\n\n", "description": "Women bear the brunt of climate change because they are more acutely subject to poverty, says organisation Gender Links.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5248/c959fdf5640f48cb91ae3265b0c140d6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
