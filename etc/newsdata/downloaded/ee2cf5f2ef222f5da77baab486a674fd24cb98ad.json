I hope the @NBA can learn from that courage and not abandon those values for the sake of their bottom line. \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) October 8, 2019\n\nIt was a rare instance in which McConnell came out on the same side of an issue as The New York Times editorial board, which opined Monday that the NBA\u2019s silence on China\u2019s human and civil rights record \u201cis merely complicity.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s statement Tuesday is also notable because his wife, Elaine Chair, the Secretary of Transportation, is Chinese-American and was born in Taiwan, a country that has long been a source of tension between mainland China and the United States. McConnell\u2019s father-in-law, James Chao is the founder of the Foremost Group, a multimillion-dollar shipping company.\n\nMorey caused an uproar over the weekend when he tweeted a slogan of the pro-Democracy movement in Hong Kong, which is protesting the Chinese government\u2019s attempt to increase control over the city.\n\nAfter tweeting, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d More immediately deleted his post and walked back his statement.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up tweet. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the NBA on Sunday apologized for the tweet, saying it was \u201cregrettable\u201d and acknowledging that Morey \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets are one of the highest-profile franchises in China, a huge potential market, because one of China\u2019s best basketball players of all time, center Yao Ming, played parts of 8 seasons for the team.\n\nOther GOP lawmakers have also criticized the NBA\u2019s response.\n\nSen.
