This is totally wrong,\" she said.\n\nThe Chinese government expressed its support for Lam after Reuters news agency released an audio recording of her telling business leaders last week that she wanted to step down and take responsibility for the unrest.\n\nLam herself insisted earlier on Tuesday she had no intention of stepping down.\n\n\"I told myself repeatedly in the last three months that I and my team should stay on to help Hong Kong,\" Lam told a press conference in the city.\n\nLam said she had \"not even contemplated\" discussing her resignation with the Chinese government, which gives Hong Kong a restricted form of autonomy.\n\nYang said Hong Kongers are allowed by law to protest as long as it is in a peaceful manner, but he lashed out at \"criminal acts that unscrupulously challenge the bottom line\" of the \"one country, two systems\" policy that governs the city.\n\n\"Positive change has emerged in Hong Kong, most importantly to put an end to violence,\" he said.\n\nBut, he added, \"it must be pointed out that the situation remains complex.\"", "description": "Beijing on Tuesday threw its backing behind Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam after an audio recording emerged of her saying she wanted to quit over three months of unrest in the semi-autonomous city.  \"We firmly support Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam in leading the SAR (Special Administrative Region", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RvCKYVlWwnmOgxoP68gI3Q--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/b051a2ed1230ad0c4db816afa2b294d50f7f52bf.jpg"}
