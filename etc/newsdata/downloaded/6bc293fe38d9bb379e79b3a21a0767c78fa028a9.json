It\u2019s more like.... When a whole picture of someone\u2019s life is painted\u2014it made so much sense, to see her whole childhood detailed,\" Willis told the magazine. \"It was like having a bunch of puzzle pieces put together.\"\n\nShe added: \"Whenever your parents say something like, 'I was your age once and blah blah blah,' when you\u2019re younger you go, \u2018Yeah, but you don\u2019t really understand.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to imagine your parents as kids.\u201d\n\nShe says she doesn\u2019t have that problem anymore.\n\nDEMI MOORE SAYS SHE 'LOST' HERSELF AFTER ASHTON KUTCHER BREAKUP: 'I BLINDED MYSELF'\n\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve had the privilege to see all sides of my mom,\" Willis concluded. \"But I feel like one of the most beautiful parts of her writing this book is everyone who has been a fan of hers or who has loved her for so long will get to see all of those pieces, to see this vulnerable and very beautiful and sometimes intense side that they may not have seen before.\"\n\nIn the book, Moore said she struggled to cope after her marriage to Ashton Kutcher came to end.\n\nThe 56-year-old revealed in her new memoir \u201cInside Out\u201d that her life began crashing down after she and the actor, now 41, decided to split seven years ago.\n\nDEMI MOORE, COURTENEY COX STUN FANS IN INSTAGRAM POST: 'YOU BOTH LOOK LIKE TWINS'\n\n\u201cI lost me,\u201d the actress told television journalist Diane Sawyer on Monday\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI think the thing if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself.\u201d\n\nMoore, who was in pain and isolated from her family, weighed a mere 102 lbs., the outlet revealed. In 2012, the Hollywood star was rushed to the hospital after smoking synthetic marijuana and inhaling nitrous oxide at a party.\n\n\u201cI guess the fundamental question that came forward for me was, \u2018How did I get here?\u2019\u201d Moore admitted to GMA. \u201cFrom where I started to what I\u2019ve experienced, where I\u2019ve been, how did I get here?\u201d\n\nDEMI MOORE PENNING 'A WRENCHINGLY HONEST' MEMOIR THAT DETAILS 'TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIP' WITH MOM, EX-HUSBANDS\n\nMoore\u2019s personal turmoil wasn\u2019t just based on her broken marriage.
