(Warning to the spoiler-averse: I\u2019m about to discuss specific scenes within the game in some detail.)\n\nIts campaign is as dark as a moonless night. It delivers a story that feels plucked from some of our most disturbing headlines. A terrorist attack in Piccadilly Circus and subsequent nighttime SAS raid on a townhouse in the heart of London. A civilian population within an Arab nation targeted for genocide by a mix of Russian military and local extremists, with men, women and children brutally killed by explosions, gas attacks and execution. A chaotic mob attacking a U.S. embassy that\u2019s holding a local hero-cum-war criminal prisoner.\n\nSome levels \u2014 including one experienced from the point of view of a little girl that begins with her trapped under a pile of rubble alongside her dead mother before being pulled to safety by white-helmeted rescuers, only to be caught in a white phosphorous attack and relentlessly pursued by a murderous Russian solder \u2014 are extraordinarily difficult to bear, and do an effective job of communicating the notion that war is atrocious.\n\nWorse still, we can\u2019t always tell who our enemies are. We are ordered to practice strict trigger discipline in order to avoid civilian casualties. That means carefully choosing targets out of a crowd during that Piccadilly attack I mentioned earlier, and holding fire on suspicious targets until they reach for a weapon and become active combatants. It is absolutely the right thing to do, but this morally essential hesitation can \u2014 and frequently did \u2014 cost the lives of both the soldiers whose boots I stepped into and their comrades.\n\nModern Warfare also allows for some level of moral agency, as in a scene in which a brutal warlord is being tortured by Western soldiers using his family as leverage. You can choose to participate or wait outside the room. It\u2019s not so blunt as to prompt us with a decision. I discovered that I could opt out simply because I knew what was about to happen, felt strongly opposed to witnessing it, and refused to go in, which eventually queued the scene to play out behind closed doors, leaving me to ponder whether the side I was on was any better than the one I was fighting.\n\nThe message is clear: War is both terrible and terrifying.\n\nAnd yet Modern Warfare also appeals to our human craving for visceral thrills. For every scene of horror and revulsion, there\u2019s another designed to make us revel in the excitement of battle and of exacting revenge on those we are disposed to see as evil. It glorifies combat, makes guns and military technology feel marvellous, and presents it all in a finely tuned and play-tested package that left me feeling powerful and privileged.\n\nHence, the whole duality of man thing. As I worked my way through the five-hour campaign in a single marathon session, I flip-flopped between feeling repulsed and despairing over the awful ravages of war and being an almost giddy participant in battle.\n\nI suspect this is exactly what Infinity Ward\u2019s gamesmiths intended, so bravo to them for succeeding. And it\u2019s a message worth absorbing. Achieving an awareness of our own conflicting emotions and motivations as human beings is a good place to begin understanding who we are, and to consciously resist our baser urges.\n\nThat said, this message is undercut to a degree by multiplayer, the place where the majority of players will spend the vast bulk of their time. Online play utterly abandons any pretence of war authenticity in favour of lightning fast, throw-caution-to-the-wind combat. It\u2019s a pure and unapologetic rush of adrenaline.\n\nNow, before piling up on me for putting down multiplayer fragfests, know this: Modern Warfare\u2019s online play is top shelf. The interface is as slick and intuitive as ever, and its plethora of maps and modes \u2014 including a game type called Ground War that offers large scale battles complete with vehicles \u2014 are excitingly well balanced. It\u2019s loaded with growth and customization features, and adds some terrific new mechanics, such as a hyper authentic night vision mode and the ability to mount weapons on solid surfaces for improved accuracy and additional cover.\n\nPlus, a brand new cooperative game type dubbed Special Ops delivers sharp and challenging team-versus-AI battles that force players to work together as they strive to accomplish a series of objectives. It\u2019s a nice change of pace from the series\u2019 traditional zombies cooperative modes.\n\nThere are many reasons why Call of Duty remains so popular among fans of online military shooters, and they\u2019re all on display in this latest iteration. I\u2019m not going to put it down.\n\nI think I just wish Modern Warfare had been broken into two disparate games. It feels like there needs to be more space between its dramatic, contemplative and controversial story and the mostly mindless chaos of online play than a couple of centimetres on the main menu screen.\n\nMy recommendation: Play the campaign, then wait a few days before diving into multiplayer. This might be the best way to avoid cross-contamination and get the most out of these two deeply incongruent gaming experiences.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Infinity Ward's new campaign effectively conveys both the existent horrors and strange exhilaration of war", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cod-mwr-2-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
