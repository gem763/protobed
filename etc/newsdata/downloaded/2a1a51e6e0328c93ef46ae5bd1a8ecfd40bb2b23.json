Instead, the away support at AZ Alkmaar and West Ham directed their ire at Woodward and the Glazer family.\n\nWoodward was instrumental in Solskjaer\u2019s appointment and decided against waiting until the end of the 2018/19 campaign to hand him the job on a full-time basis, making the move in late March instead. After four managers in five years, Woodward can ill-afford to get another one wrong. Least of all when the man in question is a club legend.\n\nSolskjaer's record before and after permanent appointment Interim Permanent\n\nGames: 19 Games: 21\n\nWon: 14 Won: 6\n\nDrawn: 2 Drawn: 6\n\nLost: 3 Lost: 9\n\nGoals for: 40 Goals for: 18\n\nGoals against: 17 Goals against: 23\n\nThat\u2019s why the club remain behind Solskjaer. They do genuinely believe he has made positive, long-term decisions in the last six months that will benefit the side in years to come. They were impressed with his identification of transfer targets and believe he has helped transform that aspect of the club in a such a relatively short space of time.\n\nBut, while Woodward spoke about rebooting the club for the long-term, there is no escaping the present. Solskjaer has spoken about Sunday\u2019s clash against Liverpool as being the \u2018perfect\u2019 chance for his squad to respond to recent setbacks but rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 in the Premier League era have United entered into a game against their arch rivals as such underdogs.\n\nThe tide is yet to turn against Solskjaer and he retains favour with supporters, who in the main would rather watch a diminished side than dismiss a legend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited\u2019s board broadly share the same view but poor results can only be stomached for so long. Solskjaer\u2019s side haven\u2019t won away from home since March and they face four consecutive matches on the road after Sunday\u2019s test against Liverpool.\n\nWoodward is backing Solskjaer \u2013 but results need to improve (Picture: Getty)\n\nIt is hard to see a short-term fix to the club\u2019s problems and Solskjaer is already looking for resolutions in the January transfer market. Club sources have spoken about simply \u2018getting through to January\u2019 before taking stock of the club\u2019s position, so difficult has there start to the season been.\n\nSolskjaer remains absolutely determined to turn things around but he\u2019s under no illusions about the task he faces and recognises his status at the club can only buy him so much time. He maintains he can reverse recent results but sources have told Metro.co.uk that he has \u2018too much respect\u2019 for supporters to put his pride before the club\u2019s best interests.\n\nIt\u2019s why those close to Solskjaer believe he could jump before he\u2019s pushed at Old Trafford and would genuinely consider stepping aside if he felt he was not the best man for the job.\n\nBeyond that is Solskjaer\u2019s acceptance that he was not the club\u2019s first choice to replace Jose Mourinho last December. He was a caretaker, brought in to guide the club through the remainder of the season while they searched for a long-term successor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMauricio Pochettino has long been viewed as that man and it\u2019s not inconceivable to think the Argentine could be available in the not-too-distant future if his troubles at Tottenham persist.\n\nUnited stuck with Louis van Gaal against their better judgement in the winter of 2015 before sacking the Dutchman at the end of the season following an FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace. Mourinho cast a shadow over the Dutchman\u2019s final months at the club and it became an open secret that the Portuguese would take charge once the season had finished.\n\nSolskjaer would not allow such a scenario to play out and would step aside if he no longer retained the full support of the board.\n\nAt this moment in time, the club remain fully behind Solskjaer and are desperate for him to succeed. The last thing they need is to be seen to be sticking the knife into an icon.\n\nThey hope it never comes to that.\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plays down comparisons with Jurgen Klopp\u2019s managerial start at Liverpool", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would consider his own future at Old Trafford if he felt he was damaging the club, sources have told Metro.co.uk.
