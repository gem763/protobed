Despite a citywide curfew, some residents waved Ecuador\u2019s yellow, blue and red flag in public places to mark what appeared to be the end of more than a week of unrest.\n\nConaie said it was also celebrating \u201cvictory,\u201d emphasizing the repeal of the fuel subsidy cuts. But it cautioned on Twitter that \u201cthis is not over until the agreement is fully realized.\u201d\n\n\u2018CONCEDING IS NOT LOSING\u2019\n\nIt was unclear what specifically would be changed with a new law or how soon it would go into effect. But the government is committed to working with indigenous groups to design the new policy, said Peral.\n\nJuan Sebastian Roldan, the presidency secretary, said representatives of the indigenous movement and the government would keep working late on Sunday to draft the new law.\n\n\u201cConceding is not losing,\u201d Roldan said at the end of the talks. \u201cHere we are all conceding.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the highland city of nearly 3 million people resembled a war zone, with armored military vehicles patrolling some streets and sounds resembling explosions and shots ringing out.

He said on Saturday that it would remain in effect until further notice.\n\nMoreno has blamed the unrest on \u201cdark forces\u201d linked to former president Rafael Correa, who is now a fierce critic of his government. Asked for evidence of that, Moreno\u2019s government has pointed to attacks on the comptroller\u2019s office, where documents related to a probe into the misuse of funds under Correa are stored.\n\nCorrea denies meddling and has called Moreno a sellout for turning to the right after being elected on a leftist platform.\n\nWashington and other countries in South America had backed Moreno and condemned the violence.\n\nA group of vandals set fire to the comptroller\u2019s office for a second day in a row on Sunday, the interior minister said, and some 500 people had occupied a banned area in the city.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nIndigenous protesters have also said that extremists from outside its ranks had been trying to instigate clashes, but it has denounced the government\u2019s response as heavy handed.\n\nJaime Vargas, the head of Conaie, said dozens of its members and were still missing and hundreds in jail. \u201cWe don\u2019t want more repression,\u201d said Vargas.", "description": "Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno agreed to swap a law that ended decades-old fuel subsidies for new legislation that will direct more resources to the needy, part of a deal he struck on Sunday with protest leaders to end a spate of violence that has roiled the Andean nation.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440616894&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0FU", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
