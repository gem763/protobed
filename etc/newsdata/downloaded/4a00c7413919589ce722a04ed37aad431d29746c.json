During breaks, guests could lug full jerry cans up and down a reception room to better appreciate the difficulties of those lacking access to clean water.\n\nIt was not your usual bank conference. There was little talk of investments, financial products or tax planning. Indeed, the subject matter was light years away from the lender\u2019s roots as a tony offshoot of a family-owned firm that has been at the center of British horse racing since 1770. And that was partly the point.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want us to be perceived as a sort of leather armchair, old pictures of horses and very much a sort of a bank of yesterday,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Roger Weatherby said in an interview before the Oct. 1 conference. \u201cOur customers -- and particularly the next generation of customers -- will want us to be using our contacts, our profits and our wherewithal to help in whichever way we think is appropriate.\u201d\n\nSuch an approach is increasingly important in the once-staid world of private banking. With automation and consolidation on the rise, curating such events is a useful way for firms like Weatherbys to demonstrate the networking and advisory capabilities that justify their higher fees, while exposing clients to speakers and ideas outside their usual orbits.\n\nRead more: British banking dynasty that\u2019s even older than the Rothschilds\n\nEven as many European private banks are battling shrinking profits and declining inflows, Weatherbys\u2019 assets have continued to grow. Customer deposit balances increased 15% to 816 million pounds ($996 million) last year. Rival C. Hoare & Co. -- which hosts similar forums for customers -- also saw deposits rise, up 8% to 4.4 billion pounds in its latest fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere is often a closer synergy between the owners of private banks and their clients, with the emphasis on the relationship and being a trusted adviser,\u201d said Caroline Burkart, an associate partner at wealth consulting firm Scorpio Partnership.\n\nCreated in 1994, the bank is an offshoot of Weatherbys Ltd., which provides the British Horseracing Authority with its central administration, as well as services like pedigree research to a range of clients. Johnny Weatherby, Roger\u2019s brother, is chairman of the equine firm. There\u2019s also Weatherbys Racing Bank, which offers financial services to those involved in the sport.\n\nGenteel Landowners\n\nThe private bank\u2019s base is diversifying from its traditional clientele of genteel landowners, with professionals, executives and entrepreneurs making up the majority of new customers. The bank\u2019s first Creating the Future conference was held last year and struck a chord with clients. It resulted in two smaller events this year on education and the environment that preceded this week\u2019s gathering. Another targeting those age 20 to 30 is planned for early next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to curate it, but it\u2019s a lot easier if you have a bank with a history of looking after families,\u201d said Mike Dickson, the author of \u201cOur Generous Gene,\u201d who helped Weatherbys organize the conferences. \u201cThey\u2019re much more concerned about issues that are going to affect their family, their children.\u201d\n\nThe bank says such engagement will be good for business -- in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to engage with all our clients, potential clients, introducers and friends on a very different level to that of a transactional banker,\u201d Weatherby said in his opening remarks at the conference. \u201cTransactions can be done by machines.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The besuited millionaires chuckled and shifted nervously in their chairs as the co-founder of climate-change protest group Extinction Rebellion urged them to embrace their radical sides.\u201cConsider getting arrested, seriously,\u201d Gail Bradbrook told about 450 people at a London conference", "authors": ["Tom Metcalf"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x9G4AOvHjxvNoXJevhKkfQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/a6245527fdf4a20c103264c34e0df24f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
