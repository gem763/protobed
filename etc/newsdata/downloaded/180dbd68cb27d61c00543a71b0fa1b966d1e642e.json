The network said it \u201cappears to show the fury of the Turkish attack.\u201d\n\nABC says it relied on an outside source that it would not identify for the material. It gave no immediate explanation Tuesday for how it got through.\n\nThe mistake was first noticed by conservative media, which had suggested ABC was trying to make President Trump look bad.
