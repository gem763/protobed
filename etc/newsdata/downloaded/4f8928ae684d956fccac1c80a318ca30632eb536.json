He also planned to travel to the United States after.\n\nBut he was released by a court on Monday after it emerged the detention was a procedural error and that his bail requirements allowed him to take any overseas trips that had been arranged before his arrest, local news station RTHK reported.\n\nBefore departing Hong Kong, Wong tweeted that his overnight detention was \"wholly unacceptable and unreasonable\".\n\nHe said he planned to meet German politicians from different parties as well as speak at Berlin's Humboldt University. He added he would also call on Germany to halt trade negotiations and arms sales to Hong Kong and China \"until the human rights is put on the agenda\".\n\nHis party said he would also be travelling to the United States and would return in late September, without giving details of his itinerary.\n\nWong began his career as an activist when he was just 12 years old and later became the poster child of the huge pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement\" protests of 2014 that failed to win any concessions from Beijing.\n\nHe has previously been jailed for his involvement in those protests.", "description": "Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong said he was making his way to Germany on Monday after he was released from a brief spell in custody following a mistake in his bail conditions.
