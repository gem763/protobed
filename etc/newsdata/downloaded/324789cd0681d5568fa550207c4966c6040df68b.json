Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe Bronx Democrat and pastor filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for the congressional seat, which spans parts of the Bronx and Queens, and is formally kicking off his campaign today.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile a slew of lesser-known Republicans have already launched campaigns against the progressive firebrand, Cabrera becomes the most prominent local Democrat to take her on.\n\n\u201cOnly a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it\u2019s going to be a moderate Democrat,\u201d Cabrera told POLITICO. \u201cShe\u2019s a no-show in the district. She hasn\u2019t brought about anything except division within the party.\u201d\n\nHe plans to target Ocasio-Cortez for her democratic socialist views, and opposes her \"Green New Deal\" proposal as well as \"Medicare for All.\"\n\n\u201cSocialism doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t want it for my children, for my grandchildren,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Council member said he was first inspired to jump into the race after hearing Ocasio-Cortez rail against Amazon\u2019s planned headquarters in Queens, a plan that was scuttled amid a flood of opposition.\n\n\u201cIt was staggering to me,\u201d he said of her attacks on the $3 billion in tax breaks and subsidies the project was set to receive \u2014 most of which any company could have received on an as-of-right basis. \u201cWe have somebody who literally dismantled the possibility of us having 25,000 jobs, and she has yet to bring any jobs into the district.\u201d\n\nCabrera has courted controversy in the past for his views on gay rights, which are sure to be a flash point in the primary battle. A video surfaced five years ago of him in Uganda praising the policies of the country\u2019s government, which imposed draconian penalties on homosexuality. He also appeared on the radio show of the Family Research Council, which has been labeled a hate group.\n\nCabrera said he has voted for every piece of legislation pushed by the LGBT caucus during his tenure on the Council.\n\n\u201cThere are people who want to demonize me because that puts a cloud over my accomplishments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my track record ... I\u2019ve been supportive every step of the way.\u201d\n\nLike several of Ocasio-Cortez's Republican challengers, Cabrera lives outside the congressional district.\n\nThe Council member has close ties to the Bronx Democratic party, and hopes to court their support.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see the party ever endorsing her, because her and the Justice Democrats are running people against everybody in the Democratic party,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t play well with local officials,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ll all tell you exactly the same thing: We can\u2019t work with her, she\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment.", "description": "He said he was inspired to jump into the race after hearing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rail against Amazon\u2019s planned headquarters in Queens.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/81/5a/8798dfab4f3c8c3c9027df4174e0/proxy-2-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
