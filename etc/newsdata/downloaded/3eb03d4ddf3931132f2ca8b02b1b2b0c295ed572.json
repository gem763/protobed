(AP) \u2014 Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa left in the first half against Tennessee with an ankle injury.\n\nTagovailoa walked off the field and was taken to the sideline medical tent during the second quarter Saturday night. The 2018 Heisman Trophy runner-up then was escorted to the locker room while Mac Jones took his place and started the second half.\n\nESPN reported that he was not expected to return to the game. Tennessee quarterback Brian Maurer also was hurt in the first half.\n\nCrimson Tide coach Nick Saban told ESPN Tagovailoa twisted an ankle and that he wasn't sure of the quarterback's status for the second half.\n\nTagovailoa called a timeout just before the play clock ran out after a sack and walked to the sideline.\n\nHe was 11 of 12 for 155 before the injury. Tagovailoa did throw an interception on first-and-goal from the 2 when he tried to force the ball while scrambling.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
