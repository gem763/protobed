In recent days, travelers on the \u201cmystical fjords\u201d voyage in Europe have staged (and live tweeted) a veritable mutiny after inclement weather forced repeated changes to their itinerary and trapped them at sea.\n\nThe ship, called Norwegian Spirit, departed from Southampton, England, recently for a 14-day voyage with planned stops in the Netherlands, Norway and Iceland. But those plans were scuttled by bad weather, forcing the ship to plan new stops \u2014 some of which were then also canceled because of the weather. Passengers said they were stuck at sea for three days.\n\nBy Monday, a fed-up \u2014 and social media-savvy \u2014 group of passengers rallied in the ship\u2019s atrium to vent their outrage at the crew, demand a refund from the company and post images and video of their revolt on newly created Twitter and YouTube accounts. They described the scene as a \u201criot\u201d and \u201copen rebellion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuddy, you\u2019re not a manager, we want the head \u2014 who is driving the boat?\u201d a passenger in one video asked a uniformed crew member, who stood flanked by security personnel in a crowd of angry vacationers. Nearby, a woman screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing right now is you\u2019re not helping the situation, you\u2019re getting people amped up,\u201d the passenger said to the crew member. Later, looking into the camera, the passenger said: \u201cNothing on this itinerary is the same. Nothing is the same. Not one thing.\u201d\n\nPassengers shared grim images of their trip on Twitter, including video and pictures of toilets that did not flush, a picture of a uniformed crew member in a scrum of angry passengers grabbing one of them by the wrist, and a receipt for a $79 tour of the ship that included a visit to the laundry room.\n\n\u201cAfter three days floating around the Atlantic the bathrooms are backing up, not flushing, and out of order today on Norwegian Spirit,\u201d one protester, Cody McNutt, wrote on a Twitter account he started to share updates from the protests. He said it \u201csmelled like sewage in public areas on the ship.\u201d\n\nMcNutt wrote that the ship was scheduled to dock in Southampton on Friday but that he had gotten off at an earlier port.\n\n\u201cMany passengers got off the ship when it stopped after 3 days stuck floating the ocean, fearing for their safety and health,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnother video showed crew members retreating up a staircase to escape dozens of angry passengers in the ship\u2019s atrium, many of whom could be seen holding their phones over their heads to record the mayhem. The man being booed was the captain, the passengers said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be on this ship!\u201d one man yelled, as the crew members clambered up the stairs. Another man agreed, yelling, \u201cWe want off the ship!\u201d\n\nIn another video, passengers at a reception desk can be seen angrily reacting to staff members who advised them to call the cruise line\u2019s Miami headquarters for information.\n\nAgain, many of the passengers can be seen recording the scene with their phones. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we got this fancy new phone here for our trip,\u201d a woman quipped.\n\nA representative for Norwegian Cruise Line declined on Thursday to provide a day-by-day breakdown of events on the ship or to provide its original and modified itineraries. In a statement, the company pleaded for calm.\n\n\u201cWe understand that it is disheartening when we are unable to call on ports that our guests have been looking forward to visiting,\u201d the company said. \u201cHowever, we do ask for our guests\u2019 patience, cooperation and understanding that severe weather conditions are an act of God and cannot be controlled, influenced or remediated by the cruise line.\u201d\n\nA spokesman said that the itinerary was changed because of \u201csevere weather conditions\u201d and that the company had offered its passengers 25% off the cost of a future cruise.\n\nBut on social media, the protesters said that offer was not enough.\n\nThey held up signs in the ship\u2019s atrium and chanted: \u201cRefund! Refund! Refund!\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "It is not clear if the rebellion was sparked by the clogged toilets or the canceled visit to Scotland, but passengers on the Norwegian Cruise Line ship had had enough.
