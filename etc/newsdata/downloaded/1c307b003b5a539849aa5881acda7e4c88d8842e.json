And though the raiders were eventually turned back, the idea of shareholder value proved harder to dispel. To ward off hostile takeovers, boards started firing CEOs who didn\u2019t deliver near-term stock-price gains. The rolling of a few big heads\u2014including General Motors\u2019 Robert Stempel in 1992 and IBM\u2019s John Akers in 1993\u2014drove home the point to CEOs: They had better start thinking about shareholder value.\n\nIf their conversion to the enemy faith was at first grudging, CEOs soon found a reason to love it. One of the main tenets of shareholder value is that managers\u2019 interests should be aligned with shareholders\u2019 interests. To accomplish this goal, boards began granting CEOs large blocks of company stock and stock options.\n\nThe shift in compensation was intended to encourage CEOs to maximize returns for shareholders. In practice, something else happened. The rise of stock incentives coincided with a loosening of SEC rules governing stock buybacks. Three times before (in 1967, \u201970, and \u201973), the agency had considered such a rule change, and each time it had deemed the dangers of insider \u201cmarket manipulation\u201d too great. It relented just before CEOs began acquiring ever greater portfolios of their own corporate stock, making such manipulation that much more tantalizing.\n\nToo tantalizing for CEOs to resist. Today, the abuse of stock buybacks is so widespread that naming abusers is a bit like singling out snowflakes for ruining the driveway. But somebody needs to be called out.\n\nSo take Craig Menear, the chairman and CEO of Home Depot. On a conference call with investors in February 2018, he and his team mentioned their \u201cplan to repurchase approximately $4 billion of outstanding shares during the year.\u201d The next day, he sold 113,687 shares, netting $18 million.* The following day, he was granted 38,689 new shares, and promptly unloaded 24,286 shares for a profit of $4.5 million. Though Menear\u2019s stated compensation in SEC filings was $11.4 million for 2018, stock sales helped him earn an additional $30 million for the year.\n\nBy contrast, the median worker pay at Home Depot is $23,000 a year. If the money spent on buybacks had been used to boost salaries, the Roosevelt Institute and the National Employment Law Project calculated, each worker would have made an additional $18,000 a year. But buybacks are more than just unfair. They\u2019re myopic. Amazon (which hasn\u2019t repurchased a share in seven years) is presently making the sort of investments in people, technology, and products that could eventually make Home Depot irrelevant. When that happens, Home Depot will probably wish it hadn\u2019t spent all those billions to buy back 35 percent of its shares. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a mature company, when everything seems to be going smoothly, that\u2019s the exact moment you need to start worrying Jeff Bezos is going to start eating your lunch,\u201d the shareholder activist Nell Minow told me.", "description": "American corporations are spending trillions of dollars to repurchase their own stock.
