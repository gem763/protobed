And while gamers have been able to take the reigns on Ketchum\u2019s life in the past, training pok\u00e9mon however they\u2019d like on GameBoys of every generation in a quest to win the game and beat the Final Four, the television-version of the forever 10-year-old protagonist had always seen him stumble.\n\nCrashing out in the final 16 in his first effort at the competition, Ketchum\u2019s journey saw him reach the Top 8 three times and even reach the final once, but he was never able to clinch it, that is until the last episode of \u2018Pok\u00e9mon Sun And Moon\u2019 went live.\n\nWow, it only took 22 years for Ash to win the Pokemon League. \u2014 Jane (@JaneLednovich) September 15, 2019\n\nAsh Ketchum has been a part of millions of lives & while many stop watching the Pok\u00e9mon anime Ash continued to be a role model trainer for new generations. He's lost every Pok\u00e9mon League to teach children it's ok to lose & today he finally won. What a day to be a Pok\u00e9mon fan \ud83d\ude42 pic.twitter.com/Gzbf9j08N9 \u2014 Aero (@ActualAero) September 15, 2019\n\nIt took Ash Ketchum 20 years and countless series to win the Pok\u00e9mon league but he finally did it. Never stop chasing your dreams! Never give up!

Congratulations, Pok\u00e9mon League Champion Ash Ketchum. pic.twitter.com/n0WmRXhDep \u2014 TSF EV (@Alpha_Eevee) September 15, 2019\n\nFinally, we have reached the valuable ending point of a journey that took literal decades. Nevermind that the pok\u00e9mon are now called things like iPhonemon (looks like an iPhone) and Parachutemon (looks like a parachute). What matters is that Ash finally made it. All he had to do was keep trying (and save the world a handful of times, whatever). Here\u2019s to a true champion (and wonderful, lengthy storytelling).", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-16-at-11.16.05-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
