They\u2019re going to be trying to figure out what happened, how it happened.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018And I think in that way, LaKeisha continues to live on, even with me not being there.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued to Entertainment Weekly: \u2018Tommy [Joeseph Sikora] definitely will be trying to get to the bottom of it. I think she\u2019ll still be in front of mind for a lot of people.\u2019\n\nYikes.\n\nLa La added that she \u2018wasn\u2019t as surprised as you think\u2019 about Tasha firing the gun, saying: \u2018The only other logical person outside of maybe Ghost would be Tasha, and it goes back really to the demise of their entire friendship.\n\n\u2018So many people who watch the show say they can relate to that, someone you\u2019ve been friends with your whole life and suddenly something happens and you fall out and can never recover from that.\u2019\n\nJudging by the preview for the next episode, Tommy is going to take justice into his own hands.\n\nIn the teaser clip, it looks like the gangster believes that James St Patrick (Omari Hardwick) is behind LaKeisha\u2019s death as payback for killing his bit-on-the-side Angela Valdez (Lela Loren) and utters a stern word of warning.\n\nAre we finally going to see the end of Ghost?\n\nPower airs Sundays on Starz in the US and with the latest episodes dropping on Netflix on Monday in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
