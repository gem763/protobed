However, it doesn\u2019t stop there \u2013 we\u2019ve had several death threats too.\u201d\n\nIt is believed that Jordan\u2019s 3,000-word resignation letter claims that several parties representing Russian interests lobbied against the investigation\u2019s broadcast which was scheduled for late summer.\n\nBut it is unclear why the broadcast was dropped. Al Jazeera declined to comment.\n\nThe decision comes at a sensitive time.\n\nAlthough the Qatar government funds the broadcaster it insists it \u201cexerts no editorial influence of control\u201d.\n\nThe broadcaster\u2019s enemies allege this is not the case and want Al Jazeera to be registered as a foreign agent with the US Justice department. This would see it branded as a propaganda arm, similar to Russia Today, something that would undermine its reputation for independent journalism.\n\nIt is understood that senior Al Jazeera executives had concerns about A Fishy Business due to the nature of its subject. Hacked emails relating to the black propaganda campaign turned out to be fabricated making it difficult to establish the truth of who was behind it, its motivations and intentions. The Observer publishes its own investigation into the affair on Sunday.", "description": "In a fog of accusations, fake emails and death threats, the decision has prompted questions about broadcaster\u2019s independence", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5789459fbe49cd3e3fd81344b788aa1693dc248c/0_75_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=152062670be753f5a466a30d6f5b363a", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
