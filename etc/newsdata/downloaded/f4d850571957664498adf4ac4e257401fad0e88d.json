Asked whether the two sides might be able to reach a handshake deal by Thanksgiving, Neal replied: \"I would like to think that, but I think that even based on what we discussed here today ... that there's still a ways to go.\"\n\nLighthizer is scheduled to meet with the group again on Friday morning to keep pushing toward a deal, Neal said.\n\nPelosi, who met briefly with the working group on Wednesday, added that Democrats are \"not there yet because we don't have the enforceability assurance that we need to have.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, Republicans and business groups have increased pressure to have USMCA put to a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they\u2019ll be able to get a deal done this year despite the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi also dismissed President Donald Trump and Republican leaders\u2019 claims that the impeachment inquiry is stopping Congress from getting work done.\n\n\u201cThe people who are saying that don't know what they're talking about or have a different agenda that they want to present,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\nNeal also praised Pelosi for saying \"from Day 1\" that she wants to show Democrats can still govern even as the impeachment investigations proceed. The trade deal, he noted, \"is one of the best vehicles\" for proving that Democrats can do both.\n\nAnd even though some concerns remain, the Massachusetts Democrat said the \"one truth\" in place is that \"what we have already done is better than what NAFTA represents at the moment.\"\n\n\"That is not in dispute,\" Neal said. \"The question is can we move it along even more, and I think we can.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/fb/fb9caf334a80868b734b25646832/191017-nancy-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
