But in that case, now retired justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court\u2019s four liberals to form a majority. Since then, President Trump has added two new justices who were enthusiastically supported by antiabortion groups.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe court could uphold or overturn that 2016 precedent or distinguish it in a way that a restriction deemed unconstitutional in one state is allowed in another.\n\nIt was not a surprise the court accepted the case. Last February, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court\u2019s liberals entered a stay that kept the law from going into effect.\n\nThe court\u2019s 2016 decision in the Texas case said the admitting-privileges requirement \u201cprovides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \u2018undue burden\u2019 on their constitutional right to do so.\u201d\n\nRoberts forms majority to keep Louisiana law from doing into effect\n\nHospitalization after an abortion is rare, all sides agree, and the lack of admitting privileges by the doctor who performed the procedure is not a bar to the woman getting needed medical care. Roberts was one of the dissenters in the 5 to 3 decision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast fall, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the Louisiana law in a 2-to-1 vote, finding factual distinctions between how the restriction played out in Texas and Louisiana. The full court, considered one of the most conservative of the regional appeals courts, voted not to reconsider the panel\u2019s decision.\n\nDissenting judges said their colleagues in the majority ignored requirements set out in the 2016 decision and seemed intent on giving the high court reason to reconsider that precedent, called Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt.\n\nJudge Jerry E. Smith, writing for the two-member appeals court majority, said that the court complied with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health by taking a painstakingly close look at the details.\n\n\u201cUnlike in Texas, the [Louisiana law] does not impose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIt seemed unlikely after the chief justice\u2019s action in February that the court would simply dissolve the stay and allow the law to go into effect.\n\nAD", "description": "The 2014 law, which has not gone into effect, requires doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3s-UW3darjOlrmj8C8Qh_CaaMSM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VCIETEEX5YI6PAXE6EDW63LBKI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
