On Tuesday, McDaniels shared his initial thoughts on having receiver Antonio Brown at his disposal.\n\n\u201cAntonio\u2019s been a productive player, obviously, his whole career,\u201d McDaniels told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to defend him numerous times in my time here in New England. [He is] just an overall solid player that has done a lot of good things in our league. I think for us, it\u2019s just how quickly we can get him acclimated to our process and our system and to things we do here and just build trust on the practice field, and then see how it goes and kind of let that determine how we build it from there.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels was asked whether there\u2019s pressure to get someone like Brown involved in the offense early.\n\n\u201c[T]he goal for us is always the same \u2014 have a really good week of preparation, try to make sure our guys know what our plan is and we\u2019ve prepared them as best we can for the opponent, and then go out there and take care of the football and score as many points as we can playing complementary football,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cWe have a lot of good football players on our team and a lot of guys that have roles that they can perform well. We\u2019ve got to go out there and put our guys in good positions to be successful, hopefully, with a really good week of practice. We\u2019ll see how it goes as we go forward, but certainly we\u2019ve always had the same concept in terms of our run game, pass game, our offense in general. We\u2019re going to try to throw it where we\u2019re supposed to throw it and we don\u2019t try to force the ball anywhere or to anybody because that\u2019s not necessarily the way we do it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something the Patriots never will do, not with Tom Brady as quarterback. Brady never will force the ball to any player, no matter how much he makes or what his profile may be. For Brown, who is used to being the focal point of the Pittsburgh passing game, adapting to that will be as challenging as adjusting to the Patriot Way.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad", "description": "Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has a new toy for his offense.
