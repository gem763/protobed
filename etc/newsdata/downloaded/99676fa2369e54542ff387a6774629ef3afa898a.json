The 10-player competitive game has amassed a cult following, and is often breathlessly described as \u201cperfect\u201d to anyone who asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s Killer Queen?\u201d If you aren\u2019t among the lucky few, you may be forgiven for not knowing.\n\nNovelty grants rare objects an aura of specialness or quality. But on October 11, a new, enhanced version of Killer Queen, called Killer Queen Black, will be released for Switch and and on Steam, and it will cease to be so very special. Will its reputation stand the test of ubiquity? I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nKiller Queen Black is one of those delightfully retro-looking games with a fierce competitive bent. It\u2019s cute, mean, and strategically dense. It\u2019s now an 8-player game instead of 10, with each team of four consisting of three \u201cworkers\u201d and one \u201cqueen.\u201d\n\nEach map consists of several platforms, a hive with many holes, berries that fit into those holes, a slow-moving snail, and transformation portals that grant workers specialised abilities like speed or a sword. A team wins in one of three ways: killing the enemy queen three times, stuffing their own hive full of berries, or riding the snail across the map into their goal. While Killer Queen Black loses a player on each side, it adds new maps, abilities and weapons.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pick up and, over time, reveals level after level of depth and nuance. Your learn to spawn-camp enemies to prevent them from gathering too many berries, or to bait out a queen\u2019s attacks while an enemy drags the snail through your team\u2019s goalposts. And if you\u2019re playing as a queen, you need to be constantly thinking about:\n\nwhether to dive down and kill the opposing worker riding the snail,\n\nhow aggressive you want to be in pursuing the enemy queen,\n\nthe safety of your workers,\n\nif you\u2019re going to lose the game for your team by getting killed,\n\net cetera.\n\nAccordingly, a high-level esports scene formed around the arcade game exploiting galaxy-brain strategies with lightning reflexes.\n\nThe beauty of Killer Queen is that every single piece of information is illustrated on-screen. You can see exactly what attack capabilities each warrior-worker has. You can see how many berries the enemy team has collected.\n\nYou can see how far the snail has progressed toward your goal and how many lives your queen has left. A lot of the time, when your team loses, it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t looking at the right thing at the right time and communicating that threat out loud to teammates. This weaves collaboration into the game as a mechanic in its own right.\n\nThis is why playing alone is a little eerie. Cast against the game\u2019s traditional context \u2014 10 drunk people screaming at each other and mashing buttons \u2014 queueing up for a game of Killer Queen Black online by yourself feels a little strange.\n\nYou can coordinate with teammates (voice chat is enabled by default, and certain emotes like \u201csnail\u201d and \u201cgates\u201d help you along), but throughout the pre-release review period when few other humans were online, it was difficult to test the authentic experience of solo online play when most of my teammates were bots.\n\nWith that said, there\u2019s very little anybody could do to muck up Killer Queen\u2019s transcendentally satisfying gameplay loops. It\u2019s always going to be fun to dive down from the top of the map and onto an enemy queen; it\u2019s always going to make you feel very, very happy to sneak the snail through your goalposts after a long, back-and-forth game. And anyway, it\u2019s nice not to hear anyone guffawing after I lose my third queen life to an enemy morningstar.\n\nThe Switch is all about local multiplayer experiences, so I knew I had to try to replicate the Killer Queen arcade vibe at home. (Kotaku did not play the game\u2019s PC version.) I invited over nine friends and grabbed some sparkling seltzer. That way, I could really assess the game the way I fell in love with: with eight people, all yelling at each other in a room.\n\nTo play the game locally with two full, four-person teams, you will need two Switches, each with its own copy of Killer Queen Black. I borrowed my colleague\u2019s console and asked my friends to bring their Joy-Cons and Pro Controllers.\n\nOver the course of two hours, these controllers would connect and disconnect seemingly at random. Once the controllers were finally connected to the Switch, we needed to re-register each controller with the game by hitting the plus or minus buttons. After we corralled the two full teams onto two Switch consoles, the local multiplayer lobby didn\u2019t appear on the second console until we put the two consoles within about two feet of each other.\n\nAfter the immense frustration of troubleshooting this, with the help of a half dozen game design students and alumni familiar with Killer Queen, I poured a couple shots of Mezcal and we decided to play two separate games. Whether going up against AI-controlled bots or a team of players online, it was still a blast aside from some controller lag.\n\nKiller Queen Black BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE SNAIL! SNAIL! SNAIL! TYPE OF GAME Hivemind combat LIKED Low barrier-to-entry with a high skill ceiling, delightful graphics, excellent gameplay loops DISLIKED Technical issues with the Switch DEVELOPER Liquidbit PLATFORMS Switch, Steam RELEASE DATE October 11 PLAYED 5 hours on Switch\n\nI reached out to Killer Queen Black\u2019s developer today to understand what happened here, after playing in the office using a different console and experiencing similar technical issues. Saying that Killer Queen Black is \u201cspecifically designed to play online and it\u2019s best when played in that environment,\u201d a representative of the studio designing Killer Queen\u2019s Switch iteration said that local wireless is mostly intended for tournaments, while online play is \u201cthe main game mode.\u201d (When it came to the controllers connecting and disconnecting and the difficulty of finding the game lobby, the representative suggested that my home might have a \u201chigh noise environment.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s pass\u00e9 to say that the original version of a beloved game is superior to the newer, more accessible one. It\u2019s ungenerous to elide over real explanations for technical issues and, instead, just complain. Killer Queen Black\u2019s release is a celebration of this cherished, impeccably-designed game finally escaping the confines of physical arcade cabinets and entering fans\u2019 homes. And yet, and yet.\n\nAssuming you\u2019re ok with dealing with the frustrations of local multiplayer \u2014 or just plan to play online and don\u2019t care about any of this \u2014 Killer Queen Black is a brilliant ballet of a team-based online competitive game. If you haven\u2019t experienced it yet, you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "description": "Since its 2013 release, the 90 Killer Queen arcade cabinets scattered across the states have become one of those underground sensations in urban gaming circles and among in-the-know indie connoisseurs.
