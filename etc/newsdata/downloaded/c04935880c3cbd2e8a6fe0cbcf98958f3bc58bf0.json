There\u2019s no one else. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nKhaldoon recalls that moment in a new book, \u2018Pep\u2019s City \u2014 the Making of a Superteam\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat evening was a tense and difficult moment but it would spawn thousands of wonderful ones,\" Khaldoon says in the book, according to The Sun .\n\n(Image: PA Wire)\n\n\u201cWhen you set out to do something so difficult and ambitious, the joy and stress go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nCity went on win five of the next six domestic trophies available, claiming the League Cup that season before wrapping up the title in April 2018, then completing an unprecedented league, FA Cup and League Cup treble last season.\n\nAnd City's director of football Txiki Begiristain knows that moment on a tense and anxious day was crucial.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt was the way Khaldoon talked to him that night, he showed how much confidence he had in us.\n\n(Image: The FA Collection)\n\n\u201cIt had been a dreadful day. We\u2019d been the better team but hadn\u2019t got the result and everyone was feeling a little bit shaken.\n\n\u201cKhaldoon told Pep that he knew it wasn\u2019t easy, but he had complete faith in what he was doing.\n\n\u201cHe said that in his eyes there was no other way for the club to proceed. Only his way \u2014 the Guardiola way.\n\n\u201cWas it what Pep needed to hear? Of course. But he said it with such conviction and Pep believed him.\u201d", "description": "After a frustrating season, one 'Pep talk' inspired a record run of 18 matches and two campaigns of dominance", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa Wire", "The Fa Collection"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12568606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-v-Huddersfield-Town-Premier-League-Etihad-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
