Further, Amazon's ability to attract ad spend is likely to continue to overtake e-tail and retail rivals like Walmart and Target that are likewise expanding their ad businesses.\n\nIn The Rise of Amazon Advertising, Business Insider Intelligence examines how and why Amazon's ad business is growing as it diversifies its various ad products across its ecosystem; how Amazon could pose a threat to ad dollars that currently flow to the duopoly, TV, and connected-TV giant Roku; and why Amazon is likely to remain dominant versus retailers expanding their own ad offerings. We also comprehensively lay out Amazon's growing array of ad opportunities across its formats, including display, video, and audio.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: Amazon, Facebook, Google, Procter & Gamble, Roku, Spotify, Target, Twitch, Unilever, Walmart, YouTube.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nAmazon's ad revenue growth is accelerating year-over-year (YoY), but has decelerated in recent quarters, likely as its core display ad products reach maturity. In 2018, the e-commerce giant generated $10.1 billion in ad revenue, up 117% YoY from $4.7 billion. But growth fell from 97% YoY in Q4 2018 to 36% YoY in Q1 2019.\n\nAmazon's ad business will grow overall as it diversifies its ad offerings beyond display ads and across its ecosystem. Amazon's ad strength will continue to come from its unique ability to target millions of consumers with purchase data from the e-commerce platform, but it will increasingly do so across its variety of popular platforms (Amazon.com, mobile app, Twitch, IMDb's Freedive) and devices (Fire TV, Echo).\n\nAmazon will eat into Google's and Facebook's share of the digital ad pie in coming years, but it won't overtake either player in the near to medium term. By 2023, Amazon could take as much as 14% of total US digital ad sales, up from 9% in 2019, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates, based on eMarketer data.\n\nBeyond the duopoly, Amazon could tap the $70 billion TV ad market as it ramps up ad-supported OTT streaming video offerings. Video offerings distributed across its Fire TV devices and elsewhere could enable Amazon to attract bigger brands to premium content, and more quickly scale ad revenue overall as it seeks more sizable payouts.\n\nAmazon is also likely to remain dominant among e-commerce and retail rivals that are expanding their ad businesses, including Walmart and Target. Amazon's dominance of the overall US e-commerce market gives it significant leverage: It accounts for nearly half (47%) of total US e-commerce sales, and 5% of the total US retail market, per eMarketer.\n\nAdvertising on Amazon remains highly valuable among brands that sell products on the e-commerce platform when it comes to driving sales and acquiring new customers.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nExamines and forecasts how Amazon will take US digital ad revenue share from the duopoly through 2023.\n\nIdentifies how and why ad dollars could shift from Google and Facebook, TV, and e-tail and retail rivals.\n\nPresents an in-depth look at how Amazon is diversifying its ad products across its ecosystem, across display, video, and audio formats.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
