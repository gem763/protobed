Nearly three years after her humiliating defeat to President Trump, the two-time loser is the talk of the political world. Everyone wants to know one thing: Will she or won\u2019t she? Even conservative blogger Matt Drudge got in on the act Tuesday, posting a picture of Clinton wearing a witch\u2019s hat with the all-capitals headline: \u201cDem Halloween: Hillary leaves door open.\u201d\n\nJust days before All Hallow\u2019s Eve, Mrs. Clinton is rising from the dead to skulk across the misty moors.\n\nMrs. Clinton and daughter Chelsea were at Revolution Hall in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday hawking their new book when a moderator brought up 2020. \u201cAll that matters is that we win,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, according to KGW8-TV.\n\n\u201cI hate to be so, you know, simplistic about it. We have to nominate the best \u2014\u201d she said. Just then, an audience member interrupted, yelling: \u201cYou!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my. Well, thank you,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said with a smile. But instead of shooting down the notion, she plowed straight into a campaign speech. \u201cI just feel so strongly that, look, I just want to say a little bit more about this, because what\u2019s going on now with the impeachment inquiry is not a choice; it was an obligation under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThis has become an annual ritual. Back in 2018 \u2014 right around Halloween \u2014 Mrs. Clinton was asked, \u201cDo you want to run again?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she replied, prompting laughter. Then she added: \u201cI\u2019d like to be president.\u201d Uh\n\nBut by March she was definitely back out. Now, though, the stories are coming with a furious pace. \u201cAnxious Democratic Establishment Asks, \u2018Is There Anybody Else?\u2019\u201d The New York Times wrote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhen a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in,\u201d the piece said, before offering up former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\u201cDemocrats\u2019 2020 race has a new shadow: Hillary Clinton,\u201d The Associated Press also wrote Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe first woman to win a major party presidential nomination \u2014 and the national popular vote leader with almost 3 million more votes than Trump \u2014 Clinton remains a popular figure in her party, even after enduring criticism for losing key Midwestern states to Trump,\u201d AP wrote.\n\nOn Monday, The New York Times wrote a fawning piece headlined, \u201cHillary Clinton, Master Troll?\u201d The piece included this subheadline: \u201cFreed of the constraints of public office, Mrs. Clinton seems to be living her best life.\u201d\n\nAnd Mrs. Clinton has been out there pitching herself \u2014 as she has been for nearly three years \u2014 with endless book tours and repeated appearances on networks controlled by friendly liberals.\n\n\u201cWe have very admirable candidates vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day there are a lot of forecasters that are saying, \u2018Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he\u2019s not impeached or he\u2019s impeached but not convicted, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard because of all of the advantages he will have,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in Portland.\n\nLast week, Mrs. Clinton went further, saying \u201cmaybe there does need to be a rematch. Obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d referring to her pulling in 3 million more votes than Mr. Trump (although he crushed her in the Electoral College by 304-227).\n\nNot everyone is excited about the prospect of Mrs. Clinton entering the 2020 race. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said Monday in New Hampshire: \u201cWe need to focus on winning this election talking about the urgencies that we have before us.\n\nFormer Trump strategist Steve Bannon, meanwhile, thinks Mrs. Clinton will jump in. \u201cShe is running. She\u2019s just throwing to decide how to fit her way in,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is a very formidable candidate.\u201d\n\nDick Morris, a former longtime adviser to Bill Clinton, also now says Mrs. Clinton is likely running.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a test you can do at home,\u201d Mr. Morris said Sunday on \u201cThe Cats Roundtable\u201d on New York AM 970 radio. \u201cJust put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she\u2019s going to run.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s Halloween, the undead come out to play. And that includes Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe really might have one more life after all.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
