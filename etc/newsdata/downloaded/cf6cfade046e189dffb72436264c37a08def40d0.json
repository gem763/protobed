The Wall Street Journal reported that the facility is already supplying customers at pre-attack levels.\n\nTensions in the Middle East have been running high after the shutdown of oil-processing hubs in Riyadh, leading to the biggest single-day disruption in the crude oil market in its history and a record surge for oil futures.\n\nThe events have increased fears of conflict between Iran and the U.S., with Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that he won\u2019t negotiate with the U.S., which has maintained sanctions against Iranian oil exports since Trump last year pulled out of a pact limiting Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions even though the country was largely in compliance.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wasn\u2019t interested in meeting with Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani in New York on the sidelines an annual United Nations General Assembly later this month after all. Over the weekend, Trump said he was \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d hinting at a possible retaliatory response against Iran. However, the U.S. president has been hesitant to directly hold Iran responsible for the Saudi attacks but has said that evidence from U.S. intelligence agencies, which have been shared with Riyadh, points to the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Middle Eastern drama has temporarily overshadowed the Sino-American trade war, which had weighed on market sentiment and contributed to expectations that the Fed would reduce interest rates to tamp down the chance of an economic slowdown in the U.S.\n\nDiane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW Group, told MarketWatch that the market has been edgy.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s center of gravity turned to geopolitics in the Middle East. I think everybody took a gulp because \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 is a pretty scary term and investors don\u2019t have a lot of company specific information now\u201d, Jaffee said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee is set to deliver an update to monetary policy at 2 p.m. Eastern Wednesday.\n\nOn the data front, U.S. industrial production rose 0.6% in August, the Fed said Tuesday, above the consensus expectation of a 0.4% increase, according to a MarketWatch poll of economists. Capacity utilization increased by 0.4 percentage point to 77.9%, above expectations of 77.6%.\n\nSeparately, the National Association of Home Builders\u2019 monthly confidence index increased one point to 68 in September, matching the highest reading in a year, the trade group said Tuesday.\n\nThe trade group also revised its August figure up by one point to 67.\n\nCheck out: How a cash shortage forced the Fed to stem a surge in rates in a vital area on Wall Street funding\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nWeWork parent The We Co.
