The justices have agreed to take up a Louisiana law that could leave the state with just one clinic.\n\nThe justices won\u2019t hear arguments until the winter. A decision is likely to come by the end of June.\n\nThe high court indicated last February it would take a thorough look at the case when it agreed to block a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe Louisiana law is virtually identical to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. That decision came when Justice Anthony Kennedy was on the bench and before President Donald Trump\u2019s two high court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined the court.", "description": "The proposed Louisiana law would leave the state with just one abortion clinic.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GL406_scotus_ZG_20180622125652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
