And the number one item on our list isn\u2019t more money, prestige or a fancy office.\n\nIt\u2019s flexible hours.\n\n\u201cMore than 60% of individuals say that they would surely not work after age 70\u2026if they did not have flexible work hours,\u201d report researchers from the Rand Corp. in a new survey of older workers. Offering flexible hours was \u201cby far the strongest\u201d factor employers could offer to woo older workers, they found. \u201cWe estimated that the fraction of individuals working after age 70 would be 32.2% if all workers had flexible hours, while the fraction working would be around 17.2% if none had the option.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re talking about a factor of nearly two.\n\nThe findings appear in a new paper issued by the National Bureau of Economic Research, \u201cThe Effects of Job Characteristics on Retirement,\u201d and written by researchers Peter Hudomiet, Andrew Parker, Michael Hurd and Susann Rohwedder of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based Rand Corp. think tank.\n\nThey were based on a survey of 2,177 people age between 50 and 79 conducted between December 2017 and February 2018. The survey was part of RAND\u2019s biweekly, ongoing American Life Panel.\n\nFlexible hours are the key to attracting senior workers for a variety of reasons, the research suggests. Many older workers will have to take care of an older relative or a spouse. They\u2019ll also have rising health needs of their own.\n\nAnd, frankly, one suspects that after decades in the workforce they are pretty much done with the long hours in the cubicle farm anyway.\n\nThe findings come at a critical moment. A surging number of Americans are staying in the labor market after the traditional retirement age and looking for work. The percentage of those over 65 who are either working or looking for work has doubled in the past 35 years, hitting 20% earlier this year. With more and more baby boomers reaching their 60s that\u2019s already more than nine million seniors, according to Pew.\n\nMost experts predict the numbers will keep rising. Many people need to stay in work and keep working to stretch their retirement savings.\n\nMeanwhile, unless a recession is about to strike, employers have good reasons to want to woo them. The job market is so tight right now that companies are looking for productive talent where they can find it. According to the U.S. Labor Department, there are 7.1 million nonfarm job openings nationwide\u2014and only 5.8 million unemployed.", "description": "Hint: It\u2019s not more money", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD709_senior_ZG_20190211095713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
