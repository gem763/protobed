MU, +4.74% and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +6.51% also enjoyed strong gains. The PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +3.07% surged 2.9% to 1,563.66 Thursday. On Wednesday, the index closed up 2.8%, and is up more than 35% for the year. The index is 3.7% off its all-time high hit on July 24.\n\nIn comparison, broader stock indexes were up 1% to 1.5% Thursday. For the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.41% is up nearly 15%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.30% up nearly 19% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.75% is up more than 22%.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya, who has a buy rating on Intel and a $62 price target, supported Intel\u2019s rosy outlook.\n\n\u201cOverall we forecast Intel\u2019s [data center group] to grow 20%+ HoH in 2H19, which is well supported by Intel commentary earlier today as well as our cloud capex tracker that is indicating spending could surge 29% HoH after a weak 1H,\u201d Arya said in a note.\n\nOpinion: Even Intel doesn\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s going to happen with Intel\n\nCiti analyst Christopher Danley, however, had a more mixed view of Intel\u2019s outlook. While cloud sales make up 60% of data-center sales, the other 40% is made up of enterprise sales, which are still sluggish and will likely continue that way \u201cdue to the slowdown in China and the soft global economy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDanley also voiced concern over Intel\u2019s willingness to get into a price war with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +1.78% to combat share loss. Grebe said in his presentation that \u201cfrom a pricing perspective, everything that we do is very, very targeted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about a potential price war, which we believe would be negative for Intel and AMD,\u201d Danley wrote.\n\nFor more: Tech earnings are a test amid tumultuous times, and all the chips are on the table\n\nAMD already displayed a willingness to price war with Nvidia earlier this year after Nvidia released a new line of gaming cards to compete against AMD, and AMD responded by cutting prices of its cards within days.\n\nIn broader comments, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay said he expects a slower-than-expected second half recovery \u201cbarring a broader recovery until a trade resolution is reached.\u201d Ramsay sees a cautious positive read through for AMD and Nvidia with a more mixed outlook for Intel.\n\nOn Thursday, Nvidia shares rallied 6%, while AMD shares were only up 1.5%.", "description": "Chip stocks saw a second big day of gains Thursday as analysts digested Intel Corp.\u2019s forecast of a recovery in cloud spending in the second half of the year.", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ635_amd_vs_ZG_20180925115500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
