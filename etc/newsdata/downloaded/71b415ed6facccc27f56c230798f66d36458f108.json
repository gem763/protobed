Although he has consistently received some of the worst scores from the judges (he got the lowest score of any contestant on Monday\u2019s episode) and lots of mockery on social media for his gaudy outfits, there\u2019s no sign of him being eliminated anytime soon. Each week, the technical scores and viewer votes are combined, and the bottom two couples are placed in jeopardy \u2014 then the judges choose which pair is \u201csaved.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo far, Spicer hasn\u2019t yet been in the bottom two, as singer Mary Wilson and NBA star Lamar Odom have been voted out and NFL star Ray Lewis withdrew due to injury. (No one went home Monday night, which was Disney-themed; producers didn\u2019t want to ruin the mood after so much fun-filled corporate synergy.) The conservative fan base is known to rally around this show (see: Bristol Palin in Season 11) and Spicer is clearly getting a lot of audience votes, with the help of some high-profile endorsements:\n\nVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nNot to mention:\n\nAnd while the judges get the final say in who goes home \u2014 a new twist this season, likely to prevent a beloved-yet-mediocre dancer from winning \u2014 they seem to be warming up to Spicer after an initially cool reception.\n\nAD\n\nThe first week, Arnold described his dance skills as \u201cpre pre-school level,\u201d and the judges looked deeply concerned by his attempt to salsa to the Spice Girls hit \u201cSpice Up Your Life.\u201d Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli, the kinder judges, called it \u201cstrangely entertaining.\u201d Len Goodman, the harshest, simply said, \u201cI admire your courage coming on this show\u201d \u2014 a sign that he found the dance so terrible that he couldn\u2019t muster the energy for a critique. Spicer scored 12 out of 30 points, the second-lowest of anyone except Odom, who scored 11.\n\nAD\n\nAfterward, Spicer implied he was being unfairly maligned because of religion: \u201cClearly those judges aren\u2019t going to be with me. Let\u2019s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won\u2019t be discounted,\" he tweeted. Perhaps realizing this wasn\u2019t the best way to endear himself to the judges, he later deleted the tweet. Instead, he doubled down on the idea of turning the competition into a campaign, urging people to vote for \u201cSpicer/Arnold,\u201d complete with weekly emails to his supporters.\n\nIn Week 2, after a tango, the judges were slightly more encouraging. \u201cI have to admit, it looked like a tango,\u201d Tonioli said, sounding surprised, and Inaba added he was \u201csuper much improved.\u201d Goodman deemed it \u201cbetter than last week.\" In Week 3, things didn\u2019t go as well: Goodman cracked that Spicer\u2019s cha cha to \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d was \u201cmore like Monday night lukewarm,\u201d and Tonioli said it was so bad (\u201ca disaster blockbuster\u201d) that it was almost good. Inaba chose the \u201cA for effort\u201d angle.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re living your best life right now. And you\u2019re having such a great time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have smiled from the moment you started until you finish, no matter what happened in between. I\u2019d like to see you loosen up a little. ... because I don\u2019t know, people seem to love you. So you might be here for a while.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWeek 4 brought relatively mild reviews yet with his paso doble \u2014 even though Spicer got the second-lowest scores again, and the judges thought it wasn\u2019t great, they gave actual technical criticism. Even guest judge Leah Remini got in on the act, saying while Spicer was clearly not a dancer, \u201cYou come out here, you\u2019re committed, and you try your best.\u201d\n\nAnd on Monday night, Week 5, Spicer received the most positive feedback yet, as he and Arnold performed a quickstep to \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me\u201d while dressed as Woody the cowboy from \u201cToy Story.\u201d Spicer choked up during his introductory video as he dedicated the dance to his father, who died of cancer in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nThe judges were pleased with the performance, especially Goodman, who complimented his frame as \u201cpretty good.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get overexcited, because there\u2019s still a ways to go,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cHowever, it was a proper dance. Well done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTonioli echoed similar praise, and Inaba added it was his best dance yet. \u201cYou did a really good job, I\u2019m very proud of you,\u201d she said. \u201cI know this hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d She awarded him a seven (his first of the season), while Goodman and Tonioli gave him sixes \u2014 for a total of 19, the lowest-ranked of the nine remaining dancers.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump tried to fire up the conservative fanbase on Monday with a tweet that encouraged people to vote for Spicer.", "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IFXwRtgBlDFqQ0Orn-ubawi7jYk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2Q2JDXMEOVGJZPK55SQP5P2ZHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
