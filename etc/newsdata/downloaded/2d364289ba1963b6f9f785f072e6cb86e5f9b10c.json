There\u2019s no question about that.\n\nWhat would that look like?\n\nYou would get arguments outside the political class from people like Yuval Levin and hopefully me. Within the political class, people would start paying attention to those arguments. Postwar conservatism was a bookish movement\u2014Richard Weaver\u2019s Ideas Have Consequences and Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman\u2014that evolved into a network of intellectual think tanks like American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, and the Heritage Foundation.\n\nI think we\u2019ll have that again. There will be younger writers and younger politicians, and we\u2019ll have a genuine fight to see what comes next. There are signs of intelligent life in Congress, which knows it has delegated its job to presidents who will not always be progressives.
