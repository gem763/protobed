I couldn't get a debit card, I had to use a cash card.\"\n\nWith just \u00a340 and operating out of a garden shed, Danny started selling watches on eBay to supplement his family's income.\n\nThat was in 2002 and the business has now grown to become Britain's biggest independent retailer of branded watches.\n\nLast year it had a turnover of \u00a312million.\n\nHowever, with Danny's newfound success he was seriously risking his health.\n\nHe worked huge hours and didn't take a single day off for seven years straight.\n\nHis immense work ethic also meant his diet suffered, with him choosing quick and easy takeaway foods to satisfy his hunger.\n\nDanny said: \"I don't remember exactly what I ate but I used to have two steaks for dinner and if a ready meal was for two people, I would eat two of them, so I was eating enough for four.\n\n\"When I went out to eat I didn't care what I ate, I only cared about it being a large portion.\"\n\nHis weight ballooned to 25 stone and Danny had also developed a hobby that was making his eating patterns even more erratic - poker.\n\nHe said: \"I was working 15 hours a day, every day and then playing poker until late into the night.\n\n\"I was a rubbish husband and father because it was all about work or poker.\"\n\nThen, when his wife, Katrina, was desperately struggling with the demands of running the family home, Danny realised he needed to change.\n\nHe quit smoking five years ago but realised his weight was still a massive issue.\n\nHe said: \"I've always done silly diets but as soon as I'd lose the weight I'd put it back on.\n\n\"I started to get liver disease because of my weight and I went on holiday determined to shed some pounds - but ended up putting even more on.\"\n\nThat's when Danny knew he wanted to take drastic action to deal with his weight and decided to have a gastric sleeve fitted to help him shed the pounds.\n\nHe admits he was nervous before the two and a half hour surgery but just an hour after he left the operating theatre, he was back at work.\n\nThe weight began to fall off and Danny also developed a love of the gym.\n\nIt took him six months to drop from 23 stone to just 16. He is now a svelte 14 stone with a medium top and a 34ins waist.\n\nAnd Danny's diet could not be more different. Gone are the takeaways, which have been replaced with a fresh soup for lunch every day.\n\nHe said: \"I eat a lot of fish, I can't eat steak any more or a lot of meat or bread.\"\n\nAlthough it isn't just Danny's waistline that has seen the benefit of his new healthy lifestyle.\n\nHe says he is now a much better father, with his spare time now revolving around his family and not poker.\n\nHe spends more time with his two daughters Eleanor, 15, and 13-year-old Christina, who he named his succesful accessories website, ChrisElli after.\n\nDanny added: \"I'm now home every night with the kids and I have a great relationship with my wife. We go out and do a lot more stuff as a family.\n\n\"I play tennis four times a week and I go to the sauna in the gym evey day at 3.30pm to get away from everything for an hour.\n\n\"It's changed my whole mindset. I've thrown all my old clothes out because I won't be needing them again.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Founder of Watches2U, Danny Toffel, has shed a massive 7.5stone after his workaholic ways and unhealthy lifestyle put his life at risk", "authors": ["Jane Lavender"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547792.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Danny-Toffel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
