Anything's possible,\" the New Jersey musician responded.\n\nKing noted that \"a lot of people are very concerned about the direction of the country,\" with Springsteen agreeing that it's a \"very frightening time\" in America.\n\nCHRISTIAN ROCKER TOBYMAC'S SON DEAD AT 21\n\nCHIP GAINES ADMITS PARENTING MISHAPS AS FATHER OF FIVE\n\n\"The stewardship of the nation has been thrown away to somebody who doesn't have a clue as to what that means.

The famed rock and roller explained at the time why Trump's presidency is \"unforgivable.\"\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201c[He] has no interest in uniting the country and actually has an interest in doing the opposite and dividing us, which he does on an almost daily basis,\" he claimed.\n\n\"That\u2019s simply a crime against humanity, as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s an awful, awful message to send out into the world. You are intentionally trying to disenfranchise a large portion of Americans. That\u2019s unforgivable. These are folks who are invested in denying the idea of a united America and an America for all. It\u2019s a critical moment. It\u2019s a scary moment for any conscientious American, I think.\u201d", "description": "Rock legend Bruce Springsteen took aim at President Trump in a new interview Friday, saying the president doesn't \"grasp\" the meaning of being an American.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Bruce-Springsteen-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
