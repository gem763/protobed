It\u2019s run by Keith Ineson, a retired chaplain who was himself raised in a rural farming community. Growing up gay in a community that prized traditional masculinity, Ineson felt isolated. But he knew that other people bound by the same circumstances must be out there.\n\nLandline, a short documentary from Matt Houghton, features the voices of gay farmers who have called into Ineson\u2019s hotline. In the film\u2019s recorded telephone conversations, gay British farmers share their candid and often shocking experiences. Houghton reconstructs haunting imagery to depict the emotional essence of their stories\u2014half-obscured faces, a foggy landscape, a dark road at night. Many of the farmers describe a life plagued by isolation, secrecy, and shame.\n\n\u201cYou want to scream out what the problem is, but you can\u2019t,\u201d one farmer says in the film. \u201cI\u2019ve got all these feelings of guilt from what I was doing, and feared that I would lose friends, family, my home\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up in a small rural village of West Wales,\u201d a different farmer says. \u201cThere were rules about behavior that was tolerated. There was no such thing as a gay farmer.\u201d\n\nDespite having conducted thorough research on the topic, Houghton told me that he was surprised by what the farmers told him. \u201cThe film hangs totally on the honesty and openness of our contributors,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout their generosity, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of interviewing in my career,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I was often very surprised at how quickly the people I spoke to were willing to talk about some of their most intimate experiences. That was definitely not what I expected. I think a big part of it is that, in some cases, they\u2019d very rarely had the chance to speak freely.\u201d", "description": "In the U.K., many LGBTQ farmers feel isolated and live a life plagued by secrecy and guilt.
