(AP) - The Denver Broncos\u2019 search for their first victory under coach Vic Fangio continues. And their latest loss was yet another gut-punch.\n\nThe Broncos were left shaking their heads, expressing frustration while vowing to turn things around, after a 27-16 loss to Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday that might have been a win if not for a few mistakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, for sure,\u201d linebacker Bradley Chubb said. \u201cIf we just play a game at 100% together, I feel like we would be special. We\u2019re playing as a team for 95% of the time. We\u2019ve just got to make it 100% and it\u2019s going to go in our favor, I feel like.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos hired Fangio to replace Vance Joseph coming off back-to-back losing records for the first time since the 1970s, hoping he could turn things around after transforming Chicago\u2019s defense into one of the league\u2019s best as coordinator the previous four years. They\u2019re 0-3 in their worst start since the 1999 team dropped its first four games. But they could just as easily have a few victories by now.\n\nThe past two games have been particularly rough.\n\nThey lost to Chicago on a 53-yard field goal by Eddy Pineiro as time expired after a second was put back on the clock following a 25-yard reception by Allen Robinson.\n\nAgainst Green Bay (3-0), they kept Rodgers mostly in check after he threw a 40-yard touchdown toss to Marquez Valdes-Scantling on the game\u2019s opening drive and dominated in time of possession 35:34-24:26. But they allowed Joe Flacco to get sacked six times and committed three turnovers, leading to 14 points for the Packers.\n\nA strip-sack by Preston Smith and recovery by Rashan Gary gave the Packers the ball on the Denver 5. Two plays later, Aaron Jones scored from the 7 to make it 17-10.\n\nAnother turnover early in the third led to another touchdown for Green Bay.\n\nJaire Alexander ripped the ball out of Noah Fant\u2019s hands following a short pass for his first career forced fumble and his first recovery. The Packers took over at the Denver 37, leading to a 1-yard touchdown for Jones that boosted the lead to 14.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the turnovers that the Broncos committed. It\u2019s the sacks and takeaways they\u2019re not getting. They have zero through three games - stunning for a defense led by Von Miller and Chubb and designed by Fangio.\n\n\u201cI have to say, this is one of the cleanest games my jersey has ever looked,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI took basically one shot. I hit the ground one time. So I\u2019m ecstatic. I\u2019ve been at this for a long time. To go home with my body feeling this good is a credit to the offensive line, for sure.\u201d\n\nFangio was at a loss to explain it, after coordinating a defense in Chicago that led the league in takeaways and tied for third in sacks last season. With Miller and Chubb leading the way, he figured to get plenty of pressure on the quarterback. But the sacks and takeaways just haven\u2019t come.\n\nThat\u2019s a surprise considering Miller had 14\u00bd sacks last season, giving him 98 since he entered the NFL in 2011, while Chubb registered 12 as a rookie.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the solution?\u201d Fangio said.\n\nTo that, a reporter responded: \u201cYou get paid the big bucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s three games in a row, that\u2019s no good, obviously,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cAnd it is the circumstances of the game to a degree, this game in some ways was similar to our first two. Until we can stop people more decisively and score more points, teams are going to be content playing these types of games.\u201d\n\nMiller said the opportunities were there for him Sunday.\n\n\u201cI can sit here and make all type of excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cI got clean rushes today, that was different from last week and the week before. I got some rushes today, I\u2019ve just got to find a way to get the quarterback on the ground.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Sanders made his frustration clear after being targeted four times and catching two passes for 10 yards. The two-time Pro Bowl receiver was a key figure on Denver\u2019s 2015 Super Bowl championship team. And he\u2019d like to see a few more balls thrown his way.\n\n\u201cTimes are rough around here,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cObviously, the past few years have been tough. We\u2019re trying to get it right. \u2026 Football is still fun. But it\u2019s not so much fun when you\u2019re losing, especially when you prepare as hard as you can. You go out, have four targets and two catches for 10 yards. There\u2019s always next week, so I\u2019m optimistic then.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Denver Broncos' search for their first victory under coach Vic Fangio continues.
