I'm not going to get on the bandwagon of mental health, as important as it is, but I've always had that.\n\n\"You just talk yourself down. You tell yourself you've got nothing to worry about and go out and face the world. \"\n\nAmanda added that appearance is integral to how she combats the anxiety.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe continued: \"I will always wear my eyelashes. I will always be well presented. That's my armour. I've been like that since I was 13 and allowed to wear make-up.\n\n\"I'm riddled with insecurities but I'm from a different era., so I just get on with it.\"\n\nWhen told she looked confident, Amanda replied: \"You just make it work. T*ts and teeth! If I had that in Latin, I'd put it across my door as my motto.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\"I hate walking into rooms on my own. I count my footsteps walking down the street. I constantly take a deep breath.\"\n\nLater, she added: \"Everyone's different and has different traumas and ways of dealing with things. I've gone through some pretty horrific things in my life, particularly over the past ten years.\n\n\"I've had some very dark moments. For me, anxiety is one of life's normal feelings. You have to understand one to understand the other.\n\n\"You have to be happy to be sad. You have to be anxious to be calm.\"\n\nAmanda's been a mainstay on telly screens for the past six weeks as a judge on Britain's Got Talent's spin-off, The Champions. She'll make one more appearance in tomorrow night's final.\n\nOutside of the talent judging gig - for which she's the longest serving female judge in the country - Amanda is Britain's highest paid radio DJ.\n\nShe hosts Heart Breakfast alongside Jamie Theakston, and entertains millions of listeners every morning.", "description": "Amanda's built a hugely impressive career in TV and radio, but suffers from 'exam tummy' every single morning", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20164197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Amanda-Holden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
