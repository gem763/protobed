This was his first start in a proper football match since June, and his first outing in the full white-noise glare of Champions League-issue Real Madrid.\n\nOn the UK TV coverage Glenn Hoddle winced and grimaced and wagged his head, looking as ever like the sad, kindly community support officer in a rain-soaked oilskin who knocks at your door in the middle of the night to tell you your dog has been run over.\n\nFor decadent, deficient Real Madrid the problems start in midfield | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nHoddle thinks Hazard went to Madrid \u201cat the wrong time\u201d. Perhaps he\u2019s right. But then, there is no right time to go Real Madrid, except for that time you look down and discover you\u2019re Cristiano Ronaldo. Otherwise, well, prepare to kneel, prepare to suffer.\n\nAnd so Hazard struggled, stuck out on the right in a team overrun in central midfield. He played like Eden Hazard, just a bit less so. The next day L\u2019\u00c9quipe gave him two out of 10. Mundo Deportivo used the word \u201cinnocuous\u201d.\n\nWatching Hazard in the stadium felt a bit different. He wasn\u2019t terrible. He was the same, upright, scuttling, soft-shoed figure. But for me there was something else, a pall of sadness in seeing him out in all that space, exposed to that unblinking glare. Not to mention a sense of shared nostalgia, a lost intimacy that is no less poignant or tender for the fact it only ever existed inside my head and isn\u2019t real.\n\nThese are small details. For seven years Hazard was a genuine treat to watch in England. The press box at Stamford Bridge is low down and close to the pitch. You didn\u2019t need to look up to know Hazard had just taken the ball, the only player on the pitch whose touch was completely silent but for a slight shift of air, a whisper around the stands.\n\nHe was unusual in other ways. His brilliance came reluctantly. If this sounds like Hazard is soft, then the opposite is true. He was a driving force at the sharp end of two title-winning seasons. At times he played at a pitch beyond any other footballer in England, even the ones who won more and scored more. At others he meandered, a footballer whose own father had wondered if he might just be too nice and too normal to make it as a relentlessly high functioning machine-athlete.\n\nThere was something else too, a quality of pathos. He is an oddly affecting figure. Watch him long enough and you could see \u2013 or imagine you could see, which is almost the same thing \u2013 the things this process took out of him, the way he was feeling. It became natural to think of Hazard as some vision of sporting perfection menaced by pitfalls and dangers. Although this might be because his name is literally the word for a vision of perfection, followed by a word that means pitfall or danger.\n\nAnd yes, reporting on sport can do strange things to you. I\u2019m not proud.\n\nYou stare at these people so intently, trying not just to understand what they\u2019re doing, but to second guess it, to drape it in meaning. It becomes all too easy to invest theory and spiralling trains of thought in people who are often quite simple, and who would look at you strangely if you tried to explain your \u2013 wait, no \u2013 quite complex ideas about exactly why this thing is happening and not that thing; that you\u2019re not just investing this with an assumed and, arguably, quite creepy sense of intimacy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard finds his way past PSG\u2019s \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda on Wednesday, but his first start for Real Madrid was a night to forget for the Belgian.

That I could, for example, have had a really good talk with him on Wednesday night during that break in play where he walked across to the touchline at 1-0 down and stood slightly away from his teammates looking lost. I could have said, look, it\u2019s a bit like that time where you were playing out of, and when Jos\u00e9 said, and the injury meant, and the other team did.\n\nHe\u2019d laugh and roll his eyes and we\u2019d stand in companionable silence. Then he\u2019d go back out and start playing a bit better. At the final whistle he\u2019d wave up as he walked off and something would pass between us, information, understanding.\n\nReal Madrid relieved to hold on for nervy win after Levante fightback Read more\n\nLook, I\u2019m OK if it doesn\u2019t happen like that. Either way is good. It\u2019s fine.\n\nBut there are some things I\u2019d tell him. First, I\u2019d point out that the model he\u2019s entered is in the process of failing. This version of elite football has prostrated itself before an unsustainable notion of individualism and star power. The dynamic has been distorted, made to look idiotic and confused by the presence of a pair of outsize, freakish talents, one of whom used to wear that same No 7 shirt. It is a hunger that has yet to run its course, at a club that will continue to eat its stars.\n\nThen I would tell him that although he\u2019s a wonderful player this doesn\u2019t mean he has to be that kind of wonderful player, whiting out the screen with his relentless, repeatable brilliance. You don\u2019t have to be an obsessive, robot-level goal-lunatic to work here \u2013 but it helps!\n\nHazard is a more elusive talent, a less linear definition of value. It might well work out for him. The parts might still fit. But this is the real power of elite sport, the reason it still creates that strange, irresistible fascination. Failure, discomfort, struggle: these are often the most involving parts of the process. Fly, Eden. Get fit. Play inside a bit more. Most of all remain, whatever the pressure, your intermittently luminous self.", "description": "The former Chelsea player has the skill and the attitude to succeed at the Bernab\u00e9u even if the club is still a little infatuated with the former owner of the No 7 shirt", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f466d53bad716f3e7c1c6c7a71a19c9eb4ac85/0_0_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e14dbc502cf5d4f0867d2b2f0aa09e11", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
