The former model has refused to deny reports of an affair with the now prime minister.\n\nLast year, the government awarded Hacker House a \u00a3100,000 grant to help it develop technology to train people in cyber security. In doing so, it waived a condition saying that grants should not exceed half the company's annual income.\n\nMs Morgan faced a lengthy grilling on the issue by the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee.\n\nAsked why the government had given money to Hacker House despite the company appearing to have no real income, she said: \"Often start-up companies don't...We all have constituents and others who have set up incorporated companies on an absolute shoe-string and have very little or almost no income in the first year.\"\n\nMs Arcuri has claimed that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport approached her directly to ask her to apply for the funding.\n\nAsked whether this was correct, Ms Morgan said: \"Obviously I wasn't a minister at the time...but it wouldn't surprise me because we listen to what people are saying in terms of the development of funding for a whole host of different parts of the department.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I doubt very much there is any reference to the prime minister.\"\n\nMs Morgan said the government's investigation was expected to published before the end of October.\n\nThe London Assembly is also looking into whether there was any conflict of interest in Mr Johnson's dealings with Ms Arcuri.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However, the Assembly also has an important role and special powers. We will consider using those powers immediately following the conclusion of the IOPC\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cSubject to that important review by the IOPC, certain people should be on notice that the Assembly may well be knocking on their door sometime soon.\u201d\n\nA third inquiry, commissioned by current London mayor Sadiq Khan, has been scaled back, also after a request from the IOPC.\n\nMr Khan had asked Kathryn Robinson, a London Fire Bridge lawyer, to look into the decision by London & Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to give \u00a311,500 to Ms Arcuri in sponsorship and invite her on overseas trade missions with Mr Johnson.\n\nBut Ms Robinson will now only review current L&P processes and will not assess any decisions made during Mr Johnson's time as mayor.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Khan said: \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s office has agreed with Kathryn Robinson that she will look into the processes currently in place at London & Partners and the Greater London Authority\u2019s involvement in them, to see if they need to be strengthened. This review will begin shortly, irrespective of the IOPC\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cThe IOPC has informed GLA officers that they are concerned that unless the review is limited to current processes, there is a risk it could prejudice the work they are undertaking. Following completion of the IOPC\u2019s processes, the review by Kathryn Robinson and the GLA oversight committee\u2019s investigation, the mayor will consider whether any further steps are required.\u201d", "description": "Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has defended the government's decision to award a\u00a0grant to an entrepreneur with close links to Boris Johnson, as an investigation into the prime minister was paused at the request of a police watchdog.", "authors": ["Benjamin Kentish"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/16/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
