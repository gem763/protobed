Friday's market hinged on \"NABAF,\" Cramer's new acronym for \"not as bad as feared.\" The \"not as bad as feared\" theme played out at United Rentals Inc. (URI) , which Cramer details in his Real Money column here.\n\nLet's check out the charts of this rental company that services customers that includes construction and industrial companies, utilities and even homeowners.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of URI, below, we can see that prices have traded sideways the past 12 months. Prices have recently rallied above the rising 200-day moving average line and the bottoming 50-day moving average line.\n\nDespite the sideways price movement the daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been improving from late August and just moved above the September high. A rising OBV line only happens when buyers of a stock have been more aggressive with trading more shares of stock when the stock closes higher.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing above the zero line now for a fresh go long signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of URI, below, we can see that prices are moving above the bottoming 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been steady but also slightly higher than its November low.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is just slightly below the zero line so we could soon cross the zero line for a buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of URI, below, we can see a potential longer-term price target of $178.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The charts of URI tell a bullish story. Traders could do some buying at current levels and get more aggressive above $140. The $180 area is our price target. Risk below $119 for now.", "description": "United Rentals Stock: Buyers Are Looking Several Months Ahead...URI", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "United Rentals Stock", "Buyers Are Looking Several Months Ahead", "The 'Not As Bad As Feared' Theme Played Out With Uri This Week.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/ab1c7dbd-a8c7-11e9-ad16-d7dd71de3f3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
