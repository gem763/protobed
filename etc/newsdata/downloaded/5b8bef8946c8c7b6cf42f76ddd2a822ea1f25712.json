(At that time, the Sorority also included pHoenix Pagliacci.) They released their first studio album, Pledge, in 2018, and member Haviah Mighty won the 2019 Polaris Music Prize in September for her solo work.\n\nWhile the Sorority's last shows are coming up in November in Vancouver, Victoria, Cumberland, B.C., Ottawa and Toronto, they ended their Instagram post with a reassuring call to sisterhood: \"We'll continue to uplift support and love each other down this new path. Bonds like this never break. See you on the road.
