In a case of remarkable synchronicity, both women are three months pregnant with their second children.\n\nIf that still doesn't ring any bells \u2014 and their brand name Life Of Mummies isn't familiar \u2014 the chances are you've had a YouTube clip of theirs forwarded to you by an amused friend, or been regaled with tales of their nappy mishaps or bedtime woes by a daughter or granddaughter with children.\n\nFor these women are two of the most influential mothers in Britain today.\n\nHolly Gee (left) and Sophie Taylor (right) created the Life Of Mummies blog two years ago and now have 17,000 Instagram followers\n\nThey're members of a growing band of online role models who have become the first port of call for advice and companionship in those bewildering early days of parenthood by writing about their own experiences with sisterly honesty \u2014 while also making motherhood a profitable business in the process.\n\nFriends Holly and Sophie, who joined forces to launch their blog Life Of Mummies two years ago, are already so successful they are considering leaving their day jobs (Holly works in beauty while Sophie is a music manager) to become full-time mum bloggers.\n\nIt sounds counter- intuitive that the role of stay-at-home mother could be potentially more lucrative than a regular career. But the rewards can be rich.\n\nThe world's top-earning mum blog is an American site, WhatsUpMoms, which a study by website OnBuy estimated can make \u00a389,333 in a busy month, from advertising and brand partnerships.\n\nOur version of this booming industry is far more down-to-earth in content, but can be just as profitable, with the most successful UK mum bloggers now earning six-figure sums for passing on parenting titbits that women would once have gleaned from a chat at the school gate.\n\n(Holly and Sophie's first ever post was the hilarious account of an outing with a newborn baby and no spare nappy, which any mother will appreciate was not at all funny at the time.)\n\nOne of the most successful British mummy bloggers, Louise Pentland's company A Sprinkle of Glitter was worth \u00a3576,000 last year, according to Companies House. Anna Saccone Joly who posts as The Saccone Jolys, is reportedly worth \u00a31.4 million.\n\nIt sounds like an enviable lifestyle for the lucky few who make it work \u2014 when blogger Candice Brathwaite's second child RJ was born 18 months ago, she says she 'didn't have to pay for a thing for him, because brands sent everything we needed, as gifts. That will never cease to take my breath away'.\n\nAnd juggling childcare and work is certainly easier.\n\nThe mothers are now recognised in the supermarket \u2014 and want to give up their day jobs in music management and PR to work full-time on Life Of Mummies\n\n'What women who blog about being parents have done is use the internet to get the balance we want,' says Molly Gunn, a former journalist who built up her blog Selfish Mother in the wake of the 'discombobulating' experience of becoming a mother.\n\nThe big brands pay hand over fist for mummy bloggers' endorsements \u2014 regularly over \u00a31,000 for a single mention, bloggers have admitted.\n\nLittle wonder then, that, all in all, the online 'influencing' industry is forecast to be worth at least \u00a38 billion globally next year and that mum bloggers are crucial players within it.\n\nBrands realise their power \u2014 beauty giant Est\u00e9e Lauder now spends 75 per cent of its marketing budget on influencers as they are more effective than traditional advertising.\n\nThese women are aware, of course, that they are a marketable commodity \u2014 one post from them can make a product sell out. But their reliability and authenticity \u2014 key selling points of their blogs \u2014 also make them a welcome source of advice or just solidarity.\n\nThey sound just like the average woman \u2014 so why wouldn't you take their advice when it comes to buying clothes or booking holidays?\n\nAs Anna Whitehouse, who has nearly 300,000 Instagram followers and is better known by her blog name Mother Pukka, explains: 'Brands are now aware that customers want to see reality, so they're not buying into fantasy but moving towards real people in their campaigns.'\n\nTaboo subjects, previously only shared with one's closest friends \u2014 if at all \u2014 like the reality of sex after giving birth, the misery of the perimenopause, or the at times frustrating monotony of childcare are now broadcast to the world, gaining bloggers more valuable followers.\n\nIt's caused a significant societal shift: normal women have followed suit and will now publicly air even the most intimate of anxieties.\n\nSuch openness may have many positive effects, but it's also true some find this readiness to emote disconcerting \u2014 especially when it comes to sharing every detail of one's private life.\n\nThere's an element of show and tell. Toddler's nappy exploded? Teenager being moody? Husband forgot to put the bins out again? No matter \u2014 it's all material for your online audience.\n\nAnna has recently had a change of heart about sharing \u2014 and not just out of a need for privacy, but also because of the impact social media was having on her day-to-day life. Taking endless photos of her family meant she was living through her phone screen. Today, she forces herself to take phone breaks and tries to protect her children's identities, hiding their faces with artfully arranged pictures instead.\n\nSo who's who among the most powerful mum bloggers \u2014 and how successful are they at their unique blend of motherhood and marketing?\n\nFIGHTING FOR FAIR WORK FOR MUMS\n\nAnna Whitehouse, Mother Pukka\n\nFAME: 226,000 Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: Her company is worth \u00a3264,000, records show\n\nAnna Whitehouse (pictured) created Mother Pukka in 2015 and her company is worth \u00a3264,000\n\nBlonde East Londoner Anna uses her blog Mother Pukka to campaign for flexible working. And it's hugely attractive to brands seeking to market themselves to Anna's 30 to 40-something following: from Huggies to Scottish Widows.\n\nMother Pukka was born in 2015 out of 'frustration', Anna says. She was working as a copywriter for L'Oreal while bringing up her two-year-old daughter, and her request for flexible working was denied.\n\n'I quit my job and posted on Instagram that the working world is not set up for mothers or fathers, for people living with disability or caring responsibilities \u2014 or people just wanting to live.'\n\nWithin minutes she had 68 comments. Instagram had gone from being a place where she 'posted pictures of avocado toast' to a new job.\n\nShe is lobbying to make flexible working the default \u2014 Conservative MP Helen Whately recently introduced a flexible working bill in Parliament.\n\n'This is not about a Mummy wanting to see more of her Weetabix-spattered child,' says Anna. 'It's about wanting to work in a more humane way.'\n\nShe's aware that mum blogging is 'not representative of modern parenting in Britain. To tell the full story, other voices need to be raised higher. I love the work of Motherhood Reconstructed and Make Motherhood Diverse.'\n\nWhen she started out, she didn't think twice about sharing pictures of every family moment, but when they started school, she stopped posting pictures of their faces.\n\nToday, she restricts herself to her children appearing in only 20 per cent of her posted images \u2014 and spends one day a month with a photographer taking enough pictures of her children to sustain her online feed, allowing them to spend the rest of the month without being photographed.\n\nAnna, who also presents on Heart FM, outearns her husband, Matt Farquharson, a copywriter. Her daughter recently commented that 'mummy is a boss and daddy keeps [us] safe'.\n\n'WHERE ARE ALL THE BLACK MOTHERS?'\n\nCandice Brathwaite, Make Motherhood Diverse\n\nFAME: 46,500 Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: Can earn \u00a31,000 for a day's work.\n\nCandice Brathwaite (pictured) started her blog Make Motherhood Diverse in 2015 and was astonished at how much bloggers could earn\n\nMilton-Keynes based Candice didn't stumble into posting about her family \u2014 she started her blog 'with a business mindset' in 2015, when her daughter Esme was a year old.\n\nWorking in marketing for publisher Penguin Random House, she had been astonished at how much bloggers earn: 'I spent my whole time asking bloggers to feature our books and it was minimum \u00a3800 for a post. I realised I was in the wrong job. Everything I was doing for Jamie Oliver, I could do for myself!'\n\nShe was also concerned about the lack of diversity. 'There was one question in my mind: Where are all the black mums online? I struggled to see any black British mums with a voice.\n\nYet black mothers are particularly prone to post-natal depression [at 44 per cent versus 31 per cent for white mothers] because they feel no one understands them.' Witty and open, she writes about bringing up her two children, Esme, now six and RJ, 18 months, and has a podcast and a book deal.\n\nShe also insists she turns down offers to promote goods if she doesn't use the product in real life.\n\nBut she admits it took her three years and a lot of heartache to make any money. She had given up her salary of around \u00a330,000 and was reliant on her husband, a sales director. 'He told me it was a massive waste of time,' she says. 'It put a strain on our relationship. But he stuck with me.'\n\nThey had struggled with money before, she says: 'At one point, we were down to our last \u00a320 and had to make a choice between topping up the gas meter and buying Esme nappies. Blogging changed that.\n\nAlthough when I get a deal, I still do a happy dance around the kitchen because it means we can afford food! I am aware the cheques can stop at any moment.'\n\nHer first 'paid gig' was with Dove, who gave her \u00a31,000 to make a video. Her daughter gets a cut if she's in photos, and it goes into her savings account. Still, she doesn't quite understand Candice's job. 'She says 'Mummy, you are always at home taking pictures. Daddy works, you don't.'\n\nLike many mum bloggers Candice says being your own boss doesn't mean an easy life.\n\n'I took on too much with my second pregnancy,' she says. 'I was back on email three days after my C-section. I felt I couldn't slip out of the public eye. Now I wish I could go back and tell that woman to chill out. I was pumping milk while on my laptop.'\n\nShe's now trying to relax \u2014 but she's also aware the mummy blogger boom may not last.\n\n'Any mum influencer who thinks 'this is it' is in for a horrendous wake up call in five years. If you don't diversify into other projects, like writing books or giving talks, you will come unstuck.'\n\nBRUMMY MUMMY \u2014 AND PROUD\n\nEmma Conway, BrummyMummyof2\n\nFAME: 94,000 Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: Has worked with Disney and McDonald's\n\nEmma Conway (pictured), a former teacher, uses her site BrummyMummyof2 to post self-deprecating humour Brummies love\n\nNormality is Birmingham-based mum of two Emma's mantra: 'Unlike the average Insta-mum, I'm a bit older at 40, I'm not from London, I'm plus-size and live in a fairly average three-bedroom terrace. A lot of my posts use the self-deprecating humour us Brummies love.'\n\nBlonde, outgoing and happy to post pictures of herself in a swimming costume, Pimm's in hand, she has worked with brands including Sainsbury's.\n\nA former teacher, she admits she's gone from a 'worthy' job to one often labelled 'shallow' \u2014 and so tries to talk about charities such as Alzheimer's Research UK and advocate for body confidence. She's just employed a part-time assistant and has even inspired her mother to start her own account, @ brummynannysan.\n\nIT TAKES TWO TO MAKE AN EMPIRE\n\nHolly Gee and Sophie Taylor, Life Of Mummies\n\nFAME: 17,000 Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: One project with a brand made them \u00a35,000\n\nHolly Gee and Sophie Taylor realised their YouTube channel had become more than a fun project when baby food company Annabel Karmel got in touch to ask if they wanted to make a video in 2017.\n\nNow they are recognised in the supermarket \u2014 and want to give up their day jobs in music management and PR to work full-time on Life Of Mummies.\n\nThey met through their husbands, who Sophie says have been 'best friends since school', and found out they were pregnant at the same time.\n\nNow that their children Zack and Delilah are two, Holly says they are 'being careful about what they do'. 'I can tell if Delilah is not in the mood to be filmed, she goes 'no, no, no', and I instantly put my phone away.\n\n'These kids will grow up and see themselves online. We won't chase them around for an Instagram picture. We'll never post them having a tantrum or naked. We don't want to force it.'\n\nTAKING HER FAMILY AROUND THE WORLD\n\nKatie Ellison\n\nFAME: 74,000 Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: Works with Visit Florida and Mark Warner and goes on family trips with them.\n\nKatie Ellison (pictured) has been a blogger since 2011 and now attracts brands from Velux to Soak, Thomson Holidays to Ski Famille, with her mix of family, travel and interiors posts\n\nSmiley, athletic mum-of-three Katie has been a blogger since 2011 when, she says, there were 'only a handful of mum blogs'.\n\n'I was in the throes of first-time motherhood and was obsessed with talking about my daughter. I didn't start it with a particular plan, no one was making any money from blogging back then.'\n\nHow that's changed. Cambridgeshire-based Katie now attracts brands from Velux to Soak, Thomson Holidays to Ski Famille, with her mix of family, travel and interiors posts.\n\nGLITTERING QUEEN BEE\n\nLouise Pentland, A Sprinkle Of Glitter\n\nFAME: 2.4 million Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: Her company was worth \u00a3576,594 last year\n\nOne of the most successful bloggers, working with Olay, Benefit Cosmetics and Sunbites crisps. Louise, from Northampton, documents everything from charity shop finds for plus-size figures to what her two daughters are up to.\n\nLouise Pentland (pictured) documents everything from charity shop finds for plus-size figures to what her two daughters are up to on her site A Sprinkle Of Glitter\n\nDarcy, eight, is from a previous relationship, while she has Pearl, one, with her boyfriend Liam.\n\nWith her curvy figure and gap-toothed smile, she's 'real' enough to be relatable, and it's clear why such a huge variety of brands find her so attractive.\n\nShe says: 'As Darcy gets older I share less of her because she's becoming her own amazing person.\n\n'I rarely share anything in real time and I try not to upload anything I think might embarrass them in the future \u2014 I'll let you know in ten years if I succeeded.'\n\nShe is about to launch her own podcast called Mothers Meeting, where she chats to other mums.\n\nI'VE NO REGRETS OVER SHARING PHOTOS\n\nAnna Saccone Joly, The Saccone Jolys\n\nFAME: 1.4 million Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: An estimated net worth of \u00a31.5 million\n\nAnna Saccone Joly (pictured) started blogging about beauty, but has since shared everything from potty training to miscarriages on her vlog The Saccone Jolys\n\nSurrey mum-of-four Anna Saccone Joly has four children \u2014 Emilia, six, Eduardo, five, Alessia, two, and Andrea, one \u2014 with her video editor husband Jonathan.\n\nShe started blogging about beauty, but has since shared everything from potty training to miscarriages \u2014 and not without controversy.\n\nIn August this year, she and her husband were criticised for how they handled Alessia's potty training, sharing a film of Jonathan giving her a cold shower after she wiped a dirty nappy on the bed. The video was viewed more than 222,000 times.\n\nAt the time, they said their children are 'the light of our lives and our priority every day is to ensure that they are healthy and happy'. Legal action ensued against some of the trolls who targeted them.\n\nNow Anna says: 'We've all made mistakes in our lives, but I don't think I necessarily regret sharing anything.\n\n'As the kids get older they might naturally take a step back from being involved with our vlogs (video blogs), but at the moment they love it \u2014 Eduardo even picks up the camera and films his own content!'\n\nFEARNE COTTON'S A FAN\n\nMolly Gunn, Selfishmother.com\n\nFAME: 135,000 Instagram followers\n\nFORTUNE: Raised more than \u00a31 million for Syrian mothers\n\nMolly Gunn has acquired 135,000 followers through her blog Selfishmother.com and today her site is linked to a website where she sells Selfish Mother products\n\nWhen Somerset-based Molly Gunn's son Rafferty, now eight, was born, she says she put pressure on herself to be perfect. A fashion journalist, she was working freelance: 'I didn't have maternity leave pay so I was still working and trying to be a brilliant mother at the same time.\n\n'I was stressing myself out. Then I realised if I looked after myself and was happy, my children would be too. That's how Selfish Mother was born.'\n\nMolly's busting of what she calls 'the perfect mother myth' struck a chord. 'It felt like there was a collective mindset among women who had careers, then had children and thought they couldn't 'just' be mums.'\n\nToday, her blog is linked to a website where she sells Selfish Mother products \u2014 the most successful of which is a T-shirt saying 'Mother', pictured, for which half the \u00a330 price tag went to a charity supporting Syrian women.\n\n'Fearne Cotton and Leah Wood wore them [in 2015]. We sold out almost immediately.' In three years, she raised more than \u00a31 million.\n\nMolly, who also has a son Fox, six, and daughter Liberty, two, has never made money directly via her blog, but her range of clothing is profitable. Today, she and her husband, who also works for the site, have six employees.", "description": "Mothers Holly Gee and Sophie Taylor are two of the most influential mothers in Britain today who joined forces to launch their blog Life Of Mummies two years ago.", "authors": ["Susannah Butter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/21/20101966-0-image-a-46_1571862606269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
