If the Fed slashed interest rates as Trump has decreed, he would save millions on this and other loans.\n\nWall Street pros have a term for people who recommend whichever actions will make them the most money: Talking their book.\n\nWhen your broker calls out of the blue to tell you should buy XYZ stock without mentioning that he\u2019s also trying to sell his own shares, he\u2019s talking his book. When a trader goes on TV to bad-mouth PDQ bonds, seeking to drive down the price so she can secretly pick up some more on the cheap, she\u2019s talking her book.\n\nOr when an overleveraged president hounds the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates (even below zero!), without ever coming clean about the fact that lower rates would save him millions of dollars a year, you know what he\u2019s up to.\n\nThe American people should not have to wonder if the president or his close advisers have a conflict of interest.\n\nYes. I know it is shocking, but Donald J. Trump is talking his book when he says the U.S. economy badly needs lower or even negative interest rates. He says he\u2019s doing it for us, but really he\u2019s doing it for the Trump Organization and for Donald J. Trump, which are the same thing.\n\nPublic interests first\n\nIt\u2019s assumed that everyone on Wall Street always talks their book, but that\u2019s not so in Washington, where public officials are supposed to put the people\u2019s interests first and their own financial interests into a blind trust so they have no idea if their decisions would help or hurt their portfolio.\n\nAt least that was the way it was until Trump came to town to drain the swamp. He refused to divest his assets. He denied that it was even possible for a president to have a conflict of interest. Although he claims that he no longer runs the Trump Organization, he still owns it and stands to benefit when the government favors his company, which it does every day (and twice on Sundays).\n\nIf you think it is immoral, if not illegal, for the president to earn an emolument when (to give just one example among thousands) he rents golf carts to the Secret Service agents whose job it is to give up their lives if necessary to protect him on the back nine, then you have a better ethical compass than every Republican politician (now that Justin Amash has left the party, that is).\n\nLow interest-rate guy\n\nIt\u2019s largely forgotten now, but Trump has been calling for lower interest rates since early in his term, when the top of the fed funds target range FF00, +0.00% was only 1%. At that time, the economy did not need lower interest rates, but the self-described King of Debt sure did.\n\nAlso read: Dear Mr. President, why is it a good thing if a 10-year Treasury note is pays less than a bag of dirt?\n\nDuring the campaign of 2016, Trump briefly put his political interests ahead of his money, complaining loudly and frequently that the Fed had kept rates unnecessarily low in order to benefit President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut as soon as he was in office, Trump\u2019s political and financial interests aligned again. He flip-flopped and argued that low interest rates were good, not bad. \u201cI do like a low-interest-rate policy, I must be honest with you,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump\u2019s complaints about interest rates continued even after he replaced Fed Chair Janet Yellen with Jerome Powell, after he appointed more Fed governors, and even after the 2017 tax-cut bill pushed the economy into a temporarily higher orbit.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticisms of the Fed grew sharper and more specific beginning last fall, after Trump\u2019s escalating threats to raise tariffs on Chinese imports began to rattle markets and threaten the economy.\n\nHow Trump would save millions\n\nIn early August, just after the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in 10 years, Shahien Nasiripour of Bloomberg News took a deep dive into Trump\u2019s financial-disclosure statements and into other public documents. He concluded that every quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate would save Trump about $850,000 per year.\n\nNasiripour had reported late last year that the seven interest-rate hikes by the Fed since the inauguration would cost the Trump Organization about $6 million a year on his payments on about $350 million in variable-rate loans he had taken out with Deutsche Bank to develop a golf course outside Miami and hotels in Washington and Chicago. (That\u2019s the same struggling golf course that Trump wants to rent out to the G-7 Summit.)\n\nThe variable interest rate on such loans tracks short-term interest rates (such as prime and Libor) that are heavily influenced by the Fed.\n\nThe Washington Post confirmed Bloomberg\u2019s story in its own investigation.\n\nThe watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported that Jared Kushner and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump (who also work in the White House) would possibly save hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest payments if the Fed cut rates. According to their financial-disclosure forms, the couple have five variable-rate loans worth at least $17 million and as much as $85 million.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s not known how much his family business, Kushner Cos., would save with lower rates, because it is not required to disclose its finances. The president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser is still a major stakeholder in the business and would benefit personally from any reduction in interest payments.\n\n\u2018To promote the general welfare ...\u2019\n\nThe American people should not have to wonder if the president or his close advisers have a conflict of interest. Public policy should be made on the basis of what\u2019s best for the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d of the people, not the private interests of officials.\n\nThat line has been blurred many times in our history, but never with so much open disdain for propriety. Corrupt officials used to hide in shame, but the Trumps celebrate it.\n\nThe American economy might benefit from lower interest rates, although I am skeptical that lowering the cost of borrowing would do much to solve the major problem in the economy, which is Trump\u2019s destructive and incoherent trade policies.\n\nBusinesses and consumers don\u2019t seem to have many difficulties in obtaining credit. The main trouble is the disruption in imports and exports, and the inability of businesses and consumers to plan ahead.\n\nWhat the economy really needs is a stable policy for the rules of trade, not a president who changes his mind about tariffs on a daily basis. It needs a president who won\u2019t screw up the good thing that was handed to him.\n\nAnd most of all, the nation needs leadership that is not corrupt.\n\nRex Nutting is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "The president is \u2018talking his book,\u2019 neglecting to mention that he would save millions of dollars with lower interest rates.", "authors": ["Rex Nutting"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR194_Trump__ZG_20190912105934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
