A Dolphins vendor was arrested after charging a fan $724 for two beers, according to the Miami Herald.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nNo, Dolphins fans are not so desperate for alcohol that they are willing to pay $724 for two beers. The vendor \u2014 33-year-old Nathaniel Collier \u2014 reportedly tried to take hundreds from an unsuspecting Dolphins fan by scanning the fan\u2019s credit card to a personal card reader, not the one provided to the vendor at the stadium, according to the Herald.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe grabbed the fan\u2019s card and swiped it using a personal card reader, not the device the stadium provides to vendors, according to the police report. Shortly after the transaction was processed, the fan received an alert from his bank notifying him of the steep charge to his card. It also displayed the vendor\u2019s name.\n\nCollier was arrested and faces charges of grand theft and using a skimming device. Collier was also fired by Rocket Man, the company that employs the vendors at Dolphins games.\n\nAfter all that, the fan watched the Dolphins lose 30-10 to the Los Angeles Chargers. The loss dropped Miami to 0-4 on the season.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at christophercwik@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
