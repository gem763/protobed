The company was previously known as Xtend.\n\nIf you think about smart suitcases, chances are you picture a suitcase with a battery pack in it and that\u2019s it. In other words, they are not that smart. Kabuto is packing a bunch of electronics to add some more features.\n\nAt the top of the suitcase, you\u2019ll find a fingerprint reader. You can unlock the suitcase with your fingerprint or use a key in case your suitcase battery is dead \u2014 yes, a smart suitcase means you have one more thing to charge in your life.\n\nThe suitcase comes with a 10,000 mAh battery that you plug to various USB-A and USB-C cables. This way, you can charge a device using a USB-A or USB-C cable from the top of the suitcase.\n\nThe pocket at the back of the suitcase is removable. For instance, you can store a laptop and a book in it in order to take it with you on a flight. The company uses a magnetic connection between the pocket and the suitcase, which means that you can plug the included USB-C cable to your laptop and then attach the pocket to the suitcase to charge your laptop when you\u2019re not using it.\n\nThe suitcase features an expandable structure, four wheels with metallic bearings and tires and a strap to attach another bag to the large handle on top of your suitcase. It costs $435 on Kickstarter and it will cost $595 after the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPeople who like to pack things exactly the right way will think the Kabuto suitcase offers a lot of options. It\u2019s not a suitcase for everyone, but it\u2019s an interesting take. The company promises to ship all suitcases by the end of the year. The startup has previously raised $1 million (\u20ac900,000) from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mazzella, Michel & Augustin, Bpifrance, Fabien Pierlot and others.", "description": "French company Kabuto is launching a Kickstarter campaign today for the second generation of its smart carry-on suitcase.
