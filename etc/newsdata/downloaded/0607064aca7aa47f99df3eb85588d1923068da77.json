In the essay as told to writer Kevin Arnovitz, he said he wants the next football team to sign him to know who he truly is.\n\n\u201cMy truth is that I\u2019m a talented football player, a damn good writer, a loving son, an overbearing brother, a caring friend, a loyal lover, and a bisexual man,\u201d Russell said.\n\nThe lack of even one openly LGBTQ player currently playing in the NFL, NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball gives him pause, Russell said, but he wants to change that.\n\n\u201cFor me, for other athletes who share these common goals, and for the generations of LGBTQ athletes who will come next,\u201d he said.\n\nTom Szczerbowski / Getty Images Pro football player Ryan Russell publicly revealed that he is bisexual on Aug. 29.\n\nAn openly gay athlete has never played a game for an NFL team. In 2014, Michael Sam became the first openly gay player drafted when he was selected by the St. Louis Rams, but Sam didn\u2019t make the final 53-man roster. In 2017, former offensive lineman Ryan O\u2019Callaghan came out as gay, years after his retirement from the league in 2011.\n\nRussell said that athletes\u2019 choices about whom they date are far from the NFL\u2019s most pressing issues.\n\n\u201cI can say with confidence that LGBTQ players having the comfort to be themselves, date who they want, [and] share parts of their life with friends and teammates will not rank among those issues,\u201d he said.\n\nRussell also emphasized that he is still looking for a team \u2015 he was released by the Buffalo Bills last fall \u2015 and that his choice to come out is not a choice to retire from the NFL.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to dedicate my life to football without feeling like I can\u2019t dedicate my life to truth as well,\u201d he said.", "description": "Russell, now a free agent, talked about his identity as part of the LGBTQ community in an ESPN essay.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d683a383c00004e0047ed0b.jpeg?cache=ilujny70je&ops=1778_1000"}
