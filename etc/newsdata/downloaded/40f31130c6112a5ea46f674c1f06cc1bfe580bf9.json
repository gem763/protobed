As Menon put it, \"You can say many things about this election, but you can't say it is not an election about big things.\"\n\nFacing a British public that is fed up with Brexit and campaigning in the early twilight of the days before Christmas, Johnson and his opponents will seek to frame the election around competing visions of Britain's future: Johnson's, based on a swift exit from the European Union; and the Labour Party's, based on holding a second referendum on whether to leave at all.\n\nHistory warns, however, that other issues could intrude, from crime or the stability of Britain's National Health Service to an external shock, like a terrorist attack or a peripheral issue that assumes symbolic importance.\n\nJohnson's predecessor, Theresa May, called a snap election in 2017, confident that she could expand her majority and strengthen her hand in negotiating a Brexit deal.\n\nInstead, May wound up with a shrunken majority after running a desultory campaign during which she was tarred for advocating a harsh new policy on care for the elderly that critics branded a \"dementia tax\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith two smaller parties, the Liberal Democrats and the hard-line Brexit Party, also contesting for votes, the choice of the next government could turn on a tiny number of parliamentary seats. Far from securing a healthy majority, the next prime minister may have to govern with a minority, as Johnson has.\n\nBritain last held a cold-weather election in February 1974, when an embattled Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, went to the voters during a time of economic upheaval and labour unrest with a stark manifesto, \"Who governs Britain?\"\n\nThe result was a hung Parliament, and Heath had to give way to a Labour government.\n\nWhat Johnson has going for him, many analysts agree, is a substantial lead over the Labour Party in the polls \u2013 more than 10 percentage points in some \u2013 and a clear message: He will take Britain out of the European Union.\n\n\"It's great fodder for an election,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, an expert on Brexit at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \"He can run a very compelling centrist campaign, albeit with a hard Brexit program.\"\n\nWith his shambling charm and studiously unkempt style, Johnson is a singular presence on the campaign trail \u2013 a politician whose celebrity has put him on a first-name basis with virtually the entire country.\n\n\"Boris is one of the very few people in British politics who can enter an ordinary shopping centre on a dull Wednesday afternoon and utterly transform the atmosphere,\" said Andrew Gimson, who wrote a biography of Johnson. \"People just want to have selfies taken with him.\"\n\nJohnson, 55, has not lost an election since 1997, when he stood for Parliament in Wales and was trounced by the Labour candidate. He was first elected to Parliament in 2001, in a safe Conservative district, and won two terms as mayor of London, where his antics \u2013 like getting stuck on a zip line during the Olympic Games, waving two Union Jacks \u2013 earned him further notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flip side of Johnson's devil-may-care manner, Gimson said, is that \"he is tasteless and excessive and goes too far\". Those less flattering traits have been on display during the frequently toxic debate over Brexit in the House of Commons since Johnson took office.\n\nHe came under fierce criticism for dismissing threats of violence made against members of Parliament as \"humbug\". And he was condemned, including by his own sister, Rachel, for saying that Britain should get Brexit done in the memory of Jo Cox, a member of Parliament who was ardently pro-European and was killed a week before the 2016 referendum by a right-wing assassin.\n\nJohnson's bare-knuckle tactics have dented his happy warrior image. Last summer he was booed during a visit to Scotland, which wants to stay in the European Union, and where he could face the first genuinely hostile crowds of his career during this campaign. He will have to go back to Scotland to try to hold on to Tory seats that are severely endangered by his Brexit policy.\n\nThe Conservative Party will try to make gains among Labour seats in the northern England and the Midlands, where people voted in favour of Brexit. But it will have to defend seats in the south, where people voted to stay, from the Liberal Democrats, whose platform is to revoke Brexit altogether.\n\n\"Johnson is gambling that he can make up for the liberal votes he loses in cities and among 'remain' voters by attracting Labour voters in rural areas and the hinterlands,\" Menon said. \"If the Tories become the party of people in the hinterlands, that would be a huge change in British politics.\"\n\nDominic Grieve, a longtime Tory who broke with Johnson over his Brexit strategy and was purged from the party, said the Conservatives had \"haemorrhaged support from Middle England.\" Some voters, he said, would be turned off by Johnson, who he called a \"populist demagogue who is unable to tell the truth\".\n\nJohnson also has to worry about his right flank, where the Brexit Party could siphon off critical Conservative votes. He supplied that party's leader, Nigel Farage, with a damaging talking point when he broke his vow to withdraw Britain from the European Union by October 31, with or without a deal.\n\nFor the Labour Party, which anguished for days over whether to back an election, the risks are equally high. The party is deeply divided over Brexit, with some of its members ardent proponents of leaving, while others are equally passionate about staying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorbyn, himself, seemed ready, saying on Tuesday that he would campaign all across Britain, including in Johnson's home constituency in suburban London. He proved to be a surprisingly effective campaigner against May in 2017, but he remains an unpopular figure nationally. Some members of Labour's rank and file worry that an election is a prescription for defeat.\n\n\"There's not really an appetite for an election on the Labour benches,\" said David Lammy, a lawmaker from London, at a briefing sponsored by the Foreign Press Association. He predicted it would be \"one of the nastiest, most brutal elections of our lifetimes\" and that no party would emerge with a clear majority. \"We're going to end up in the same fix we're now in,\" he said.\n\nJohnson has viewed an election as the path out of the Brexit quagmire almost from the moment he became Prime Minister. He called for a vote four times, taunting Corbyn as a \"chlorinated chicken\" for resisting (Corbyn has warned that in the post-Brexit trade deal with the US, Britons could be forced to buy chemically treated poultry from US exporters).\n\nFor all the risks of going to the voters, some analysts said, Johnson risked more by sitting on his hands. Lawmakers could tie up his Brexit deal with Brussels with amendments and block any other legislation. Commentators have already taken to saying he runs a \"zombie government\".\n\n\"Admiral Nelson said the boldest measures are the safest,\" said Gimson, referring to the 18th-century naval hero who vanquished Napoleon in the Battle of Trafalgar. \"Boris also thinks the boldest measure are the safest.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "After three years of political chaos, the outcome of the British election is deeply uncertain.
