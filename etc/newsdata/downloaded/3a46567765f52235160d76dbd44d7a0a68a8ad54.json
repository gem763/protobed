USA TODAY\n\nWe've seen dancers wipe out on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" But Carrie Ann Inaba's tumble from the judge's table Monday was the first time this season a judge has tumbled from the desk.\n\nThe ever-graceful Inaba, a co-host on CBS' \"The Talk\" and an original Fly Girl from the '90s sketch show \"In Living Color,\" laughed off the bizarre incident. It started when host Tom Bergeron pointed out a misplaced broom prop from contestant Kate Flannery's \"Mary Poppins\" routine on the floor in front of Inaba's desk.\n\nThe broom's movement startled Inaba, who tried to sit back down on her wheeled desk chair that had other ideas.\n\nInaba followed the moving chair with a slow-motion fall onto the floor in her resplendent green Disney Night gown. One thing about Inaba, she never stopped smiling even as her chair shot out to the first row of the audience.\n\nCarrie Ann Inaba took her Disney seriously on \"Dancing With the Stars\" Disney night.

To be fair, she does stand up a lot and gets very passionate in her judge opinions.\n\nMore: With fresh support from Trump, Sean Spicer on his 'Dancing With the Stars' survival\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/15/dancing-stars-carrie-ann-inaba-laughs-chair-wipeout/3983009002/", "description": "Judge Carrie Ann Inaba managed a chair wipe-out on \"Dancing With the Stars\" Monday and she's a judge.
