Josef Brunner, whom neighbors had believed to be the farmhouse\u2019s sole occupant, was taken into custody earlier this week after the oldest son in the family escaped and raised the alarm about their plight.\n\nFamily found living in cellar for 9 years 'waiting for end of time' #Ruinerwoldpic.twitter.com/S5Seaz9Dyh \u2014 Ruptly (@Ruptly) October 16, 2019\n\nThe two men were trying to start their own cult, according to Unification Church members who spoke to Dutch media. After van Dorsten left the group, he moved to Germany and they \u201clost sight of him\u201d \u2013 but rumor was that he\u2019d set up a group of his own \u201cwith his family.\u201d\n\nThe six adult van Dorsten children were moved to a holiday park after their basement prison \u2013 accessible only through a secret passage behind a kitchen cupboard \u2013 was discovered. But their cult rituals, including walking circles every half-hour, disturbed other guests, forcing authorities to move them elsewhere. The 25-year-old son who sought help from the pub owner has been moved to a separate location from his siblings, some of whom had been reduced to communicating in a \"fantasy language\" because of their isolation, authorities said.\n\nVan Dorsten has been charged with \u201cdepriving people of their liberty, harming the health of others and money laundering,\u201d police said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAuthorities found tens of thousands of euros piled up at the farmhouse, believed to be donations from the Moonies. The sect confirmed van Dorsten was a member on Friday in a statement that noted he \u201csuffered from mental health problems\u201d and left in 1987. It claimed to have no records of Brunner\u2019s involvement. A cousin of van Dorsten's still with the group claimed those mental health problems were what got him kicked out of the cult in the first place.\n\n\u201cAt some point he got certain ideas in his head. Crazy ideas\u2026 He started talking and discussing that, but they immediately said, \u2018no, we don\u2019t want anything to do with it.\u2019 At one point our church said: we cannot go any further with you,\u201d he told Dutch outlet Algemeen Dagblad.\n\nAlso on rt.com Dutch family found living in cellar for 9 YEARS waiting for \u2018end of days\u2019 & unaware other people still existed\n\nVan Dorsten\u2019s family had not heard from him in decades and feared he was dead when he did not attend his mother\u2019s funeral.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether \u201ca certain religion or philosophy\u201d played a role in the family\u2019s nine-year isolation, during which none of the children attended school or apparently understood there were other people in the world. Even the house\u2019s owner said she had no idea there was anyone living there \u2013 least of all a cult \u201cwaiting for the end times.\u201d\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "The father of six children who spent nine years in a farmhouse basement was a former Moonie \u201ctrying to create a cult of his own\u201d and has been arrested for holding his brainwashed offspring against their will, Dutch media reported.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5daa550f20302778bb06c51f.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
