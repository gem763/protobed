It was opposed by Democrats and some Republicans and led to a record-long 35-day partial government shutdown that extended into January 2019.\n\nThe standoff ended when Trump circumvented Congress and declared a national emergency, which he said allowed him to divert money appropriated for other programs to construct the wall, a major plank of his 2016 election campaign..\n\nWith money for scores of federal agency operations expiring on Sept. 30 - the end of this fiscal year - lawmakers are now trying to agree to a series of new spending bills for fiscal 2021.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Republicans were proposing to funnel $12.2 billion (\u00a39.9 billion) in domestic spending to the border. Thousands of immigrants have arrived at the southern U.S. border with Mexico in hopes of winning asylum or other protections.\n\nSchumer said that $5 billion of the $12.2 billion would come out of Department of Health and Human Services programs, while the rest would be taken from military construction or veterans\u2019 programs.\n\n\u201cThey (Republicans) know darned well that $12 billion in additional money for the wall is not going to fly with Senate Democrats or the House of Representatives,\u201d Schumer told reporters. Democrats control the House.\n\nLast week, the Pentagon said funds were being diverted from schools and daycare centres for military families and other Defence Department programs to cover the $3.6 billion Trump wants for wall construction.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, a Senate Appropriations panel work session was abruptly cancelled because of a dispute over an attempt by Democrats to reverse a new Trump administration \u201cgag rule\u201d that blocks medical providers receiving federal funding, such as Planned Parenthood, from talking to patients about abortion if they inquire about it.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of violating an agreement from earlier this year in which contentious \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments to spending bills would not be sought.\n\nDemocratic Senator Patty Murray, who was planning to offer an amendment rolling back the rule, is expected to pursue a vote on her amendment.", "description": "U.S. lawmakers clashed on Tuesday over funding for President Donald Trump's border wall and women's reproductive health programs, flashpoints that could threaten funding to keep the federal government operating beyond this month.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
