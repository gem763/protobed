And it strikes at the core of the way AT&T has built its bigger-is-better empire: a costly M&A binge that has turned the carrier into one of the most indebted companies on Earth.\n\n\u201cThere will be a fight,\u201d said Chetan Sharma, a wireless-industry analyst.\n\nElliott outlined a four-part plan for the company in a letter to its board Monday. The proposal calls for the company to explore divesting assets, including satellite-TV provider DirecTV, the Mexican wireless operations, pieces of the landline business, and others.\n\nIt urges AT&T, led by Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, to exit businesses that don\u2019t fit its strategy, run a more efficient operation and stop making major acquisitions. Elliott said it would also recommend candidates to add to AT&T\u2019s board.\n\nIn response, AT&T said it would review Elliott\u2019s recommendations and said many of them are \u201cones we are already executing today.\u201d\n\nThe telecom giant said its strategy is \u201cdriven by the unique portfolio of valuable businesses we\u2019ve assembled across communications networks and media and entertainment, and as Elliott points out, is the foundation for significant value creation.\u201d\n\nThe carrier said it believes that \u201cgrowing and investing in these businesses is the best path forward for our company and our shareholders.\u201d\n\nStill, investors seem to think Elliott\u2019s plan could wring more value from AT&T. The shares surged as much as 5.2% to $38.14 in New York trading Monday. That was the biggest intraday jump since March 2009 and put them at their highest level since February of last year. They later settled down to a 2.7% gain amid a broader pullback in the market.\n\nElliott said the investment -- among its largest to date -- was made because the company is deeply undervalued after a period of \u201cprolonged and substantial underperformance.\u201d It argued this has been marked by its shares lagging the broader S&P 500 over the past decade.\n\nIt pointed to a series of strategic setbacks, including $200 billion in acquisitions, the \u201cmost damaging\u201d of which was its $39 billion attempted purchase of T-Mobile US Inc. That deal resulted in the largest breakup fee of all time when the government blocked it in 2011 -- about $6 billion in cash and assets.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the internal and external distractions it caused itself, AT&T\u2019s failed takeover capitalized a viable competitor for years to come,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nThe hedge fund also slammed the subsequent acquisitions of DirecTV and media giant Time Warner Inc. That puts particular pressure on Stephenson, 59, who oversaw the deals Elliott criticized in the letter.\n\nBut, while the position in AT&T is large, Elliott may have a difficult time pushing for change unless it gets other investors to back its stance. Its newly disclosed stake in AT&T represents just about 1.2% of the company\u2019s total market value.\n\nElliott\u2019s plan also calls for aggressive cost-cutting measures that aim to improve AT&T\u2019s margins by 3 percentage points by 2022. Those margins have come under pressure amid cord cutting in video and widespread discounting in wireless, and Elliott said competitors like Verizon Communications Inc. have done a better job addressing those headwinds.\n\nElliott said in the letter it has identified opportunities for savings in excess of $10 billion, but the plan would only require cost cuts of $5 billion.\n\nElliott is also calling for a series of governance changes, including separating the roles of CEO and chairman -- currently held by Stephenson -- and the formation of a strategic review committee to identify the opportunities at hand.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc.\u2019s sweeping transformation from Ma Bell to a multimedia titan has gone both too far and not far enough for Elliott Management Corp.Billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s New York hedge fund disclosed a new $3.2 billion position in AT&T, taking on one of the nation\u2019s biggest and most widely", "authors": ["Scott Deveau"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mHThw_L6Jw7_vON7xEeiYQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/176fa4c04bb016cd9cd7cde84005002c", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
