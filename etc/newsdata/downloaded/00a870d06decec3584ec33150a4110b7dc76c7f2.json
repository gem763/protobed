It has been hard, but she manages to get by on the Disability Support Pension and a small amount of savings. Her children have left home and are either studying at university or working.\n\nSignificant savings\n\nAlice\u2019s uncle recently passed away and left her an inheritance of $400,000. This was a generous gift, but Alice is worried about losing her Disability Support Pension. What worries her most is not losing the income, but losing the Pension Concession Card, which provides her with significant savings in medical treatments and pharmaceutical benefits.\n\nAlthough her uncle has died, the inheritance is not yet included in her means test because the estate is still being finalised and the distribution is not yet available. The money does not count as hers until the estate can be distributed. Centrelink generally allows a grace period of up to 12 months.\n\nThis has allowed Alice some time to get advice on what to do.\n\nWhile she is grateful for her uncle\u2019s generosity, she would prefer the money going straight to her children. If she forgoes her inheritance, this could be seen by Centrelink to be gifting and deprivation rules will apply. If she had known about her uncle\u2019s plans and he had understood her concerns, he might have been able to draw up his will differently.\n\nAlice considers transferring the money into a family trust so it can be used to help her children, but Centrelink rules will still capture the full assets and income in her means-testing if she retains a connection to the trust. Gifting and deprivation apply if she does not maintain a connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Alice does not own a house, or has a mortgage, the inheritance could be a genuine windfall and allow her to buy or pay off a home to live in, turning the inheritance into an exempt asset. It might also give her the opportunity to renovate or upgrade an existing home. If she moves from being a non-homeowner to a homeowner, the asset thresholds are lower and may have an impact depending on other assessable assets.\n\nAlice is under the age pension age, so superannuation might hold a solution for her, at least for now. Money held in the accumulation phase of superannuation is exempt (from both assets and income tests) until the owner reaches age pension age. When Alice receives the inheritance, she could make a personal contribution into superannuation.\n\nRisk of losing entitlements\n\nOnce she is eligible for age pension, it does become assessable and at that point, she may lose or reduce her age pension entitlements. However, the implications may not be so problematic because if she does lose the pension she may be able to apply for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card to retain her health and pharmaceutical concessions.\n\nBefore making any contribution into super, it is important to consider the preservation issues. If Alice meets the definition of permanent incapacity, she may not have an issue with preservation.\n\nDeath and inheritances are among the taboo topics we don\u2019t like to discuss. But careful planning and good advice are important. It can also be beneficial to have conversations with the people you are planning to include in your will to determine what special needs they may have or options they would prefer.\n\nEstate planning is not just about who the money gets to, but also ensuring it gets to them at the right time and in the right way.", "description": "Give some thought to the circumstances of your beneficiaries to determine how they can best use a windfall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4322%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_637%2C$y_177/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/25e6568683f8ce15deca1edf2ff8356cae7dd337", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
