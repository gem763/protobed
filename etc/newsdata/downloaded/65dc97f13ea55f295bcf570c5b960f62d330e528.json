Gavin Newsom that mandates later start times at most public schools.\n\nThe new law, which acknowledges research showing that teens perform better when they start later than schools now typically begin, will make California the first U.S. state with this requirement once the law is fully implemented, the Los Angeles Times noted.\n\nImpacted schools will need to begin the new start times \u2014 8 a.m. or later for middle schools and 8.30 a.m. or later for high schools \u2014 by July 1, 2022, or the date of expiry of the school\u2019s three-year collective bargaining agreement with its employees, whichever is later.\n\nMost of California\u2019s public schools will need to delay their start times under the new law, according to a legislative analysis prepared this year. About 50% will need to increase their start times by 30 minutes or less; while 25% of schools will need to push it back by 31 to 60 minutes, the analysis said.\n\nSo-called \u201czero periods,\u201d or classes offered before the start of a regular school day, will not be impacted by the legislation. Rural school districts are also exempt from the law.\n\nThank you @GavinNewsom for your wisdom in signing #SB328 - your economy & constituents will benefit in myriad ways. Thank you @CaliforniaPTA for co-sponsoring the bill. And thank you to the many Start School Later volunteers who gave hundreds of hours of their time to help youth. https://t.co/g3ZAFuDtFp \u2014 Start School Later (@StartSchoolL8r) October 14, 2019\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, said schools are being given ample time to adjust to the new timings, which he said are aimed at benefiting California\u2019s teens.\n\n\u201cThe science shows that teenage students who start their day later increase their academic performance, attendance, and overall health,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cImportantly, the law allows three years for schools and school districts to plan and implement these changes.\n\nSome medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the California Medical Association, supported the bill.\n\nDescribing insufficient sleep among adolescents as a public health issue, the pediatricians\u2019 group told the LA Times that it \u201cendorses the scientific rationale for later school start times and acknowledges the potential benefits to students with regard to physical and mental health, safety and academic achievement.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agreed, however.\n\nA similar bill was vetoed last year by former Gov. Jerry Brown (D), who said decisions about when schools start are \u201cbest handled in the local community.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the measure, including the California Teachers Association and some school districts, have echoed similar concerns.\n\n\u201cAdolescents function better with more sleep, but we don\u2019t believe that starting school later is the only path forward,\u201d Seth Bramble, legislative advocate for the CTA, said in a letter to lawmakers last month, according to the Sacramento Bee. \u201cA mandatory statewide school start time would be an onerous, overreaching mandate on an issue best left to local districts and their parents. The one-size-fits-all approach doesn\u2019t work in California.\u201d\n\nSome critics have also warned that some families, especially working class families, could be particularly hard-hit by the bill.\n\n\u201cWhile well-intentioned, proposals to mandate school start times fail to take into account the complexity of the issue and perpetuate the illusion that adolescent sleep deprivation has a simple fix,\u201d two San Jose school superintendents, Chris Funk and Nancy Albarr\u00e1n, wrote in a op-ed for EdSource earlier this month.\n\n\u201cMany students are dropped off in the morning by parents headed to work well before the current start time. Mandating that all districts delay the school start time will not change this reality. It would, however, result in students getting out of bed at the same time they do now and being on campus unsupervised for a longer period,\u201d the superintendents said.", "description": "Schools have about three years to adjust under the law signed by Gov.
