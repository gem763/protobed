Moreover, the bill will allow the US to implement sanctions against officials who are seen to be responsible for \u201cundermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong. Naturally, China has vowed to retaliate, although details of their timing and method are typically scarce.\n\nStill, it has to pass the senate, and this is where it becomes interesting and, well\u2026 political; the timing of this bill could be catastrophic for Trump\u2019s much-touted phase 1 trade deal. So, on that front it\u2019s hard to see why the Republican owned senate would officially sign off on this and stick one to China. Especially when it could be several more weeks until a trade deal is reached, and China\u2019s lukewarm media coverage and casual stance over \u201cthe greatest and biggest deal ever\u201d post-talks suggests Trump has exaggerated their progress.\n\nFrom here, we\u2019ll keep a close eye on the as it could dictate risk appetite. The fix is higher today and allowed USDCNH to hit a 3-day high around 7.1000, and we\u2019ll see if developing headlines allow the Yuan to weaken further.\n\ncame off from their high, and has shed around 30 pips for the session. Yet moves are relatively minor and not in panic mode just yet; for that, we\u2019d need to see the Senate pass this bill which is probably just a thorn in their side which undermines the yet-to-be-signed, phase 1 trade deal.\n\nUSD/CNH Daily Chart\n\nhas touched a 3-day high and found resistance at the 20-day EMA (for now). We\u2019d likely need to see the bill pass the senate and trade talks completely break down for USD/CNH to break to new highs, so whilst there are upside pressures near-term, this could fall lower if Trump sends assurances the bill won\u2019t be passed or of course if the senate block it. Either way, USD/CNH is our guide for risk sentiment.\n\nS&P 500 E-Mini Futures Chart\n\nS&P E-Mini futures have retreated from their high yet holding up quite well, and the daily range remains relatively small. Clearly, the trend is bullish on the 15-minute chart and has found support at the daily pivot point, with support nearby at 2982.50 and the 100-bar average at 2986. Perhaps a Trump tweet would help this one rally a little, with 3000 and the highs being the obvious targets for intraday traders. That said, if he remains surprisingly quiet and it appears the bill could gain traction, then we\u2019d expect risk-off to ensure and take stocks lower.\n\nAUD/USD Chart\n\nhas made a minor attempt to break its bullish channel on the 1-hour chart, although a bullish hammer has formed and closed back above the lower trendline. In a similar vein to E-mini\u2019s, it appears traders are waiting for further headlines to roll in from either side of the debate for further direction. From a technical standpoint, the daily S1 is acting as a pivotal level with the bullish trendline, so risk-on could see prices rebound from this key level and head for the pivot point around 0.6770, or head towards the 0.6706 low. Note that the daily S2 is right on the 0.6668 low (2019 low), although a test of this key level today is not favored unless we go all-out risk-off.\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
