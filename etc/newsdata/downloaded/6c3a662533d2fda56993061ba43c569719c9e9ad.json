Last month it became a partner of fintech hub Stone & Chalk and it has started building \"application programming interfaces\" (APIs) to allow outside developers to connect to its 40 million bank accounts from early next year.\n\nBen Tabell, chief information officer at Eftpos: \"The ability to connect to us means fintechs can connect to the Australian market.\u201d Supplied\n\n\u201cThe market is seeing a sharp increase in the pace of innovation, and the new strategy reflects a realisation that to continue to remain relevant, Eftpos needs to enhance its card capabilities in digital, mobile and e-commerce,\" said Eftpos' chief information officer Ben Tabell, who recently joined it from HSBC. \"We think a large part of this will be through building connections via APIs.\"\n\nWith the Reserve Bank scrutinising \"buy now, pay later\" companies like Afterpay preventing merchants passing costs to customers, the central bank also wants banks to promote to merchants their right to choose \u201cleast-cost routing\u201d when accepting card payments. This could drive volume to Eftpos, given its average merchant fee is 0.26 per cent of the transaction value, compared to 0.58 per cent for Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cMerchant awareness of [least-cost routing] is an important factor affecting the degree of downward pressure on payment costs in the economy,\u201d the Reserve Bank said last week.", "description": "Eftpos wants to ramp up competition against Visa, Mastercard and the buy now, pay later sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_7.641%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_61/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/37eeb4b6abf96985f8c94cb789bff31a106af214", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
