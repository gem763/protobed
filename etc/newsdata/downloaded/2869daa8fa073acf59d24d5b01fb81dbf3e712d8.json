Linda M. Kaufman, center, leads a memorial service along 12th Street NW for Bernard \u201cChino\u201d Dean Jr. on Thursday in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nPeople gathered Thursday beneath the awning of a downtown Washington department store to honor the life of a homeless man they knew little about but loved nonetheless.\n\nBernard \u201cChino\u201d Dean Jr., 45, lived under the Macy\u2019s awning across from an entrance to the Metro Center station for more than a decade. The dozens in attendance weren\u2019t sure why he made his home on the sidewalk or how he died Aug. 25, when EMTs showed up and took him from his familiar perch for the last time.\n\nFood vendors he regularly greeted and outreach workers he spurned said their goodbyes.\n\n\u201cI want you to look at all the people touched by Chino,\u201d said the Rev. Linda M. Kaufman, an advocate for the homeless who planned the service. \u201cI\u2019ve done services for people who died on the street before, and I\u2019ve never seen this many people show up.\u201d\n\n\n\nBernard \u201cChino\u201d Dean Jr. (Street Sense Media)\n\nDistrict officials announced earlier this year that 6,521 homeless people live in the city, a 5.5 percent decline from a year earlier. While D.C. leaders credit city policies for the decline, they say a shortage of affordable housing makes the problem difficult to tackle.\n\nDespite Chino\u2019s mental health problems, society had a responsibility to shelter him, said Brian Carome, executive director of Street Sense Media, a nonprofit group that publishes a newspaper sold by the homeless. He said ending homelessness will require a commitment to building cheaper housing.\n\n\u201cChino should not have died under this awning,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should have died in a home of his own.\u201d\n\nThough Kaufman never had performed a sidewalk ceremony, she reached out to nonprofit Pathways to Housing DC the day after Chino died to plan the memorial and put up fliers under the Macy\u2019s awning and the hot dog stand at 12th and G streets NW.\n\nDuring the lunchtime service, she lit a candle at a makeshift altar across the street from a cheesesteak truck and asked attendees to clear a path for passersby. Two men, oblivious to those shedding tears, walked by carrying a canoe.\n\nThose gathered offered observations of a neighbor whose exuberant spirit couldn\u2019t be obscured by mental illness, addiction and lack of a home address.\n\nOne outreach worker called Chino \u201cone of our toughest clients\u201d \u2014 a man who resisted well-meaning attempts to put a roof over his head, but insistent the sheets on his sidewalk cot be clean. A woman said he was passionate about watching a movie every Friday. A man commented he was \u201ca hell of a soccer player.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not sugarcoat it \u2014 Chino could be a real pain in the a--,\u201d Carome said to general laughter. \u201cLike many Washingtonians.\u201d\n\nHe said Chino worked as a Street Sense vendor and in the organization\u2019s office before Carome fired him about three years ago. Though Chino wrote for the organization, Carome said his mental illness made him \u201cconstantly disruptive\u201d while trying to sell newspapers.\n\nThursday\u2019s brief memorial filled gaps in the scant public record of a man who died on a sunny Sunday afternoon in downtown Washington. Even a police report detailing his death doesn\u2019t bear his name.\n\n\n\nKaufman waits for people to arrive for a memorial service along 12th Street NW that she led for Chino. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMedic 3 transported S-1 to Georege [sic] Washington Hospital where all lifesaving efforts proved futile and S-1 was pronounced,\u201d the report said. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner\u2019s office, Cheryle E. Adams, said findings on the cause and manner of Chino\u2019s death are pending.\n\nDespite having devoted friends, Chino carried with him an extensive criminal history.\n\nPublic records show he was from New Jersey and was convicted of child molestation in 1992, then later charged with failure to register as a sex offender, drug possession and trafficking in stolen property. He was last criminally charged in the District in 2007 with possessing an open container of alcohol.\n\nJason Dean, Chino\u2019s cousin, said he once served in the Navy and was the father of two children, but the fallout from a bad marriage \u201cmade him lose his mind.\u201d He had been out of touch with family for years, Dean said, and his mother, who is in poor health, still didn\u2019t know he died.\n\n\u201cThat was like my brother,\u201d Dean said in an interview from his North Carolina home. \u201cWhen he was in his right state of mind, he was a loving husband and good to his kids.\u201d\n\nChino\u2019s writing and comics on the Street Sense website offer glimpses of the energy people said he brought to the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cHe is a guy of many passions and desires,\u201d he once wrote about himself. \u201cAt 41 years old, he is still energetic, and full of life.\u201d\n\n\n\nA person attending the service for Chino picks out a memorial stone. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nGerren G. Price, director of public space operations for the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, said Chino\u2019s plight showed the importance of homeless outreach, particularly as officials grapple with how to handle encampments around the city.\n\n[Letter critical of D.C. homeless encampments stirs controversy]\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy who we\u2019ve seen every day, we talk to every day,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt was devastating when we had to come clean up the day after.\u201d\n\nKristal DeKleer, a former Street Sense employee who attended the memorial, once let Chino sleep on her couch for a few months after securing him a dishwashing job. He earned enough money to get his own place, but eventually lost it, she said.\n\nDeKleer said Chino\u2019s complex character showed \u201cthe mystery of homelessness.\u201d The same energy that brought people out to honor him should be used to get people like him safely housed, she said.\n\nAfter the memorial, mourners slowly dispersed, sharing memories of Chino. The only traces of his passing were flower bouquets leaning against Macy\u2019s and chalk on the sidewalk that read \u201cMiss you my friend\u201d and \u201cI know you\u2019re still here with us.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDisabled residents in the D.C. region face obstacles when searching for housing, report says\n\nD.C.
