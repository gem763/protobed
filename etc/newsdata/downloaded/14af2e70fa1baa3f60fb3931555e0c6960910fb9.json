Nemeth, who signed as a free agent last summer, scored his first goal with the Red Wings less than a minute later.\n\n\"We knew they were going to come out fast because of their losing streak, and then we let them get a couple goals early on,\" Edmonton centre Ryan Nugent-Hopkins said. \"I thought we fought our way back into the game, but we have got to find a way to score.\"\n\nA long scoreless stretch for both teams ended with 7:12 left when Leon Draisaitl scored from the right circle to pull Edmonton within one.\n\nEdmonton had a 4-on-3 power play shortly thereafter but could not take advantage despite McDavid and Draisaitl putting shots on net.\n\n\"All their lines and their defencemen can skate,\" McDavid said. \"And, they do a good job of clutching and grabbing to clog up the middle.\"\n\nRare power outage for Oilers\n\nThe Oilers entered the game as the NHL's No. 1 team on the power play and ended it scoreless with the man advantage for the first time this season when earning three or more power plays.\n\n\"Our goalie was our best player,\" Larkin said. \"We needed that.\"\n\nFilip Hronek added an empty-net goal late to seal a much-needed victory for the rebuilding Red Wings.\n\nMikko Koskinen stopped 25 shots for the Oilers, who have dropped four of their last five after opening the season 7-1.\n\nKoskinen, who entered 5-0, gave up two goals on the first seven shots he faced before keeping his team in the game.\n\nSpeedy forward Andreas Athanasiou had a pair of breakaways for Detroit and was denied each time by Koskinen.\n\n\"It's a heck of a lot harder to chase a game than it is to play with the lead,\" Oilers coach Dave Tippett said. \"That's just how this game is built right now. It's frustrating, but this wasn't a lack of effort. We've just got to find some scoring in our lineup somewhere.\"", "description": "Dylan Larkin and Patrik Nemeth scored in the first period, and the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Edmonton Oilers 3-1 Tuesday night to end an eight-game losing streak.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340542.1572402668!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/oilers-red-wings-hockey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
