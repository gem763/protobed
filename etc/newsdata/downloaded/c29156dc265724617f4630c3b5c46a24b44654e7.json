In the most recent poll of the contest, taken by Gravis in June, showed Bevin with a six-point lead. But last time Mason-Dixon surveyed the race, in December 2018, Beshear had a substantial advantage, leading the incumbent Republican 48 to 40 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a sitting GOP governor in a state continuing to shift to the right, Bevin has a bit of an advantage, so the poll comes as a bit of a surprise. But according to tracking data from Morning Consult, Bevin is the least popular governor in the country, and he has maintained a negative net-approval rating throughout most of his tenure.\n\nEven so, his approval rating has risen quite a bit since this time last year, despite having to weather a narrow primary challenge earlier this year. According to the new Mason-Dixon data, Bevin now has the support of more than 75 percent of Republicans, along with a surprising 22 percent of Democrats. Independent voters favor Beshear by eight points, 46 to 38 percent. Unsurprisingly, the Democrat has a substantial advantage in the urban and suburban areas around Louisville and Lexington; Bevin has a double-digit lead in both the eastern and western rural portions of the state.\n\nThe new poll also found that fewer than one-third of Kentucky voters support impeaching President Trump (29 percent) while more than two-thirds oppose impeachment (65 percent) and 6 percent are undecided. Among independent voters, those numbers remained nearly the same, with 30 percent supporting impeachment and 58 percent opposing it.", "description": "Republican incumbent Matt Bevin is facing a tough challenge from Democratic attorney general Andy Beshear.", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Kevin D.
