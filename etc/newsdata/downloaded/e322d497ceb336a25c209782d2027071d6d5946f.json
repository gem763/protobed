On the trading side equities revenue fell 7%, while foreign exchange, rates and credit revenue was steadier with just a 1% fall.\n\nUBS said it expects to take restructuring expenses of around $100 million in the fourth quarter related to structural changes it is making to the business, run by co-heads Piero Novelli and Robert Karofsky.\n\nMeasures include streamlining and merging its securities and trading activities and reducing headcount.\n\nOPERATIONAL GROWTH\n\nThe bank brought in net new money of $15.7 billion in its flagship wealth management business, as a sizeable jump in transaction-based income for the unit, newly under the joint management of long-time wealth management co-head Tom Naratil and former Credit Suisse star Iqbal Khan, saw a sizeable jump in transaction-based income, helped restore operational growth.\n\nShares in UBS opened 1.9% higher on wealth management strength.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at an office building in Zurich, Switzerland January 27, 2017.
