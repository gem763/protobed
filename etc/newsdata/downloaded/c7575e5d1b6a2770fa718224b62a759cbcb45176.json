If he thinks it\u2019s okay to emit far more emissions than our campaign is emitting, we\u2019re going to hold him to account for his hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nOn social media, the Tories lampooned Trudeau, writing: \u201cWhile Trudeau makes life unaffordable for Canadians with a carbon tax, he\u2019s personally jetting around the country with two high-emitting personal planes. Seriously.\u201d\n\nWhile Trudeau makes life unaffordable for Canadians with a carbon tax, he\u2019s personally jetting around the country with two high-emitting personal planes. Seriously. https://t.co/qDCNUqWpHv#cdnpoli #elxn43 pic.twitter.com/3ABEYPZjaw \u2014 Conservative Party (@CPC_HQ) October 3, 2019\n\nTory Alberta candidate Michelle Rempel Garner, who has long criticized the open-door policy of the Trudeau government that led to a recent surge in illegal immigration, also took the opportunity to roast the Liberal leader on social media.\n\n\u201c[For What It\u2019s Worth], as you all know I travel a lot for work. In fact, I\u2019m on the road right now. I can easily survive for ten days with the stuff in a small rollaboard and a backpack. No checked luggage or second plane required. Just sayin\u2026..\u201d she said.\n\nThe gaffe is just the latest for Trudeau on the campaign trail and comes just after he met Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg in Montreal for the global strike for climate event.\n\nTrudeau is still reeling from the blackface scandal last month that saw photos and videos released of him wearing blackface on multiple occasions. In one press conference, Trudeau admitted he had no idea how many times he had donned blackface in the past.\n\nWhat a time to be alive. https://t.co/T4FV1KSrfa \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) September 19, 2019", "description": "Opponents slammed\u00a0Canadian Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau as a hypocrite after it emerged that he was using two aeroplanes.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1074308908-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
