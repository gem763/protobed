David Boruchowitz said.\n\nArea 51 is the focus of events next weekend in the tiny towns of Rachel and Hiko inspired by a Facebook post inviting people to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d\n\nSavage, 21, and Granzier, 20, were arrested Tuesday on the misdemeanor charges after they were found in a car near a gate inside the Nevada National Security Site, authorities said.\n\nThey were at least 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) from Area 51.\n\nBoruchowitz said the men were released Thursday on $500 bail with no order to remain in the U.S. ahead of scheduled court appearances Monday.\n\nRecords did not reflect if they had attorneys to speak for them.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies said Savage and Granzier had a drone, computer and camera equipment and acknowledged they disregarded \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs.\n\nThe site is a U.S. Department of Energy reservation that is part of a vast government tract in central Nevada. It is separate from Area 51.\n\nThe Air Force has posted warnings that people who try to enter the Nellis Air Force Base bombing range surrounding Area 51 will be arrested.\n\nThe land surrounding the range is \u201caustere desert, with little to no life-sustaining services like water, food, gas or medical centers,\u201d Nellis spokesman Nick Janeway said\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two men from the Netherlands who said they wanted to post internet video of the once-secret Area 51 military base in Nevada were arrested on suspicion of trespassing onto a secure U.S. government reservation, sheriff's officials said Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/storm_area_51_event_09463_c0-204-5166-3216_s1770x1032.jpg?b966887ab22045623249a64510add15903935b60", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
