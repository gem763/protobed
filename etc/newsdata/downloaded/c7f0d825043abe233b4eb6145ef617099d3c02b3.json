Because of this, he believes that \u201cit\u2019s natural that they would both embrace USD-backed stablecoins for their own government services.\u201d\n\nHe also claims that this Bermuda\u2019s initiative highlights that the world is on its path towards mainstream acceptance of stablecoins for everyday payments and commerce.\n\nA comprehensive regulatory crypto framework\n\nCircle also announced that the firm has been awarded a \u201cClass F\u201d license under Bermuda\u2019s Digital Assets Business Act (DABA) of 2018. The company claims that this license makes the company the first major cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service ever to receive such a permit. Allaire commented:\n\n\u201cThrough the DABA, Bermuda is one of the first countries in the world to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital currency and digital asset-based products and services, including licensing of firms operating payment systems using stablecoins. It will be interesting to see how other governments will respond to this fundamental innovation.\u201d\n\nUSDC was launched about a year ago by Circle in partnership with major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Coinbase now allows holders of USDC to earn a 1.25% annual percentage yield.", "description": "Bermuda became the first government to accept stablecoin USDC for tax payments, according to global financial services company Circle", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvM2ZlMjZlMGY5MDRlNWU3M2NjNTZlYTc4OGU4NzAxYjAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
