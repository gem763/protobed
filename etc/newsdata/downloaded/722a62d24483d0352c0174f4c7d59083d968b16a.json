There is no rigid definition of the words, but there are some general attributes for each. A college is typically a four-year school that offers undergraduate degrees like an associate or a bachelor\u2019s. (Community colleges are often two-year schools.) They don\u2019t typically offer master\u2019s or doctorates, and the size of their student body is typically the smaller of the two.\n\n\u5c3d\u7ba1university\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u4e2d\u5386\u53f2\u66f4\u60a0\u4e45\uff0c\u65e9\u572813\u4e16\u7eaa\u5c31\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u5317\u7f8e\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u5374\u4e3b\u8981\u7528college\u6765\u6307\u4ee3\u5927\u591a\u6570\u9ad8\u6821\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6ca1\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u5317\u7f8e\u7684college\u4e00\u822c\u6307\u63d0\u4f9b\u672c\u79d1\u5b66\u4f4d\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u51c6\u5b66\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u6216\u5b66\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff09\u7684\u56db\u5e74\u5236\u5927\u5b66\u3002\uff08\u793e\u533a\u5b66\u9662\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e24\u5e74\u5236\u9ad8\u6821\uff09\u3002College\u4e00\u822c\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7855\u58eb\u6216\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u5e38\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709university\u5927\u3002\n\nUniversities, on the other hand, tend to offer both undergraduate and graduate programs leading to advanced degrees for a larger group of students. They can also be comprised of several schools\u2014referred to as colleges\u2014under their umbrella. A university could offer both a school of arts and sciences and a school of business. The University of Michigan has a College of Engineering, for example.\n\nUniversity\u5219\u4e00\u822c\u90fd\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u672c\u79d1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b66\u4f4d\u3002University\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5305\u542bcollege\uff0c \u5373\u5b66\u9662\u3002\u4e00\u6240university\u65d7\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u827a\u672f\u5b66\u9662\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u9662\u548c\u5546\u5b66\u9662\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66\uff08university\uff09\u65d7\u4e0b\u5c31\u6709\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\uff08college\uff09\u3002\n\nWhile many of these traits are common, they\u2019re not guaranteed. Some colleges can be bigger than universities, some might offer master\u2019s degrees, and so on. To complicate matters further, an institution that fits the criteria of a university might choose to call itself a college. Both Dartmouth College and Boston College qualify as universities but use the college label owing to tradition. Schools may begin as colleges, grow into universities, but retain the original name.\n\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u8005\u95f4\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6709\u4f8b\u5916\u3002\u4e00\u4e9bcollege\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4university\u8fd8\u5927\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9bcollege\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u3002\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u7b26\u5408university\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u6821\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u79f0\u4e3acollege\u3002\u8fbe\u7279\u8305\u65af\u5b66\u9662\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u987f\u5b66\u9662\u90fd\u7b26\u5408university\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u51fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u539f\u56e0\u800c\u4f7f\u7528college\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u9ad8\u6821\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u662fcollege\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u6210university\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6765\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u3002\n\nPeople tend to think of a university as being more prestigious or harder to get into, but there are too many variables to make that determination at a glance. Some colleges might ask more of applicants than universities. Some universities might be smaller than certain colleges. Either one can be public or private.\n\n\u4eba\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u8ba4\u4e3auniversity\u66f4\u6709\u58f0\u671b\u66f4\u96be\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u4e0d\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u540d\u79f0\u6765\u4ed3\u4fc3\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\u592a\u591a\u3002\u4e00\u4e9bcollege\u5bf9\u7533\u8bf7\u8005\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u6bd4university\u8fd8\u8981\u9ad8\u3002\u6709\u4e9buniversity\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u67d0\u4e9bcollege\u8fd8\u5c0f\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6821\u90fd\u65e2\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u516c\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u79c1\u7acb\u7684\u3002\n\nIn the UK, students go off to university (or uni) instead of college.
