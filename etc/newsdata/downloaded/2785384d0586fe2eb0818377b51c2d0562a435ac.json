Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui also said her \u201cimpression\u201d is that Kim \u201chas lost the will to engage in deal-making\u201d with the U.S.\n\nBetween the lines: North Korea\u2019s demands on sanctions relief still went far beyond what was likely to be accepted in exchange for limited steps toward denuclearization.\n\nJung Pak, a former CIA analyst now at Brookings, emails that Trump \u201cdemonstrating his desire for substantive actions on denuclearization was important because Kim has been ignoring U.S. negotiators and banking on his personal appeals to Trump, whom he probably judged was more malleable.\u201d\n\nWhile the abrupt ending of the summit was a surprise, the absence of a major breakthrough was not.\n\nJim Walsh, an international security expert at MIT who has negotiated with North Korea, says the two sides \u201csquandered their time since Singapore,\u201d adding: \u201cIt took 2 years of intense, regular negotiation to get the Iran deal. And Iran is easier. \u2026 So no, 30 days and winging it isn\u2019t going to get it done.\u201d\n\nan international security expert at MIT who has negotiated with North Korea, says the two sides \u201csquandered their time since Singapore,\u201d adding: \u201cIt took 2 years of intense, regular negotiation to get the Iran deal.

But Trump went ahead with the summit anyway out of a heady mix of hubris and ignorance.\u201d\n\nThe question now is whether this was a bump in the road or if we\u2019ve now veered entirely off course.\n\nBruce Klingner, a former CIA official now at Heritage, isn't expecting a return to fire and fury in the short term, given Kim \"promised not to resume nuclear or missile testing\" \u2014 at least according to Trump \u2014 and the U.S. has shown no interest in \"activity that could trigger a strong North Korean response.\"\n\na former CIA official now at Heritage, isn't expecting a return to fire and fury in the short term, given Kim \"promised not to resume nuclear or missile testing\" \u2014 at least according to Trump \u2014 and the U.S. has shown no interest in \"activity that could trigger a strong North Korean response.\" \u201cThe negotiations will resume sooner or later, and the misfortune in Hanoi might impart a different kind of momentum to what is destined to be a fluctuating, arduous diplomatic process,\" Gi-Wook Shin of Stanford University writes for Axios Expert Voices.\n\nBehind the scenes: For the South Koreans and anyone banking on positive momentum, this was a bad outcome. As Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan points out, hawks like John Bolton won\u2019t share that disappointment.\n\nThe bottom line: \u201cNow that many of the critics ... have got what they wanted \u2014 a tougher approach to North Korea \u2014 they have to accept the consequences, whatever they may be,\u201d write Joel Wit and Jenny Town of 38 North.\n\nCorrection: This post has been corrected to reflect the fact that Choe Son-hui is North Korea's vice foreign minister, not its foreign minister.", "description": "Reading between the lines of no deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Eb2eeyYpW-Kt6mLdQcn1htW9F_4=/0x332:4332x2769/1920x1080/2019/03/01/1551401536047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-01"}
