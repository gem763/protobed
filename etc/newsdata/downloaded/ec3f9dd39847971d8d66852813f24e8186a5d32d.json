For us to do well the outcome only has to be bad, not terrible,\u201d Mr Nayak said.\n\nThe investment case for energy is based around three pillars of thought. First, growth in electric vehicles is overstated and petrol cars will be with us for a long time. Second, the economics of swing producers such as shale are more marginal than most think.\n\nAnd third, estimates of stranded resources are overblown. Most major energy companies do not have assets that will last longer than 12 years, according to Allan Gray. They will produce solid cash flow right up until then, enabling them to return your investment over that period.\n\nMr Nayak used the weighting of the energy sector in the S &P 500 to prove his point, saying it was at a 30-year low despite the oil price running at roughly double the level it was at in 2016.\n\nHe also laid out the investment case for AMP, the embattled financial services firm which has been on the receiving end from many of its shareholders, including Allan Gray\u2019s chief investment offer Simon Mawhinney who asked if the company\u2019s strategy was the product of a \u201cbrain explosion\u201d.\n\nAMP is is among the firm's top 10 holdings of both its stable fund and its Australian equity fund.\n\nEarlier this month, respected Australian-listed investment company AFIC revealed it had sold out of AMP after managing director Mark Freeman decided the firm no longer had a competitive advantage over rivals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Nayak said on his estimates there was around $1 billion of value in the business that is not reflected in the market capitalisation, after a sum of parts valuation that ascribed zero to the wealth management business.\n\n\u201cAs I said earlier, stocks are already priced for certain outcomes and in the case of AMP they are priced for a terrible outcome,'' he said. \"Most people think things will be pretty bad, and I wouldn\u2019t disagree, but we think there is enough valuation support to justify our valuation.\u201d\n\nAllan Gray said often when it buys companies the catalysts for a turnaround aren\u2019t evident.\n\nThe late Allan Gray portfolio manager Simon Marais was known to say \u201cthe best catalyst is no catalyst\u201d, making the point that if an inflexion point could be seen then you would never get a bargain.", "description": "Contrarian investors known for buying the most unloved stocks on the ASX have a new target.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/41c85bdc40dbfc7bd9f8238b60da7c4c3fc662c3", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
