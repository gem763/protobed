Did you know?\u201d Margaret Brennan asked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why I should know. There is a tradition of common courtesy of presidents informing their predecessors of things of significance like this,\u201d Rice answered.\n\n\u201cSince the White House seemingly didn\u2019t feel it necessary to inform the leadership of the intelligence committees on a bipartisan basis, I\u2019m quite confident that they didn\u2019t do the normal protocol with respect to predecessors either,\u201d she added.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonexaminer.Com News Susan-Rice-Trump-Should-Have-Notified-Obama-Ahead-Of-Baghdadi-Raid"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
