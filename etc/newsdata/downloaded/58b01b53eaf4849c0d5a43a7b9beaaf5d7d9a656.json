Join us at the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and co-operation. And let's make Brexit work for both sides.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"We are leaving in 25 days. We can do it with a deal if the EU is willing. But they should be under no illusions or misapprehensions. There will be no more dither.\n\n\"No more delay. On October 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\"\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar gave a glimmer of hope to Mr Johnson as he said a deal could be secured in the next two weeks, but he cautioned the current proposals do not form the basis for \"deeper negotiations\".", "description": "It is claimed the Prime Minister will challenge any moves to remove him and is prepared to \"squat\" in Downing Street", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Pa", "Samir Hussein Wireimage", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20169030.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FILE-PHOTO-Boris-Johnson-arrives-at-Buckingham-Palace-in-London-for-an-audience-with-Queen-Elizabet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
