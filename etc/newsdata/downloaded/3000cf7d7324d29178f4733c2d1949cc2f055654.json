(Photo: Europol)\n\nEuropol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union, released a list of women fugitives on Saturday \u2014 from convicted murderers, to human sex traffickers \u2014 as part of its new \"Crime has No Gender\" campaign.\n\nThe women-centric campaign drew criticism after Europol spokesperson Claire Georges said the organization \"wanted to show that women are just as likely to commit violent crimes as men.\"\n\n\"Even though the discourse is often around 'male fugitives,' women can be just as bad,\" she said.\n\nThe campaign, aimed at driving up web traffic in hopes of catching criminals, shows fugitives with a digital mask, obscuring their gender, which falls away as viewers scroll down the individual bio.\n\n\"Who is hiding under the mask,\" the website asks.\n\nThe website teases the new campaign by asking, \"Are women equally as capable of committing serious crimes as men?\"\n\nIt answers itself by declaring: \"The female fugitives featured on Europe\u2019s Most Wanted website prove that they are. The criminals \u2013 of both genders \u2013 in this new campaign by EU law enforcement are all wanted for grave offenses like murder, drug trafficking, fraud, theft and trafficking in human beings.\"\n\nEuropol said it asked 21 of its 28 EU members countries to select one of their most wanted fugitives.\n\n\"Many studies have examined how gender plays a role in crime,\" Europol says. \"The majority of those looked at the gender of the victim but less often at that of the offender. However, in recent decades, the number of women engaged in criminal activity has increased, although at a slower pace than men.\"\n\nEuropol says one possible explanation is that \"that technological progress and social norms have liberated women from the home, increasing their participation in the crime market.\"\n\nThose making the list included:\n\n\u2022 Elena Puzyrevich, 39, a Russian national wanted for luring young women to Spain under false pretenses and forcing them to work as prostitutes;\n\nA screen grab from the Europol website shows wanted fugitives.

Europol says Kelly tortured the driver by cutting off his ear, beating him repeatedly with an iron bar and a sledgehammer and burning his leg with a blowtorch.\n\nIn response to the campaign, the Independent, a British newspaper, noted that the latest Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that 74% of perpetrators of violent crimes are male.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/19/women-fugitives-europol-posts-crime-has-no-gender-most-wanted-list/4035979002/", "description": "Europol teases the\u00a0new campaign\u00a0by asking, 'Are women equally as capable of committing serious crimes as men?'", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Published P.M.
