Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told reporters in Florida that it wasn't \"a real request\" and Trump was \u201cjust needling the press.\" Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) followed suit on Sunday, saying on CBS, \u201cI doubt the China comment was serious.\u201d\n\nStill, some Republicans have split from that line of defense, the most recent being Maine Sen. Susan Collins who on Saturday said Trump made a \u201cbig mistake by asking China to get involved.\u201d She is the third Republican senator to publicly criticize the president on this matter, joining Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney and Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/39/a8/b6c0062940f5a41ebfdff8315d0a/20191006-jim-jordan-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
