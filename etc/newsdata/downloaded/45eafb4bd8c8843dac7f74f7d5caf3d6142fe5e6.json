News.\n\nTalking to the Mail on Sunday, he said, \"I decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghan's friends in People magazine,\" he said.\n\n\"I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn't seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\"\n\nThomas was referring to an interview in People with Meghan's inner circle in which they claimed Thomas is choosing to communicate through the press.\n\n\"After the wedding, she wrote him a letter. She's like, 'Dad, I'm so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimizing me through the media so we can repair our relationship.'\" they said in February when the letter was first published.\n\n\"He writes her a really long letter in return, and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her. And she feels like, 'That's the opposite of what I'm saying. I'm telling you I don't want to communicate through the media, and you're asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said?' It's almost like they're ships passing.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday said Thomas denied any claims that he requested and received payment for the excerpts he sent them and said instead that he wants to repair his relationship with Meghan.\n\n\"I don't recognize the person who wrote the letter, but I still love my daughter,\" Thomas told The Mail on Sunday. \"All it would take is one phone call, and most of this craziness would stop.\"\n\nAccording to Meghan's friends though, he has yet to make that call. \"He knows how to get in touch with her. He\u2019s never called; he\u2019s never texted. It\u2019s super-painful.\"\n\nREAD NEXT: Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan file multiple lawsuits against the British press \u2013 and Piers Morgan could be next", "description": "Thomas Markle recently opened up in new interview about his choice to publish Meghan's letter.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9420/f33c83a0147849bb93a9ca706aef4c42.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
