She said her group \u201cwill continue to stand with President Trump and support his fight for the soul of our country.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nACT was founded in 2007. Its leaders, who claim to have more than 1 million members, have labeled Islam a \u201ccancer\u201d and spread theories of a secret plot by Muslims, Democrats, communists and the media to destroy the country from within. They have sponsored lectures on how to monitor and oppose U.S. mosques.\n\nAD\n\nTheir event at Mar-a-Lago was advertised as a dinner gala featuring conservative speaker Michelle Malkin. Tickets began at $1,500, according to an archived version of the event website.\n\nAD\n\nThat event appeared to be an example of a long-term trend at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s social club, banquet hall and winter residence in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump\u2019s divisive presidency has driven away many of his longtime banquet clients, including charities such as the American Red Cross.\n\nIn their place, Mar-a-Lago has attracted new clients \u2014 supporters of Trump\u2019s politics: Republican fundraisers, gatherings of Trump superfans called \u201cTrumpettes\u201d and galas held by conservative Christian groups.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s last financial disclosure showed that Mar-a-Lago\u2019s income had fallen 10 percent in 2018.\n\nIt was unclear if ACT for America had organized events at Trump\u2019s hotels before. In 2018, Gabriel was the guest of honor at an event put on by another group, the Virginia Women for Trump, at the president\u2019s D.C. hotel, according to social media posts.\n\nThis is the second time in recent months that the Trump Organization has booked a major event at one of its clubs, only to cancel after a public outcry. The first was in July, when Trump\u2019s Doral golf club canceled a planned golf tournament organized by a Miami-area strip club.\n\nAD", "description": "In a statement, the founder of the group, which has called Islam a \u201ccancer,\u201d said it still supports the president.", "authors": ["David A.
