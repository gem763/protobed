It\u2019s untrue.\u2019\n\nUxbridge in west London - traditionally a true blue seat - has been represented by Mr Johnson since 2015.\n\nWhen he first stood, he clocked up a respectable majority of 10,695.\n\nBut in Theresa May\u2019s disastrous election of 2017, this had halved to 5,034. A similar decline in his vote this time would see him lose his seat.\n\nLabour has chosen Ali Milani, a 25-year-old Muslim as their candidate to succeed him.\n\nNo sitting prime minister has lost his seat in an election in modern times.\n\nThe nearest example is Tory leader Arthur Balfour who lost his seat in January 1906. However he had already resigned as prime minister along with his entire government in December 1905.\n\nLabour has chosen Ali Milani, 25, as their candidate to succeed Mr Johnson. No sitting prime minister has lost his seat in an election in modern times\n\nOn Monday, Labour MP Stephen Doughty said he had heard Mr Johnson was looking at safer seats such as Sevenoaks, which is currently held by departing former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon.\n\nHe said: \u2018Is he aware of the interesting rumour that has reached my ears that the Prime Minister might be planning not to stand in his own constituency at an upcoming general election, and that he has apparently instead lined up Sevenoaks or East Yorkshire?\u2019\n\nMr Doughty had to apologise for citing East Yorkshire, because the MP for that seat - Greg Knight - is not retiring.", "description": "The Prime Minister is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.
