It\u2019s obvious that the Euro is more than likely going to continue drifting lower, as we have seen such significant selling pressure over the longer-term. Granted, it\u2019s been a very choppy ride lower but it does make sense that we continue to see negativity based on the fact that bond yields in the European Union are almost all negative at this point so therefore it makes more sense to put money in the United States for larger institutions. Beyond that, we also have to worry about Germany going into recession as it is hanging on by a thread, and of course Italy is already there.\n\nEUR/USD Video 30.09.19\n\nTo the downside, breaking below the 1.09 level would be the next trigger for fresh money coming into the downside, pressing toward the 100% Fibonacci retracement level which is closer to the 1.04 handle. Granted, it\u2019s going to take forever to get there, because this pair doesn\u2019t necessarily move that quick. That being said though, I do expect to see back-and-forth trading and an opportunity to fade rallies every time they appear. Simple patience will be needed to take advantage of the market once it\u2019s gone a little too far to the upside as the trend and all of the reasons for it are still firmly ensconced.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Euro rallied a bit during the trading session after initially falling on Friday, but has turned around to give back quite a bit of the gains already. In other words, this looks like a market that is certainly going to eventually go lower, and the fundamentals would suggest that should be the case", "authors": ["Christopher Lewis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
