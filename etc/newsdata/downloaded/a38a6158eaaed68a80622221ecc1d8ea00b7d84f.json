The new SDK will reportedly tackle the two-fold challenge of bolstering security and building mobile-compatible DApps.\n\nAs commentators have been swift to claim, the new Tron integration means that APIs for all tokens conforming to the TRC10 or 20 standards \u2014 as well as Tron-based DApps \u2014 are poised to become accessible to anyone with the Blockchain Keystore among Samsung\u2019s near-one billion global smartphone user base.\n\nJustin Sun, the CEO of Tron \u2014 which positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum (ETH) by coupling decentralized finance with a wider decentralized internet ecosystem \u2014 had this week attempted to fuel hype by hinting at an undisclosed partnership with an allegedly \u201chundred billion USD megacorporation.\u201d\n\nAs of August 2019, Samsung reportedly has a market value of $272.4 billion, according to Statista.\n\nSun had also claimed the partnership would \u201cbroadly distribute TRON Dapps and tokens to billions of customers.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese blockchain market\n\nAs reported, Tron has recently dislodged Ether (ETH) from the second spot on the latest crypto rankings report from China\u2019s state-backed tech workgroup, the Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID).\n\nYesterday, TRX reported gains of as high as 25% against the U.S. dollar, perhaps due to a combination of Sun\u2019s provocative announcement and a milestone endorsement of blockchain technology from Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe latter prompted an explosion of domestic interest in Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain, according to WeChat search data, as well as a boom in blockchain company shares on the Chinese stock markets.", "description": "South Korean technology conglomerate Samsung has integrated Tron support to its decentralized app store, Blockchain Keystore", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGNlZmU5NGIwZjAxOTI0OWFmNmJlMzk5MWQxZWQ3NGYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
