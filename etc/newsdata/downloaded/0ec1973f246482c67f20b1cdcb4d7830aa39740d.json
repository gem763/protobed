And it\u2019s a safe bet that this will confuse a lot of Trump supporters.\n\nSoros has traditionally been a boogeyman for the right wing of the U.S. Republican Party, spawning conspiracy theories across the web that Soros is trying to \u201creplace\u201d white people in America by encouraging immigration to the U.S., among a host of other things.\n\nTrump supporters, including some white supremacist terrorists, have used this \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d theory to justify their horrific attacks against people of colour.\n\nSoros, a billionaire investor and Holocaust survivor known for contributing to liberal U.S. causes, uses the op-ed to call China a \u201cdangerous rival\u201d to the U.S. in areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning. Soros celebrates the fact that the Trump regime has placed Huawei on the so-called Entity List and says that Trump\u2019s actions against China have been the \u201cgreatest \u2014 and perhaps only \u2014 foreign policy accomplishment of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nBut Soros is concerned that President Trump may ultimately \u201csell out\u201d the U.S. by including Huawei in some kind of trade deal that will weaken prohibitions against American companies doing business with the Chinese tech giant\u2014strengthening Huawei\u2019s position in 5G infrastructure around the globe.\n\nFrom the WSJ:\n\nLast year [Trump] lifted restrictions on ZTE, Huawei\u2019s smaller rival, after it had evaded U.S. sanctions. If he gives Huawei a similar break, removing it from the entity list as part of a trade deal, the company could consolidate its leading position in the 5G market. It\u2019s hard to know exactly what\u2019s motivating Mr. Trump, but he appears desperate for a deal with President Xi to bolster the U.S. stock market and economy to improve his chances at re-election \u2014 putting his electoral interests ahead of America\u2019s interests. Congress must prevent this from happening. Mr. Trump\u2019s own Defence Department and National Security Council recognise the grave threat Huawei poses. If Republicans allow Mr. Trump to bail out the Communist Party-run telecom giant, they will be abdicating their most basic democratic responsibilities.\n\nSoros is hedging his bets about Trump, but the op-ed will probably leave many Trump supporters confused about whether to continue calling Soros a danger to America. One Trump supporter, widely known as the MAGA bomber, even put a pipe bomb in Soros\u2019 mailbox in late 2018. The MAGA bomber, Cesar Sayoc, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his pipe bombs, which were also sent to Hillary Clinton, CNN, and former CIA chief John Brennan, among others.\n\nTrump, a white supremacist who often uses coded language to inflame his supporters against Jewish people, has even mentioned Soros by name on various occasions. During Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination hearing, for example, Trump said that protesters were being paid by people like George Soros.\n\n\u201cThe very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don\u2019t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love!\u201d Trump tweeted on October 5, 2018.\n\nAnd when Trump held an impromptu rally in the East Wing of the White House later that month, one of his supporters shouted \u201cSoros\u201d after the president decried the \u201cglobalists\u201d who were working against the American people. Others shouted \u201clock him up\u201d and President Trump laughed before saying \u201clock him up\u201d himself.\n\nBut we\u2019ll see how long the Soros-Trump love affair lasts. As Soros says in the op-ed, Trump should use \u201cHuawei\u2019s status on the table as one of his bargaining chips\u201d in a trade deal with China, but everything is always on the table with Trump. The president would sell out his own kids if it made him a buck. And with recent revelations that the CIA decided to extract a high level spy from Russia because they were concerned Trump might reveal highly classified intelligence, we know where the U.S. president\u2019s loyalties rest.\n\nIt\u2019s not with the American people \u2014 it\u2019s with himself and anything that will make him money in the long run.", "description": "George Soros praised Donald Trump\u2019s strong stance against China and the telecom giant Huawei Tuesday in a new op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.
