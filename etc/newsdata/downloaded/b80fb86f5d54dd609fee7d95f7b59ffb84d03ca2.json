Though the president was reportedly adamant that the exchange not be called a quid pro quo, it doesn\u2019t matter what it was labeled, since it apparently was, in fact, a quid pro quo. Nor does the excuse that Trump was simply trying to use American leverage to fight corruption stand up. The president was seeking to aid his own personal reelection prospects using American statecraft as leverage\u2014a clear abuse of power. (It\u2019s also still possible that the administration broke the law by trying to hold up the funds.) Nor can the president claim ignorance of the scheme, since multiple witnesses have attested to his personal involvement.\n\n\u201cThe president used the machinery of government to advance his private interests instead of his own administration\u2019s public policy,\u201d Daniel Fried, a former State Department official in Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote in an email. \u201cTaylor\u2019s statement outlines in devastating detail that there was indeed a presidential-mandated \u2018quid pro quo,\u2019 that the substance of the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship was to be made conditional on the Ukrainians acting on behalf of the president\u2019s partisan interests.\u201d\n\nWith this information in hand, Democrats have little choice but to vote to impeach. They just have to decide, as my colleague Elaine Godfrey reports, when and on what specific issues.\n\nAny impeachment of a president is an epochal event. Yet this realization is especially surprising because of how quickly it has come. As the drip of evidence has turned into a steady stream over the past two weeks, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of how much the ground has shifted.\n\nLess than one month ago, on September 24, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was launching an \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry.\u201d At the time, that seemed like a potentially risky move. What led Pelosi to act was that a group of moderate Democratic representatives who had been reluctant to impeach announced that they supported an impeachment inquiry\u2014not necessarily articles of impeachment, or a vote to impeach, but a simple inquiry.\n\nA probe made sense, since the public, and Congress, knew very little about the matter in question. There was a whistle-blower complaint about the president\u2019s behavior, and the White House had been refusing to release it, but the substance of the complaint was still mostly unknown. The White House had not yet released the transcript of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had been relatively open about his muckraking in Ukraine, but the extent of his hijacking of U.S. foreign policy was unknown. More than half the country opposed impeachment (51.2 percent on average, per FiveThirtyEight), and less than 39 percent of the country backed it.", "description": "The testimony of William Taylor confirmed that what seemed improbable just a few weeks ago is now all but certain.", "authors": ["David A.
