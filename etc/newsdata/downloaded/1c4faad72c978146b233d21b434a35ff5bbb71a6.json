Max Rose\u2019s (D-NY) office over his newfound support of the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry.\n\nRose \u2013 who represents New York\u2019s 11th district, which Trump won by ten percentage points in 2016 \u2013 recently caved and announced his support for an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI will support and I will defend the United States Constitution, and it is for that reason that I intend to fully support this impeachment inquiry and follow the facts,\u201d he told supporters at a town hall last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna follow these facts wherever they lead, no matter the consequences,\u201d he added.\n\nProtesters \u2013 who chanted \u201cHey, hey! Ho, ho! Max Rose has got to go!\u2013 swarmed his office on Monday alongside Staten Island GOP Chairman Brendan Lantry and New York State Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy.\n\n\u201cThe president won this district by almost 11 percentage points, the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn and this district spoke loud and clear, (Rose) is going to face a wrath of those constituents next November, mark my words,\u201d Langworthy said at the protest, according to MSN.\n\nLantry added:\n\nInstead of focusing on doing his job and focusing on the important issues like improving our infrastructure, making New York competitive despite oppressive taxes and regulations, or lowering the cost of prescription drugs, Max fell in line with the most radical elements of the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting the left is questioning our decision of whom we voted for,\u201d one voter said:\n\n\u201cMax Rose\u2019s constituents overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump, but Max just can\u2019t let it go: he\u2019s absolutely obsessed with impeaching Trump and overturning his constituents\u2019 choice in the 2016 election,\u201d Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) spokesman Calvin Moore said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMax Rose has no intention of delivering on any of the issues voters elected him on, as long as he can team up with radical left for one more Hail Mary pass at removing Trump from office, no matter the cost,\u201d he added.\n\nRose defended his decision to back the inquiry on Monday.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fight our enemies overseas so that our leaders would invite them to interfere in our elections back home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see the Republican Party put China and Russia ahead of America,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy job is to get the facts, not play politics \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nRose is not the only lawmaker who has faced protests over support for the impeachment inquiry. Protesters surrounded Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at the Reno airport last week, demanding her to \u201cstop the impeachment\u201d of Trump:\n\nNevadans greeted @ewarren in Reno and let them know exactly how they feel about the Democrats\u2019 despicable attempt to impeach @realDonaldTrump and undo the 2016 election.
