The workout was released, and immediately the two heavyweights went toe-to-toe live at the Rogue Iron Games. Few expected Panchik to win, but he cruised to victory by pacing himself on the burpees and targeting the barbell.\n\nThe pair had to complete a tough 10 rounds of two exercises \u2013 lifting a 95lb barbell from the ground over head, 10 times. Then, 10 bar-facing burpees. They had complete both 10 rep sets, 10 times, in 15 minutes. Both finished with around eight minutes to spare.\n\n\u201cIt [pain] set in right around [set] two or three,\u201d Panchik said. \u201cI was just trying to think about being smooth.\u201d\n\nHe advised other competitors to pick one of the movements to focus on, and use the other to recover.\n\nFroning echoed his words: \u201cIt\u2019s minimising those transitions. Scott was a lot quicker on that bar, maybe a bit slower on the those burpees but he\u2019d get right back on the bar.\u201d\n\nJust before the match up, Froning announced that Panchik would be the latest addition to his team CrossFit Mayhem. The team has won four CrossFit Game titles, the latest coming in 2019.\n\nCrossFit Open 20.1 workout\n\n10 rounds for time of:\n\nEight barbell ground-to-overheads, Men: 95lb. Women: 65lb.
