They have now subpoenaed both OMB and Defense department heads for related documents.\n\nHouse Democrats dropped the hammer on Donald Trump's secretary of defense and budget chief on Monday, as they moved into the next phase of their impeachment inquiry\n\nDemocrats chairing three House committees - Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight - issued the subpoenas.\n\n'The enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the Committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,' the chairman wrote.\n\nThe committee chairman last week subpoenaed the White House for communications with Ukraine, including notes and transcripts from the president's calls with Volodymyr Zelensky since his counterpart in Kiev's April election.\n\nThey've demanded documents from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as testimony from Giuliani associates and State Department officials.\n\nThey expect to hear from two key figures in a whistle-blower complaint about Trump's conduct this week in a private deposition. They last week heard private testimony from former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nVolker resigned shortly after the committee chairs said they intended to subpoena testimony from he and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.\n\nHouse Democrats are subpoenaing witnesses and documents related to the president's call with with Volodymyr Zelensky, who won Ukraine's April presidential election\n\nTrump asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and the Democrat's son for potential corruption in a conversation about military assistance\n\nThe former diplomat subsequently turned over 60 pages of documents, including text messages in which he appeared to be promising a White House visit to Zelensky, if the Ukrainian government agreed to to investigation Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nDemocrats are demanding information from OMB about Trump's decision in August to block military aid to Ukraine. He released the money after a bipartisan outcry on Capitol Hill, but Democrats say he may have been engaged in pay for play.\n\nThey say Trump inappropriately suggested on a July 25 call with Zelensky that further aid would be contingent on cooperation with the proposed investigation into the Biden family.\n\nTrump says there was 'no quid pro quo' and his call with Zelensky was 'perfect.'\n\nRather than back away from the behavior that led congressional Democrats to launch their investigation, he doubled down last week on called on China to launch a similar probe into the son of the former vice president and possible 2020 general election opponent.", "description": "House Democrats dropped the hammer on Donald Trump's secretary of defense and budget chief on Monday, as they moved into the next phase of their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19408716-0-image-a-15_1570473100085.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
