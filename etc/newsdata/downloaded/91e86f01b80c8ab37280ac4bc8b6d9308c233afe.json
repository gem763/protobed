Among the co-sponsors was the majority leader, Mr. McConnell, who, in a floor speech before the committee\u2019s vote, declared himself \u201cproud\u201d to support the measure.\n\nTo say this was a welcome surprise would be an understatement. Mr. McConnell has spent the past year-plus blocking multiple bipartisan proposals for election security. This despite warnings from the intelligence community and others that American elections remain vulnerable to outside interference. In his testimony before Congress on Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential race, Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, stressed that Russia was still \u201cdoing it as we sit here\u201d even as other foreign actors were poised to do the same.\n\nIn the wake of Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony, critics cranked up the pressure on Mr. McConnell, mocking him as a \u201cRussian asset\u201d and dubbing him \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d Social media went wild for the nickname. The ordinarily impervious Mr. McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, was not amused and proclaimed himself a victim of modern-day McCarthyism.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s team says he\u2019s on board with this new plan because it gives money directly to the states, with few strings attached . Others see that as a problem.", "description": "Even if it took a taunt to do it, he approved $250 million for voting protections.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/opinion/sunday/20mitch/20mitch-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
