Friday will mark Meir\u2019s first spacewalk. The ISS has seen more than 200 spacewalks since 1998.\n\nThe March spacewalk was called off because astronaut Ann McClain needed a medium spacesuit but only a large was available. Due to safety issues with the fit she did not participate.\n\n\u201cWe must never accept a risk that can instead be mitigated,\u201d she said on Twitter after the event. \u201cSafety of the crew and execution of the mission come first.\u201d\n\nAt the time the cancellation drew widespread criticism, including from former U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton and global activism group March for Science.\n\nWoman spacewalks date to July, 1984 when Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya became the first to do so. Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov conducted history\u2019s first spacewalk in 1965.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The International Space Station (ISS) crew member Christina Koch of the U.S. gestures after donning space suits shortly before their launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan March 14, 2019.
