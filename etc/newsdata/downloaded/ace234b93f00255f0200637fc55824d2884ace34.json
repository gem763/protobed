It's very disappointing.\n\n'Boris wanted it in there but the people around him showed a lack of interest in having it included in the Queen's Speech.'\n\nGeneral Lord Dannatt, a former chief of the general staff, said he is 'very disappointed' at the move.\n\nGeneral Lord Dannatt (pictured), a former chief of the general staff, said he is 'very disappointed' at the move\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'It is a really major issue here which the Government has got to address.\n\n'It is unacceptable that serving soldiers, particularly large numbers of former soldiers, run the risk of prosecution as a result of operations conducted worldwide and including in Northern Ireland.\n\n'Nobody is above the law. If soldiers have broken the law and if there is evidence to back up charges against them, then of course they must face the rigours of the law and take the consequences.\n\n'But in the vast majority of cases, British soldiers, particularly in the campaign in Northern Ireland, got up in the morning to do their duty to keep the peace according to the rules of engagement we had, in sharp contrast to terrorists who got up in the morning whose aim was to maim and kill.'\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'It is a really major issue here which the Government has got to address'\n\nWhen former soldier and veterans minister Johnny Mercer was asked on Twitter what he thought of the news, he replied: 'Let's see.'\n\nHe later added: 'Lots of noise on this this morning. Boris has made it clear - repeated and vexatious litigation against troops - including Northern Ireland - will end.\n\n'He tasked me personally with it on appointment; that direction has not changed in any way.'\n\nChiefs at the MoD are understood to want to extend a ten-year statute of limitations for the vets as talks with Number 10 continue ahead of Monday's speech.\n\nA No10 spokesman said: 'The PM has been clear that we need to end the unfair trials of people who served their country when no new evidence has been produced and when the accusations have already been exhaustively questioned in court.\n\n'There are different views on how to move forward and effectively address the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland - that said, we are determined to make progress and legislate on the issue of legacy prosecutions.\n\n'Our clear and overriding objective remains to provide a better way to address the past for all those affected by the Troubles \u2013 the Northern Ireland Office has consulted on the question of legacy prosecutions and we are engaging with the main parties in Northern Ireland, MPs in Westminster and wider society across Northern Ireland on the issue.\n\n'This is so that we can reach a broad consensus and set out detailed, balanced and fair proposals on the best way forward.'\n\nThe Northern Ireland office is believed to feel unsure over any amnesty for former Troubles soldiers without agreement in Stormont.\n\nThere are understood to be four former Army servicemen facing prosecution for murder and attempted murder during conflict, with up to 200 veterans under investigation.", "description": "Boris Johnson (pictured) had promised to end the pursuit of soldiers over historic allegations of offences.
