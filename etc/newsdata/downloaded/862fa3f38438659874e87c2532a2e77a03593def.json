It is the absolute amount of energy, it is a 220-megawatt energy requirement. That compares to a similar project in Western Australia which is 450 megawatts, so that is the energy efficiency,\" she said.\n\nOnce fully ramped up, Iron Bridge is expected to produce 22 million wet tonnes of iron ore a year, which is the equivalent of about 20 million tonnes of conventional iron ore exports.\n\nSinosteel has not floated any magnetite concentrate plans for Oakajee, and in the immediate future the company is expected to focus on its existing iron ore mines in the region, which are conventional \"direct shipping ore\" mines extracting hematite iron ore.", "description": "A Chinese state-owned entity will seek to revive a $9.7 billion mining rail and port project in Western Australia, in a move that could unlock the nation's next iron ore export province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2713%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f5a9560384eb95c7a8dc88ee53c4748c2bbe4c", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
