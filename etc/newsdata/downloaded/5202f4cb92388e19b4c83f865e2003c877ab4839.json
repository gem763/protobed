I just don't know if I should play next week. I'll figure it out with the team.\"\n\nFederer returned to the Paris Masters last year for the first time since 2015 and reached the semi-finals where he lost a three-set semi-final thriller to Novak Djokovic, who is top seed ahead of Rafael Nadal in the French capital this year.\n\nOn Sunday, Federer cut an emotional figure as he was presented with the trophy at the Basel tournament where he once worked as a ballboy.\n\nIn the crowd of 9 000 were his wife and four children.\n\n\"It might be remembering back at all that went into this week, the family of maybe the (coaching) team aspect,\" said Federer when asked to explain his emotions.\n\n\"People think I just go out there and do it at will - but it's not that way at all.\n\n\"Sometimes I stand there and look back at what I've gone through. The ballkids running onto court (for the trophy ceremony) - that can get me going. Also thanking the fans at the end.\"\n\nFederer said his success it Basel, where he is on a 24-win streak and has won 75 matches against just nine losses, had been \"an incredible journey\".\n\n\"It leaves a mark for me,\" he added after making an appearance at his annual pizza party with all tournament ball boys and girls immediately after the trophy ceremony.\n\n\"To be able to play in a stadium with people celebrating your tennis it's a wonderful feeling. I've had an incredible journey, it's hit me hard winning in Basel. This is not something that I take as normal.\n\n\"(Winning a title) is something unique and special, even if I've done it a lot.\"", "description": "Roger Federer clinched his 103rd career title in Basel but admitted that he may skip the opportunity to win a 104th at the Paris Masters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8569/2e08c3bd0950459a989e89cf9912802d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
