And I feel like I'm blessed. And I am humbled and honored that they gave me a chance to be in that group. It's an actor's playground,\" she told Fox News.\n\nNarducci particularly responded to Scorsese's creative process, because he lets the actors have freedom in scenes. \"You don't feel such a bind to the script,\" she recalled. \"You go off book and there's a lot of freedom and fun in that. [Marty] lets the actors show who also who he is.\"\n\nHer on-screen husband in \"The Irishman\" is Pesci; Narducci revealed he needed a lot of coaxing to return to a movie set.\n\nCLINT EASTWOOD'S 'RICHARD JEWELL' EXPLORES FBI, MEDIA WRONGDOING AFTER 1996 OLYMPIC BOMBING\n\nNarducci's biggest TV success and fondest working memories come from the set of HBO's \"The Sopranos\" where she played Charmaine Bucco, whose husband, beleaguered restaurateur Artie Bucco, was a childhood pal of mob boss Tony Soprano..\n\nThe friendships that were made making that show is what she misses most. \"We really were a family,\" she insisted. \"I mean any one of those actors you put them in this chair and they will say we were a family.\"\n\nSCORSESE SAYS USING DEAGING TECHNOLOGY IN 'THE IRISHMAN' TOOK 'EDGE' OFF DE NIRO, PESCI PERFORMANCES\n\n\"Everybody knew their place. Everybody who knew who they were. Everybody respected the other person's place and what they got even if they were getting more you were still happy for them,\" she said. \"At least that's how I felt. And I think that's how everybody else felt. We all had each other's back.\"\n\nThe actors were so close that they even traveled to award shows in big groups. \"We all flew on the same plane ... got in a 'Sopranos' bus,\" Narducci recalled. \"I mean it was hilarious. We're just always together and we've wanted it that way.\"\n\nShe remembers working with \"Sopranos\" star James Gandolfini, who died in 2013, and believes he'd be so happy that his son, Michael, is playing a younger Tony in an upcoming prequel film. \"I think it was a great idea... [He's] honoring James.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"The Irishman\" hits theaters Nov. 1 and will be available on Netflix on Nov. 27.", "description": "Kathrine Narducci loves a mob drama.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091876770001_6091872742001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
