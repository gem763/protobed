It\u2019s been a great tournament so far and I\u2019m sure it will be an awesome finish tomorrow.\u201d", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods led Hideki Matsuyama by three strokes with seven holes to play to stand on the verge of golfing history when the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/6fd8b5_fans-wearing-tiger-costumes-tiger-woods-us-pga-zozo-championship-golf-tournament-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
