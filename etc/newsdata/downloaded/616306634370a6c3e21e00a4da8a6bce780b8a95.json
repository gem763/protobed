Dams in some parts of western NSW have all but dried up, with rainfall levels through the winter in the lowest 10% of historical records in some areas.\n\nThe crisis in the far west of the state became unavoidable after the mass fish kills along the lower Darling River last summer, but now much bigger towns closer to the coast, including Dubbo, are also running out of water.\n\nResidents of three distinct areas talked to Guardian Australia about the state of their towns under extreme stress from water shortages, expressing anxiety about their future but also determination to keep communities alive.\n\nDubbo, NSW\n\nIt seems unthinkable that the city of Dubbo, with a population of 40,000 and home to the Western Plains Zoo, could be facing the prospect of running out of water by mid- 2020. But as the drought enters its second summer, that\u2019s exactly what is facing the main town in the central west of NSW.\n\nIt\u2019s also raising questions about management of water in the region, as irrigators in the basin have been permitted to continue to take water in the expectation that inflows would occur. Instead inflows into the Macquarie River are at historic lows.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burrendong Dam, which supplies Dubbo and surrounding towns. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\nThe vast Burrendong dam on the Macquarie \u2013 six times the size of Sydney Harbour and the main water source for Dubbo, Wellington, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar and Warren \u2013 is now at 4.5% capacity and dwindling rapidly as unseasonably high temperatures hit the region.\n\nThis is not just a matter of water restrictions and inconvenience. The drought and water shortages spell potential economic catastrophe for Dubbo as farmers leave fields unplanted and sell off stock, tourist numbers wither and parks and gardens turn brown.\n\nDubbo still looks like an oasis in the brown landscape that surrounds it, despite being on level two restrictions.\n\nBut tougher level three restrictions are imminent if there is no spring rain, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting. Then the city will rapidly go to level five, then level six.\n\nThat means no watering of lawns and parks. Some of the council\u2019s pools will be emptied and residents will be required to use no more than 120 litres a day \u2013 half the amount now permitted. That means short showers and limited use of evaporative coolers, in a summer when the temperature on most days will be well over 30C.\n\n\u201cThere are no records of the sort of drought that we are experiencing,\u201d says the chief executive of Dubbo council, Michael McMahon. \u201cAt the same time the population has grown and there are more businesses here.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A huge mat of red duckweed floats on the surface of the Macquarie River. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\nA fortnight ago the state government announced a $30m program to sink more bores, and McMahon says he hopes to shift to roughly 50/50 bore and dam water by March.\n\nBut there are serious questions about whether groundwater in sufficient quantity and quality can be found to support all the people who rely on Burrendong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite concerned that the groundwater they find won\u2019t be enough or of good enough quality to help Dubbo,\u201d says the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor, Melissa Gray.\n\nShe points to a risk assessment by state water authorities in November 2018 that found the risk of compaction and subsidence, caused by extraction of groundwater, was high in several zones of the Macquarie aquifer. There is also a high risk of poor quality water travelling through the aquifer as water is withdrawn at other points.\n\nBill Johnson, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority senior staff member, says the problem is the climate is getting hotter and drier but allocations are being made on the expectation of previous dry times.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t plenty of water for towns now because too much has been given to irrigation in the recent past,\u201d he says.\n\nMcMahon also acknowledges concerns about bore water. He is confident it can be treated to provide drinking water but says there are limits to how much can be extracted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Hippo enclosure at the Western Plains zoo. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\nAstoundingly, farms with groundwater entitlements are still permitted to extract from underground aquifers for irrigation, Gray says. \u201cThey can still flood irrigate with groundwater so, despite the conditions, there will be cotton grown in this region this year.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime some of the city\u2019s big water users, including the zoo, are trying to reduce water use further.\n\nThe zoo has a 500-megalitre allocation from Burrendong, which it uses for its non-potable water, mainly for the irrigation of lawns, for water features and moats around enclosures, and for growing \u201cbrowse\u201d feed for animals.\n\nThe zoo\u2019s director, Steve Hinks, says it has already cut irrigation back significantly to 340ML a year but is looking at what else can be done, through greater recycling.\n\n\u201cWe hold 50ML on site at any one time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe water is stored in a reservoir and flows through a lake system, so the hippo lake here is one of the last lakes in our natural system.\u201d\n\nThe zoo is installing a pump system to take the hippo lake water back to the reservoir, where it will run through a series of natural wetlands to purify it.\n\n\u201cWe can not only reuse the water and get a longer lifespan, but we are creating an environment for a lot of the native bird species,\u201d Hinks says.\n\n\u201cEven if it rains in the next few months we will forge ahead with this project as it sets us up for the future, because historically droughts are cyclical, and historically people tend to put the changes on hold.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Albert Priest channel where it crosses the Dubbo-Nyngan road. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\n\u201cWe are planning for the eventuality of no water in Burrendong but I don\u2019t think we would necessarily close the zoo or drastically reduce the animals here. We are working closely with Water NSW and council about options such as sinking bores on site, and desalination and sewage treatment and recycling.\u201d\n\nThe further you travel from Dubbo, the more acute the problems are. Nyngan, which sits on the red soil plains 120km to the north-west, was seared into the national consciousness in 1990 when the Bogan River overran its banks, inundating the town of just over 2,000 people.\n\nSuch excesses are now a distant memory. There has been no rain since 2016 and the town is relying on a combination of its off-river storage, shrewdly built by the council in 2017, and a channel that brings water from Dubbo and the Burrendong.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ruins of the train station at Girilambone. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\n\u201cHaving this backup makes it a lot better than it would be,\u201d says Nyngan\u2019s water manager, Trevor Waterhouse. It holds about 700ML, which is close to a year\u2019s water for the town, particularly with water restrictions. But it depends on water from Burrendong, brought by the 66km Albert Priest channel.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Publican Darren Painter at Girilambone. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\nFurther west along the road to Bourke, the situation is already dire.\n\nGirilambone, population 26, is already part of the way towards becoming a ghost town but this drought could be the last straw. The town water supply ran out six months ago and water is now trucked in every two days.\n\nThe rail line to Bourke closed in 1986 and, since then, the town has been in retreat. The station is derelict. The hotel burned down. The general store and petrol station closed two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe mines [at Cobar and Girilambone] have already had meetings and said if they don\u2019t have rain before January, it\u2019s no more,\u201d says Darren Painter, who runs the hotel in the old RSL. \u201cThis is the only small business here. In turn that will shut us too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much laughter here in the pub these days. The farmers try to come in to buy two beers but then they have to go.\n\n\u201cAh, but it will be all right. We\u2019ve got through this before.\u201d\n\nWarwick and Stanthorpe, Queensland\n\nAfter 73 days it rained a trickle in the southern Queensland town of Warwick in August.\n\nFew locals celebrated the end of the longest dry spell in living memory. The drought had passed the point where 5mm in the rain gauge could make a drop of difference.\n\n\u201cWarwick is a fantastic town, a very proud town, but it\u2019s on its knees,\u201d says Ian Macdonald, who runs a local garden nursery with his son, Brent. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we ever come back from this. Because if it rained tonight, it doesn\u2019t rain money and we\u2019re about a quarter of a million dollars down the gurgler.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A water restriction sign greets drivers arriving in Warwick. Photograph: Ben Smee/The Guardian\n\nWarwick is on track to run out of water within months. Roadside signs heading into town remind residents of the new restrictions: 100 litres per person, per day.\n\nLocals take pride in their rose gardens \u2013 shopping centres and hotels and Chinese restaurants are named after Warwick\u2019s signature flower. Each year in October the Rose and Rodeo festival is the town\u2019s showpiece event.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford the money to bring in roses this year because no one is buying and you\u2019d quite easily do your arse taking a gamble,\u201d Macdonald says. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t get about a drought is that it hurts everybody \u2026 If the farmers have got no money, none of us have got any money ... People don\u2019t buy plants to take home. They don\u2019t stop after the cattle sales and buy a pie at the pie shop.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dead things everywhere\u2019: is Australia facing the summer from hell? Read more\n\nIn Stanthorpe, 60km to the south, \u201cday zero\u201d \u2013 when drinking water supply runs dry \u2013 is approaching just as quickly. The towns in Queensland\u2019s Southern Downs and Granite Belt are hubs for primary producers; mostly fruit and vegetable growers. Last month the Granite Belt Growers Association estimated the reduction in wages and expenditure would cost the local economy $100m.\n\nAnn Bourke from Jester Hill Wines \u2013 a spokeswoman for the Granite Belt Wine Tourism body \u2013 says the latest vintage was picked a month earlier than usual, and most local winemakers now have business plans that assume they will lose one harvest in every five.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s costing us $2,000 a week to buy in water,\u201d Bourke says. \u201cWe\u2019re still in two minds, do we throw the dollars at buying more water and have a vintage, or do we concentrate on just keeping the vines alive?\u201d\n\nSome of the bigger farms have decided not to plant this year, which means there is no additional work, and few backpackers in town.\n\n\u201cThat means there\u2019s less people employed, families might move away, next year our school numbers will drop,\u201d says Amanda Harold, the secretary of the Stanthorpe chamber of commerce. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary and very stressful for everyone.\u201d\n\nHarold says Stanthorpe faced a similar situation 10 years ago, when the community was months away from running out of water. She, like many locals, thinks authorities should have acted more quickly to build the Emu Swamp dam. The dam tends to split opinion, but most accuse successive councils and governments of failing to plan properly.\n\nRick Humphreys, a small producer, decided not to grow his primary crop \u2013 parsley \u2013 this year. He says there\u2019s an increased acceptance that climate change will force farmers to adapt their practices.\n\n\u201cI think people now acknowledge that we\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d says Humphreys, who is a member of the group Farmers for Climate Action. \u201cA lot of the old blokes, whose families have been keeping records a long way back, they say this is the worst drought on record \u2026\n\nAustralians increasingly fear climate change related drought and extinctions Read more\n\n\u201cIf the numbers are right a version of this is going to become the new normal in the mid-term and we need to think differently about how we produce things and what we produce. The worst thing we can do is carry on farming ... the way we always have.\u201d\n\nMacdonald says he was called \u201ca communist\u201d by a local Warwick identity for suggesting the weather patterns had changed and that October thunderstorms were no longer a regular occurrence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be too frightened to talk about [climate change] in this town,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get through to people at all. Not one bit.\u201d\n\nWalgett, NSW\n\nThe far western town of Walgett will be back on bore water again next week.\n\nRain in March sent the last natural flow down the once-mighty Barwon River, and the quality of what remains has been declining ever since.\n\nOn 3 September the shire council warned locals to boil water for drinking and food preparation owing to \u201chigh turbidity\u201d \u2013 a level of murkiness that can indicate the presence of disease-causing bacteria such as E coli.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Castlereagh Highway near Walgett in January. Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian\n\nLocals say the water coming out of the tap is brown, brackish and smells bad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yucky water,\u201d says Clem Dodd, from the Dhariwaa elders group. \u201cIt stinks. You can\u2019t wash in it or wash your clothes in it, or they\u2019ll stink too.\u201d\n\nWalgett shire\u2019s general manager, Greg Ingham, agrees the situation is \u201cpretty dire\u201d. \u201cI really do feel for the community about the river,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to go down and see what was a thriving lifeblood of our community just a dry, parched riverbed.\u201d\n\nWalgett\u2019s bore water is high in sodium, which can pose a risk for people with heart disease, diabetes and other chronic health conditions. The water supply is regularly independently tested, and the NSW health department has said it is safe but the taste can be unpalatable.\n\nIngham says the shire is in discussions with the state government to install a desalination system but that in itself will not solve the town\u2019s water woes.\n\nFor centuries the rivers sustained Aboriginal culture. Now they are dry, elders despair Read more\n\n\u201cThe output of any desalination treatment won\u2019t be the same as what is currently going through our treatment plant. Desalination on its own won\u2019t be enough to supply all our needs. We might have to look at a blend of the two.\u201d\n\nFor the past year locals have been buying bottled water or receiving crowdfunded donations shipped in by truck and car.\n\nWhen Walgett\u2019s only supermarket burnt down after an electrical fault in June, locals had to make an 80-minute round trip to Coonamble to buy water, or go further afield. A temporary shop opened in August.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had various campaigns,\u201d Ingham said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of bottled water coming in, through GoFundMe pages. Then we had a concern about all those small empty bottles piling up here, not being great for the environment.\n\n\u201cNow 20- to 50-litre-sized containers are being delivered to households. But the bottom line is we\u2019re no different to any other part of regional Australia suffering through the drought. The only real long-term solution is rain.\u201d\n\nThe Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and the Dhariwaa elders group have been distributing bottled water, and delivering water to housebound elders.\n\n\u201cBuying water is expensive,\u201d says a local Gamilaraay woman, Vanessa Hickey, \u201chaving to spend extra, to wash fruit and veggies.\u201d\n\nBoth she and Dodd have started to think about what the lack of water might mean for the future. Dodd says moving away is a possibility but Hickey says she\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already ruined our rivers with cotton, coal seam gas and mining. But I\u2019m not moving. The community suffers from other people\u2019s wrongdoing. It\u2019s not our fault but we\u2019re the ones who suffer the most.\n\n\u201cThey want us gone because they want the land; they want what\u2019s under the land. But where can we live in the city? We only live in the country. I\u2019d rather live in a tent on the riverbank \u2013 only we\u2019ve got no river to live on.\u201d", "description": "Guardian Australia reports from three communities hard hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory", "authors": ["Lorena Allam", "Anne Davies", "Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a54322f523601cdc0b7aa5d9a20851a71c64fe/131_0_5053_3032/master/5053.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=990042c63076b15c59405b45484f550c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
