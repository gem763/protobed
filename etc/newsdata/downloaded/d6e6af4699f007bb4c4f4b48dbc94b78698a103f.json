But Will This Hate Rotation Last?", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nDarling stocks fell this past week, and dogs rose. Some Wall Street banks called the shift \u201cviolent.\u201d One used the term \u201chate rotation.\u201d If anyone else is looking for over-the-top terms to describe this brief return to how stocks used to work, I\u2019m pretty sure \u201chatchet cannon\u201d and \u201cclown punch\u201d are still available.\n\nIt used to be that stocks that got too expensive would eventually sell off, and that stocks that sold off too far would rebound. But over the past decade, pricey momentum stocks have gotten pricier, and value stocks have stained the carpet. Then, during the first three days of this past week, momentum stocks sold off by 10% and value stocks rallied 7%, according to J.P. Morgan. That was one of the sharpest such three-day shifts in 30 years.\n\nThere\u2019s always a bit of disagreement over how exactly to define value stocks, because cheapness can be subjective. But let\u2019s just say it was a bad few days to be long electronic trading platforms and short underpants and motorcycles. MarketAxess Holdings (ticker: MKTX), which Barron\u2019ssingled out last week as an example of why straight momentum investing looks expensive, fell 19%, the worst performance in the S&P 500 index. CME Group (CME) was second-worst, down 9%. Meanwhile, Hanesbrands (HBI) gained 13%, and Harley-Davidson (HOG), 10%.\n\nI\u2019m not sure Hanes and Harley are the first places to look for good deals now on companies with favorable trends. Same for General Electric (GE), up 7%, and Victoria Secret owner L Brands (LB), up 12%. But then, value investing hasn\u2019t worked for so long that it\u2019s understandable if bargain hunters are rusty. To their credit, they also sweetened on BorgWarner (BWA), up 10%, and AT&T (T), up 7%.\n\nFunny thing about American Airlines Group (AAL): Jamie Baker, who covers air carriers for JPM, has a simple, turbulent trading rule he calls \u201cdown 30 in 30.\u201d His records show remarkable returns for investors who bought shares of United Airlines Holdings (UAL) and its predecessor Continental each time they fell 30% or more in 30 days, and who held for 180 days. Just before this past week, Baker issued a note saying American had triggered his trading rule. He\u2019s up a quick 8%.\n\nThe big question for investors, of course, is whether this shift will continue. A trio of Wall Street firms has the answers: absolutely, probably, and not really. JPM points out that recent trading has unwound only about the past five months of outperformance for momentum stocks. \u201cThe extreme divergence...is bound to further rebalance,\u201d its strategists wrote on Thursday. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, investors are underestimating the ability of central banks to fuel stock gains with a \u201cliquidity supernova,\u201d and as stocks broadly rise, value will likely continue to shine.\n\nUBS explains that growth stocks have had such strong price momentum because investors have poured money into growth mutual funds at a time when fast-growing companies are becoming scarce. If history is a guide, a recent slowdown in manufacturing signals that growth stocks will now begin to underperform defensive ones, the bank says. It favors staples, health care, utilities, and real estate investment trusts.\n\nMeanwhile, assets in stock index funds, which tend to have a momentum tilt, just eclipsed those in actively managed funds, according to Morningstar. If the recent bounce in value stocks is a hate rotation, savers are still boarding the love train.\n\nThere are no free lunches, at least since Blue Apron Holdings (APRN) last offered its three-meal introductory giveaway. But free stock-trading is a growth industry. Square (SQ) is reportedly testing such a service for its Cash App payments platform. It will go up against privately held Robinhood, which is valued at $7.6 billion, up from $5.6 billion last year, if a summer funding round is any indication.\n\nRobinhood is part of what Canaccord Genuity Capital Markets analyst Joseph Vafi, in a 209-page report this past week on the financial technology or fintech industry, calls freemium 2.0. Freemium 1.0 involved offering a stripped-down service for free, while charging to upgrade to a premium one. In the 2.0 version, companies give away a premium service in hopes of charging later for a totally different service. The idea is to win over plenty of so-called HENRYs\u2014high earners, not rich yet. One risk is that you end up instead with JEFS, who just enjoy free stuff. Another risk is that a bigger company decides to price-match at free. Vafi\u2019s favorites in fintech include Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and PayPal Holdings (PYPL).\n\nElsewhere in this issue, Viacom (VIAB) chief Bob Bakish discusses Pluto TV, a free Netflix-like service. It uses library content and makes money with advertisements. But Apple (AAPL) is doing something altogether different. It\u2019s reportedly spending $6 billion on content for a new streaming service launching Nov. 1. On Tuesday, it priced the service at $4.99 a month, lower than expected. And it said that it would give it away for a year to anyone who buys a phone, computer, or Apple TV.\n\nGoldman Sachs trimmed its earnings per share forecast for Apple by $1.72, to $10.76, for its fiscal year ending September 2020, in part because the iPhone maker\u2019s likely accounting for the giveaway will reduce average selling prices on its gear. In a Thursday note, Goldman, which rates Apple stock Neutral, predicted 26% downside. I feel somewhat less neutral about the prospect of losing one-quarter of an investment, but to each his own. The larger point is that for companies, all this free stuff is starting to look expensive.\n\nWrite to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com", "description": "Analysts offer some different views on the matter: absolutely, probably, and not really.
