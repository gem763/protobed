The prime minister will introduce the legislation needed this week for the U.K. to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. The parliamentary rejection on Saturday increases the risk that the U.K. will crash out of the trading bloc without an agreement, a senior cabinet minister said.\n\nKey Developments\n\nJohnson sends letter to Brussels formally asking the European Union to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, as stipulated by law, but made it clear he\u2019d rather there was no extensionMove came after MPs voted by 322 to 306 for Letwin amendment forcing government to request Brexit delayEuropean Council President Donald Tusk to consult EU leaders on how to reactJohnson could yet deliver on pledge to get Britain out of the EU by the end of the month, an analysis of Saturday\u2019s vote reveals.\n\nJohnson Has Support to Pass Brexit Deal (9:45 a.m.)\n\nMichael Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, said Johnson has the support to win a vote on the Brexit deal he negotiated with the EU but the government was making preparation in case the U.K. crashes out without a deal. Should Parliament reject the Johnson deal in a vote expected this week there might not be any extension to the Oct. 31 deadline, Gove said on Sky TV\u2019s \u201cSophy Ridge on Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t back this deal, then the risk is that the European Council may not grant an extension,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t bet on that. It\u2019s not a sure thing.\u201d\n\nThe government is relying on lawmakers such as Amber Rudd, a former cabinet minister, who backed the Letwin amendment but says she will support the deal this week. \u201cWe do want to leave with a deal and this deal from the prime minister is good enough for me,\u201d she said.\n\nRudd, who walked out of the government and quit the Tory whip in protest at the expulsion of 21 colleagues, said she expected many of that group would also back the deal.\n\nWhy the Delay, Foreign Secretary Asks? (9:44 a.m.)\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the numbers appear to exist in Parliament to get the deal passed, so the question is \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we getting on with it?\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThe whole economy will get a boost, the rancor will come out of the debate,\u2019\u2019 he told the Andrew Marr show on BBC TV.\n\nLabour Pushing for Second Referendum (9:33 a.m.)\n\nKeir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the the Labour opposition, said any deal needs to be subject to a second referendum with an option to remain in the EU. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see tactically how we get there,\u201d he told BBC TV\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr Show\u201d Sunday.\n\nLabour will table amendments to the Brexit bill covering issues such as the environment and workers\u2019 rights, and it was inevitable that a second-referendum amendment would emerge, probably from the beckbenches, he said.\n\nEU Ambassadors Fail to Discuss Delay Request (9:08 a.m.)\n\nEU ambassadors meeting in Brussels Sunday morning did not discuss Johnson\u2019s Brexit delay request. The meeting had been scheduled to work out the EU approval process once Parliament had signed off on the deal, which it failed to do on Saturday.\n\nFormer BOE Governor Dismisses Economic Forecasts (9 a.m.)\n\nFormer Bank of England Governor Mervyn King expressed his frustration that Brexit remains unresolved, saying the feeling among the British public is \u201cjust do it.\u201d Brexit, he said, has provoked a political and constitutional crisis, but leaving the EU is unlikely to have a \u201cmajor\u201d impact of the British economy longer term either way, he said in a Sky interview shown Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to try and map out a particular deal into precise numbers,\u201d he said of forecasts that Britain will be significantly worse off outside the EU. \u201cA lot of bogus quantification has gone on to try to justify positions.\u201d\n\nFarage Prefers General Election to \u201cRotten Deal\u201d (8:50 a.m.)\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage said he\u2019d rather Brexit was extended and a general election held than see Johnson\u2019s \u201crotten deal\u201d being passed in Parliament.\n\n\u201cAn extension for a few weeks into which we can have a general election is a much better outcome than signing up to a treaty that becomes part of international law that binds us in foreign policy and in many, many other areas,\u201d he told Sophy Ridge.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Parliament voted Saturday for Boris Johnson to request a further delay to Brexit.
