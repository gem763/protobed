All actors should therefore now make any necessary final adjustments to their plans in relation to a withdrawal without an agreement on 1 November 2019,\" it added.\n\nThe Commission also outlined possible extra support for the agriculture sector and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n\"In the agriculture sector, the full spectrum of existing instruments for market support and direct financial support to farmers will be made available to mitigate the worst impact on agri-food markets in a no-deal scenario. National financial support should match EU exceptional market measures, multiplying the impact of the European Union\u2019s intervention,\" the Commission wrote.\n\n\"The Commission stands ready to act swiftly if Member States decide to amend their structural and investment funds programmes to allocate part of the available resources, within their national envelopes, to deal with challenges caused by a withdrawal without an agreement,\" it wrote, adding that the \"Commission stands ready to propose amendments to the agreement between the European Union and the European Investment Fund to allow the use of the programme for the Competitiveness of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (COSME) to facilitate access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises.\"", "description": "European Commission unveils latest plans for UK departure without agreement.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Cristina Gallardo", "Annabelle Dickson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-936025436-1200x628.jpg"}
