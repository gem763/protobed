But its nice because when I see the film now, because of my memory they\u2019ve faded away and I get to relive it with everyone else.\u2019\n\nAckie is taking on the role of Jannah in the JJ Abrams-directed finale to the Skywalker saga, her character\u2019s role in the fight against the First Order still shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe Rise Of Skywalker is in cinemas December.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
