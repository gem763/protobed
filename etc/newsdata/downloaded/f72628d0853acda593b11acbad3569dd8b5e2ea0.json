The union said it\u2019s seeking at least $115 million for damages sustained through the end of this year, primarily for lost pay and legal expenses.\n\n\u201cBoeing abandoned sound design and engineering practices, withheld safety critical information from regulators and deliberately misled its customers, pilots and the public about the true scope of design changes,\u201d the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit and public criticism from Southwest\u2019s pilots undermine Boeing\u2019s effort to rebuild confidence in its best-selling airplane after months of bruising publicity. The planemaker has invited pilots from Max operators to fly the updated software as part of outreach to flight crews.\n\nSouthwest is the largest operator of the Max, which has been grounded worldwide since March. Parking its 34 Max planes and failure to get new ones on order has cut at least $225 million from the airline\u2019s operating income and caused tens of thousands of flight cancellations. The jet has been pulled from Southwest\u2019s schedule through Jan. 5.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Boeing said by email. \u201cWe will continue to work with Southwest Airlines and its pilots on efforts to safely return the Max to service.\u201d Its shares were little changed after the close of regular trading.\n\nSouthwest reiterated that it plans to use profit-sharing to provide employees part of any compensation received in a settlement with the planemaker. It didn\u2019t comment on the substance of the union claims.\n\nThe Max crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights have triggered probes beyond the accidents into Boeing\u2019s design process for the aircraft -- a retooled version of its workhorse 737 -- and whether safety reviews and certification by U.S. regulators were compromised. Boeing was trying to stay competitive with the Airbus SE A320neo, which could fly farther and burn less fuel.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Monday in state court in Dallas, according to the union. The filing couldn\u2019t be immediately confirmed at the court.\n\nCriminal Probe\n\nThe complaint cited news reports, statements made by officials and other sources to support its allegations. Yet aside from a safety board recommendation, none of the official reviews and investigations into how the Max was designed and approved for flight have issued public findings. They include a criminal probe led by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nBoeing has said there was no breakdown in the design, testing and Federal Aviation Administration approval of the Max.\n\nBoth the Lion Air crash on Oct. 29 and the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10 occurred after a malfunction triggered a new feature, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, to repeatedly push the planes into dives. The accidents killed a total of 346 people.\n\nUntil the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, airlines and pilots hadn\u2019t been told of the existence of MCAS, which had been installed to counteract the effects of the Max\u2019s larger engines on the existing 737\u2019s airframe.\n\nTraining Requirements\n\nBoeing also played down design changes in the Max to convince regulators and airlines that time-consuming training wasn\u2019t needed because the plane was an update to the previous model, the 737 Next Generation, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe planemaker didn\u2019t share those differences, including MCAS, during work with Swapa and Southwest as recently as 2016, the union said. That persuaded the pilots group to include the Max with other 737 variants under a new contract, easing the rollout of the new plane for Boeing\u2019s launch customer, Swapa said.\n\n\u201cHad Swapa been aware of MCAS and the true extent of differences between the 737 NG and the 737 Max, it never would have agreed to pilot the 737 Max,\u201d said the union, which represents nearly 10,000 Southwest pilots.\n\nThe union decided to sue Boeing after failing to reach an agreement in talks that began in late August, said Jon Weaks, a Southwest captain and president of the labor group.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The union for Southwest Airlines Co. pilots sued Boeing Co., saying the manufacturer rushed output of the 737 Max jet to stay competitive, withholding key information about a feature that contributed to two fatal crashes within five months.\u201cBoeing made a calculated decision to rush a re-engined", "authors": ["Mary Schlangenstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
