It may be a whole 46 years since she sent pulses racing as sweetly sexy Bond girl Solitaire in Live And Let Die. But, now pushing 70, the grandmother with four children and two stepchildren says she still looks so young, directors refuse to give her roles befitting her age.\n\nIn fact, they doubt there\u2019s any way she can look much over 50, frankly.\n\n\u2018They see my photo of me in a swimming costume on Instagram and they think I look too young,\u2019 she bemoans, flicking that famous auburn mane. Oh, boo hoo. Poor Jane.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a refreshing change from all those actresses who complain that roles wither at the first hint of a wrinkle, it\u2019s enough to make you want to slap her.\n\nSmouldering in 1973: Jane Seymour as sweetly sexy Bond girl Solitaire in Live And Let Die\n\nOnly, damn it, Jane, 68, is right. Lithe and dewy-skinned, even her hands \u2014 normally as reliable a marker of age as rings around an oak tree \u2014 look like they belong to a woman a decade younger.\n\nIf a director was looking for a gnarly old hag to fill a character role, I\u2019d say Jane Seymour\u2019s CV would most definitely end up in the bin. You\u2019d probably cast her as a foxy fiftysomething \u2014 someone\u2019s glamorous mother or mistress. Look on Instagram, however, and she might struggle to convince even in those roles. In January, she was pictured in a blue swimsuit on a boat in Hawaii, looking half her age, and again in the summer in Los Angeles and Europe.\n\nJane pictured with her cheating fourth husband James Keach\n\nIt\u2019s not as if her life has been plain sailing. Her fourth husband cheated on her, leaving her \u2018devastated\u2019, and husband No 3 had already lost the family fortune. Plucky, fiercely hard-working and determinedly upbeat, you can\u2019t help warming to her.\n\nJane herself can definitely see the funny side of having to prove \u2014 beg even \u2014 that she\u2019s old enough to play an old part.\n\n\u2018It happened most recently when I was asked to meet producer Chuck Lorre for the role of Alan Arkin\u2019s girlfriend in his show The Kominsky Method,\u2019 says Jane.\n\n\u2018Alan is over 80, so they needed me to look a similar vintage. Chuck was dubious. I said: \u201cTrust me. I\u2019ve had no cosmetic surgery, so my face still moves and I\u2019ve got plenty of wrinkles. Add in the right clothes and bit of acting and all I need is a grey wig.\u201d \u2019\n\nThe transformation worked so well that \u2014 with her wig in place \u2014 even the show\u2019s star Michael Douglas didn\u2019t recognise Jane, despite them having known each other for decades.\n\n\u2018He came up to me, put out his hand and said: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Michael.\u201d He freaked out when he realised,\u2019 she laughs.\n\nJane is quietly confident that in the new series of The Kominsky Method (which began on Netflix yesterday), she will look so convincingly grannyish roles will pour in. \u2018It\u2019s great to play the younger roles, but there are terrific roles for women of 70 that I know I can play, too \u2014 with or without a grey wig,\u2019 she says.\n\nSo, come on, Jane, what exactly have you had done? Surely, there must have been the occasional discreet nip and tuck?\n\n\u2018Hand on heart, the only surgery I\u2019ve had was a small operation to remove the bags under my eyes some 30 years ago,\u2019 she says, firmly. \u2018That wasn\u2019t even to do with age \u2014 I was born with slight bags.\n\n\u2018I also had a boob job when I was 40. Even then, the surgeon was eager for me to go a great deal bigger. I was adamant that I just wanted my old boobs refilled, as it were \u2014 I\u2019d lost definition after breastfeeding.\u2019\n\nHer children are: Katie, 37, and Sean, 34, from her marriage to businessman David Flynn, plus 23-year-old twins John and Kris, from her 20-year partnership with actor and director James Keach.\n\nShe has a stepson, Kalen Keach, and a stepdaughter, Jenni Flynn.\n\nThere are also two granddaughters, Katie\u2019s little girls, Willa, six, and Luna, three; a grandson, Jenni\u2019s son, Rowan, seven; and Kalen\u2019s children, Sierra, Dylan and Denver.\n\nBut she says that was it with cosmetic surgery: \u2018I am so pleased I was never tempted to do more. Messing with your face is so risky.\u2019\n\nSo what about Botox?\n\nJane admits to trying it years ago. \u2018I hated the effect. My brows were so raised I looked like a unicorn \u2014 and, as an actress, I realised I needed my facial muscles to move,\u2019 she says. \u2018I\u2019m lucky to have fairly olive skin, which I abused horribly when I was younger.\u2019 As a young actress, Jane was so eager to get a tan she even took tips from actor George Hamilton, whose permatan at its peak was enough to make David Dickinson look wan and pasty.\n\n\u2018George persuaded me to lie in the sun with a reflective shield in front of my face, soaking up maximum sunlight,\u2019 she shudders.\n\n\u2018Now, of course, I always wear a big floppy hat and skin protection. I have a pretty simple beauty routine \u2014 I don\u2019t have time for facials or peels. But I\u2019m fanatical about cleaning my skin. I exfoliate and slap on a face mask while I\u2019m making phone calls or galloping around the house.\n\n\u2018I also use a retinol cream, Rejuvenate by Skinbetter Science, every night, which I\u2019m convinced promotes cell turnover and I use a hyaluronic cream, Timeless Skin Care, as a moisturiser.\u2019\n\nFor years, Jane has been the poster girl for a body cream called Crepe Erase, which she credits with reducing the appearance of wrinkles. And, as for that famous mane of hair, she cheerfully admits it comes out of a bottle. It would be nothing short of a miracle if it didn\u2019t.\n\nShe visits the hairdresser religiously every three weeks to banish any stray greys.\n\nHer eyes, however, by rights ought to belong to a much younger woman. \u2018The optician says I\u2019m the only person of my age he knows with 20:20 vision,\u2019 she says. \u2018It must be all the carrots I ate as a girl.\u2019\n\nAnd, if anything, her lithe figure is even more impressively youthful. A ballerina as a child, she has been practising Pilates and Gyrotonics several times a week for almost 40 years and now adds in light weights.\n\nEnviably, she claims to have none of the aches and pains to which most women reaching 70 are prone. There\u2019s zero chance of Jane grunting with discomfort as she eases herself out of a chair.\n\nSo much so that there\u2019s every chance we will see Instagram snaps of a swimwear-clad Jane for years to come. \u2018I do hope so,\u2019 she laughs. \u2018Although I\u2019m alert to that moment when a discreet sarong might be necessary.\u2019\n\nYou don\u2019t get a whippet-thin figure like Jane\u2019s with cheesecake and wine on tap. She admits she has to be careful \u2014 a single glass of wine and the odd bag of Maltesers or Twiglets specially sent to Malibu from England count as serious indulgences.\n\nHowever, she has put on 10lb \u2014pushing her weight up to just over 9st for the first time in decades.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve gone up a whole dress size, which has actually been great for my face,\u2019 she says. \u2018If you get too thin, the wrinkles start showing.\u2019 She is coy about attributing the weight gain to anything in particular. But it\u2019s a fair bet it\u2019s got quite a lot to do with her happy love life. And that, in turn, is thanks to her boyfriend of five years, film producer David Green, 70.\n\nWe are chatting over lunch (a healthy bowl of salad Jane has grown herself) at her seaside home. There are all the celebrity trappings one would expect: tennis courts, palm trees, a pool and an outdoor bar big enough to host a crowd scene from Wedding Crashers.\n\nIt\u2019s a star-studded area. Neighbours include Simon Cowell and Cher \u2014 handy if Jane ever changes her mind on cosmetic surgery and wants a recommendation.\n\nShe wakes every morning to a breathtaking view of the sea and the comforting sight of the devoted David appearing with a morning cup of coffee. \u2018I feel so supported,\u2019 says Jane. \u2018He doesn\u2019t even flinch when a team of people arrive at 3am to do my hair and make-up for a photoshoot. Because he\u2019s in the business, he completely understands the odd hours I work.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not a one-way street. David, who directed Buster starring Julie Walters and Phil Collins, and more recently produced the wildly successful reality TV series Bridezilla, is a fanatical Manchester City fan.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a total soccer maniac,\u2019 Jane laughs. \u2018He\u2019s promised me there\u2019s no way he\u2019s ever going to be unfaithful because he\u2019s already got a mistress \u2014 Manchester City.\u2019\n\nIncongruously, Jane found herself on one of their first dates being invited on to the pitch to kick a ball. Heaven alone knows what spectators made of the sight of the former Bond girl. \u2018We ended up in the boardroom and they took me on to the field and gave me a ball to kick. I\u2019m there with my Man City scarf, leg flailing like a ballerina,\u2019 she laughs.\n\nJane met David through her childhood friend, novelist Sally Emerson. \u2018David was at Oxford with Sally\u2019s husband, Sir Peter Stothard, former editor of The Times,\u2019 says Jane. \u2018David bought the film rights to her first novel, so that\u2019s when I first heard his name. We saw each other socially over the years. Then, six years ago, Sally was staying with me and planned to have brunch with David. I insisted she invite him here.\n\n\u2018We were both single, with children of similar ages \u2014 David has three children, Jessica, Samuel and Jacob. We had both just come out of long marriages. We had lunch and then dinner. We realised we had too much in common not to be together.\u2019\n\nBut Jane is firm that she doesn\u2019t plan to marry again. \u2018What\u2019s the point when we are so happy as we are?\u2019 she asks. \u2018We aren\u2019t going to have children, so there really is no incentive.\u2019\n\nWho can blame her after four husbands \u2014 her first two marriages, to Michael Attenborough when she was just 20, and Geoffrey \u201cGeep\u201d Planer, older brother of actor Nigel Planer \u2014 were \u2018blink-and-you-miss-them\u2019 affairs lasting barely two years each.\n\nJane was deeply wounded by the collapse of her most recent marriage to actor-director James Keach in 2013.\n\nAlthough there have been rumours that he had an affair, Jane has never admitted the painful truth, until now. \u2018Choices were made that I couldn\u2019t live with,\u2019 she says, choosing her words carefully.\n\n\u2018I thought we were going to be married for ever, but James made a choice that I wasn\u2019t privy to. He found someone else. I felt horrible, devastated.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t do well with betrayal. If someone says: \u201cThings aren\u2019t good, let\u2019s separate,\u201d it would be different. But I was never privy to that conversation.\n\n\u2018By the time I found out \u2014 entirely by accident \u2014 it had been going on for some time, so that was that. It was someone I knew, so that was very frightening.\n\n\u2018I tried to figure something out, but I realised that the marriage wasn\u2019t going to work. We are friends now, and were always determined to be good parents, but it was devastating at the time.\u2019\n\nThe timing was terrible. \u2018I felt so vulnerable. My self-confidence took a real knock. I tried a bit of dating \u2014 not anything like Tinder. That sounds just horrible. But friends introduced me to friends. However, there was never a spark.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Jane has felt betrayed.\n\n\u2018Her third marriage to businessman David Flynn \u2014 the father of her two elder children \u2014 collapsed after Jane discovered that he had lost their family fortune. \u2018He was my husband and business manager so, of course, I trusted him,\u2019 she says. \u2018But he had invested in all kinds of business transactions that I knew nothing about.\n\n\u2018By the time I found out, everything had gone. It was horrendous. I felt so angry and betrayed.\u2019\n\nOnly the arrival of her starring role in Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman \u2014 the series that ran from 1993 to 1998 \u2014 saved her fortunes.\n\n\u2018I was penniless and homeless, then this television role dropped like manna from heaven.\n\n\u2018The production company literally gave me and the children a roof over our heads.\u2019\n\nAnd perhaps this is one of the most unexpected things about Jane. She may look like a fragile English rose, but she\u2019s got the survival instinct of Japanese knotweed and a knack for turning her talents into hard cash.\n\nAs well as acting, she paints (her oil paintings sell for as much as \u00a345,000), designs for furniture brand Michael Amini and has a jewellery line, Open Hearts.\n\nShe\u2019s also absolutely determined to see the best in everything. \u2018You can do: \u201cWhy me?\u201d for a little while, but then you have to stop and go: \u201cWhy not me?\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018My wonderful mother, Mieke, survived three-and-a-half years in a Japanese concentration camp. It left her determined to embrace challenges.\n\n\u2018I try to live by her mantra: to try to accept whatever happens, however difficult it seems, because there\u2019s always someone worse off and \u2014 through helping them \u2014 your problems seem diminished.\u2019\n\nRemarkably, both exes David and James, complete with their new partners, will be invited to join Jane, boyfriend David and their assorted children for Thanksgiving.\n\n\u2018We are all family, even if we have moved in different directions,\u2019 she says. \u2018I\u2019m simply not prepared to look back. It\u2019s pointless, particularly when I have so much to be happy and thankful for.\n\n\u2018All my husbands have been great men. I loved them all.\u2019\n\nThere may have been pain. There may have been heartache. But nothing, it seems, is going to shift this very spritely Bond girl from her philosophy . . . live and let live.", "description": "It has been 46 years since Jane Seymour, 68, set pulses racing as Bond girl Solitaire in Live And Let Die.
