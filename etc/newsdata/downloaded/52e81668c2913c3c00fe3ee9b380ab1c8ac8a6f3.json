Erasmus may be swayed by pure gut feel.\n\nThey are, after all, slightly different in make-up, with Mbonambi (106kg, 1.76m) arguably having an edge in mobility and Marx being more of a \u201cdoor-stopper\u201d in contact situations with his larger, 114kg and 1.88m proportions.\n\nThe coach will have to work out which of the pair is best suited to running out at the start against England\u2019s likely first choice on Saturday, Saracens\u2019 Jamie George \u2013 early pack statements could be crucial in determining which outfit eventually hoists the Webb Ellis Cup, as much as later impact-geared displays off the splinters might be.\n\nGeorge, aged 29 and sporting 47 caps, is no shrinking violet in the heat of the forward tussle with his own quite bulky frame, tipping the scales at around 113kg.\n\nMy own feeling is that Erasmus is going to go very much \u201cstatus quo\u201d with his Bok line-up, thus favouring Mbonambi to get first crack from the hooker\u2019s slot.\n\nBut Marx instead? He may have a reasonable enough, 40-45 percent shout at wearing No 2 this Saturday, rather than No 16.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t exactly be a bombshell, such is the entirely healthy rivalry.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "Malcolm Marx as starting hooker, in a \u2018horses for courses\u2019 move, is a Bok switch that should not be totally ruled out for Saturday\u2019s RWC final, says <strong>Rob Houwing.</strong>", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9477/33f992e5de9046f8aa64995bda130d1d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
