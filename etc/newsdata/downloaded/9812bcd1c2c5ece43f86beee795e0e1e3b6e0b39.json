I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe United States said it is withdrawing all 1,000 troops from northeastern Syria, keeping in the country only roughly 150 troops in the southern base of Al Tanf near the borders with Jordan and Iraq.\n\n\u2013 Filling void \u2013\n\nWasting no time to fill the void, Russia \u2014 the top broker in Syria \u2014 clinched a deal between the Kurds and Damascus. The two sides had frosty ties since the minority group threw its lot in with Washington and unilaterally declared self-rule as the regime fought rebels elsewhere.\n\nFrom early Monday, Syrian regime forces were moving within several kilometers (miles) of the border, AFP correspondents reported.\n\nResidents around the town of Tal Tamr welcomed them with cheers and Syrian state television showed some waving national flags and portraits of Assad.\n\nErdogan had said he expected Kurdish forces to withdraw from Manbij, some 30 kilometers from the border, with the arrival of the regime.\n\n\u201cWhen Manbij is evacuated, we will not go in there as Turkey. Our Arab brothers, who are the real owners, the tribes\u2026 will return there,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, the Turkish attack has already left 133 fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and 69 civilians dead.\n\nThe United Nations says 160,000 people have been displaced.\n\nOn the Turkish side, four soldiers and 18 civilians have been killed in six days, either in fighting or from Kurdish cross-border fire, according to Turkish sources.\n\nThe Observatory has put the number of pro-Turkish Syrian forces killed at 108.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The United States slapped sanctions on Turkey Monday as it demanded an end to the deadly incursion against Syrian Kurdish", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/ce116c_syrian-regime-soldier-waves-national-flag-in-town-tal-tamr-as-damascus-deploys-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
