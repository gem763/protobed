The defendant is not talking to me, she is talking directly to the Probation service,' he added.\n\nAt an earlier hearing, the court had heard details of the leg biting incident - which occurred as the train pulled into Reading train station and an affray began between Peereboom, Jones and Deadfield.\n\nEliza Peereboom (pictured) had been travelling home from celebrating at Newbury racecourse when she bit the leg of another passenger - causing a permanent scar and leaving her needing tetanus jabs\n\nMs Marabet, who was bitten, said: 'I was tired after a long day of dancing and chatting and slept on the train ride to Reading station where we were set to change for Oxford.\n\n'I went to swerve around a commotion in the alley when my hair was violently pulled forwards from the chair. I kicked out and my leg was grabbed by the same girl who had my hair.\n\n'I was bitten just above the knee which felt like for ages but it was about 15 seconds long. I screamed and was escorted off the train and she was kept on it.'\n\nThe jury at Reading Crown court were show 23 minutes of CCTV footage which caught the fracas.\n\nIt was also shown pictures taken by Ms Marabet of her bite injury the day after the incident.\n\nShe said: 'I had a bite mark and a sore head from where my hair was pulled. I went to the doctors and I had to receive a Tetanus jab once a month for three months and a course of antibiotics.\n\n'I have a scar now. I have just got back from holiday and it looks worse now as the skin around it is darker.'\n\nPeereboom currently resides with family friends in Amsterdam, and questions were raised in court today over how she might come back to carry out unpaid work as part of her sentence\n\nA judge at Reading Crown Court said she was going to defer sentencing for two months while Peereboom could either find a place to live in the UK to undertake her unpaid work or get herself a job to pay compensation\n\nThe court also heard today - when Mr Quinton was still representing Peereboom - that the Dutch-born model and actress currently resides with family friends in Amsterdam.\n\nThis caused difficulties for the Probation Service as she would be required to undertake seven hours of unpaid work a week, meaning Peereboom would have to return to the UK every weekend.\n\nMr Quinton said: 'The defendant's understanding of an overnight coach to the UK every weekend to do the hours was that she does not need to spend any money other than the \u00a38 coach fare - there seems to be a lack of understanding of the practicalities.'\n\nAfter the change of barristers, Judge Campbell said: 'I feel I am left with not many options. You are 23 years of age and you were found guilty of assault by beating and causing actual bodily harm while on a busy train, which in my view, was deeply unpleasant and animalistic.\n\n'Your sarcastic demeanour could be seen on the CCTV footage as you pulled a victim's hair hard and removed it from her head in clumps.\n\n'What ensued can only be described as a scrum and you lost control of yourself. Miss Marabet was trying to get past you when her leg was bitten causing a permanent scar and needing tetanus jabs.'\n\nThe judge added that Peereboom's previous warning in 2011 for biting a police officer when she was 15 years old and her difficult upbringing, having been put in care at the age of 14, had to be taken into consideration.\n\nShe suggested that under the exceptional circumstances, she was going to defer sentencing for two months while Peereboom could either find a place to live in the UK to undertake her unpaid work or get herself a job to pay compensation.", "description": "Eliza Peereboom, 23, had been travelling home from celebrating at Newbury racecourse on August 18 last year when she bit the leg of another passenger causing a permanent scar.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19550710-0-image-a-2_1570727197755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
