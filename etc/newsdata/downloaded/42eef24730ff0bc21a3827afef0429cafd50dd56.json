in prison,\" an inquest heard.\n\nDennis Nilsen, died from natural causes aged 72 after being found slumped over a toilet at HMP Full Sutton near York.\n\nAn inquest heard that Nilsen died after having a pulmonary embolism - a blocked artery in his lung - and bleeding in his abdominal cavity on May 12, 2018.\n\nThe former civil servant murdered and dismembered several of his victims, most of them homeless young gay men, at his home in Muswell Hill, north London.\n\nHe strangled his victims and would sit with their posed bodies for days afterwards.\n\n(Image: Unknown)\n\nNilsen had been found slumped over the toilet in the prison where he was serving a whole life sentence for his heinous murders.\n\nHe was checked over by medics in his cell on the morning of May 10, 2018 and was told to provide a urine sample and visit the prison's clinic later that day.\n\nThe inquest heard Nilsen was left deteriorating in his own faeces as health care staff refused to review his condition throughout the day.\n\nHull Coroners' Court heard a post-mortem revealed Nilsen had suffered a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was only detected when paramedics examined him after 6pm.\n\nHe was successfully operated on at York District Hospital and transferred to intensive care.\n\nHis condition worsened and he died in the early hours of May 12, 2018.\n\n(Image: ExpressStar)\n\nThe inquest heard how the killer had refused to engage with healthcare providers in the prison since he was transferred there in 2003.\n\nHe refused to have a routine screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is offered to all men when they reach 65.\n\nThe inquest heard that had the aneurysm been detected by a screening, it was \"likely\" it could have been treated before it ruptured.\n\nNilsen, who was jailed for his crimes in 1983, was said to have been \"polite\" with staff, but had no close friends or associates in the category A prison.\n\nKenneth Bottomer, supervising officer, said he \"kept himself to himself\".\n\nThe inquest heard how he rang the bell in his cell to call for help and told prison officers he was in \"excruciating pain\".\n\nStaff at the prison said they did not issue a \"code blue\" call as Nilsen was not having difficulty breathing, but made numerous calls to healthcare through May 10 to ask for help.\n\nA paramedic described Nilsen as looking \"ashen\" when they arrived at the prison.\n\nThe court heard how they were delayed in transporting Nilsen from his cell to the ambulance and leaving the prison by around 30 minutes due to security procedures in place.\n\nA statement by Sue McAllister, the Prison and Probations Ombudsman for England and Wales, slammed an \"unacceptable\" delay in the ambulance leaving the prison.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail)\n\nHer statement, which was read out at the hearing, said: \"The standard of care he (Nilsen) received in prison was of the same standard he would have received in the community.\n\n\"However, I am concerned that when Nilsen's health deteriorated that day, health care staff did not review his health when asked.\n\n\"As a result, he lay in his own faeces as his condition worsened for around two hours.\n\n\"There was also an unacceptable delay of getting the ambulance out of the prison and the patient to hospital.\"\n\nSenior coroner Paul Marks recorded a verdict of natural causes and said he would write informally to NHS England regarding delays in ambulances getting out of prisons.\n\nNilsen committed at least 12 murders between 1978 and 1983 and is thought to have killed 15 men in total, making him Britain's second worst serial killer behind disgraced doctor Harold Shipman.\n\nHis victims between 1978 and 1981 were murdered at his home in Cricklewood, North London, and their remains were burned on a bonfire.\n\nThe final three victims were killed in 1982 and 1983 at his Muswell Hill home and the flesh and small bones were flushed down the toilet.\n\nHe was convicted of six counts of murder and two of attempted murder and jailed in 1983.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nNilsen admitted killing at least 15 people, but he was convicted of the murders of six men: Kenneth James Ockenden, Martyn Brandon Duffey, William David Sutherland, Malcolm Barlow, John Peter Howlett, Stephen Neil Sinclair.\n\nThe killer, who was born in Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, usually met his victims in pubs and bars and lured them to their deaths, strangling them and sometimes drowning them.\n\nHe washed and dressed the bodies, sat with them for days or weeks before dismembering them, and carried out sexual acts with the corpses.\n\nAfter removing their internal organs that were dumped nearby, he got rid of the remains.\n\nHe was caught by accident when a drain outside his home became blocked by the remains he tried to flush away.\n\nHe and other tenants in his block of flats had complained to the landlord about the smell from the drains.\n\nAn inspection by a plumber found pipes packed with human flesh.", "description": "Dennis Nilsen, the UK's second most prolific serial killer, died after being found slumped over a toilet at HMP Full
