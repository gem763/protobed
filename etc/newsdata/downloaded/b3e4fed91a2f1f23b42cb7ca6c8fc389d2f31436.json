REUTERS/Alberto Lingria/File Photo\n\nRenzi, who led a PD administration from 2014-2016, was instrumental in piecing together the new coalition earlier this month after the far-right League, led by former Interior Ministry Matteo Salvini, walked out of an alliance with the 5-Star Movement in the hope of triggering an early election.\n\nHowever, Renzi, now a member of Senate for PD, has had an abrasive relationship with his party, especially with left-wingers, and there have been persistent rumours he was planning to set up a new movement.\n\nIn an interview with daily newspaper la Repubblica published on Tuesday Renzi said PD was now a bunch of factions.\n\n\u201cI am afraid it will not be able to respond to Salvini\u2019s aggressions and to the difficult cohabitation with 5-Star Movement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to spend the coming months fighting against Salvini,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bad populism he represents has not been defeated\u201d.\n\nThe parliamentary groups of the new force would be created this week, Renzi said, adding some 30 lawmakers would follow him.\n\nPD has 111 seats in the lower house of Italian parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, and 51 in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThat will be good for everyone,\u201d Renzi said of the breakaway, adding it would allow the government \u201cto probably expand its parliamentary support\u201d.\n\nPD\u2019s Secretary Nicola Zingaretti said Renzi\u2019s decision was a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry,\u201d he said on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to analysts, Renzi\u2019s move might make it harder for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to keep his government in office. But others think Renzi might succeed in claiming the middle ground of Italian politics.\n\nPD lawmakers Ettore Rosato and Ivan Scalfarotto said earlier this week a new party might attract dissidents from Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party, broadening the coalition\u2019s parliamentary majority.\n\nSupport for Forza Italia has sunk since the 2018 national election, while backing for the far-right League has soared. Renzi\u2019s backers believe this has created a big hole at the centre of domestic politics that they hope to fill.\n\nFrancesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar, said Renzi was giving himself more political bargaining power over policy and public appointments.\n\n\u201cIn the PD he would have been a minority shareholder without board position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a mortal threat to the government yet, but it makes its prospects less rosy because it increases fragmentation and may contribute to instability\u201d he added.", "description": "Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will lead a breakaway from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) this week and set up a new centrist force, he was quoted as saying on Tuesday, stressing the move could broaden the appeal of the coalition government.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430749275&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0C2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
