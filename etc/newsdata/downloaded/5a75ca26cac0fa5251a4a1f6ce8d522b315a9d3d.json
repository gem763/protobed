But dramatically, the stories feel like a drug to cure insomnia.\n\nCORONATION STREET\n\nTEARS FOR FEARS\n\nSinead Tinker (Katie McGlynn) fights back tears as she breaks the news to family and friends that she only has weeks to live. Pictured, with Daniel (Rob Mallard)\n\nYou\u2019d have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by Sinead\u2019s struggle, and despite agreeing with Daniel to savour every day, she receives more bad news when the oncologist says she has just weeks to live.\n\nIt\u2019s just not what you want to hear at any time, let alone when you have to attend Ken\u2019s 80th.\n\nAnd it gets worse, when Daniel reveals that he and Beth have also made it a surprise party for Bertie\u2019s first birthday (don\u2019t these people watch EastEnders and the horrors of every surprise party since time began?).\n\nLEAST LIKELY OUTCOME \u2018I just want you to be \u2019appy.\u2019 Robert to Michelle, Corrie\n\nFighting back tears at Bertie\u2019s bash in the back yard (inset), Sinead publicly announces her imminent demise.\n\nBack at the flat, she expresses regret at having to leave Daniel, although secure in the knowledge Bertie will be in safe hands.\n\nSeriously, stock up on the Kleenex; both performances (Katie McGlynn and Rob Mallard) will have you drowning in tears.\n\nActually, forget the Kleenex; start lining up the buckets.\n\nIn other news, following their break-up, Ali looks on jealously as Gary flirts with Maria.\n\nTalk about frying pan to fire, Maria.\n\nWhy not just barbecue yourself right now and have done with the middle man?\n\nEASTENDERS\n\nBEDSIDE MANNERS\n\nSonia (Natalie Cassidy), seated centre, accuses Martin (James Bye), right, of not being there for Bex (Jasmin Armfield), in bed, as they gather by her bedside in EastEnders\n\nWith Bex in hospital, will this be the moment everyone realises that springing a surprise send-off is always going to end in tears? In fact, the only pleasant surprise with them is if someone does not end up dead/unconscious/choking on one of Ian\u2019s vol-au-vents.\n\nOblivious to what has happened between Martin and the Mitchells, Sonia takes the opportunity of her ex\u2019s presence at Bex\u2019s bedside to accuse him of not being there for his daughter.\n\nQUESTION OF THE DECADE \u2018What\u2019s the story with you and Ally McBeal?\u2019 Debbie to Sophie, Corrie\n\nHang on \u2013 this from the woman who put Bex up for adoption, has enjoyed stints as both a man- and woman-eater and was arrested for the murder of Pauline.\n\nI\u2019d say Martin has a veritable clingfilm of a relationship with Bex among that lot.\n\nFeeling guilty (that\u2019s a first), Sonia begs Martin to stay and he and Bex return to the Square to have a heart to heart.\n\nNow if there\u2019s one thing more doomed than a surprise party, it\u2019s an East End \u2019eart to \u2019eart.\n\nSure enough, within minutes, Martin and Ben spot each other across the Square.\n\nThink Djokovic and Nadal on opposite sides of the net; Spassky and Fischer on opposite sides of a chessboard.\n\nOn second thoughts, think Beavis and Butt-Head.\n\nThe two are forced to join forces when Jags reveals he\u2019s kidnapped Lola (who\u2019s minding Martin\u2019s stall during all this, by the way?), but tensions again reach breaking point when Ben reneges on a promise.\n\nYer don\u2019t say.\n\nEMMERDALE: FAKE IT TO MAKE IT\n\nMandy (Lisa Riley), pictured, pretends to be Lydia Hart in the hopes of getting money from a mysterious solicitor in Emmerdale\n\nDoes losing weight make you selfish? Each time Mandy returns, slimmer and more glamorous, she\u2019s more of a Mean Girl than the time before.\n\nWhen a mysterious solicitor (is there any other kind? This one looks like Don Corleone\u2019s lawyer) turns up at Wishing Well, he tells Mandy that Lydia Hart has been gifted a large sum of money.\n\nMandy wastes no time in pretending to be Lydia as she tries to persuade Mr Dodgy to hand over the dosh.\n\nWill she feel guilty when Lydia and Sam arrive? She needs to lay off the lettuce and recapture the cuddly part of her soul.\n\nBarry Manilow\u2019s Mandy, she ain\u2019t.", "description": "In this week's Coronation Street, Sinead publicly announces that she has just weeks to live.
