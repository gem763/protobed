But this is just a momentary setback considering the depth and reach of the organisation worldwide,\" Lorenzana said. \"Somebody will take his place.\"\n\nSoutheast Asia has long been an important focus for ISIL, which has inspired fighters in West Africa, across the Middle East and Asia, through to Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nThe Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are concerned ISIL supporters from the region and those fleeing Iraq and Syria could exploit the porous borders, lawlessness, and abundant arms found in Mindanao to take refuge in its far-flung villages.\n\nISIL has claimed responsibility for four suicide bombings since July last year in the Philippines, which fought its toughest battle since World War II in 2017 when fighters seeking to establish an \"Islamic state\" laid siege to Marawi City and occupied it through five months of air-and-ground assaults.\n\nFighters from at least seven countries took part, including Malaysia, which remains on high alert and has arrested 400 people suspected of links to armed groups.\n\nMalaysian police counterterrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said the real concern was not ISIL's leadership but the effect of its teachings.\n\n\"It's good news, but his death will have little impact here as the main problem remains the spread of the Islamic State ideology,\" he said.\n\n\"What we are most worried about now are 'lone wolf' attacks and those who are self-radicalised through the internet. We are still seeing the spread of IS teachings online. IS publications and magazines from years ago are being reproduced and re-shared,\" he said.\n\n'Never stop'\n\nChatrooms in messaging applications such as Telegram showed defiant messages about al-Baghdadi's death, according to a researcher who monitors activity by ISIL sympathisers.\n\n\"God Willing, whatever happens, Islamic jihad will not rely on any one individual, but will always stand tall on the orders of God and His Prophet,\" read one posting under the handle Ansurul Ummah.\n\nAnother participant, Abu Abdullah Asy Syami, posted: \"Jihad will never stop, even if our own caliph dies.\"\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison made a similar observation, and said al-Baghdadi's death was by no means the end.\n\n\"This is a many-headed monster... As you cut one off another one inevitably arises,\" he told reporters.\n\nIndonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, is grappling with a resurgence in militancy and has detained hundreds of suspects this year under tightened anti-terrorism laws.\n\nAuthorities believe thousands of Indonesians draw inspiration from ISIL and about 500 are thought to have joined the group in Syria.\n\nIndonesia's intelligence agency said it was ready for retaliation and though al-Baghdadi's death would be a psychological blow, ISIL would have a successor in place.\n\n191022063320387\n\n\"It is a war. Usually, there must be a counterattack or the like. When it comes to security, we are sure that we will secure this country,\" said spokesman Wawan Purwanto.\n\nSecurity analyst Rommel Banlaoi said al-Baghdadi's demise and uncertainty about the leadership could undermine operations of ISIL loyalists seeking to regroup and establish their own territory in Southeast Asia.\n\n\"Pro-ISIS groups in the Philippines will surely re-examine their roles in the post-Baghdadi era,\" he said.", "description": "Officials say while death of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi will unsettle the group, it remains capable and dangerous.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2016/9/3/aa7e646ddf6a4f9295818141b3db5eee_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
