There\u2019s much to support in the governor\u2019s language, but what\u2019s most interesting to me is the approach taken to the most controversial portions of the bill; the \u201cred flag\u201d and background check proposal. Both are worth serious consideration, if for no other reason that unlike most gun control bills, these proposals were put together with a sincere mind towards protecting the rights of gun owners, not trying to eradicate them. Already the mainstream media in Ohio is calling it a \u201cretreat\u201d from the governor\u2019s earlier positions, when it seems to me that DeWine is at least trying to do something that works, instead of just \u201cdoing something.\u201d\n\nThe background check measure proposed by Governor DeWine doesn\u2019t impose any sort of universal background check on private sales. Instead, the governor wants to increase the penalties for providing a gun to a prohibited person, while lowering the standard to convict from \u201crecklessness\u201d to \u201cnegligence\u201d. What is currently an 18-month prison sentence would be doubled to three years, according to the governor. To help private gun owners when they\u2019re selling to strangers, the governor wants to create a process by which the seller can go to the county sheriff to conduct a background check.\n\nUnder the governor\u2019s plan, people looking to sell a gun privately to another individual could go to their county sheriff, who would run a background check on the potential buyer. If the check came back clean, the sheriff would issue a \u201cseller protection certificate\u201d to the would-be seller, offering confidence that he or she was selling the gun to a respectable buyer.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting plan, though I think DeWine would have been better off increasing the penalties for selling a gun to a prohibited person without lowering the legal standard. DeWine is a champion of criminal justice reform, but it\u2019s kinda hard to support criminal justice reform while making it easier to put people in prison for a longer period of time. Having said that, this is a much more workable idea than a compulsory background check law for even temporary transfers between friends. The premise behind DeWine\u2019s proposal has some actual common sense to it. In fact it requires gun owners to use some common sense. Don\u2019t know who\u2019s buying your guns? Better make sure they\u2019re allowed to have them. Selling them to one of your friends, or someone you know and trust? Go ahead.\n\nDeWine\u2019s approach to a \u201cred flag\u201d law is noticeably different from what we\u2019ve seen in other states as well. First, it\u2019s not really a \u201cred flag\u201d at all, but a \u201cpink slip\u201d, which is what Ohioans apparently call the paperwork to civilly commit someone. The process of removing firearms would exist within the existing civil commitment laws under DeWine\u2019s plan. There is no scenario where police come and take your guns, and in three days to two weeks you have a hearing to determine if you\u2019ll get them back. To DeWine\u2019s credit, this proposal focuses on the individual, not just their guns. The Cleveland Plain-Dealer\u2018s Jeremy Pelzer calls it a \u201cretreat\u201d by the governor, but it\u2019s actually one of the more thoughtful proposals I\u2019ve seen in how deal with someone who\u2019s in a crisis.\n\n\u2026 the governor\u2019s new proposal builds on state\u2019s existing \u201cpink-slip\u201d law allowing involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for people suspected of being likely to cause harm to themselves or others. Under existing law, such people cannot own or buy a gun. Individuals undergoing court-ordered treatment would have the option to sell their firearms to a licensed firearm dealer, turn their firearms over to a family member, or give them to police, according to his proposal. Right now, state law doesn\u2019t allow \u201cpink slips\u201d for drug or alcohol problems. The governor\u2019s proposal would change the law to include such issues. DeWine said he revised his earlier gun plan because of concerns it wouldn\u2019t pass the GOP-dominated legislature. But he said the new plan would \u201cget the job done.\u201d\n\nI have some concerns about expanding the civil commitment laws to include alcoholism and drug abuse, but I can also understand why some people might think it\u2019s necessary. Ohio has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country, and it\u2019s possible that this will allow thousands of individuals to fight their addiction and live a productive life.\n\nHonestly, the measure isn\u2019t a really a \u201cgun bill\u201d at all, but an expansion of the civil commitment process for gun owners and non-gun owners alike. Lt. Governor Jon Hulsted explicitly stated that one of the concerns about every other red flag law out there (with the exception of Maine) is that they all supposedly deal with people who are dangerous to themselves or others, but there\u2019s no mental health component to the red flag order. It\u2019s a gun control bill masquerading as a mental health bill. The proposal unveiled today is a true mental health measure, not a gun control bill, and my concerns about the pink slip portion of the bill are about how it would impact gun owners and non-gun owners alike.\n\nThe governor\u2019s proposed legislation isn\u2019t the end of the story. State legislators and other officials may end up offering complementary or competing legislation, and gun owners in the state should weigh each of these proposals in balance against each other. Without endorsing or condemning DeWine\u2019s proposals (for the time being) beyond the concerns outlined above, I will say I do think this was a sincere attempt on the part of a lot of folks in Ohio (including some staunch 2nd Amendment supporters) to come up with something that passes constitutional muster as well as being effective, practical, and not about punishing legal gun ownership under the guise of promoting public safety. For that, I applaud the effort.", "description": "Ohio Governor Mike DeWine unveiled a 17-point public safety proposal Monday, including a new approach to background checks and \"red flag\" laws.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dewine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
