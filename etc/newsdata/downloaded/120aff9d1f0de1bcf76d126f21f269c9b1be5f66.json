Ceferin answered in English in an attempt to reassure the fans.\n\nThe lawyer said that Uefa has no plans to sanction a division comprised of the game\u2019s richest clubs insulated from relegation. \u201cI value very much this opportunity to clarify that there has never been a concept of European Super League considered by Uefa in the notion you describe of a competition reserved to a handful of powerful clubs selected on the basis of their history/brand/renown, cutting themselves off the rest of the system,\u201d the letter says.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nUefa is considering substantive changes to the format of the Champions League. From 2024 the competition will have 32 teams in four groups of eight. The bottom two sides in each group will be relegated with four of the clubs replaced by the Europa League semi-finalists. It has not yet been decided how the other four slots will be filled but it is likely that a pre-tournament knockout phase will take place between teams who performed well in their domestic league.\n\nThe concern is that 24 sides will retain their Champions League places each season regardless of their performances at home. It is a fundamental shift that undermines the importance of the domestic game. There are also plans to introduce another European trophy to give some of the smaller leagues more access to continental competition.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They have been actively looking for replacements - including Juventus\u2019 Paolo Dybala - but the situation remains complicated by technical and financial issues, particularly regarding Financial Fair Play.

Ceferin is correct to say that it will not create a closed league. However, it will be extremely difficult for teams outside the gilded circle to force their way into the Champions League. The Premier League is likely to be one of the biggest losers if the new system is introduced. Television money will be drawn to the new competition \u2013 which will feature at least four of England\u2019s biggest clubs \u2013 and the Premier League\u2019s financial firepower is likely to be significantly weakened.\n\nThere is real resentment across Europe over the riches at the top end of English football. Ceferin\u2019s letter hints at this indignation as he suggests Middlesbrough fans should be grateful for their status. \u201cEven if your club does not belong to the so-called elite, please never forget that you enjoy a situation of privilege if you compare to most part of Europe as the UK is a leading market offering football top class infrastructure and significant financial resources,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe Uefa president last week postponed talks with the European Clubs Association (ECA) and the European Leagues body scheduled for September 11, saying that \u201ca new discussion now would be premature as we are analysing feedback and proposals coming from different parties.\u201d\n\nThe Premier League is against the restructure of European competition but the \u2018Big Six\u2019 \u2013 Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 have mixed feelings about the possible changes. In an interview last week Liverpool\u2019s chairman and co-owner Tom Werner was unequivocal about his club\u2019s stance. \u201cOur first intention is to protect the inherent strength of the Premier League,\u201d Werner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to participate in anything that in any way harms that experience both from a Liverpool supporter\u2019s point of view and also in terms of the primacy of English football.\u201d\n\nThe financial rewards available in the new system will put that position to the test. The criteria for awarding the 32 places in the revamped Champions League has not been decided but it is likely to be a combination of league performances in the previous four seasons. European success may play a part, too. Liverpool are almost certain to be given a slot even if they have a dreadful campaign.\n\nAfter the Premier League annual general meeting in June, representatives of the Big Six flew to Malta to attend an ECA meeting and express England\u2019s objections to Uefa\u2019s plans. John W Henry, Werner\u2019s fellow owner, never made it to the island and the English clubs\u2019 opposition to the changes was, at best, lukewarm.\n\nThere is also a vacuum at the top of the Premier League. The chief executive and chairman roles have remained vacant since the retirement of Richard Scudamore last year. At a time when the domestic game needs strong direction, the main leadership positions are still empty.\n\nThe Football Supporters\u2019 Association (FSA) and club groups like the Middlesbrough Supporters Forum have serious concerns about the future of the sport. The FSA is in the process of making fans across the country aware of the consequences of recent developments and will be organising protests at grounds during the autumn.\n\nCeferin\u2019s letter is unlikely to reassure any of the interested parties. Promotion and relegation will continue to exist in European competition but the degree of difficulty required for clubs to reach and become a regular member of the Champions League elite 24 make rising to the top extremely unlikely.
