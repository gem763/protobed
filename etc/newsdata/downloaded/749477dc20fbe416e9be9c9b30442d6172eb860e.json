He could end up disabled.\"\n\nAnd professional powerlifter Kirill Sychev agreed, stating: \"You can see it in his face, there is something unhealthy about it.\n\n\"This is a person, who needs complex medical help. Not just to drain his arms and detox his blood, but also psychiatric help.\"", "description": "Kirill\u00a0Tereshin is known as 'Popeye' after he developed enormous arms by injecting highly dangerous synthol", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663172.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_201019Slug_2477JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
