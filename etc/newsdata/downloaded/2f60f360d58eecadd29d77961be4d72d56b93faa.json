So, certainly in the last 18 months, that would be the first time that we\u2019ve let ourselves down in terms of the level of the performance, but I\u2019m also realistic: that can happen.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You can have nights where you don\u2019t hit the level. I think there\u2019s always a tactical and technical element to that. But to a man they have been entirely honest about that. None of them have hidden from the fact that they are all disappointed individually and, of course, collectively.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he\u2019d move to three at the back after a hugely uncertain night for a four-man defence, Southgate said: \u201cI think we have to stay calm on the back of a result, that we don\u2019t throw everything out of the window. The best way to improve is to play in the same way and play better, and do it with better detail. And of course, there are players who we\u2019re giving football to in key areas, like Declan Rice who\u2019s still 19 years old. I\u2019ve got to always remember that, that we\u2019re putting a lot of onus on young players.\n\nLook at those moments and say: \u2018OK, this is the time for a solid performance, get back on track. Remember the objective is to qualify.\u2019 We\u2019ve been trying to qualify, develop the team, blood players, and the other night that didn\u2019t quite work for us. But, it\u2019s the first time it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSouthgate said they have had discussions about control of matches, and \u201cgame management\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do have meetings about that. At times, in the past we have put scenarios into training and of course a lot of that, the players just have to live through that, through experiences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a team that has got to go through those sorts of experiences, a lot of them haven\u2019t played in qualifiers in those sorts of scenarios but it\u2019s key to winning big matches. You\u2019re not going to win every game by four or five goals, especially going away from home and you do have to manage those periods, especially the last 10 minutes, where you\u2019ve got to say OK, we haven\u2019t played well but we\u2019ve come away with a point and then we\u2019d be sitting here saying we could qualify tomorrow night.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate has told his England\u00a0players to stick with the plan for Monday\u2019s match away to Bulgaria, as he insisted Friday\u2019s defeat to Czech Republic was an \u201caberration\u201d.
