He was 69 years old.\n\nMr. Ingrassia, who also served as managing editor of the Thomson Reuters news service and president of Dow Jones Newswires, was the author of three books vividly describing pivotal moments in the car business.\n\nIn 1993, when he was chief of the Journal\u2019s Detroit bureau, he and his deputy, Joseph B. White, won a Pulitzer for their reporting on turmoil at General Motors, including major losses, factory closings and the ouster of Chairman Robert C. Stempel.\n\n\u201cPaul Ingrassia was not just one of the most accomplished journalists to ever work at Dow Jones, but one of its smartest, most decent and most caring leaders,\u201d said Matt Murray, editor in chief of the Journal. \u201cHis fortitude, spine of steel and deep dedication to the highest principles of journalism set an example for the rest of us on how to do our jobs and how to live our lives.\u201d\n\nRead a 1992 front-page story on GM.\n\nMr. White, who shared the Pulitzer with Mr. Ingrassia, recalled his \u201cgift for being able to strike up friendships and personal relationships with people who were running the car companies\u2014not just at the high levels but at the middle levels.\u201d Mr. Ingrassia asked the toughest questions in a polite, rather than prosecutorial, tone and remained friendly with people in the industry even while writing about their failings. The message, Mr. White said, was that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be nasty to get a good story.\u201d\n\nMr. Ingrassia had endured cancer treatments off and on for more than two decades. In 2016, when he received a Gerald Loeb award for lifetime achievement in financial journalism, he referred to his health struggles, saying: \u201cI often think that my biggest lifetime achievement is simply having a lifetime.\u201d\n\nHis death came about six months after that of one of his three sons, Charles Ingrassia, who died of cancer at age 39 in February. His two sisters, Gina and Angela, died in the 1980s of cancer. Some members of the family have the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare disorder that increases cancer risk.\n\nHis books on the auto industry included \u201cComeback\u201d (1994), written with Mr. White; \u201cCrash Course\u201d (2010) and \u201cEngines of Change\u201d (2012).\n\nSince 2016, he was a member of the five-person Dow Jones Special Committee, responsible for monitoring The Wall Street Journal\u2019s adherence to the highest ethical and professional standards.\n\nRead the Journal\u2019s story on his Pulitzer.\n\nPaul Joseph Ingrassia was born Aug. 18, 1950, in Laurel, Miss. His father was a research chemist and his mother a homemaker. The family moved to Carol Stream, Ill., a Chicago suburb, when he was 10 years old. His early jobs included mowing lawns, delivering newspapers and working as a short-order cook.\n\nA love of sports led him into journalism. While studying at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he explained in a 2014 interview, \u201cI kind of wanted to get free tickets to the football games, and so I signed up to cover sports for the student newspaper.\u201d He discovered a gift for telling stories and interviewing people. \u201cYou just felt you were part of something larger than you are,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Illinois, he earned a master\u2019s degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin in Madison.\n\nEarly in his career, he was an editorial writer at the Lindsay-Schaub newspaper group in Decatur, Ill. He joined the Journal in 1977 as a reporter in Chicago and served as Cleveland bureau chief from 1981 until 1985, when he became the Detroit bureau chief.\n\nMr. Ingrassia headed Dow Jones Newswires and then spent several years on book projects before serving as managing editor and other senior posts at Thomson Reuters from 2011 to 2016.\n\nHe met Susan Rougeau while they were attending graduate school at the University of Wisconsin. They married in 1973. He is survived by her, as well as two sons, a grandson and his younger brother, Lawrence Ingrassia, a former Journal assistant managing editor.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Reuters, Mr. Ingrassia said covering the auto industry offered him \u201ca platform for writing about almost any major issue of our day: globalization, technology, environmental issues, labor-management issues, design, competition between companies and nations, and culture.\u201d\n\nHe also was asked to name his favorite car. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of like saying, \u2018Which of your children do you like best?\u2019\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI have a little 10-year-old BMW wagon that\u2019s got 60,000 miles on it, and I just love it.\u201d\n\nMr. Ingrassia admired leaders who were able to laugh at themselves. One of them was Sergio Marchionne, a former chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV who died last year. In 2014, Mr. Ingrassia conducted an onstage interview with Mr. Marchionne at the Brookings Institution in Washington. After the interview, Mr. Ingrassia mentioned to Mr. Marchionne that he was heading for Moscow to interview Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader.\n\n\u201cThis means I\u2019ll be interviewing two dictators in one week!\u201d Mr. Ingrassia added. As he anticipated, Mr. Marchionne appreciated the joke.\n\nWrite to James R.
