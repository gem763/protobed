Today, we examine the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nThere is less than a month to go before the Jets open training camp, and like plenty of NHL teams, they have a couple of critical players unsigned in restricted free agents Patrik Laine and Kyle Connor.\n\nThe market yet has been set with an elite-level, restricted free-agent group that includes Brock Boeser (Vancouver), Mitch Marner (Toronto), Colin White (Ottawa), Matthew Tkachuk (Calgary), Jesse Puljujarvi (Edmonton), Charlie McAvoy (Boston), Travis Konecny (Philadelphia), Mikko Rantanen (Colorado) and others.\n\nTwo months ago, the Jets began to clear some salary cap space and have paid a hefty price to reduce their payroll. Jacob Trouba was dealt to the New York Rangers in exchange for Neal Pionk and the 20th overall selection in the 2019 draft, Finnish defenceman Ville Heinola.\n\nWinnipeg also lost three significant players in defencemen Tyler Myers and Ben Chiarot as well as one of head coach Paul Maurice's favourites in the hard-working and swift skating Brandon Tanev.\n\nMore of the offensive burden will be placed on the shoulders of centre Mark Scheifele (55) this upcoming season. (Jeff Roberson/The Associated Press)\n\nEach was an unrestricted free agent. Myers bolted out West to the Vancouver Canucks, while Chiarot signed on to bolster the Montreal Canadiens blue-line and Tanev upped the grit level with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nCentre Kevin Hayes also signed with the Philadelphia Flyers. His brief stint with Jets after being acquired at the trade deadline never caught on in Winnipeg the way Paul Stastny did the year before.\n\nWinnipeg general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff always has been confident and content to develop players from within.\n\nHe's also shopping around veteran forward Mathieu Perreault and defenceman Dmitri Kulikov in the hopes of shedding more salary. But each makes more than $4 million US per season and will be challenging to move.\n\nPlayoff loss still stings\n\nEven though four months have elapsed since the Jets quick six-game elimination from the playoffs in the first round to the eventual Stanley Cup-champion St. Louis Blues, the outcome still stings.\n\nThe Jets were not alone. They and the three other teams from the 2018 conference finals \u2014 the Washington Capitals, Tampa Bay Lightning and Vegas Golden Knights \u2014 each found themselves on the sidelines after the opening round of the 2019 playoffs.\n\nWATCH | Blues eliminate Jets from Stanley Cup playoffs:\n\nThe Blues eliminated the Jets with a 3-2 win in Game 6, on Saturday night in St. Louis. 2:16\n\nThe Jets advanced to the West final in 2018, and big things were expected from Mark Scheifele and company last spring. But the Blues' toughness and determination proved to be too much.\n\nThe Jets still are a playoff-bound team, but their contender status has taken a hit with the loss of the aforementioned key players, especially three of their top five defenceman.\n\nTrouba was a capable partner for the emerging Josh Morrissey. Myers and Chiarot have size and mobility and they gobbled up minutes. Their departure leaves a blue line significantly downgraded.\n\nMid-sized 6-foot-1, 176-pound Sami Niku will get a shot on the Jets blue-line and could see some power-play time with their second unit. He played 30 games for Winnipeg last season.\n\nDefenceman Tucker Poolman and forwards Mason Appleton and Kristian Vesalainen will get a chance to fill in for the absences. Vesalainen, Andrew Copp and Jack Roslovic are options to be promoted to the top six forwards if Connor and Laine aren't signed in time.\n\nBut the two wingers who combined for 64 goals last season are paramount to the Jets' future. Sure, Laine faded down the stretch. He had only one goal in the final 19 regular-season games, and none of his three playoff goals were significant.\n\nIt will be up to Maurice, who enters his seventh season behind the Jets' bench, to make Laine more accountable and further develop the core of the team.", "description": "Even though four months have elapsed since the Winnipeg Jets' quick six-game elimination from the playoffs in the first round to the eventual Stanley Cup-champion St. Louis Blues, the outcome still stings.
