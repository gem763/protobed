I was pleased to come on and give us a bit of comfort.\u201d\n\nEverton came into the match on the back of four consecutive league defeats that had turned up the heat on Silva, but there was little to suggest they were lacking in confidence despite missing several chances to further improve the scoreline.\n\nThe Portuguese has faced criticism for rigid tactics in recent weeks but his decision to deploy Richarlison as a striker paid off as the Brazilian troubled West Ham throughout and had a goal ruled out for offside after the break.\n\nThe opening goal came minutes after Tom Davies had an effort from point-blank range saved by Jiminez and shortly before Richarlison struck the post from the right.\n\nWalcott, one of five changes to the team from Everton\u2019s last game against Burnley, struck the crossbar with a blistering volley in the 64th minute after Lucas Digne\u2019s free kick was headed away by West Ham\u2019s Angelo Ogbonna.\n\nAlex Iwobi also missed a clear chance in the 77th minute as he shot straight at the keeper from close range.\n\n\u201cThe game felt like we needed to start taking our chances, we had so many,\u201d Walcott said.\n\n\u201cThe sense of urgency was what we needed. It showed how good we can be going forward. We know the quality in the team and we know what to expect from each other.\u201d\n\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini brought on Ukraine forward Andriy Yarmolenko in place of Felipe Anderson at the start of the second half and although the London side appeared a lot sharper, they were unable to score.\n\nEverton, who have 10 points from their opening nine games and provisionally rose to 12th in the table, visit Brighton & Hove Albion next Saturday while West Ham, in eighth with 12 points, host promoted Sheffield United.", "description": "Everton snapped a four-game losing streak as Bernard's superb solo goal in the first half and midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson's stunner in added time helped the struggling Premier League side beat West Ham United 2-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442679486&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0CA", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
