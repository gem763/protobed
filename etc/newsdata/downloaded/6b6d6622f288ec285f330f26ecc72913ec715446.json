Will it actually survive to reach 200? We take a deep dive into the state of the league and the challenges that could derail the NFL as the undisputed king of American sports. USA TODAY\n\nNFL Films' \"100 Greatest\" series, celebrating the league's 100th season, rolled on Friday night with the reveal of the top 30 greatest games in NFL history.\n\nThe list of the league's 100 greatest contests was compiled by an 80-person panel put together by the Associated Press and NFL Media, with results revealed in another multi-part special on NFL Network.\n\nIn perhaps something we should have seen coming, \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" was revealed as the best game in NFL history.\n\nThat nickname was given to the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants. The rosters were loaded with future Hall of Famers, and the contest was the first title game to go to overtime \u2013 forced when legendary Colts QB Johnny Unitas engineered a two-minute drill with the help of wide receiver Raymond Berry.

Green Bay went on to beat the Raiders in the Super Bowl, providing the final title in Vince Lombardi's Packers tenure.\n\nThis is the second of several lists that will be revealed throughout the season.
