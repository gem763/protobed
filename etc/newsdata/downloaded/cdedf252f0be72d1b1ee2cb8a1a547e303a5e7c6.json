Raytheon has developed a high-powered laser capable of immobilizing drones in mid-flight. Its high energy laser works by sending out a concentrated beam of energy at light speed toward a target. The HELWS can fire between 20 and 30 times and run its tracking system for up to four hours on a single charge. If connected to a generator it can fire a virtually infinite number of times. The HELWS can be fastened to a number of vehicles, including attack helicopters, drones, and dune buggies. The cost for developing two prototypes for the US Air Force was $23,817,657. The weapon also utilizes several technologies that help it track UAVs, including: windshear tracking software. Windshear is a software interface that allows rapid 'plug and play' detection of multiple kinds of drone detecting sensors, including radio, radar, acoustic, electro-optical, and infrared. Windshear uses data from the sensors connected to it to lock on the drone as it moves. The high-powered laser fires at the drone based on tracking software data. The laser damage disrupts the drone\u2019s flight systems and causes it to crash.\n\nLast year, ISIS was found promoting a plan to use drones to bomb fans at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nLast month, the Air Force announced an investment in another anti-drone technology, a $16.28 million microwave weapon that would disrupt drone functioning.\n\nCalled PHASER, this military owned device uses electromagnetic pulse to take down swarms of enemy drones.\n\nThe weapon is mounted on a 20-ft. trailer, and can detect and track threats using its own radar or be 'plugged in' to other sensors.\n\nRaytheon has developed an entire ecosystem of anti-drone technologies to sell the US military.\n\nThe company also sells a Coyote brand of drones that can seek and attack other drones.\n\nIt offers a special Stinger missile designed to detonate on contact with, or in the vicinity of, an enemy drone.\n\nRaytheon also provides a suite of sensor software called Windshear, that allows military personnel to operate all their different anti-drone devices from a laptop or mobile command station.\n\n\u2018Five years ago, few people worried about the drone threat,' Raytheon\u2019s president Roy Azevedo said.\n\n\u2018Now, we hear about attacks or incursions all the time. Our customers saw this coming and asked us to develop a ready-now counter-UAS capability.\n\n\u2018We did just that by going from the drawing board to delivery in less than 24 months.\u2019", "description": "Raytheon has delivered an experimental new anti-drone weapon to the Air Force.
