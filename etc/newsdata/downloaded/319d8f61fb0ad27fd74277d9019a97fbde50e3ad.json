In what can potentially (non-canonically) be considered the first of her old master rerecordings, Taylor Swift gave fans a gift with a slowed-down, piano-ballad version of her Red track \u201cHoly Ground.\u201d Bathed in Ultrafragola-worthy rose-gold light and playing in front of a panoramic backdrop of the Brooklyn Bridge, Swift recontextualized the track with a soulful, wise, post\u2013post\u2013\u201cWelcome to New York\u201d maturity. As Swift put it: \u201cI wanted to kind of flip the coin of the song and show another side of it.\u201d\n\nAlso, in the crossover event of the century (or at least the crossover event of BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge Month), Swift opened the set with a performance of her Anglophilic Lover track \u201cLondon Boy,\u201d which is presumably about her boyfriend Joe Alwyn but really is improved when you just sort of imagine that she\u2019s singing about Paddington. Swift bopping around, singing about Shoreditch and Brixton and saying things like \u201cfancy\u201d and \u201cuni\u201d in front of a majestically sun-kissed Brooklyn Bridge is definitely a whole entire confused mood and is worth a watch.\n\nSwift also covered the Phil Collins hit \u201cCan\u2019t Stop Loving You,\u201d which is actually a cover of a 1978 Leo Sayer song. It\u2019s swoony and romantic and very Swiftian. Swift cited Collins as an influence on her album 1989 in 2014, which was also the last time she performed at the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge. You can watch the rest of her set here.", "description": "Taylor Swift performed a six-song set in the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge in New York City on Monday to kick off a month of programming. This included four tracks from \u201cLover,\u201d a Phil Collins cover, and fan favorite \u201cRed\u201d cut \u201cHoly Ground.\u201d", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-taylor-swift.w1200.h630.jpg"}
