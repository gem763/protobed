She had been sentenced to two and a half years in jail with 15 months to be served and the rest suspended.\n\nMembers of the Massachusetts Parole Board said they were \"troubled that Ms. Carter not only encouraged Mr. Conrad [Roy] to take his own life, she actively prevented others from intervening in his suicide.\"\n\n\"Ms. Carter's self-serving statements and behavior, leading up to after his suicide, appear to be irrational and lacked sincerity,\" the members said. \"Release does not meet the legal standard.\"\n\nSteven Senne/AP\n\nCarter's attorney, Joseph Cataldo, told ABC News on Friday that the board's is based on the \"incorrect and dangerous\" of a prior legal ruling.\n\nHe said they have appealed with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"Additionally, it is never in society's best interest to incarcerate anyone for the content of their speech where there is not a specific statute previously enacted,\" he added.", "description": "Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for urging Conrad Roy to kill himself.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/michelle-carter1-ap-ml-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
