A poster for the series, which will be released on Friday, is shown above\n\nSepinwall praised performances by Crudup, Aniston and Witherspoon and called the direction by Mimi Leder 'confident and eye-catching', but concluded: 'The series is a well-polished snore, a prime example of how throwing money at a problem \u2014 in this case, Apple's need to dive into the streaming wars ... \u2014 isn't inherently the best way to solve it.'\n\nHe added that despite its #MeToo relevance, the show 'feels like it could have aired on broadcast TV anytime in the last 15 to 20 years, so long as the profanity got cut'.\n\nSepinwall compared The Morning Show to HBO's The Newsroom, harping that the former lacks the 'snappy dialogue, the soaring rhetoric, or any attempt whatsoever to argue for why anyone should care about the future of this show-within-the-show'.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Feinberg took aim at the central storyline, writing that Kessler's exit is 'rendered toothless by reality' and 'hard to buy', Levy's reaction to it is 'a bore' and Jackson's subsequent rise to the top is 'ridiculous and implausible'.\n\nFeinberg wrote that in the first two episodes the show is 'struggling and floundering to find its focus, tone and attitude toward its main characters' before finally becoming 'more satisfying and confident' by the third.\n\n'Did the behemoths at Apple really get into the crowded original TV marketplace to become the latest perpetrator of 'It eventually gets better!' patience-testing?' the critic asked.\n\nAniston stars Alex Levy, a TV anchor struggling to retain her position at a leading morning program after her co-host Mitch Kessler (Carell) is fired over sexual misconduct allegations\n\nWitherspoon stars as Bradley Jackson, a small-town conservative news reporter desperate to cement herself as Kessler's replacement on the show\n\nThe core cast is capped off by Billy Crudup as Cory Ellison (left), a broadcast network president newly-assigned to lead the news division despite his total lack of experience in the area, and Mark Duplass as Chip Black (right), the show's executive producer\n\nIndieWire critic Ben Travers' writes that The Morning Show's chief problem is that 'it trusts its story without knowing what it's trying to say'.\n\n'All the pretty people in the world can't keep you hooked when the purpose is this muddled, and hoo boy, is it hard to figure out what The Morning Show wants to accomplish, or even who we're meant to care about,' Travers wrote.\n\nHe echoed Sepinwall's praise for Aniston's 'engaging conviction to her performance' and Leder's 'empathetic eye and expansive vision' but questioned the decision to sympathize with powerful men accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nTo the extent The Morning Show is Apple's way of sounding the alarm for its new service, feel safe to hit the 'snooze' button. -CNN's Brian Lowry\n\n'Are we supposed to laugh at this privileged rich dude's ineptitude? Are we supposed to feel sorry for him?' Travers asked.\n\n'More often that not, it seems like the latter, and even after the third episode steers Mitch's story toward the edification of an ignorant predator blinded by power, it doesn't give us any reason to care about a guy who, at best, cheated on his wife all the time and, at worst, raped women.'\n\nBrian Lowry of CNN expressed similar concern, writing that Carell's Kessler 'comes across as a bit too likeable'.\n\n'This is one of those shows where the star power in some respects works against it,' Lowry wrote, adding that Witherspoon 'radiates a little too much movie-star vibe to be wholly convincing'.\n\nLowry's review lands on the devastating conclusion: 'To the extent The Morning Show is Apple's way of sounding the alarm for its new service, feel safe to hit the 'snooze' button.'\n\nWitherspoon, Carell and Aniston are seen at a press event for The Morning Show on October 13. Some critics charged that series' impressive cast gets in the way of the storyline\n\nVulture's Jen Chaney called The Morning Show 'a serious show that, in every frame and every performance, announces that it wants to be taken seriously'.\n\nChaney expressed skepticism over the showrunners' repeated insistence that the plot is not based on Lauer's fall from grace, writing that while Carell 'certainly doesn't appear to be trying to capture anything specific to the disgraced Today Show host in his performance', the similarities are impossible to ignore.\n\n'Mitch gets fired for sexual misconduct, then adamantly contends that he's the one being mistreated; his younger, model-esque wife leaves him; and it's revealed that he had a button under his desk that automatically locked and closed his dressing room door,' Chaney writes.\n\nCritics praised Aniston's portrayal of Levy, with one reviewer calling her performance 'one of the finest she's ever given'\n\n'If you can absorb all that and not be reminded of Matt Lauer, then either you were just born five minutes ago \u2014 in which case, welcome to the world! \u2014 or you have somehow never heard of Matt Lauer.'\n\nAmong the disappointing reviews were a few more optimistic ones.\n\nVanity Fair's Richard Lawson wrote: 'The Morning Show attempts to seize on this moment, and while the show doesn't always work, there's still something exciting about the trying.'\n\nHe admitted that series doesn't fully capture how news media works, but concluded: 'I find it hard to complain about a project that involves so many good actors happily talking themselves into storms, even if some of what they're saying has the tinny clang of the trite or over-generalized.'\n\nEntertainment Weekly's Kristen Baldwin encouraged viewers to give The Morning Show, writing that 'if we can all forgive the turgid early episodes of Succession \u2014 a primetime soap about aggrieved rich white men \u2014 surely we can power through some growing pains for this ambitious drama about aggrieved women who are putting their anger to work.'\n\nBaldwin applauded Aniston's 'forceful' performance as she 'pounds tables, rage-slams her phone onto counters, and yanks out hair extensions with such violent contempt, you'd think they owe her money.'\n\nThe AV Club's Alex McLevy charged that Aniston's performance is 'one of the finest she's ever given'.\n\n'Her Alex Levy is vulnerable, calculating, naive, arrogant, controlling, and messy all at once, a wonderfully freewheeling bundle of emotions and ruthless business savvy that jockey for dominance in her personality and in her constantly changing expressions,' McLevy wrote.\n\n'Aniston has never had such a meaty, outsized character before, and she dives headlong into the larger-than-life nature of the role.'\n\nHe continued: 'The only thing keeping Aniston from being the best part of this series is Crudup. His smirking, supercilious exec instantly joins the pantheon of great love-to-hate villains, a Machiavellian schemer who knows exactly when to turn on the endearing charm and when to plunge the dagger into your backside.\n\nMcLevy agreed with fellow critics' assertions that the show 'takes a while to get going', but wrote that 'once it does, it attains a kind of terminal velocity, as its protagonists and antagonists alike are swept up in a torrent of intrigue and office-politics gamesmanship.'\n\nThe first three episodes of The Morning Show will be released publicly on Friday, within the launch of Apple TV+.\n\nIf it impresses viewers, the show will give the $4.99-per-month streaming service a fighting chance at attracting subscribers away from established competitors like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon's Prime Video, as well as newcomers like WarnerMedia's HBO Max, NBCUniversal's Peacock and Disney's Disney+.", "description": "Critics described The Morning Show as 'muddled', 'floundering' and 'a well-polished snore' ahead of its Friday debut.
