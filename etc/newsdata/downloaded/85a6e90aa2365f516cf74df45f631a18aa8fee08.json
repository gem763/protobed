Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had requested additional support, Mr Esper said.\n\nThe attack on Saudi oil facilities knocked out 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. Both Saudi Arabia and the US blame Iran for the incident.\n\nMohammed bin Salman said: \"If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests.\"\n\nIran has denied allegations it was behind the attack.\n\nHowever the leaders of France, Germany and the UK said in a joint statement that there was no other plausible explanation for the attacks.", "description": "The US says they will help protect the kingdom after an attack on its oil facilities last month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/153FB/production/_107953078_055368213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
