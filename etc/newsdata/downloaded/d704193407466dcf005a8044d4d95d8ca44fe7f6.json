The Office: Cindy Adams\u2019s war room, where the gossip still lands. The walls and ceiling have been plastered over time with her front-page scoops. Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson\n\n\u201cI thought if it was good enough for Doris Duke, it\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d Cindy Adams says, striding through the foyer of the Park Avenue penthouse she purchased in 1997 \u2014 with her own money, she wants you to know \u2014 and today shares with her 17-year-old Yorkshire terrier, Juicy. \u201cThree and a half pounds of pure selfish,\u201d she calls her. (Translation: the most beloved thing in her life.)\n\nThey live in theatrical splendor, with the phone ringing off the hook as if it were the pre-texting era and people still knew that the best stories are whispered directly into an understanding ear. The apartment was once the home of billionaire tobacco heiress Doris Duke, who bought it in 1965 and hired Tony Duquette to decorate it. Adams left some of his most distinctive details \u2014 like the glossy black ceiling in the living room \u2014 in place even after she made the nine-room, 4,200-square-foot apartment her own. Today, it is an utterly personal monument to the triumph Cindy Adams has made of her life and what it took for her to get here.\n\nThe Living Room: Adams holding Juicy, her Yorkshire terrier. Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what she dropped,\u201d Adams says, pointing to the large crack in the travertine floor left over from Duke\u2019s tenure. It runs all the way to the living room, where light pours in through the floor-to-ceiling plateglass windows overlooking the terrace onto which she never goes (the better to preserve her astonishing complexion). They match the ones in the apartment next door, which Duke\u2019s neighbor, film producer Sam Spiegel, had put in. \u201cWe had to stop traffic on Park Avenue when those glass panes and some tables were craned in,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIt was illegal. Like I care.\u201d\n\nThe Living Room: The antiques, including a root chair and Ming pieces, were accumulated during the \u201960s, when Adams and her husband, comedian Joey Adams, did a tour of Southeast Asia. \u201cDid you see the solid silver ashtray that Roy Cohn gave Joey?\u201d Adams asks. \u201cHe had it inscribed in his own handwriting.\u201d Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson\n\nThe Living-Room Window: Adams knocked out all western-facing windows and walls in her living room and replaced them with floor-to-ceiling glass panes after visiting the apartment of her neighbor (which was previously owned by producer Sam Spiegel) and noticing he\u2019d done the same. Her wrap-around terrace, visible through the glass, sports sheep, mushrooms, and flowers among boxed greenery.

Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson\n\nShe moved into the place with her husband, the comedian Joey Adams, at a time when he was ailing and having difficulty navigating their previous \u201cmuch nicer\u201d apartment on Fifth Avenue. Adams is a New York girl, born in 1930, who grew up on the Upper West Side. She dropped out of high school over a requirement that she take a sewing class, she says, and was working as a photographer\u2019s model when she met Joey on a radio program (they married in 1952). He was her mother\u2019s age. \u201cI would have loved to have been a six-foot-tall blonde model and married a brainy man,\u201d Adams says. She was pretty and charismatic \u2014 a pageant queen, the onetime Miss Bagel \u2014 but six feet tall and blonde she was not.\n\nSmart and ambitious she was. Joey may not have had a Ph.D., but he was talented, popular, and funny, and, as she writes in her best-selling book The Gift of Jazzy \u2014 named for her first Yorkie \u2014 \u201cJoey loved me the way my mother did. Without reservation.\u201d Plus \u201cJoey had a lifestyle,\u201d she says. He dressed beautifully, loved to live large with his pals (who included Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope), squired her to the Stork Club, and lived in the Waldorf Towers. His connections were the door to her journalism career, as she started interviewing his friends and writing articles for TV Guide. Then there was the life-changing four-month trip to Southeast Asia, which President Kennedy proposed that Joey, president of the American Guild of Variety Artists, take to entertain the troops. One of the people she interviewed on the trip was Sukarno, the president of Indonesia, who liked what she wrote so much that he asked her to return to write what became her first book, Sukarno: An Autobiography As Told to Cindy Adams, published in 1963. From there, she incarnated her role as the confidante of dictators, presidents, First Ladies, First Mistresses, charlatans, and basically the entire cast of shady, glitzy, and powerful characters the world loves to hate. As a gossip columnist, she plays by her own rules, but, she insists, she doesn\u2019t judge; she just reports gossip.\n\nThe Bedroom: Ruching rules everywhere. The painstakingly brilliant fabric installation was done by the same Russian craftsman. The dog stairs that allowed the late Jazzy to climb up onto the bed remained for Juicy, who is now carried to and fro.

The Closet: The silk-upholstered walls and ceiling are kept immaculate; they look like they were installed yesterday. The chest on the right also is covered in silk with ruched edges.

They had become friends after Cindy and Joey made trips to Tehran in the \u201960s, including being guests at the shah\u2019s infamous three-day celebration of the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian empire at Persepolis in 1971. Adams\u2019s report of her hospital visit ended up being her first page-one exclusive story for the New York Post, with the byline \u201cThe Post\u2019s Own Cindy Adams.\u201d Since then, she has had some 500 front-page exclusives, many of which are now plastered on the walls and ceiling of her office, Duke\u2019s former boudoir, where her bathtub still resides, festooned with Duquette\u2019s silver lam\u00e9 wrapping and full of old papers and magazines. \u201cNobody put it up thinking it was going to be a tremendous wall,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIt actually happened like Scotch tape by Scotch tape.\u201d\n\nThe Office: Adams decided to use Doris Duke\u2019s former bathroom (which still has Duke\u2019s original bathtub, festooned with silver lam\u00e9 by Tony Duquette, who decorated the place in 1965) as her office space. Adams wanted to put the tub out on the terrace, but the fire department ruled that out \u2014 she now uses it as a receptacle for spare papers, magazines, and photographs.

Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson\n\nThe apartment today is ruled by Juicy, who is usually in the arms of Nazalene, Adams\u2019s housekeeper, who cooks for the dog and her mistress. Adams couldn\u2019t have a dog with Joey, as he\u2019d had a bad experience when he was young, but a week after his death, Jazzy landed in her lap, a gift from friends. \u201cThat\u2019s almost 20 years. I\u2019ve been dog crazy ever since,\u201d says Adams, who is making her annual preparations for the Blessing of the Animals at Christ Church on Park Avenue and 60th Street, held on December 8. She started the event 11 years ago because \u201cI just adore dogs, adore animals. It\u2019s a long story. I had a dog when I was a child, a black Scottie named Rufus, and the dog was run over by a car. I couldn\u2019t get over it for years.\u201d\n\nAfter joking (I think) to our photographer that she\u2019ll ruin him if she doesn\u2019t like his picture of her, Adams has to go. The phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing, and she has to get back to her office, surrounded by her front-page scoops.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
