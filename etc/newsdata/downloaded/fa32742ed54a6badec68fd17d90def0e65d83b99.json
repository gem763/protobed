(AP) - A business owner and musician who has made valuable contributions to the arts community and a group of volunteers who have donated hundreds of hours to caring for the George Aiken Wildflower Trail were honored by the Bennington Museum on Friday.\n\nGreg Van Houten, owner of GVH Studio in Bennington, received the Walloomsac Society Award, given annually since 1991 for \u201csignificant contributions to the community in the field of art, history, or education,\u201d and the 14 volunteer keepers of the wildflower trail received the General Stark Society Award, established in 1982 to recognize \u201coutstanding service to the museum.\u201d\n\nThe awards ceremony took place during the museum\u2019s fall social.\n\nWhen Van Houten learned that he would receive an award, \u201cI was flattered, but I don\u2019t get a lot of awards, and I don\u2019t go to a lot of award things, so I decided I should probably look it up, and really understand what it meant,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the names that I saw were Polly van der Linde and Mary Geannelis and some other people that mean a lot to me.\u201d\n\nHe recalled his introduction to the arts community in 1991, when, working on the second shift at a graphics company in North Adams, Massachusetts, he decided that he wanted to take piano lessons. \u201cI was a pretty bad guitar player, and my mother had always drilled into my head that piano is how you learn music,\u201d he said. That was how he met van der Linde, the director of the Sonatina Piano Camp in North Bennington.\n\n\u201cI spent an entire winter taking piano lessons, which basically made me a better guitar player and musician overall,\u201d Van Houten said.\n\nAbout a decade later, he met Alexina Jones, currently the museum\u2019s acting director for operations. \u201cI had started to perform out, and Alex gave me my first voice lesson ever. She taught me the basics of what I know about singing,\u201d he said.\n\nVan Houten dedicated his award to the memory of Geannelis, a community leader who died this spring.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, when I was running for select board, (state Sen.) Brian Campion was giving me some advice. One of the things he said is, \u2018You should really talk to my neighbor. She knows Bennington inside-out. She knows everybody.\u2019 So I went to meet Mary Geannelis. And she told me - everything,\u201d he said.\n\nConstance F. \u201cConsie\u201d West, chairwoman of the museum\u2019s board of trustees, thanked Van Houten for his \u201ctireless advocacy and service to the arts in this region.\u201d She highlighted his contributions to Bennington\u2019s civic life, including service on the Select Board and the board of the Better Bennington Corp., and as a force behind the new Bennington County cultural plan, \u201ca toolkit for all arts organizations in the area to try to continue to make this region as vibrant as it can be in collaboration with one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have so much going on here, and if we can just work together, we can be the best that we can be, and Greg knows that,\u201d West said.\n\nJackie Marro, who, with her husband, Tony, established the Aiken Wildflower Trail, accepted the General Stark Society Award on behalf of her fellow volunteers Ray Bolton, Jon Goodrich, Heather Hamilton, Liz Luca, Edd Lyon, Doug Mears, Don Miller, Jane Moriarty, Carolyn Plage, Mary Rogers, Don Trachte and West.\n\nWith the removal of some 200 diseased pine trees from the six-acre trail site next to the museum, \u201cthis past year has been a particularly important and critical year in the life of the trail,\u201d West said in introducing the group. \u201cThose of you who might have seen it in the winter (might have) thought it was a devastation, and wondered what was the museum thinking.\n\n\u201cThis spring and summer, over 400 hours have been spent on the trails, for the restoration and maintenance of the trails. These volunteers have been invaluable in getting the natural landscape in order, creating the pathways, continuing to clear the non-native and invasive species, and replanting and nurturing many hundreds of species to make up the sub-base,\u201d West said. \u201cIf you walk up there, it will be 100 times better than it was, it\u2019s going to grow and be beautiful.\u201d\n\nMarro presented a history of the trail, noting the contributions of George Hadwen, a publisher and developer who donated the land, and George Aiken, the former governor, U.S. senator, farmer and horticulturalist, who wrote the influential book \u201cPioneering with Wildflowers\u201d in 1935.\n\nShe noted the extensive work done by volunteers over the past 12 years, from the clearing of invasive plants when the trail was established 12 years ago to the addition of the benches, sculptures and signage that make the trail such an enjoyable and educational resource.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t walked it, it really is quite special,\u201d Marro said. \u201cI think you could say we have a lot to be thankful for.\u201d\n\nThough the volunteers are energetic and dedicated, they could always use more help, she told the audience. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done with your session, you can look out and see what you\u2019ve done - it\u2019s instant gratification. And it\u2019s fabulous exercise. I try to sell it as exercise with a purpose.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Osyaxf\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bennington Banner, http://www.benningtonbanner.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A business owner and musician who has made valuable contributions to the arts community and a group of volunteers who have donated hundreds of hours to caring for the George Aiken Wildflower Trail were honored by the Bennington Museum on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Lachance"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
