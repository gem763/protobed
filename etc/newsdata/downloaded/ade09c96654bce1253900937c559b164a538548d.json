EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So, we just completed a negotiation with China. We\u2019re doing very well. We\u2019re having another one tomorrow. I\u2019m meeting with the Vice Premier over at the White House. And I think it\u2019s going really well, I will say. I think it\u2019s going really well.\n\nSo, we had a very, very good negotiation with China. They\u2019ll be speaking a little bit later, but they\u2019re basically wrapping it up, and we\u2019re going to see them tomorrow, right here. And it\u2019s going very well.\n\nQ Mr. President, what about the story about former President \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, that he received $900,000 to himself, from Burisma Holdings? Do you think that\u2019s true?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What happened? Who took $900,000?\n\nQ There\u2019s a story out there that your personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said on \u201cSean Hannity\u201d last night that there is a possibility that Joe Biden took $900,000 out of \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I hope it\u2019s not true that \u2014 Joe Biden took $900,000? I haven\u2019t heard that. I hope it\u2019s not true. For the sake of the country, I hope that\u2019s not true. But I don\u2019t know anything about it.\n\nQ Do you know the whistleblower\u2019s name?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What?\n\nQ Do you know the whistleblower\u2019s name?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Who?\n\nQ Do you know the whistleblower\u2019s name?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know. But I know the whistleblower has been very inaccurate because when we released the transcript of the conversation that I had with the President of Ukraine, who \u2014 frankly, today, was very good; somewhere in Ukraine, I guess, gave a news conference on unrelated things \u2014 was asked a question, and he said, \u201cPresident Trump behaved in a perfectly fine manner. There was nothing wrong in any way, shape, or form.\u201d Something to that effect. So, I appreciate that.\n\nBut the President of Ukraine, that should be case over, because the President of Ukraine said that the call was absolutely fine. I think he said that it resembled very much \u2014 and he remembered it \u2014 it was just like the transcript.\n\nNow, the transcript is a perfect transcript. There shouldn\u2019t be any further questions. But the President of Ukraine just made that statement, so that\u2019s good.\n\nQ Mr. President, what conversations have you had with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know those gentlemen.\n\nQ You were in pictures with them.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Now, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody. I have a picture with everybody here. But somebody said there may be a picture or something where \u2014 at a fundraiser or somewhere. And so \u2014 but I have pictures with everybody.\n\nQ Have you talked with them?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody I don\u2019t have pictures with.\n\nI don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know about them, I don\u2019t know what they do. But, I don\u2019t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You\u2019d have to ask Rudy. I just don\u2019t know.\n\nQ Have you spoken with Rudy Giuliani today, sir? Have you spoken to him?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No.\n\nQ Mr. President, should the Senate allow a full trial if the House does impeach? The Republican (inaudible) Mitch McConnell said he would.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know how you can impeach on a conversation with the President of a country \u2014 in this case, Ukraine \u2014 which was a perfect conversation, where the President of Ukraine just said there was no pressure put on him whatsoever, that we had an absolutely perfect conversation. Then, on top of that, and maybe less importantly, frankly, but on top of that, we have a transcript of the conversation, fortunately, that\u2019s perfect.\n\nAnd I do think this: I think it\u2019s very unfair to heads of countries when they think every time they make a conversation or have a conversation with the President of the United States, it\u2019s going to be on, you know, all over the world. I think that\u2019s very unfair.\n\nBut, in the case \u2014 in the case of what we\u2019re talking about, we released a perfect conversation. The President of Ukraine just confirmed that. And that should be case over.\n\nI will say this: Adam Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation. To me, that\u2019s criminal. What he did is criminal.\n\nQ Mr. President, do you intend to block Ambassador Yovanovitch from testifying tomorrow?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re running country \u2014 I just don\u2019t think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you\u2019ve had. In this case, we have a transcript. And I\u2019ve given it almost immediately. It\u2019s called \u201ctransparency.\u201d Nobody has been more transparent than me. So, you have a transcript. And in this case, you also have the President of Ukraine confirming that, absolutely, it was a perfect conversation.\n\nBut the Democrats have committed crimes because they made up the conversation. The whistleblower was wrong. You know, I don\u2019t think people should be allowed. You have to run a country. I don\u2019t think you should be allowed to do that.\n\nQ Mr. President, have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat\u2019s \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Say it?\n\nQ Have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I can\u2019t hear.\n\nQ Have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\n\nQ Have you spoken with the U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Are you talking about in the UK?\n\nQ Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re in the process of being spoken to. We\u2019re working on that. I did have a conversation yesterday with Boris Johnson, a good one. And we\u2019re talking about diplomatic immunity. It\u2019s a very interesting situation. We are trying to work something out.\n\nQ Will you reconsider the decision?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So we\u2019re going to work \u2014 we\u2019re going to try and work something out. I think we\u2019ll be able to.\n\nQ Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President, sir, Secretary Perry was just subpoenaed by the House Intel Committee for documents related to the \u2014 to Ukraine, sir. Any response to that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: How many people can they talk to? We had a simple conversation. Everybody knows what the conversation was because I gave it immediately when I heard about it.\n\nThe whistleblower, who seems to be a Democrat that\u2019s involved with a lot of people, gave a false interpretation of the conversation because we have the conversation.\n\nThe President of Ukraine just said, just now, that the conversation was absolutely perfect. No problem. It was a very good conversation. So I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be calling Rick Perry. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be calling all these people. It\u2019s a very bad situation for our country.\n\nQ How do you know the whistleblower is a Democrat, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It was reported.\n\nQ Are you concerned that Rudy Giuliani could be indicted in all of this?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I hope not. Again, I don\u2019t know how he knows these people \u2014\n\nQ They\u2019re his clients.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What?\n\nQ They\u2019re his clients.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay, well, then, they\u2019re clients. I mean, you know, he\u2019s got a lot of clients. So, I just don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy about it. I don\u2019t know.\n\nI will say this: From what I heard \u2014 I just heard about this \u2014 they said, \u201cWe have nothing to do with it. We\u2019re totally \u2014 we have nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nQ Were you joking when you asked China to investigate the Bidens?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Was I what?\n\nQ Were you joking when you asked China to investigate?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: China has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t have to. Frankly, are far as I\u2019m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too. That\u2019s up to China.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Mr. President, thank you. Is it safe to say that Trey Gowdy is now your Chief Counsel and Rudy Giuliani is moving to the back?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there\u2019s a problem with he can\u2019t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations. So, you\u2019ll have to ask about that.\n\nI just heard Trey Gowdy can\u2019t start until sometime after January because of the lobbying rules and regulations. So, I don\u2019t know. So, we\u2019ll have to see.\n\nQ So Giuliani stays on?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I haven\u2019t spoken to him. I haven\u2019t spoken.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Which of the three choices on Syria that you just articulated in a tweet do you think you will follow?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Perhaps the last one, I hope. I hope the last one. Of the three, I hope it\u2019s going to be the last one.\n\nLook, we have no soldiers in Syria. We\u2019ve won. We\u2019ve beat ISIS. And we\u2019ve beat them badly and decisively. We have no soldiers.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is bring thousands and thousands of soldiers in and defeat everybody again. We\u2019ve already done that.\n\nSo what we have is really two choices: You have the choice of bringing in the military and defeating everybody again, or you have the choice of financially doing some very strong things to Turkey so that they take it a little bit easy on, really, competition that is \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being fairly treated in many ways, okay? We have a very good relationship with the Kurds. Or we can mediate. I hope we can mediate, John. I hope we can mediate.\n\nQ Has Turkey gone beyond the limits, in your opinion, so far?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Say it?\n\nQ Has Turkey gone beyond the limits you set up so far?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Turkey knows where I stand. And the last thing \u2014 okay, very simple: We had a big victory. We left the area. I don\u2019t think the American people want to see us go back in with our military, go back into that area again.\n\nWe won. We left the area. I don\u2019t think we want to go back in. Let\u2019s see what happens. We are going to possibly do something very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things.\n\nQ Mr. President, on Minnesota \u2014 you\u2019re headed to Minnesota. Do you think you can win in Minnesota? It\u2019s a long-time blue state.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think we can win. It\u2019s been a long time since a Republican won. We have a 20,000-seat auditorium. You know, we have the \u2014 it\u2019s essentially Madison Square Garden. And it\u2019s sold out. Over 80,000 people requested tickets. It\u2019ll be totally sold out. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going, but it\u2019ll be totally sold out. If you\u2019re not going to be there, I\u2019m going to miss you. But they have a line now that\u2019s many blocks long. It\u2019s amazing. We have a line, right now in Minnesota, that\u2019s many blocks long. I think I can win in Minnesota.\n\nQ Do you think Ilhan Omar is helping you win in Minnesota?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think Omar is helping us win in Minnesota and other places. I\u2019ll see you all \u2014 I\u2019ll see you in Minnesota. I\u2019ll see you in Minnesota.\n\nEND\n\n4:43 P.M.
