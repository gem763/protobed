The risk is that the polls that put him well ahead prove unreliable -- as they have done in the past -- and that voters opt instead for the opposition Labour Party\u2019s offer of a softer Brexit, confirmed by a second referendum. That could put the entire Brexit project in jeopardy.\n\nPremier\u2019s Options\n\nOne risk that has receded is that of a no-deal Brexit, as Johnson is now committed to a deal, and the EU seems likely to allow the time to either pass the deal or have an election. \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal, to which this House has just given its assent,\u201d the prime minister told Parliament.\n\nJohnson isn\u2019t certain to go for an election. He threatened one earlier Tuesday if Parliament didn\u2019t agree to rush his Brexit bill through, and later in the evening an official repeated the threat. But Johnson has gone back on such promises before. He said last month he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than apply for a Brexit extension, and unidentified officials in his office had briefed journalists there were ways around the law that required him to do so. On Saturday evening, he requested an extension.\n\nNor is it certain Parliament would agree to give him one. He was twice refused last month. But people familiar with Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s thinking said he\u2019d support one if Brexit was put off until Jan. 31, removing the risk of an accidental no-deal split.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland suggested he wanted Parliament to come up with an alternative timetable to break the impasse, rather than hold an election. He told the BBC on Wednesday an election may not be necessary if MPs can work together to find a way to \u201ccrack on.\u201d\n\nBreakneck Pace\n\nTuesday afternoon began with Johnson\u2019s election threat, directed at members of Parliament who wanted more time to scrutinize his Brexit legislation.\n\nAs the afternoon went on, it looked like it might be working. The first vote of the evening saw Parliament back Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal in principle, and not by a narrow margin, but convincingly, 329 votes to 299. That was the first time Parliament had approved any Brexit deal, and it suggested there is a way to get the deal through.\n\nBut Johnson didn\u2019t just want to pass his deal, he wanted to push it through at a breakneck pace before the current Oct. 31 deadline. That meant getting the House of Commons to agree to pass it through all its stages in just three days.\n\nJohnson\u2019s opponents argued that they needed more time, and voted 322 to 308 against his proposed timetable. That defeat made it certain the prime minister would need to delay Brexit, something he\u2019s promised repeatedly not to do.\n\nLabour\u2019s Corbyn offered to work with Johnson to come up with a better timetable to help Parliament improve the deal.\n\nJohnson himself seemed more emollient than earlier, not raising his election threat again. \u201cLet me be clear: our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on Oct. 31 and that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the House,\u201d he told the House of Commons.\n\nTusk then responded by saying he\u2019d recommend the EU accept the U.K.\u2019s request for an extension. While he didn\u2019t set a date, his suggestion that this could be agreed by letter, and without a summit, pointed to accepting the British Parliament\u2019s request of a new exit date of Jan. 31. It\u2019s possible the EU will offer to allow an earlier exit if Johnson can get his deal passed in the next month, something that seems plausible after the first vote of the evening. That might persuade Johnson to get his deal passed before going for an election.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Boris Johnson looked set to try for an election after Parliament blocked his plan to rush his Brexit deal into U.K. law.A day of threats and promises from Johnson ended with an official in his office warning", "authors": ["Robert Hutton", "Tim Ross", "Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8sLGTpciovsMcRQTWAh70g--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/99253edbad5d37aa15ec8ddf2f084449", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
