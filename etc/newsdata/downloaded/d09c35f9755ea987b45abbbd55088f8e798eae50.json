Commission president, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, confirmed the detail Thursday morning on Twitter.\n\nJohnson has staked his leadership on a promise to leave the E.U. on the current Oct. 31 deadline with or without a deal.\n\nBut rebel lawmakers passed a law forcing him to seek an extension if a deal had not been agreed by next Saturday, in an effort to prevent a \"no-deal Brexit\" that could have devastating consequences for the country.\n\nIf he is to keep his promise Johnson must now secure the support of the House of Commons, which his ruling Conservative Party controls despite having a minority of lawmakers.\n\nThe prime minister will likely need convince some of his opponents that his Brexit plan is better than the alternatives: Keep delaying the process, risk crashing out of the union without a deal at all, or cancel Brexit altogether.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nThe government may hold a vote on the deal this Saturday, when it has proposed holding a rare parliamentary session, the first on a weekend since 1982.\n\nJohnson has been dealt a series of defeats in Parliament and saw his efforts to shut it down in order to force through his hardline Brexit plans ruled unlawful by the U.K's Supreme Court.\n\nHis predecessor Theresa May failed on three occasions to win support for a deal she had agreed with the E.U., leading her to resign earlier this year.", "description": "The deal must still be agreed to by European leaders and lawmakers in the British Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4239762/1000x563_nbc-191015-brexit-mn-1225_72226125f4a30281fc065c59974218ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
