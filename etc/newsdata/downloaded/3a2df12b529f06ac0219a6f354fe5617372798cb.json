One block on Burnham Street boasts a whole row of them, modest homes that are examples of the architect\u2019s stab at affordable housing. These six houses were essentially built as model-home showpieces. The one at 2714 Burnham is fully restored; tours are on the half-hour, starting at 12:30 p.m., on Saturdays in the fall (adult admission: $15). Another is actually available as a rental. For something more elaborate, check out Wright\u2019s Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church in nearby Wauwatosa, a circular spiritual spaceship whose large, blue dome mirrors the sky above when the weather cooperates. (To see the interior, your best bet is to visit on Sunday during services.)\n\n7) 4:30 p.m. Drink Wisconsinbly\n\nFiserv Forum, the undulating new home of the recently ascendant Milwaukee Bucks, will serve as home base for the Democratic convention. Within a stone\u2019s throw away are two very different drinking options. Right across the plaza, in the newly coined \u201cDeer District,\u201d is the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub. The bar grew out of a popular T-shirt slogan that has become the state\u2019s cheeky unofficial motto. It\u2019s a goofy, fun-loving joint. There\u2019s a lot for sale, including T-shirts, hats and glassware. Brandy old-fashioneds are dispensed from a bubbler (Wisconsinese for drinking fountain), and the men\u2019s room is adorned with photos of famous Wisconsinites, including Willem Dafoe, Orson Welles and, er, Kato Kaelin, an actor who was a witness in the O.J. Simpson murder trial.\n\n8) 5:30 p.m. Homage to local history\n\nA few yards south \u2014 on Vel R. Phillips Avenue, which was renamed in 2018 after the Wisconsin politician and civil rights activist \u2014 is the much older Turner Hall. It was built in 1882 by the Turners, a progressive German athletic, cultural and political association. All three of Milwaukee\u2019s Socialist mayors were Turners. (\u201cA sound mind in a sound body\u201d was the group\u2019s motto.) The grandly dishabille upstairs ballroom may have inspired the still-remembered 1891 pop hit \u201cAfter the Ball.\u201d The building still performs its original function, but has recently been given contemporary relevance by some snazzy new signage and the arrival of Tavern at Turner Hall, where, if you\u2019re looking for a filling snack, you can order the Milwaukee Mac, a mash up of bratwurst and macaroni and cheese. Be sure to inspect the bar\u2019s 19th-century murals depicting moments in Turner and Milwaukee history.", "description": "Welcome to this small town in big-city clothing, where bobbleheads, ice-cream cocktails and Frank Lloyd Wright are on your weekend itinerary.", "authors": ["Robert Simonson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/travel/10Hours-Milwaukee1/10Hours-Milwaukee1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
