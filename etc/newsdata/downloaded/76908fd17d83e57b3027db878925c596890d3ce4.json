Ricky Gammon; Anthony Holehouse; Callum Northridge; and Daniel Bailey - were told on September 24 they were in the clear.\n\nAna Isabel Garcia-Galbis ruled there was 'no evidence' pointing to their involvement in 27-year-old Kirsty Maxwell's death and announced she was provisionally shelving her near two-and-a-half-year homicide investigation.\n\nFive Britons staying in the apartment where Mrs Maxwell fell - including Joseph Graham (left) and Ricky Gammon (right) - were placed under investigation for murder, but the probe has been dropped and a judge ruled there was 'no evidence' her death was a homicide\n\nIt is thought Kirsty entered the men's apartment by accident around 8am on April 29 while looking for a friend who was staying on the same floor, moments before falling to her death\n\nMr Graham and his holiday friends were the last people to see Kirsty alive after she walked into their tenth-floor room at Apartamentos Payma in Benidorm's Little England area just before 8am on April 29 2017.\n\nShe plunged to her death moments later in circumstances her family described as 'sinister and suspicious'.\n\nThe five men, who are all from the Nottingham area, were placed under formal investigation on suspicion of Kirsty's homicide, although Mr Graham was the only one of the five Brits who were arrested and they were all allowed to return to the UK after being questioned as part of the long-running court probe.\n\nThe dramatic decision to stay the investigation and lift the threat of trial hanging over the five British men was taken following a long campaign by Kirsty's family to 'get justice' over her death after her grieving husband Adam Maxwell insisted early on 'something dark' had happened in apartment 10E.\n\nJudge Ana Isabel Garcia-Galbis insisted in her ruling: 'There is no evidence of the participation of the men investigated in the death of the victim.'\n\nHighlighting the fact tests had shown Kirsty was 'seriously affected' by the alcohol she had drunk the night before her death during a hen night out with friends and could have caused her problems including 'blurred vision, loss of balance and emotional instability'.\n\nOne of the men pictured (left) arriving at court in July 2017 and (right) heating engineer Callum Northridge, who was also questioned by Spanish police\n\nShe added: 'Conclusions different to those of the police at the time about the accidental dynamic of the death have not been able to be reached.'\n\nThe former suspects' lawyer said after the decision his clients were looking forward to getting on with the rest of their lives after nearly 'three years of pain and uncertainty'.\n\nHe said: 'My clients were investigated on suspicion of a crime of homicide which in Spain carries a prison sentence of 10 to 15 years.\n\n'They have said from day one they didn't have anything to do with Kirsty's death and their reaction has corroborated that.\n\n'They didn't try to escape from the apartments where she died, they cooperated from the very first moment and when Joseph Graham's friends were placed under investigation they returned to Spain voluntarily to be questioned in court.\n\nThe apartment block where Kirsty Maxwell died in April 2017 after falling from a balcony\n\n'They have had a bad time of it over these last nearly two-and-a-half years but their conscience has always been clear.\n\n'This decision enables them to get on with their lives, although they know this decision can be appealed and my personal opinion is that it will be appealed.'\n\nKirsty's parents branded the Spanish judge's decision to provisionally shelve the court probe as 'farcical', saying it left them angry and physically sick.\n\nRetired CID detective David Swindle, who has been helping the dead woman's family, said Kirsty and her loved ones appeared to have been 'let down by apparently irretrievable shortcomings in Spanish police, forensic and crime investigation procedures.'\n\nHe added: 'Spanish police did not manage the crime scene, significant witnesses, exhibits and evidence as would be expected for such a tragic loss of a young life in unexplained, confusing circumstances.'", "description": "Brian and Denise Curry asked a judge to overturn a decision to drop a murder probe into five British men who were staying in the Benidorm room where their daughter Kirsty Maxwell fell.", "authors": ["Gerard Couzens In Spain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20030556-0-image-a-32_1571740423653.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
