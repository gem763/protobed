Then on the intercom they asked if anybody had plastic food wrap.'\n\nLater, a blazing row between two 'drunk' passengers on the no- alcohol flight from Moscow led to them being forcibly separated (Pictured)\n\nTrouble on the flight began several hours after takeoff from Moscow to Thai island Phuket\n\nAfter the cling film was located, it was used to subdue the 'drunk and rowdy' passenger after attempts by a doctor to calm him failed.\n\nDemidova said: 'Suddenly the sign \"fasten your seat belts\" began to flash. Why? Minutes later the captain explained a passenger in the rear of the plane was drunk and rowdy.\n\n'A doctor tried to calm him. Then tougher measures were taken. They tried to use plastic food wrap to tie him. Seven people were holding him, but nothing helped.'\n\nRussian Transport Police confirmed the 'air hooligan' was handed to Uzbek police in Tashkent.\n\nHe had 'abused the stewardesses and made the flight really uncomfortable for other passengers', said Elena Markovskaya, an official with the Moscow Multi-Regional Transport Investigative Department, reported Rosbalt.\n\nAfter a four hour delay in Tashkent, the flight continued.\n\nA video shows part of the second incident - a row between two allegedly drunk passengers who were eventually separated by the crew.\n\nThen in another video, Demidova said: 'This man was smoking in the plane's toilet.\n\n'The stewardesses are sorting it out right now. He was taken away from the plane by Thai police.'", "description": "The seven crew members and tourists pinned down and restrained the Russian 'wild hooligan' in a gangway before the plane was able to make an emergency landing in\u00a0Uzbekistan.", "authors": ["Will Stewart For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/09/19915194-0-image-a-16_1571473923100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
