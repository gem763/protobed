But it stops short of the far more expensive proposals from Biden's progressive rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBiden calls for the federal government to cover 75 percent of the cost of community college tuition, with states covering the rest. Sanders and Warren want universal free public college.\n\nBiden proposes doubling the Pell Grant program and cutting in half the income percentage caps on student loan repayments.\n\nSanders proposes eliminating all student loan debt, while Warren proposes scrapping it for most debtors.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
