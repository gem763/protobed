REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nBritain is the first G7 country to commit to a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target for 2050.\n\n\u201cFrom driving our cars, to catching a train or taking a flight abroad, it is crucial that we ensure transport is as environmentally friendly as possible,\u201d said transport secretary Grant Schapps.\n\nDue to be complete next year, the plan will set out in detail what government, business and society must do to deliver the significant emissions reductions needed from all forms of transport.\n\nIt will also consider how technology can encourage changes to the way people and goods move across the country, the government said.\n\nClimate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, defied a police order to end protests on Tuesday after a week of disruption in London targeting Britain\u2019s transport ministry.\n\nAmong other things, the activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands.\n\nThe transport ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving.\n\nThe government also introduced an environment bill in parliament on Tuesday to help create legally binding targets to protect the environment and reduce pollution.\n\nThe bill will also establish an office for environment protection which will hold the government to account on its progress towards the 2050 net zero emissions target.\n\nExperts say the net zero target will require sweeping changes across the energy, transport, heating and buildings sectors.\n\nBritain\u2019s business secretary Andrea Leadsom told a parliamentary committee the government would produce a long-awaited energy white paper in the first quarter of next year.\n\nThat is expected to outline the government\u2019s ambitions for the future of the country\u2019s energy system.\n\n\u201cI am very ambitious about our decarbonisation ambitions and the need to set targets and milestones to enable business to get on with it with a very clear steer from government,\u201d Leadsom said.", "description": "Britain said on Tuesday it would complete a plan next year to achieve net zero emissions from all forms of transport, as climate change activists targeted the transport ministry.", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441160076&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1F1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
