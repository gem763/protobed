The move came after car companies had pressed for years for more flexibility on the existing rules, which were agreed to in 2012 and call for increases in fuel economy annually through mid-decade to an average of about 50 miles a gallon.\n\nCar-industry executives have argued the current fuel-economy requirements are too strict and don\u2019t take into account the shift in consumer preference to larger, less-fuel-efficient trucks and sport-utility vehicles. When President Trump came into office, they raised the issue in a White House meeting the week after his inauguration.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Which proposed emissions standards should auto makers follow, the Trump administration\u2019s or California? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nBut the rollback being pushed by the administration is so extensive that car companies are worried it will set off a protracted legal battle with California\u2014the nation\u2019s most populous state and the biggest auto market\u2014and ultimately conclude with manufacturers having to meet two different sets of requirements for selling cars in the U.S. Auto makers have warned the continuing tussle could hamper planning.\n\nIn tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump defended his plan, saying it would cut the average price of a car by $3,000 and have little impact on the environment. He also criticized Ford Motor Co. for a side deal the auto maker struck last month with California regulators to meet new fuel-economy standards that are tougher than his administration\u2019s proposal, but less stringent than the Obama-era ones.\n\nFour car makers, including Ford Motor, struck a side deal with California this summer to meet new emissions standards that are tougher than the Trump administration\u2019s proposal.

Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co. and BMW AG joined Ford on the California agreement.\n\nIn a statement responding to the tweets, Ford said: \u201cWe have consistently supported one 50-state solution for regulating fuel economy standards, and this agreement with California provides regulatory stability while reducing CO2 more than complying with two different standards.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for California Gov. Gavin Newsom didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe four car companies reasoned that even if the White House prevails in freezing the targets, they could still be stuck with paying the added cost of building cars to meet California\u2019s stricter standards, say people familiar with their thinking. California has sued the Trump administration, trying to block its efforts. A legal battle could take years to resolve, prolonging uncertainty about the rules.\n\nBut other auto makers have been reluctant to join the California pact, preferring instead to wait for a final rule, which is expected to be made public later this year. Some foreign-based car manufacturers are also worried a public stance against the rollback would only embolden Mr. Trump to carry out his threat to impose tariffs on imported cars, according to a person close to the fuel-economy discussions.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. , meanwhile, doesn\u2019t think the California proposal gives enough credit for sales of fully electric vehicles, an area where it is investing heavily, people familiar with GM\u2019s thinking say. The Detroit auto maker is pushing for rules to require car companies to sell battery-powered cars across all 50 states.\n\nSuch a divergence is unusual for the auto industry, which has been mostly aligned on fuel economy in the past, say industry executives, former regulators and analysts.\n\n\u201cWe tend to think of the industry as monolithic,\u201d said Brett Smith, a director at the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research. \u201cBut it is increasingly very different companies with very different goals.\u201d\n\nHonda Motor, Ford, BMW and VW had hoped for a truce between the administration and California on fuel-economy standards.

It also wants to revoke California\u2019s federal waiver to set its own emissions standards.\n\nCalifornia has already filed a lawsuit to prevent the White House from moving forward with its efforts and threatened more legal action if the existing rules are changed.\n\nA U.S. Transportation Department spokesman said any car company that wants to exceed the proposed standards is free to do so if it can find enough buyers. \u201cBut California does not have the legal authority to, and should not, push the U.S. auto market to electric cars to serve its own political agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Newsom said in an earlier email that California\u2019s agenda is to clean up the air, fight climate change and protect the health of children.\n\nThe rift has left auto makers in the middle but with differing agendas. Some car companies have already made large investments in electric vehicles, putting them in a better position to comply with the existing standards, while others are more dependent on trucks and SUVs for the bulk of their sales, making those targets harder to reach.\n\n\u201cNo two car companies are totally aligned,\u201d said Mandy Gunasekara, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who had worked on the proposed rollback and left the administration this year.\n\nFord, Honda, BMW and VW had hoped for a truce between the administration and California. This spring, the companies and 13 other auto makers signed a letter urging Mr. Trump to personally find a compromise with California.\n\nThat letter was \u201csummarily dismissed\u201d by the administration, said an executive for one auto maker. The four car companies\u2014representing about 30% of all U.S. vehicle sales\u2014then forged their own agreement with California, working behind the scenes for more than a month and willing to risk political backlash from the White House, say people involved with the effort.\n\nThe voluntary pact with California was signed in July.\n\n\u201cIn this case, deregulation doesn\u2019t produce lower costs. It produces higher costs,\u201d this executive said.\n\nSince then, no other car company has publicly revealed plans to join the California deal.\n\nAuto makers, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Kia Motors Corp. , say they want one set of federal standards on fuel economy but declined to comment further.\n\nGM has proposed its own plan to revise the Obama-era regulations, backing a proposal to increase fuel economy by about 1% annually through mid-decade, short of the 3.7% under the California agreement. The largest U.S. auto maker by sales is also pushing for federal rules requiring car companies to sell a minimum number of electric vehicles across all 50 states.\n\nMark Reuss, GM\u2019s president, said last fall a federal program for requiring electric cars would foster a market for these vehicles and help manufacturers better plan for the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making bets now on a lot of uncertainty, which is highly destructive to capital,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Tim Puko\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com and Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com", "description": "Major car makers are caught in the crossfire between the Trump administration and California over U.S. tailpipe-emissions rules, leading them down different paths in how to respond to the standoff.", "authors": ["Ben Foldy", "Mike Colias", "Ben.Foldy Wsj.Com", "Mike.Colias Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-99935/social", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
