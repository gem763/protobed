Silvestri described the Massachusetts case as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office has filed a baseless complaint three years after announcing its politically motivated investigation, during which they have not interviewed a single ExxonMobil employee or gathered one piece of evidence from the company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to refuting the meritless allegations in court.\u201d\n\nThe complaint capped a week that saw Democrats and climate activists move to recharge the dormant \u201cExxon knew\u201d campaign, alleging that the company disregarded its own global-warming research, which Exxon denies.\n\nA team of academics, including Harvard professor and longtime Exxon foe Naomi Orekes, released a report Monday accusing the company of weaving a \u201cweb of denial\u201d about climate change, comparing it to the tobacco industry\u2019s deceiving consumers about the dangers of smoking.\n\nThe same day, The New York Times ran an op-ed from Rockefeller Family Fund director Lew Wasserman charging Exxon and other oil-and-gas companies with \u201cdrilling away\u201d even though they know \u201cthe planet is headed toward a climate catastrophe.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that his philanthropy is financing legal advocacy groups bringing two other lawsuits against Exxon. Rockefeller foundations have been instrumental in funding \u201cExxon knew\u201d advocacy and journalism.\n\nProtesters gathered Tuesday outside a New York courtroom for the start of a trial pitting the New York attorney general against Exxon, while House Democrats took aim at the company at a subcommittee hearing Wednesday that also featured Ms. Oreskes.\n\nExxon and its defenders argue that the company\u2019s research on climate change was both widely published and in step with the findings of other studies from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Massachusetts lawsuit, filed in Suffolk Superior Court, seeks $5,000 in penalties for each violation of the state\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, with each \u201cmaterially false, deceptive, or misleading statement to a Massachusetts consumer\u201d in connection with the sale of the company\u2019s products would constitute a separate violation.\n\n\u201cWe are suing to stop this illegal deception and penalize the company for its misconduct,\u201d Ms. Healey said.\n\nThis lawsuit is the first of its kind.\n\n\n\nWe know this case won\u2019t be easy, but Massachusetts consumers and investors deserve the truth. Exxon can\u2019t hide from its deception any longer. pic.twitter.com/ukMGyi8r3y \u2014 Maura Healey (@MassAGO) October 24, 2019\n\n\n\nIn honor of the kickoff of NYAG\u2019s lawsuit against ExxonMobil, we\u2019re busting myths and fronting facts.
