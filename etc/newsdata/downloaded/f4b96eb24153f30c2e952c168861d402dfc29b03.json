David Rowe\n\nCain was never going to replicate that, even with Little Shop 2 being rolled out for the September quarter of this year (yes, the little terrors at my place won that battle too, and we completed the set).\n\nBut sales growth of 0.1 per cent for the September quarter of 2019 is very respectable indeed, given analysts had tipped like-for-like sales could fall by as much as 1.5 per cent.\n\nIt also helped keep Coles\u2019 record of 48 consecutive quarters of sales growth intact.", "description": "How home brand pasta sauce helped Coles maintain its record of 48 consecutive quarters of sales growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5954%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_154/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1e965a1a377505b5d75922f197095b37bebc3aa1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
