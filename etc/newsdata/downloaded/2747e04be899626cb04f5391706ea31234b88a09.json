It called for redrafting by the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus said Labor and Liberal members of the committee had united to call for a complete redrafting before the bill came back tot he committee.\n\n\"In taking this step, I congratulate all members of the committee for putting the national interest first and sending a strong message about the value of this committee,\" he said.\n\n\"If there is no intention for the proposed identity-matching services to be used to engage in mass surveillance activities, the government should no object to amending the bill to ensure that those services cannot, as a matter of law, be used in that manner.\"\n\nThe draft laws required a statutory review of the plan in five years.\n\nThe proposed laws for identity matching were agreed in a meeting of all Australian state and territory leaders with then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in October 2017.\n\nThe Coalition first introduced the legislation to Parliament in February 2018, but the bill lapsed at the May election.", "description": "An influential parliamentary committee has called for a rewrite of facial recognition laws, telling the Morrison government to add safeguards against abuse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1952%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/43d623f2e0bbc7b990b5e8d2db43af29888bd07f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
