They appear to memorialize two conversations: one on Jan. 23, when Giuliani spoke by phone with the former general prosecutor of Ukraine, Viktor Shokin; the other is from two days later, when Shokin\u2019s successor, then-General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, met Giuliani in New York.\n\nIn addition to the fired Shokin\u2019s claim that President Poroshenko warned him not to investigate Burisma because it was not in the Bidens\u2019 interest, the notes say, the prosecutor also said he \u201cwas warned to stop\u201d by the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt.\n\nThe State Department declined to explain this assertion about Pyatt, who was ambassador to Ukraine from 2013 to 2016 and now is Ambassador to Greece. The Biden presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRecounting Shokin\u2019s version of events, the notes say he \u201cwas called into Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office and told that the investigation into Burisma and the Managing Director where Hunter Biden is on the board, has caused Joe Biden to hold up one billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine.\u201d Poroshenko later told Shokin that \u201che had to be fired as the aid to the Ukraine was being withheld by Joe Biden,\u201d the Giuliani interview notes say.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eric Felten", "Realclearinvestigations.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
