Senselessness, that prized quality of a lunatic sport, hadn\u2019t gotten much of a go early on this season. Some of us missed our senselessness. But senselessness has gushed back the past two Saturdays, in a South Carolina upset at Georgia that made no sense, then an Illinois upset of Wisconsin that made less than no sense.\n\nQuestion to Wisconsin Coach Paul Chryst, his face drained of even the limited joy it sometimes evinces: \u201cWas there any indication [in preparation] something was off?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChryst, eloquently: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWisconsin, nothing if not ironclad and earnest, appeared in Champaign \u2014 as leaky and cocky. It lost to an Illinois team many believed had disbanded operations and disappeared, with a 4-26 Big Ten record during Coach Lovie Smith\u2019s tenure, and with two of those wins coming at Rutgers and at Rutgers. It ensured that after Wisconsin destroyed Michigan, after Michigan had gone to Illinois and won, 42-25, Wisconsin had gone to Illinois, lost, 24-23, and approached its trip Saturday to Ohio State looking like prey.\n\nMaybe such slights will help Wisconsin in a way being a 30\u00bd -point favorite could not.\n\nWhere it had allowed four touchdowns all season, none relevant to outcomes, it allowed three to Illinois on plays of 29 yards or more, all relevant to the outcome. It missed a 37-yard field goal late in the third quarter. It couldn\u2019t score a touchdown from first down at the 3-yard line with 10 minutes left. Its great running back, Jonathan Taylor, lunged for further yardage with 7:12 left, while linebacker Jake Hansen\u2019s hand looped over Taylor\u2019s shoulder and down near the ball, shoving it loose. Its first-year starting quarterback, Jack Coan, with one interception all season, managed to match that total on one leaping play by cornerback Tony Adams with 2:32 left. Losing on the road is common; losing on the road before 37,363 in a 60,670-seater less common.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd as senselessness always confers its magic, consider that Illinois kicker James McCourt apparently blacked out in the aftermath of his game-winning, 39-yard field goal as time expired. Realize you could travel far and wide and farther and not hear an athlete describe an athletic experience so vividly.\n\nHere\u2019s McCourt, as recorded by Matthew Stevens of Sports Illustrated: \u201cSo I made the kick and saw [tight end] Griffin Palmer and gave him a big hug and our helmets got stuck together and I fell. There must have been 10 or so bodies to stack vertically on top of me and all I can remember seeing is darkness.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s McCourt, as recorded by Shannon Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, describing his ensuing trip upward and onto his teammates\u2019 shoulders: \u201cI thought I woke up from a dream.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDamn, that college football.\n\nAD\n\nYou look up, and here\u2019s Oregon again. It\u2019s an Oregon that plays stout defense, No. 7 in the land in yards allowed per play, and everyone knows that\u2019s just senseless. It\u2019s an Oregon at 6-1 and just one late 26-yard Auburn heroic from 7-0. It\u2019s an Oregon that gives the vanished Pac-12 Conference a plausible chance, so we must monitor these upcoming Oregon games: Washington State at home next weekend, at Southern California, Arizona at home, at Arizona State, Oregon State at home.\n\nIt\u2019s an Oregon that lost to Washington by a combined 108-24 in 2016 and 2017, yet surmounted deficits of 28-14 early in the third quarter and 31-21 late in the third quarter, as future NFL employee Justin Herbert directed drives covering 75 and 70 yards \u2014 in Seattle \u2014 to lead the Ducks to a 35-31 win.\n\nAD\n\nHere, after years of muddled LSU offense that might have inspired further fan drinking, comes pyrotechnic LSU offense that might inspire further fan drinking. The 36-13 win at Mississippi State proved wildly impressive after the loud win over Florida. Now comes Auburn. Then comes the annual pre-Alabama off week. Then comes Alabama.\n\nAD\n\nIt will be an Alabama perhaps still monitoring quarterback Tagovailoa\u2019s high ankle sprain, suffered Saturday night in the 35-13 win over Tennessee. That will be some spotlighted monitoring, because the last quarterback to rescue Alabama from a Tagovailoa ankle injury, Jalen Hurts, cannot help Alabama because he plays nowadays at Oklahoma, where he ranks No. 1 nationally in passer rating.\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow, who transferred from Ohio State, ranks No. 2.\n\nAD\n\nTagovailoa ranks No. 3.\n\nJustin Fields, who transferred from Georgia to Ohio State, ranks No. 4.\n\nEven the passer ratings are a psychodrama.\n\nTennessee vs. Alabama somehow became one as well, when Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano tried a sneak on fourth and one at the goal line in the fourth quarter with the score 28-13, and Guarantano fumbled, and Alabama\u2019s Trevon Diggs returned it 100 yards for a touchdown, and Tennessee Coach Jeremy Pruitt excoriated Guarantano with a quick yank at Guarantano\u2019s face mask. Such behavior could be wrong, or it could be just football \u2014 there\u2019s an argument underway \u2014 but what\u2019s not arguable is that good coaches don\u2019t require such acts of insecurity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe move forward with the hope of further senselessness with Penn State something of a factor. It stands 7-0 after its 28-21 win over Michigan, reestablishing itself after a dip from 11-3 (2016) to 11-2 (2017) to 9-4 (2018), a dip both mild to all and unforgivable to some. Asked to describe these Lions, first-year starting quarterback Sean Clifford said, \u201cFast, physical and just a team that really will do anything for a win.\u201d Surely any guy who can withstand St. Ignatius in an Ohio high school state title game (2015) has got some mustard to him.\n\nSurely any guy or woman who would wager on Brigham Young has got some derring-do to him. The Cougars (3-4) have epitomized senselessness, and bravo to that. They have traveled thrice to the Eastern time zone. They have won at Tennessee and at home against Southern California. They have lost at Toledo, which is surely no sin among football intellectuals, but they have lost at South Florida, which might just be.\n\nThen on Saturday night, in cold, rainy, windy weather one might label biblical if one were into that sort of thing, Brigham Young brought out a fresh starting quarterback who just got the nod Wednesday night, Baylor Romney, and gambled (uh oh) successfully on a late fourth and one with a Romney sneak, and gave then-No. 14 Boise State a 28-25 plucking from the list of the unbeaten.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were more aggressive this game even though we had some weird weather,\u201d wide receiver Matt Bushman told reporters in Provo, Utah, even adding: \u201cWe were just as confident as we could be. We believed.\u201d\n\nSuch belief might have made limited sense, but these guys play a sport in which a kicker might drill a field goal to provide a victory of a senseless beauty, black out in the celebration and wake as if from a dream.\n\nAD", "description": "A South Carolina upset at Georgia made no sense, then an Illinois upset of Wisconsin made less than no sense.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xa0USYFB1fiCe2R8h66cLi9ejxg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OEGBAIXTOYI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
