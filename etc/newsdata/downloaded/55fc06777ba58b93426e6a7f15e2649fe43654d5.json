Do you still make time to sit down at the dinner table? While this idea may seem idealistic in modern times, our nutritional experts tell us how family mealtimes can impact our lives in a positive way.\n\nNowadays, we spend most of our time commuting, working, shopping and going to gym. This leaves little time for cooking and eating healthy meals together as a family.\n\nEven our children have busy schedules, and it is so easy coming home at night to opt for the easy way out \u2013 doing fast and easy foods such as pasta and sauce, and letting everyone grab and eat at their own time, usually in front of the TV.\n\nFor this very reason it's important to get organised and start enjoying healthy meals together as a family. Research has highlighted unexpected advantages, which can be divided into nutritional, emotional, social, and educational benefits.\n\nIt is important to schedule a specific time and arrange activities to allow for meals to be eaten together. This might mean that dad has to get home earlier, perhaps doing some work later in the evening. Family meals are the glue that holds a busy family together. They should be enjoyed without distractions like TV/LED screens or even toys.\n\nEmotional and social benefits\n\nEating together provides time to get connected. It helps children feel loved, safe and secure.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that more frequent meals with the family are associated with better psychological wellbeing, a lower risk of substance use, delinquency, and greater academic achievement.\n\nConversation at the dinner table allows the family to discuss the day\u2019s events, to share feelings, opinions and to learn more about each other and what is happening in their lives.\n\nThe educational benefits\n\nIt is a perfect time for parents to be role models \u2013 not only for learning table manners, or trying new foods, but also to impart healthier eating habits.\n\nSharing food is important as children are more likely to eat foods their parents or older siblings are eating. Research demonstrates that children eating together with their family at a table consume more fruits and vegetables and therefore more nutrients such as calcium, iron, and fibre. In addition, children improve their vocabulary and communication skills.\n\nThe nutritional benefits\n\nResearch demonstrated that irregular mealtimes and too much snacking and eating apart from the family are a predictor of childhood overweight and obesity. Additional research also indicates that children who participate in regular family meals are 12% less likely to be overweight. This lowered risk appears to be linked to healthier eating habits. Children who sit down for meals with their family are 35% less likely to engage in disordered eating (overeating or avoiding eating as a means of manipulation) and 24% more likely to eat healthier foods.\n\nTo summarise\n\nThe benefits of family meals include:\n\nHealthier eating habits (including eating fruits and vegetables) that may advance into adulthood\n\nAchieving and maintaining a healthier body weight\n\nLower risk of disordered eating\n\nLess use of cigarettes and abuse of drugs and alcohol\n\nFewer behavioural problems and decreased premature sexual activity\n\nBetter self-esteem and less depression\n\nBetter grades and higher scores on achievement tests at school\n\nBetter vocabulary and public speaking skills\n\nTurn mealtimes into a safe haven and an opportunity to spend quality time with the family. Make it a team effort by encouraging your children to participate in the purchasing and preparation of the food. Children can also become more involved by activities like laying the dinner table and clearing up and cleaning afterwards.\n\n\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Do you still make time to sit down at the dinner table?
