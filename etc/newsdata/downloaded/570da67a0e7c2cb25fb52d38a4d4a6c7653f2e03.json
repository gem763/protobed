After a light campaign last year\u2019s St Leger winner Kew Gardens could profit if the hot favourite fails to perform at his best.\n\n2.45 FILLIES & MARES STAKES (GROUP ONE, 1 MILE 3\u00bd FURLONGS)\n\nThere is plenty of market confidence behind Star Catcher who landed the Ribblesdale Stakes in June from Fleeting and will be fancied by many to confirm the placings. She has done nothing but thrive since, including scoring in France last month following a shrewd front-running ride.\n\nShe may not find those tactics quite so easy today with four Ballydoyle rivals in opposition. A strong gallop could allow Fleeting to close the gap and TARNAWA, who should like the conditions, to pick up some pieces late on.\n\nLord Glitters showed he was a class act with his success in the Queen Anne Stakes last June\n\n3.20 QUEEN ELIZABETH II (GROUP ONE, 1 MILE)\n\nBritish racegoers may remember The Revenant from his early career with Hugo Palmer but he has taken his career to a new level since, with the prospect of attritional conditions no concern for connections.\n\nThe son of Dubawi appears to thrive when the mud is flying and the only facet missing from his make-up is Ascot form. He could well prove himself a class act but LORD GLITTERS has already managed that courtesy of his success in the Queen Anne in June and his track stats read an impressive 212261.\n\nA decent gallop on the straight mile with cut in the ground really plays to his strengths. Although he was beaten 2\u00bel in this event 12 months ago that run was just a month after a punishing trip to Canada and connections have not made the same mistake again. Century Dream, in front at the furlong marker last year, could make a bold bid once more at a tidy price.\n\n4.00 CHAMPION STAKES (GROUP ONE, 1 MILE 2 FURLONGS)\n\nMAGICAL is the clear form pick on her battles with Enable in the past 12 months and, providing she has recovered from a bruising run in the Arc a fortnight ago, may well see off Addeybb who should like the conditions.\n\nA drop back to 10f on easy ground should be ideal for Magical who last encountered those conditions when pushing Crystal Ocean all the way in the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes. She is a true Group One performer as victory in the Irish Champion Stakes endorsed and may have too much class for Addeybb.\n\n4.40 BALMORAL HANDICAP (1 MILE)\n\nLord North proved the proverbial Group horse in a handicap in the Cambridgeshire when landing a major punt and has been well backed here.\n\nEverything looks in place for another huge run but the price is not enticing and the likes of Amedeo Modigliani, Biometric and KYNREN may ensure the ante-post favourite doesn\u2019t have things his own way.\n\nThe latter was strongly backed to win a valuable 7f handicap here a fortnight ago and should again display how effective he is on deep ground.", "description": "There are four Group One races on a star-studded Champions Day card at Ascot on Saturday.
