Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants to make one thing perfectly clear: When he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, it wasn\u2019t because Biden could be Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. \u201cEverything, to me, is about corruption,\u201d Trump assured reporters at the White House on Friday morning. \u201cI don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s campaign. But I do care about corruption.\u201d Trump went on to use the word corruption 25 times. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t pertain to anything but corruption,\u201d he declared. \u201cI don\u2019t care about politics. But I do care about corruption.\u201d\n\nA stack of text messages released by the House of Representatives on Thursday night shows that Trump is lying. The messages, exchanged this summer between State Department officials and Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, document a quid pro quo: The administration offered a meeting between Trump and Zelensky in exchange for a Ukrainian statement that Biden would be investigated. The texts also show that Trump and his aides weren\u2019t interested in cleaning up corruption. Corruption has become a Republican code word for smearing Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\nThe texts indicate that Trump\u2019s negotiators demanded explicit concessions from Ukraine in exchange for the meeting and a restoration of military aid. In an Aug. 9 message, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told Kurt Volker, who was then a special envoy to Ukraine, \u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable.\u201d In a Sept. 1 message, William Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, asked Sondland, \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland replied with the classic line of someone who doesn\u2019t want a paper trail: \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nSondland, like Trump, tried to pretend that what Trump sought in the quid pro quo wasn\u2019t just an investigation of Biden and the Democrats, but a broader Ukrainian effort to stamp out corruption. In a Sept. 19 text, Taylor told Sondland it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland, in a pious response, denied that Trump was targeting his opponents. What Trump wanted, according to Sondland\u2019s formulation, was a statement from Zelensky proving that Ukraine was serious about \u201ctransparency and reforms.\u201d\n\nWe already know, from a reconstructed transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, that Trump specifically asked for investigations of two things that would help him in 2020: Biden\u2019s (nonexistent) corruption in Ukraine, and Ukraine\u2019s (nonexistent) possession of a server that would somehow clear Russia of having interfered in the 2016 election. The texts show that Trump\u2019s men, backstage, were pressing Ukraine for these investigations. On July 19, six days before the call, Volker wrote to Sondland, \u201cMost impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation.\u201d On July 25, just before the call, Volker wrote to Zelensky\u2019s aide, Andrey Yermak: \u201cHeard from White House\u2014assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 10, two weeks after the Zelensky call, Volker texted with Yermak to extract the two specified investigations in exchange for the meeting. \u201cLet\u2019s iron out statement and use that to get date,\u201d he wrote. Yermak replied that Ukraine would target the two subjects Trump wanted, including Burisma, a Ukrainian company that had paid Biden\u2019s son as a board member. \u201cOnce we have a date,\u201d Yermak proposed, Ukraine would call a press briefing to announce a Trump-Zelensky meeting and to discuss \u201cBurisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d Volker wrote back, \u201cSounds great!\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 13, after consulting Giuliani, Volker sent Sondland a draft statement that would be attributed to Zelensky. The statement called for \u201cspecial attention\u201d to \u201cinterference in the political processes of the United States.\u201d It promised an \u201cinvestigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections.\u201d Sondland pronounced the statement \u201cperfect\u201d and told Volker to send it to Yermak.\n\nIn testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, Volker explained how this statement had been put together. Ukraine had initially proposed a draft that didn\u2019t name Burisma or the 2016 election. According to Volker\u2019s testimony, as paraphrased by CNN and the New York Times, Giuliani told Volker that Ukraine\u2019s draft \u201cwas not sufficient to satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s demands\u201d and \u201csuggested inserting references to pursuing probes of Burisma and the 2016 election.\u201d That\u2019s stone-cold proof of Trump\u2019s motive. Ukraine offered to investigate corruption, but Giuliani and the State Department insisted on explicitly targeting Biden.\n\nUkraine offered to investigate corruption, but Giuliani and the State Department insisted on explicitly targeting Biden.\n\nThe texts make clear that Giuliani was directly involved in the statement. On Aug. 9, Sondland asked Giuliani, \u201cCan we all get on the phone to make sure I advise Z[elensky] correctly as to what he should be saying?\u201d Giuliani replied, \u201cYes can you call now going to Fundraiser.\u201d The texts also indicate that somebody other than Sondland was pressing Volker to include the two pro-Trump investigations. On Aug. 17, Sondland asked, \u201cDo we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Boresma?\u201d Volker replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the clear message so far.\u201d Volker didn\u2019t say where the \u201cmessage\u201d was coming from. But the obvious source is Giuliani.\n\nThroughout this process, Giuliani and the State Department ignored signals that their demands were unfounded, political, and based on ulterior motives. According to the Times, Ukrainian officials \u201cindicated to the Americans that they wanted to avoid becoming more deeply enmeshed in American politics.\u201d Volker, in his testimony, said he had warned Giuliani \u201cthat Giuliani was receiving untrustworthy information\u201d about Biden. In May, Volker and Sondland, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, attended an Oval Office meeting at which Trump said of Ukrainians, \u201cThey\u2019re all corrupt, and they tried to take me down.\u201d In Trump\u2019s mind, being corrupt and opposing Trump are synonymous.\n\nIf the text messages, the July 25 transcript, and Volker\u2019s testimony aren\u2019t sufficient to convince you that Trump\u2019s talk of corruption is a front for soliciting campaign dirt, just watch the president\u2019s Friday morning conversation with the press. In one exchange, a reporter poses this question: \u201cHave you asked foreign leaders for any corruption investigations that don\u2019t involve your political opponents?\u201d Trump can\u2019t think of one. \u201cWe would have to look,\u201d he replies.\n\nTrump and his henchmen don\u2019t care about corruption or conflicts of interest. They don\u2019t care that Trump secretly negotiated to build a hotel in Russia while he was running for president. They don\u2019t care that Trump tried to save a Chinese telecom company while his daughter Ivanka sought lucrative trademarks from the Chinese government. They don\u2019t care that Giuliani is up to his eyeballs in shady overseas business deals, including in Ukraine. They don\u2019t care that Sondland got his job by donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. They don\u2019t care that Volker, while working at the State Department, advocated for a missile shipment that earned millions of dollars for Raytheon, a defense contractor whose lobbying firm simultaneously paid Volker as a consultant.\n\nWhen Republicans say that the president just wants to investigate corruption, what they mean is that they\u2019ll look the other way while he colludes with foreign governments to smear his enemies. \u201cCorruption,\u201d as a Republican talking point, is a corruption of the word.", "description": "Republicans don\u2019t care about malfeasance in Ukraine.
