He had served as a minister in the BJP government under former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.\n\nThe woman said she first met Mr Chinmayanand in June last year when she enrolled at a law college run by him. She alleged that he showed her a video of her bathing and blackmailed her to have sex with him.\n\nShe posted a video on Facebook on 24 August detailing the alleged abuse. The allegations made national headlines as she went missing for six days, prompting her father to blame Mr Chinmayanand.\n\nThe Supreme Court intervened and asked the police to find her. She gave her statement in the court on 2 September, after which a special investigation unit was formed.\n\nLast week the 23-year-old and her father alleged that the police had been reluctant to arrest Mr Chinmayanand and she threatened to set herself on fire. She recorded her statement in a local court amid heavy security on 16 September.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Sengar has been charged with rape and criminal conspiracy\n\nThe case has also drawn national attention because it's the second such allegation against a prominent BJP politician from Uttar Pradesh this year.\n\nKuldeep Sengar, a lawmaker in the state, was arrested in April for allegedly raping a woman who was a minor at the time of the attack in 2017. He denies the charge, but was expelled from the BJP in August.\n\nHis accuser had also threatened to set herself on fire, alleging that police had failed to investigate Mr Sengar. In July, she was seriously injured in a car crash, and her family alleged foul play on the part of Mr Sengar. The police have since charged him with attempted murder.\n\nThe crash sparked national outrage and drew the ire of the courts, which questioned the lack of protection offered to rape survivors or anyone testifying in sensitive trials.", "description": "The BJP's Swami Chinmayanand is charged with wrongful confinement after being accused of rape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13A7C/production/_108880508_chin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
