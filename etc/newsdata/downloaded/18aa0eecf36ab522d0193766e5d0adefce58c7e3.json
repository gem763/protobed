He admitted it was an act of foul play, but argued it did not warrant a red card.\n\nHowever, the committee decided that \"the dynamics of the tackle were affected by the actions of both players\" and banned Quaglio for three games.\n\nQuaglio was on the pitch as a replacement for Marco Ricconi, who himself came off the bench for prop Simone Ferrari.
