Healthcare, property and some tech have done well for us although as always it is very stock specific. It has not all gone right and we have unfortunately owned one of the worst performing tech stocks as well.\n\nDo you think ASX-listed businesses are growing in complexity, and do you agree this is probably a bad thing?\n\nI don't think that companies are becoming more complex per se. It does seem that we are again (think 1999) in the grips of a technology bubble with many companies valued in the billions with little or no earnings. Unlike 1999, I do think that some of these companies will justify these valuations in time.\n\nHowever, given our relatively limited pool of established technology companies, valuations are inflated right now. E-commerce and disruptive business models do mean that the old days of cosy oligopolies in Australia are coming to an end. This takes time, but many of the largest and oldest companies that have done so well over the last 30 years may well struggle in the next 30. We are scouring the market for the companies that will replace them.", "description": "The ASX is off to a weaker start; Southern Cross quarterly revenue falls 8.5 per cent; BlackRock's Charlie Lanchester on tech winners and losers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e6ef472c3a1476ac0f06f23f601cd262b80f1d38", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
