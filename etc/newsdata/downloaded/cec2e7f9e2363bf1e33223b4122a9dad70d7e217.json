REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo\n\nMANILA (Reuters) - Philippine annual inflation slowed more than expected in September because of lower food and electricity costs, the statistics agency said on Friday, giving the central bank room to ease monetary policy if needed.\n\nLast month\u2019s headline inflation rate of 0.9% was the slowest in more than three years. It was below the 1.1% forecast in a Reuters poll and was within the central bank\u2019s 0.6% to 1.4% forecast for the month.\n\nIt brought the average inflation in the nine months to September to 2.8%, well inside the central bank\u2019s 2%-4% target for the year.\n\nInflation peaked at a near-decade high of 6.7% in September and October last year. Overall prices have since eased, allowing the central bank to start reversing some of last year\u2019s 175-basis points\u2019 worth of interest rate increases.\n\nLast week, the central bank slashed its benchmark interest rate PHCBIR=ECI for a third time this year to support a slowing economy. It also reduced banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio by 100 basis points to boost credit growth.\n\n\u201cDeclining inflation trend would provide increased flexibility in terms of greater leeway for any furthering easing of local monetary policy,\u201d said Michael Ricafort, economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said on Tuesday he remained confident 2019 growth would reach 6%, the lower end of its 6-7% forecast, but acknowledged it might just miss the mark.\n\nHe declined to say whether further easing would happen in 2019, saying it would depend on inflation rates which are currently \u201cunder control\u201d.", "description": "Philippine annual inflation slowed more than expected in September because of lower food and electricity costs, the statistics agency said on Friday, giving the central bank room to ease monetary policy if needed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436856528&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9302M", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
