The 126 participants in 2019 were both men and women and the winner of the winter race, Jasmin Paris, beat her male competitor by a full 15 hours, and the course record by 12 hours. Shelli Gordon, the second female, was 17th. Last year, Carol Morgan came 8th, and the year before that she clocked 6th.\n\nIn the Moab 240, another well-known endurance event, last year the top woman was 9th and there were 4 women in the top 20 in a field of 111 finishers, mostly males. The year before, in 2017, the winner was a woman, Courtney Dauwalter. Recall, till 1972 women were not even allowed to officially compete in the Boston Marathon.\n\nScience does not yet have clear answers, but there does seem to be something about the inherent ability of women to resist fatigue. Endurance events require both mental fortitude and physical fitness and women have been making a surprise showing in races and distance swimming activity.\n\nYou do not have to look at exotic sports to understand the basic point about the inherent toughness of women. Look at any nearby worksite and you will see female workers doing exactly the same work as the males \u2013 using the spade and shovel, hoisting bricks and so on. Sometimes they are nursing a child. When you are indigent you tend to worry less about gender roles and more about where your next meal comes from.\n\nIn the farm or the factory, women often do the same jobs as men, but without being given either credit, or the salary for it, even as they shoulder the \u201cdouble burden\u201d of being the caregiver of their family.\n\nWomen make up 48% of the Indian population, but only 65% of them are literate as compared to 82% men. Female labour force participation in India is not only among the lowest in the world, at around 27%, but has actually declined in the last two decades even as the country registered impressive economic growth.\n\nRemarkably, some the biggest resistance to female participation in the work force comes in better educated families. A 2018 Icrier study by Surbhi Ghai says that at the bottom of this conundrum is \u201cpatriarchy\u201d \u2013 a collection of attitudes which insist that women\u2019s roles are secondary to those of men \u2013 which the study quantified in an index.\n\nWomen, in turn, are battering against those attitudes, sometimes frontally, such as when they insist on not only joining the military, but insisting that they should serve in the combat arms. Participation in such arms is a new metric of the status of women in a society. Across the world, the barriers have fallen and in most developed countries, their role has become crucial to the combat capabilities of their forces.\n\nThe status of women in the Indian military is spotty. IAF has begun inducting them as fighter pilots, but the navy does not allow them seagoing roles. As for the army, they are permitted in non-combat arms only. Last year army chief Bipin Rawat made all the classically patriarchal arguments to argue that women cannot be given combat roles, the most obvious and facetious ones being that they would find it difficult to exercise authority over soldiers with a rural background and may claim maternal leave.\n\nWomen\u2019s participation in the military, as in the workforce, is not a vanity project to display your progressive credentials. At its heart lies the need for their training and skills, and numbers, in one case to maintain a combat capability and in the other to lubricate a growing economy. It most certainly requires a sharp understanding of what patriarchy is all about and the ways in which society can, and should, remove the social and cultural disabilities that have hobbled women through the ages.", "description": "The Montane Spine Race, coursing 268 miles along the central hilly spine of England tests not just physical fitness, but mental toughness as well.
