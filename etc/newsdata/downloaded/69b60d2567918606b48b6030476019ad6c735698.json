(GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle)\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Will the customers who fly on the suborbital spaceships operated by British billionaire Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic and Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin get astronaut wings? That\u2019s not in the cards, because those wings are typically reserved for flight crews. But at least they\u2019ll get a lapel pin to mark their achievement.\n\nThe pin, created by the Association of Space Explorers, made its debut today on the lapel of Beth Moses, chief astronaut instructor at Virgin Galactic. She was pinned here at the International Astronautical Congress by former NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, the association\u2019s president.\n\nMoses already has her commercial astronaut wings from the Federal Aviation Administration, by virtue of her trip beyond the 50-mile mark in February as a crew member aboard Virgin Galactic\u2019s VSS Unity rocket plane. But she\u2019s glad to have the pin as well.\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s Beth Moses shows off the lapel pin she received from the Association of Space Explorers. (GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle) More\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be presented with this new pin,\u201d Moses said in a news release. \u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to be recognized by an association which counts so many pioneers of space exploration among its members. I\u2019m looking forward to working with them to continue to inspire and educate people around the advantages of seeing the world\u2019s problems from the perspective of space.\u201d\n\nThe Association of Space Explorers was founded in 1985, but until now it provided recognition (and a pin) only to spacefliers who achieved orbit. The pin for suborbital space travelers, created as a result of discussions with Virgin Galactic, has a slightly different design.\n\nGoing forward, the suborbital pin will be awarded to customers and crew members who rise above 50 miles in altitude \u2014 whether it\u2019s on Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo craft, Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard spaceship or other vehicles yet to be developed.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to this new demographic of spacefliers adding to our own voices in promoting the benefits of human space exploration, greater stewardship of our home planet, and inspiring the next generation,\u201d Lopez-Alegria said.\n\nMany more pins could be given out next year if Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin stick to their current schedules.\n\nClare Pelly, head of astronaut relations at Virgin Galactic, said VSS Unity and its WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane are due to make the move from its testing grounds at California\u2019s Mojave Air and Space Port to Spaceport America in New Mexico by the end of the year. That should set the stage for commercial flights to begin next year, with Branson getting on the first flight.\n\nMore than 600 \u201cFuture Astronauts\u201d have paid as much as $250,000 each to reserve a ride. One of those future fliers is Dan Durda, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute who plans to fly alongside an experiment focusing on how grains of asteroid-like material stick together in zero gravity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an entire range of researchers, biological sciences and physical sciences, who are just champing at the bit for this relatively cheap and frequent access to the space environment,\u201d said Durda, who has been working with Virgin Galactic as well as Blue Origin. \u201cI\u2019m raring to go.\u201d\n\nBlue Origin hasn\u2019t yet started taking reservations, but each uncrewed test flight brings the day closer when New Shepard will start flying people. Greg \u201cRay J\u201d Johnson, a former NASA astronaut who now heads the New Shepard program, said there\u2019ll be one more uncrewed test before the end of the year. He acknowledged that his team has been \u201ctapping the brakes\u201d to make absolutely sure the spacecraft is safe for crewed flights next year.\n\nJohnson said Blue Origin would make sure there\u2019s room aboard New Shepard for \u201cpoets and philosophers, and artists also.\u201d He also promised that the adventure would continue even after the flight is finished.\n\n\u201cWe plan to engage with our Blue astronauts after the flight, to keep them in the club,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nPelly agreed with that strategy: \u201cProbably the thing we hear the most frequently from our Future Astronauts is, \u2018I\u2019m having so much fun, I don\u2019t want it to be over.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Will the customers who fly on the suborbital spaceships operated by British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin get astronaut wings?
