From the restaurant window, the male is allegedly seen running around the street randomly lashing cash machines and passers-by with his belt.\n\nAs another fight ensues between the souvenir sellers and the man, the cameraman laments the violence and lack of police: \u201cWhat an idiot. He\u2019s mad guys, He\u2019s mad. No police, nothing.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the video, police eventually arrive at the scene after the chaos. They reportedly arrest the alleged assailant as he screams unintelligibly.\n\nThe Met Police told Mirror Online: \"A 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault, GBH and criminal damage.\n\n\n\n\"The arrest follows a call to reports of a man assaulting people at 21:33hrs on Tuesday, 22 October on Coventry Street, W1.\n\n\n\n\"Officers attended within 7 minutes, and quickly detained and arrested the man on suspicion of assault and affray.\n\n\"One woman was treated at the scene for injuries to her hand. There are no other injuries which required medical attention.\n\n\"The man arrested was taken to a central London police station and questioned.\n\n\n\n\"He has been released under investigation whilst further enquiries are carried out.\"", "description": "Shocking footage appears to show the carnage as a brawl erupts in the streets of central London", "authors": ["Pesala Bandara", "Image", "Piotr Koltarz News Dog Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752275.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-SHOCKING-MOMENT-A-LONE-MAN-CAUSES-CHAOS-IN-LONDON-STEALING-FROM-TOURISTS-ATTACKING-AN-AMBULANCE-C.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
