Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nClifford Modern Living Holdings has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so investors might be curious about its 3.5% yield. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Clifford Modern Living Holdings for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSEHK:3686 Historical Dividend Yield, October 30th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Clifford Modern Living Holdings paid out 26% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nWhile the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Clifford Modern Living Holdings's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Clifford Modern Living Holdings's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was CN\u00a50.019 per share.\n\nWe like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nThe other half of the dividend investing equation is evaluating whether earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Over the long term, dividends need to grow at or above the rate of inflation, in order to maintain the recipient's purchasing power. It's good to see Clifford Modern Living Holdings has been growing its earnings per share at 15% a year over the past five years. A company paying out less than a quarter of its earnings as dividends, and growing earnings at more than 10% per annum, looks to be right in the cusp of its growth phase. At the right price, we might be interested.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Clifford Modern Living Holdings's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're glad to see Clifford Modern Living Holdings has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we'd like. Clifford Modern Living Holdings fits all of our criteria, and we think it's an attractive dividend idea that would warrant further investigation.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Clifford Modern Living Holdings Limited (HKG:3686) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kVZj88clH.qYaLX5ZTYQ8Q--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/448d5ae0368ea9d4972f26a94b8a227b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
