It was the year\u2019s worst stock-market debut for a U.S. company valued at more than $1 billion, according to Dealogic, and that spooked some big IPO investors.\n\nWe is now expected to wait until mid-October at the earliest to start its investor roadshow following the conclusion of the Jewish High Holidays, which Mr. Neumann observes.\n\nThe delay could also last longer and some existing investors, including SoftBank, have pushed the company to wait until next year to launch its IPO, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\n\nThe nine-year-old company, which rents space, renovates it, then divides it up and subleases it, expects that results for the current quarter will showcase its rapid growth and get investors more excited about its prospects, one of the people said.\n\nThat would enable the company to stage its long-anticipated debut as soon as October or November, this person said, adding that We had all along been considering this alternate timetable among others.\n\nThe offering has been full of unexpected twists and turns and it is still possible the company could decide to move forward on the original timetable.\n\nIf the IPO doesn\u2019t take place soon, We may have to look elsewhere for much-needed funding.\n\nThe share sale was expected to raise at least $3 billion and trigger a $6 billion loan package.\n\nOne possible source of new funding is SoftBank, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, which was planning on kicking in at least $750 million more as part of the IPO, as the Journal reported last week.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s planned investment was expected to help shore up demand for the offering by limiting the supply of shares to be sold to outside investors and signaling the Japanese technology conglomerate\u2019s continued support of the company, but apparently that didn\u2019t do the trick.\n\nThe postponement is the latest hiccup for the IPO market in a year that is set to be one of best ever in terms of money raised in new issues.\n\nA number of big technology startups, including ride-hailing services Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. and workplace-messaging provider Slack Technologies Inc., have gone public in 2019 and while some of the newly minted shares have soared, others, such as Lyft and Uber, have struggled as investors question businesses with big losses.\n\n\u2014Eliot Brown\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "description": "WeWork\u2019s parent is expected to postpone its initial public offering after investors questioned how much the company is worth and its corporate governance.", "authors": ["Maureen Farrell", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107605/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
