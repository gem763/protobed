He told them that, at a meeting with bosses, he had signed away some of their paid sick leave.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker is seen at Plasti-Tremp factory, a family-run business specialized in plastic process in Menetou-Ratel, France, October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\n\u201cThey got a bit mad,\u201d said Thomas, a workers\u2019 representative at Plasti-Tremp, a family-run business in central France.\n\nBut ultimately, the workers agreed to the change and other dilutions of their employee protections because, they said, they trusted the bosses and understood the plant needed to be competitive in a tough global market.\n\nThe outcome was possible because two years ago, President Emmanuel Macron pushed through measures to liberalize France\u2019s highly regulated labor market and reduce the unemployment rate which, at 8.5% in August, is more than double that in Britain or Germany.\n\nMacron has not yet achieved his aim. Only 200 companies have so far adopted the type of agreement used at the plastics plant, according to a committee set up to evaluate the impact of the reforms, and, on a national level, the five main trade unions view such agreements with suspicion.\n\nSome of Macron\u2019s reforms have triggered workers\u2019 unrest and, though his ratings have partly recovered in recent months, his popularity has fallen since he came to power in May 2017.\n\nBut the case of Plasti-Tremp in Menetou-Ratel near Sancerre, which is known for producing wine, offers a glimpse of the changes that are possible when Macron\u2019s reform drive aligns with interests on the ground.\n\nThe firm, which employs 45 people, specializes in plastic coating, such as the concertina-shaped covers that go round vehicle gear shift sticks, and puts the plastic hand grips on metal pliers.\n\nCompetition is from China and eastern Europe for its low-value-added products, and from Germany and Scotland for more sophisticated components. French labor regulations push up costs.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk at a certain pace, the world runs\u201d, said Jean-Pascal Godon, who created the company with his wife in 1986 on a part of his father\u2019s farm property. \u201cIt is hard to keep up\u201d.\n\nWhen Macron\u2019s labor law reform was introduced, he took advantage of it.\n\nIn France, company bosses who wanted to adjust working hours had to secure every worker\u2019s approval through a contract amendment, explained Joseph Tayefeh, head of Plastalliance, an employer federation for the plastics sector.\n\nOne of the Macron reforms created a mechanism called a collective performance agreement, a tool that allows a boss to make those moves \u2014 provided a workers\u2019 representative agrees to it \u2014 and to lay off workers who refuse to comply.\n\nMONDAY MORNING ABSENCES\n\nGodon increased working time at Plasti-Tremp to 39 hours a week from the 35 hours limit that, by law, applies to most French workers.\n\nExtended hours were not much of an issue for workers, as they came with consistently bigger wage packets, instead of the variable pay packets when they took overtime.\n\n\u201cIt is much more predictable\u201d, said Marie-Solange Devalli\u00e8re, a 58-year-old employee who uses the 200 to 300 euros extra she now earns every month to save for retirement.\n\nThe company also stopped fully compensating employees for the first few days of any sick leave. Some workers, said Godon, had been abusing the system by fraudulently taking paid days off work, especially after the weekend.\n\nChanging the system worried workers.\n\n\u201cSome of the workers said they did not understand why they had to pay for those who abused the system,\u201d said Thomas, the workers\u2019 representative.\n\nThe workers were won round, three of them told Reuters, because they agreed unjustified absenteeism caused stress among the team and that their boss had to find a solution for it. They said they also trusted him to be fair. He promised to look again at his initial change to make sure staff with severe illnesses did not lose out.\n\nCutter in hand, about to put the finishing touches on gear shift covers, Martine Canoine, a 47-year-old worker, said of the change to sick leave that employees \u201cunderstood why Jean-Pascal did it\u201d.\n\nOn a national level, trade unions oppose such deals because they fear the erosion of cherished worker protections.\n\n\u201cPeople from all around the world envy our system, and we are dismantling it\u201d, Michel Beaugas, a senior official with trade union Force Ouvriere, told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nAt the plant near Sancerre, Godon said it was too early yet to see the impact on productivity.\n\nBut he said he promised staff that if competitiveness improved following the changes, he could raise their bonuses.\n\n\u201cIf at Christmas, the bonus, which last year was 2,800 euros ($3,125 at the current exchange rate), reaches 3,000 or even 4,000 euros, I will have won my bet\u201d, he said.", "description": "Last year, Brice Thomas gathered colleagues in the finishing workshop of the French plastics factory where he works.
