It\u2019s violence against the rainforest and at the same time violence against the ethnic groups, violence against people.\u201d\n\nHe said he also hopes the synod\u2019s final document will include \u201csomething about the ordination of married men, and new ministries for women.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The archbishop of Luxembourg said this week that climate change is the most important issue faced by the Vatican synod on the Amazon.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
