She remains charged with aggravated assault, false imprisonment, simple assault and harassment.\n\nLawyers for Amorino have claimed her 19-year-old daughter is responsible for assaulting the 78-year-old woman.\n\nAuthorities say the two beat Amorino\u2019s mother and held her captive during an August 2017 attack in their Youngwood home.\n\nA psychiatrist has testified that the women have a rare delusional disorder, making them believe they\u2019re in romantic relationships with current and former Steelers players.\n\nAmorino\u2019s daughter was found incompetent to stand trial.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge has dismissed two charges against a woman accused of beating her mother and shaving her head because she thought the older woman was listening to a Pittsburgh Steelers' game too loudly on the radio.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
