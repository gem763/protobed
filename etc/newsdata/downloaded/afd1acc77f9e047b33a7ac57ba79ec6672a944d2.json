But, as in most sports, when an athlete or coach doesn\u2019t make the playoffs, they appear more expendable.\n\nAfter seven full-time seasons in the Cup Series, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. was let go by Roush Fenway Racing. (Photo: Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNASCAR begins the second round of its 2019 playoffs this weekend at Dover International Speedway (Sunday, 2:30 p.m. ET, NBCSN). All but two of the drivers who made the playoffs have contracts set to return to their same team next season.\n\nClint Bowyer still has no deal for 2020, but he has advanced to the second round of the playoffs. He has already filmed a Mobil 1 commercial to air in 2020, which leaves his Stewart-Haas Racing team in a predicament if it doesn\u2019t re-sign him as it likely would have to pay to shoot a new commercial.\n\nKurt Busch, who brought the Chip Ganassi Racing No. 1 car its first victory since 2013 when he won at Kentucky earlier this year, doesn\u2019t have a deal done yet for 2020 but team owner Chip Ganassi has said he expects Busch will return.\n\nLook at the standings of those drivers outside the playoffs, and it\u2019s a different story when it comes to stability.\n\nRCR: Promotes Reddick to Cup to replace Hemric in No. 8 Chevrolet\n\nKESELOWSKI: Hypothetical advice to college athletes: Sell your autograph\n\nSILLY SEASON: Stenhouse firing makes for frenzied NASCAR free agency\n\nJimmie Johnson, who sits 18th in the standings, is the only driver between 17th and 22nd locked into a deal with the same team next season. Daniel Suarez (17th) is still in negotiations to try to return at SHR, while Paul Menard (19th) will retire from full-time racing and Chris Buescher (20th) will replace Stenhouse. Matt DiBenedetto (21st) will be replaced by Christopher Bell in the No. 95 of Leavine Family Racing but landed the ride vacated by Menard, and then there\u2019s currently 2020 jobless driver Stenhouse in 22nd.\n\n\u201cIt hadn\u2019t been working over the last couple years. \u2026 What sucks for myself is I feel like we\u2019ve had plenty of speed to get the job done,\u201d said Stenhouse, who admitted that the Roush Fenway decision blindsided him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of things came down to us not getting those results.\n\n\u201cUltimately, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for is results and they weren\u2019t coming.\u201d\n\nStenhouse had earned two wins at Roush Fenway in 249 starts \u2014 his two wins for Roush Fenway in 2017 remain the only wins for the organization since the start of 2015. He has failed to finish 21 races in the last five years, and his average finish this season (20.8) ranks as his worst in the last four years and that likely wouldn\u2019t make the playoffs on points.\n\n\u201cLooking at my career, I try and win races, and I drive the car as hard as I can,\u201d Stenhouse said. \u201cThat bites you sometimes and maybe now as an athlete you look back on those situations and look what you could do different.\u201d\n\nNewman has been running at the finish of every race this year. Stenhouse\u2019s 2020 replacement, Buescher, has been running at the finish of every race except two, both at the crash-filled Daytona and Talladega tracks. That type of consistency earns points, increasing the potential to make the playoffs.\n\n\u201cRyan has done really well this year in terms of keeping his car together and Chris has got a history doing the same thing, so we\u2019re going to work on our cars to make them faster and to not be repairing them when they\u2019re damaged,\u201d team owner Jack Roush said.\n\nBuescher, who won the 2015 Xfinity Series title for Roush Fenway Racing, will leave JTG Daugherty Racing, whose only playoff appearance came in 2014 with AJ Allmendinger and has had only two top-20 finishes in the standings since 2010.\n\nWhile improving with JTG Daugherty Racing, Buescher apparently sees more upside at Roush Fenway, where his former Xfinity Series crew chief Scott Graves serves as crew chief for Newman.\n\n\u201cWe plan to go out and follow suit of what you\u2019ve been able to see Ryan and Scott do,\u201d Buescher said. \u201cScott and I have a history together and some great stories to tell, and that championship in \u201915 is a big thing as well.\u201d\n\nBuescher should study history. He saw firsthand what happened to Stenhouse.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that we have two cars in the playoffs and that next year at this time we\u2019re focused on both of them making the next round,\u201d Roush Fenway Racing President Steve Newmark said.\n\nBob Pockrass is a FOX Sports NASCAR reporter.
