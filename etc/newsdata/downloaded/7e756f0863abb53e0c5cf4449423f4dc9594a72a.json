What if he also has her mental health struggles?", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m waiting for my mom to finish getting ready for the wake. It\u2019s early evening on a Tuesday in December, and the humid bathroom smells of Aqua Net hair spray.\n\nI sit on the closed toilet cradling a school picture in my palm. Mike and I had traded photos in the fall like I\u2019d done with all my friends. On the back in blue ink I\u2019d written, \u201cMike 1991-92\u201d and in capital letters underlined with a squiggled line, \u201cHOT!\u201d\n\nMom leans over the sink, applying mascara to her long lashes. She thinks she knows what I\u2019m going through because her dad and brother committed suicide, but it\u2019s not the same. She doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be 13 nowadays, or how it feels when the boy you\u2019ve had a crush on since sixth grade dies suddenly, horribly.\n\nI don\u2019t look up when I mumble that suicide is selfish.\n\nFast, she\u2019s got hold of me, startling me. She grips my upper arms, her face in mine, and shouts that she never wants to hear me say that again. Through tears, she tells me suicide is not selfish.\n\nI squeeze my arms closer to my sides, edging back from her intense dark eyes.\n\nShe claims that my friend was depressed and that\u2019s why he killed himself. People who end their lives are in more pain than you can imagine, she says. Then she lets go, stands and looks away.\n\nI say I\u2019m sorry, considering that the cute boy who cracked jokes in English class could have been suffering.\n\nLike her father, my mom fought depression for many years before she took her own life. After she passed, I found a folder jammed with dozens of articles she had cut out and saved. One clipping, dotted by faded yellow highlighter, said children who have a parent who dies by suicide are six times more likely to die in the same way.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health lists family history of suicide or mental disorder as two of 10 risk factors for suicidal ideation. Studies of identical twins indicate up to 50 percent of suicidal behavior may be inherited.\n\n[I thought if I hid my anxiety I could shield my children. I was wrong.]\n\nMy children never had the chance to meet my mom. She died before they were born. But on my fragile days, when my smallest boy looks at me, I\u2019m haunted.\n\nI tell my new psychologist that five of my blood relatives died by suicide. While I tick them off, I give no hint of the images flickering behind my composed facade.\n\n\u201cMy grampa,\u201d the shed at my mom\u2019s childhood home.\n\n\u201cMy uncle,\u201d a former soldier disabled by multiple sclerosis crawling from the house to the barn to milk his cows.\n\n\u201cMy mom,\u201d a black vinyl body bag on a gurney being wheeled out the front door.\n\n\u201cMy aunt,\u201d my cousin\u2019s small pickup parked askew in the middle of the front lawn, the driver\u2019s door ajar.\n\n\u201cAnd my first cousin,\u201d a round boy with laughing cheeks bursting through a farmhouse screen door.\n\nThough I have had a panic disorder for most of my life, I have not inherited Mom\u2019s depression. I don\u2019t have her large, wide-set eyes either. As a child, it pained me when strangers praised my mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s remarkable eyes, ignoring mine. Now, the pain is because my youngest son bears a marker for suffering \u2014 the eyes of family members who have attempted or died by suicide.\n\nMy 9-year-old has my husband Mark\u2019s bony frame and square chin. His brown ringlets and introversion are from me. His older brother is more extroverted. When our 10-year-old is anxious, he seeks help. But when our younger son is struggling, he cocoons, crawling from room to room under his lovey Dinosaur Blankie. He isolates. He hides. He shuts down, and I am helpless.\n\nMy instinct is to hover over my boys and grill them about their feelings. If I could, by sheer force of will, pluck out the double helix that makes them prone to a mental malady, I would be free to imagine their futures without an underlying dread that they won\u2019t survive puberty.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just death that scares me. A life of agony might be worse. I imagine having a teenage son who can\u2019t feel joy. I push away the thought of him as a man experiencing the best moments of his life with an emptiness inside that never fills. Malnutrition of the mind can lead to broken relationships, addiction and an immutable fixation on dying, all of which my mom battled during her 48 years.\n\nOur youngest argues with Mark and me about how much more he loves us than we love him. When he lies in bed at night, he thinks of evidence to convince us that we can\u2019t possibly understand his depth of love for us. As we back out of his room, he repeats, \u201clove, love\u201d while we shut the door, hoping he\u2019ll stay in bed.\n\nAs I snuggle him on a Saturday night, we face each other on our sides, his knees scooped into my belly.\n\nHe says he has a question.\n\nI wait for him to go on.\n\nHe asks why, if heaven is so great and everything is so bad here, we don\u2019t all just go to heaven.\n\nMy heart palpitates at the seriousness of his tone.\n\nI consider asking him directly if he\u2019s thinking about dying. Sometimes I wonder if I overreact to simple questions. But what if my fear is justified? What if he believes dying is better than living?\n\nMental illness can and should be treated like physical illness. Yet, when it comes to my sons, I\u2019m guilty of treating manageable disorders like they are terminal diseases. When I need a reality check, I substitute their predisposition for mental issues for a risk of a heart condition or some other somatic ailment. It divorces me from alarm over my sons\u2019 age-appropriate outbursts and fickle emotions. If my child had a bad heart, I\u2019d put my faith in God and medicine. I\u2019d rest in the knowledge that, no matter what happened, I would not be blamed or asked to perform the surgery that could save him.\n\nI cling to a concept \u2014 genetics are not destiny. I need this reminder, and the Internet provides it through fact-based articles and published scientific studies.\n\nGenetics are not destiny. And my boys haven\u2019t lost anyone they love to suicide. In this, they are not like me. Or my mom. Or my aunts, uncles, sister, brother, cousins.\n\nPerhaps the key to protecting my children is caring for my own mental health. If they don\u2019t lose a parent to suicide, they won\u2019t be as likely to continue the pattern. Maybe, if I focus on wellness, my grandchildren won\u2019t fear mental illness as a family curse, but will understand it as a condition that can be overcome with treatment and support.\n\nAlthough my son has my mother\u2019s eyes, I can guide how he views the world and his place in it.\n\nKelly Meldrum is a writer living in Michigan.
