Chapter four in the series of Democratic Party debates begins tonight in Westerville, Ohio, on the Otterbein University campus, and instead of ten candidates onstage, which has been the format to date, we will now have twelve. The list includes Joe Biden, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nThe first rounds of Democratic debates have been weighed down by the dynamic of 20-plus candidates fighting tooth and nail to prove their mettle to donors. This has led to a lot of superficial screeching and virtue-signaling, with many trying to Win the Internet with rehearsed attacks. It hasn\u2019t really worked. Since the last rounds in Houston in early September, many of the more bombastic candidates \u2014 well, Bill de Blasio, anyway \u2014 have flamed out.\n\nNow we have fewer candidates overall, but too many still to comfortably fit on one stage, so the hurried carp-and-scratch dynamic that dominated the first rounds will likely worsen. There are also still five candidates excluded based on DNC criteria that seem even more arbitrary than before, so tonight\u2019s contest won\u2019t involve Marianne Williamson, Michael Bennet, John Delaney, Steve Bullock, and Tim Ryan. Those five will be spared a fourth round likely to be dominated by #impeachment, Bernie\u2019s stent, and calls for Joe Biden to share more views about gay bath house sex.\n\nIn any case, Katie Halper (@kthalps) and I will be commenting and tweeting on the debate live on Rolling Stone\u2019s YouTube channel as we drown our sorrows in drink, beginning at 7:50 p.m. tonight. To prevent the excess boozing that took place in previous rounds, we\u2019re encouraging everyone to stick to beer and very small shots. As always, do not politics and drive.\n\nThe rules for the fourth Democratic debate drinking game:\n\nDrink EVERY TIME:\n\nSomeone makes a passive-aggressive comment wishing Bernie Sanders a return to health.\n\nJoe Biden says \u201cBarack,\u201d or does a Liam Neeson/Taken routine about how Trump is going after his family.\n\nCastro brings up his endorsements. Bonus shot if he does so irrelevantly.\n\nSomeone brings up Assad in an exchange with Tulsi Gabbard. Also, drink if anyone talks about losing \u201ccredibility\u201d and/or Trump giving Turkey a \u201cgreen light.\u201d\n\nA candidate talks explicitly about needing to create a viral moment to succeed, then attempts to do so. (Double if it\u2019s Klobuchar).\n\n\u201cMy first day as president\u2026\u201d\n\nKamala Harris laughs at one of her own jokes.\n\nSomeone claims to be more for impeachment than someone else who is also for impeachment.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke proudly/angrily cops to a right-wing conspiratorial clich\u00e9 about Democrats, in the spirit of, \u201cHell, yes, I\u2019m going to take your guns.\u201d\n\nButtigieg subtly chides a rival for not being as subtle as he is.\n\nElizabeth Warren says \u201cMama.\u201d\n\nAnyone says something phony tough about China.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
