A fascinating look inside the Soviet Union by the then Moscow bureau chief for the New York Times, the study of the former Soviet Union was a revelation for many who'd long excused a system that ran counter to human nature. Life under communism was brutal, and defined by relentless scarcity.\n\nWhile a falling dollar stateside had around the time of publication brought about \u201coil shocks\u201d that historians misunderstand to this day as being a consequence of OPEC, Americans suffered the dollar error doubly through interminable lines for gasoline that were the predictable result of price controls foisted on them by a clueless political class. This rates mention because, as Smith observed about the Soviet Union, its people endured lines for everything.\n\nA year after Smith\u2019s book was released, Evan Osnos was born in London. One imagines they crossed paths simply because Osnos\u2019s father, Peter Osnos, had been the Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post while Smith headed up the Times' Moscow bureau. Osnos was born in London on account of its hospitals being better than what was available in Moscow.\n\nRoughly seven years after the release of The Russians, and roughly six after Osnos was born, Fox Butterfield, New York Times bureau chief in Beijing, released Alive In the Bitter Sea. This was seemingly Butterfield\u2019s attempt to explain China as Smith had Russia. It was a pretty terrifying place. Butterfield\u2019s excellent book detailed the horrors of life for people living in a country very slowly emerging from the shackles of communism. There are so many examples of the awful living conditions the people endured, but with brevity in mind those lucky enough to enjoy lightbulb light had to access their singular bulb from a central authority. The country\u2019s well-to-do citizens would bring the burned out bulb in, a low level functionary would check its serial number, then release a replacement to the lucky person. \u201cLucky\u201d is a correct descriptor here because per capita income in China then was of the $175/year variety. In 1982 most Chinese had never switched on any kind of light. Those who grew up in the developed world in the \u201870s no doubt remember that a failure to finish one\u2019s meal was often met with \u201cthey\u2019re starving in China.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2008, and Evan Osnos moved to Beijing as correspondent for The New Yorker. His 2014 book, Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China brings to mind the previous works by Smith and Butterfield. It is his thoroughly excellent, unputdownable account of a China that would be unrecognizable to Butterfield, and for that matter, anyone who witnessed the old one. As my good friend Richard Tren, Program Officer at the Searle Freedom Trust has told me, his grandparents visited the China that Butterfield wrote about. When Tren tells them that Shanghai positively sparkles now with skyscrapers as far as the eye can see, they don\u2019t believe him. They refuse to believe him. There\u2019s no way a country as desperate as China was could be thriving today.\n\nIt would be fun to watch Tren's grandparents read Age of Ambition. Osnos is a brilliant writer in possession of a hard-to-top way with words. He truly brings China\u2019s awe-inspiring transformation to life. The sentences flow, and they tell the reader so much. As Osnos described a China he returned to in 2005 (he\u2019d studied there as a college student in the late 1990s), \u201cThe greatest fever of all was aspiration, a belief in the sheer possibility to remake a life.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, China is no longer a communist country. The Right, of which this reviewer is a member, do their side a reputational disservice when they express disdain for a \u201ccommunist\u201d country. As Osnos makes plain, \u201cAt the lowest levels, the Party felt like a professional network.\u201d Without excusing the Party\u2019s brutal, sickeningly murderous history for even a second (Osnos notes that Mao\u2019s \u201cGreat Leap Forward resulted in the world\u2019s worst famine, which killed between thirty and forty-five million people\u201d), it\u2019s thankfully no longer what it was.\n\nTrue communism is defined by horrifying desperation, endless lines at stores with bare shelves, and in its worst form, it\u2019s all about killing. The China of today is nothing like that. It\u2019s the opposite of communist, particularly in an economic sense. For an American to walk off the plane there is for that American to arguably feel more at home than any Chinese citizen. All the street signs have English spelling, and then the shops and restaurants bring to mind a typical American city: McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Apple Stores, Polo Stores, Sunglass Huts, etc. Communism brings to mind the worst kind of poverty, while the China of today symbolizes a remarkable drive to improve. It\u2019s a country in a hurry, and reality supports this.\n\nThough in 1979 China was poorer than North Korea and average income was dwarfed by the earnings of those who inhabited sub-Saharan Africa, at present its people eat \u201csix times as much meat as 1976,\u201d they\u2019re collectively the world\u2019s largest consumers of \u201cenergy, movies, beer, and platinum,\u201d plus they\u2019re second only to the U.S. in the purchase of Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis. Louis Vuitton? They\u2019re #1.\n\nThey\u2019re herculean consumers precisely because they\u2019re increasingly skillful producers. Osnos reports that as of 2005, the Chinese were exporting every six hours as much as they exported in all of 1978. From a building standpoint, Osnos calculated that the \u201csquare-foot equivalent of Rome\u201d was being erected every two weeks. The previous anecdote is hopefully a corrective to those who claim the Chinese economy is one of \u201cghost cities\u201d aggressively produced for no one in particular.\n\nMore realistically, the \u201cghost cities\u201d are a recognition from developers that economic freedom is propelling Chinese by the millions from destitution to increasingly lush living in very short order. Stated more simply, there\u2019s lots of building in China because the Chinese are doing lots of buying. On this subject, Osnos thankfully didn\u2019t foist on his readers the laughable fallacy promoted by some of the most prominent economists in the world that China\u2019s economy is \u201cexport based.\u201d Oh please. People produce in order to get things. Always. As Osnos recalls about his return in 2005, \u201cthe most urgent priority for practically everyone I met that summer was a pent-up desire to consume.\u201d\n\nAll of the above rates serious thought by the overnight protectionists on the Right who long properly disdained the communist China of old, but who now think the capitalistic China of today must be held down with tariffs. When they cheer President Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs with an eye on weakening the Chinese economy, they reveal their ignorance. As right-wing hero Robert Mundell long ago observed, \u201cthe only closed economy is the world economy.\u201d Considering Mundell\u2019s truism through the lens of China, Apple sells a fifth of its iPhones there, GM sells more cars there than in North America, Boeing sells a quarter of its planes there, there are 3,400 Starbucks there on the way to 7,000\u2026.Readers get the picture, or should. The American Right would get the picture if a Democrat occupied the White House. To put a bull\u2019s eye on China\u2019s economy is to put one on the U.S. economy. It\u2019s very simple. If we make it difficult for them to sell stateside through tariffs, we\u2019ll make it more difficult for the bluest of American blue chips to sell into what is emerging as the biggest market the world has ever seen.\n\nImagine that. Imagine the China we grew up knowing as intensely poor now soaring economically. It\u2019s exciting on so many levels, but what does it mean for the Communist Party? Osnos seems to think the situation is blurry. Everything is a contradiction. Osnos writes that the Party \u201cabandoned Marx\u2019s theories but retained Mao\u2019s portrait on the Gate of Heavenly Peace.\u201d He adds that the Party \u201cno longer promises equality or an end to toil. It promises only prosperity, pride, and strength.\u201d The Party \u201chas unleashed the greatest expansion of human potential in world history \u2013 and spawned, perhaps, the greatest threat to its own survival.\u201d Figure that Osnos\u2019s very book \u201cis an account of the collision of two forces: aspiration and authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nThis matters because prosperous, increasingly worldly people will not take very well to the authoritarianism that still rears its ugly head in the country, and that Osnos doesn\u2019t shy away from exposing. Though he plainly has an affinity for the country he spent so much time in, he also writes of what a frustrating place it is, how miserable the leadership can make the lives of dissidents, how ridiculous were the directives from the propaganda departments to reporters like him. Where will this end?\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking because the people are moving fast. And they\u2019re more and more sophisticated. Not only do they purchase American goods with great gusto, not only do they view learning English as \u201ca defining measure of life\u2019s potential,\u201d they increasingly educate themselves in the freedomloving United States. While there were only sixty-five Chinese students in private U.S. high schools when Osnos arrived in 2005, as of 2010 there were 7,000. The number is surely much higher today. According to Cornell professor Eswar Prasad, as of around 2017 the number of Chinese students in American colleges had soared past 300,000. It\u2019s hard to imagine the Party winning this battle if it continues to accent authority over social network. Time will tell, but time bolstered by technology clearly favors freedom. Try as those at the top of the Communist Party might, they\u2019re proving unequal to technology. To offer up but one example referenced by Osnos, though the \u201cauthorities had purged it from the nation\u2019s official history,\u201d anyone \"who took a few steps to get on a proxy server could discover as much about Tiananmen as he chose to learn.\u201d Freedom will win, and it will notwithstanding what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong right now. More on that in a bit.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s useful to pivot to what an impressive reporter Osnos is. His writing is soothing, as are all the obscure quotes he unearths from Orwell, Deng Xiaoping and others, the anecdotes (artist Ai WeiWei found the Iran-Contra hearings in the U.S. fascinating given his excitement that \u201cthe government would go through this cleansing\u201d), and facts (by 2012 \u201cthe richest seventy members of China\u2019s national legislature had a net worth of almost ninety billion dollars \u2013 more than ten times the combined net worth of the entire U.S. Congress\") that will be used in many future columns by this reviewer. But what Osnos arguably does best is tell the stories of the people who are changing China.\n\nIndeed, he recalls upon return in 2005 that he was \u201caccustomed to hearing the story of China\u2019s metamorphosis told in vast, sweeping strokes involving one-sixth of humanity and great pivots of politics and economics.\u201d With Age of Ambition Osnos set out to remind readers that China\u2019s \u201cdeepest changes were intimate and perceptual.\u201d In other words, individuals were driving the change, and Osnos aimed to get to know some of them.\n\nOsnos introduces readers to Gong Hainan, the daughter of a farmer who, thanks to a dating website that she built and that made her a centimillionaire, propelled her \u201cfrom the assembly line to the boardroom so fast\u201d that she never had time \u201cto shed the manners and anxieties of the village\u201d she came from. Notable here is that China is full of these up-from-nothing stories as a consequence of economic freedom, so much so that Osnos sees its transformation as similar to the one that took place in the U.S. in the second half of the 19th century, during which time, according to Osnos, America went from fewer than twenty millionaires in 1850 to forty thousand by 1900.\n\nThere\u2019s Lin Yifu, who left a promising future in Taiwan by swimming from Quemoy to the mainland in 1979, only to become a prominent, University of Chicago-educated economist. Osnos writes that Lin \u201chad thrived in the People\u2019s Republic by becoming its most ardent economic spokesman.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s Han Han, who became the bestselling writer of \u201cteen angst\u201d novels, but who morphed into a government critic. It\u2019s Han, and other government critics (dissidents) like the globally renowned artist Ai WeiWei and blind political activist Chen Guangcheng (ultimately allowed/forced to move to the United States) that most interest Osnos. No doubt his descriptions of them, and of their struggles (WeiWei and Guangcheng much more than Han) unearthed reasonable skepticism on the part of the author about the country he spent so many years in. The censoring of them, the jailing of them, is all a reminder that a country that becomes more economically free by the day isn't always personally free. There are limits.\n\nAlong these lines, Osnos describes the evolution of Lin Gu, a formerly \u201cwell-connected reporter and self-described social butterfly\u201d who ultimately gave up all of his status to pursue Buddhist austerity. Despite being an important reporter, it all ultimately exhausted him. As he put it to Osnos, \u201cyou don\u2019t feel satisfied with the professionalism of your stories, and you envy your Western colleagues who can focus on the writing itself.\u201d Western journalists are free, while in China they\u2019re not.\n\nThis is all briefly mentioned in consideration of an introspective moment (or moments) that Osnos had in the writing Age of Ambition. He wondered on the printed page if his focus on the romanticized dissidents wasn\u2019t hiding a much bigger, and arguably happier story. In his own words, \u201cthe most famous image in China in the past thirty years was not of its economic rise but of the man standing in front of the tank near Tiananmen Square.\u201d Osnos saw the flaw there given his acknowledgment that foreigners could \u201cspend years in China without ever interviewing someone who had been tortured or locked up without trial.\u201d Translated, for the vast majority of Chinese citizens life is much freer, living standards exponentially higher, and the government itself somewhat of an afterthought. The rare dissident was largely \u201cunknown to ordinary Chinese citizens,\u201d and was much better known \u201cin New York or Paris.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a long way of saying that Osnos didn\u2019t run from the basic truth that in reporting on China for the New Yorker, he in a sense was playing to a crowd that likely wasn't Chinese. His conclusion, that \u201cPopularity always struck me as an odd way to measure the importance of an idea in a country that censored ideas,\u201d perhaps doesn\u2019t answer the bigger question: how bad or good is it in China? Leaving aside how incredibly poor the countryside remains, is it largely free and getting better, or not? To read Osnos, and to visit China, is to conclude that the people are much better off in all ways. No doubt there are problems, no doubt there are abuses of people, and no doubt China isn\u2019t the United States, but has it ever come far! It says here that it\u2019s too bad the most enduring image is that of the individual blocking the tank at Tiananmen. It should instead be a picture of Shanhghai\u2019s skyline, the very picture on the cover of Osnos\u2019s book. More than critics want to admit, it symbolizes the awe-inspiring escape for hundreds of millions from immense want on the best day, and death on the worst.\n\nNone of this is to say that Osnos\u2019s reporting on Ai WeiWei and Chen Guangcheng and others wasn\u2019t fascinating, but it seems the more representative example of what China\u2019s really like comes from stories about people like Gong Hainan. And a glorious story it is.\n\nEasily the most heart-rending story was the one Osnos told about Little YueYue. Without going into major detail, Little, 2-year old YueYue walked out of her parents\u2019 storefront in 2011 only to be hit by a truck. As she lay lifeless on the ground, cameras caught eighteen+ people passing by without stopping to aid the still-breathing baby. Little YueYue ultimately died, but Osnos recounts the story for it unearthing sole-searching on the part of the Chinese people well away from Foshan. Had they become too focused on profits and wealth to care about Little YueYue? Osnos seemed to conclude that, but my own analysis ran counter. The horrid story was a reminder of how cheap life is in poor countries, and China remains poor.\n\nIt\u2019s in rich countries that people have time to care, that they have the means to pay for all manner of car seats, airbags and supervision so that kids can be safer. When poverty is still the norm, people don\u2019t have as much time to worry about the Little YueYues in the world. It\u2019s a long way of speculating that if what happened to her had happened in the wildly rich U.S., someone would have done something. Quickly. Better yet, Little YueYue would have had a babysitter watching her, or been in daycare only to have someone watching her. Though it\u2019s popular within the chattering classes to disdain the profit motive, it\u2019s so very compassionate. Osnos ultimately seems to agree after giving voice to those who blamed the rising worship of wealth on what happened. As he concludes, \u201cFor all the atomizing effects of the market age, the culture of giving was not shrinking, it was growing. Private philanthropic organizations, which had been shuttered or taken over by the Party, were returning.\u201d Capitalism is compassionate. Very much so.\n\nTo this, some readers will reply \u201cwhat about the Uighurs?\u201d The answer is that Osnos doesn\u2019t spend much time on them, or on Tibet for that matter. That\u2019s not a critique, even though it would be interesting to hear his thoughts, or what he knows. About a third of the way through he does reference a reply about Tibet that came from Tang Jie, one of the many interesting people Osnos featured, and who is an ardent Chinese nationalist. About Tibet, Osnos observed that \u201cTang couldn\u2019t figure out why foreigners were so agitated\u201d about it, so much so that they might boycott the 2008 Olympic Games that were staged in Beijing. Tang\u2019s view was that boycotting the Beijing games \u201cin the name of Tibet seemed as logical to him as shunning the Salt Lake City Olympics to protest America\u2019s treatment of the Cherokee.\u201d Touche?\n\nWere there disappointments with this excellent book, or quibbles? Not many, as Osnos combines a love of reporting with a beautiful writing style. Still, on occasion he slid into economic fallacy. Early in the book he wrote that \u201cChinese leaders kept their currency undervalued, which made exports cheap.\u201d That\u2019s not true. China, like so many countries around the world, imports U.S. dollar policy; as in the policies of the U.S. Treasury. When the dollar is rising, so is the yuan. When it\u2019s weakening, so is the yuan.\n\nImplicit in the false notion that the Chinese currency is undervalued is that money\u2019s value is supposed rise as a country\u2019s economic fortunes do. If so, how disastrous for economic growth. Indeed, who would take on debt, and more important who would invest, if the value of the debt and the true value of investments were set to surge and/or bounce around throughout time? More realistically, money is just a measure. Goodness, the dollar had basically the same price from 1789 to 1933.\n\nAfter that, an \u201cundervalued\u201d yuan or falling yuan would in no way make exports cheap despite what most economists believe, what Osnos believes, and yes, what President Trump believes. To think as they do is to think that one could become tall and fast by simply shrinking the foot while elongating the second. More realistically, debased money can\u2019t hide or alter reality any more than a corrupted second or foot could. If the Chinese were keeping their currency undervalued, this would reveal itself through rising costs of production, rising wages, rising shipping costs, and reduced investment in production; investment easily the biggest driver of falling prices. Yet who would invest in new ideas that, if they result in monetary returns, would come back in currency that has shrunken in value? The currency argument is a false one.\n\nLater in the book, Osnos cited increased expenditure by the government on railroad construction as a way to \u201cward off the global recession.\u201d How could that be? By Osnos\u2019s own admission, a shrinkage of the overbearing government in favor of more economic freedom had resulted in staggering plenty for the people. How then, would expropriation and allocation of precious resources created by those same people result in greater economic growth? Certainly Osnos agrees that desperation was what emerged from a government that controlled nearly all the resources created by the people. In that case, why would he think that what doesn\u2019t work in total, works in limited fashion?\n\nIn the book\u2019s final third, Osnos referenced upward mobility as taking place on a train that had \u201ca limited number of seats,\u201d except that Osnos's own book proves the opposite. And in major way. As he notes early on, the changes ushered in by Deng Xiaoping and others \u201cunleashed the greatest expansion of human potential in world history.\u201d When there\u2019s freedom, the size of the train migrating upward is somewhat limitless.\n\nOsnos added that perhaps the soaring income gap needed a government response in the form of an introduction of a capital gains and/or inheritance tax. This read as a non sequitur. Osnos knows well from China\u2019s past, along with the Soviet Union\u2019s past, that a lot of government control results in death and deprivation. He knows that even now the state in China is overbearing. Why then would he support any kind of reform that would empower the state more? It\u2019s a long way of asking why, in consideration of all that Osnos has seen up close, he\u2019s not more libertarian? And for those who say the \u201cincome gap\u201d is what makes him favorable to state action, they might rethink such a view by reading Age of Ambition itself. They may because the recurring theme in it is of a country increasingly defined by plenty, where more and more people are tasting the fruits of progress. Yes they are. When people get rich, that\u2019s the surest sign that they\u2019re mass producing former luxuries. People are eating, and enjoying soaring living standards, and they are as a consequence of the economically unequal that can increasingly be found in China.\n\nSo while Osnos occasionally slid into conventional economic thought, he very often didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s something. More important, he wrote a wondrous book that this reviewer will be referencing for a very long time. I can't wait for his next.\n\nWhich brings us to the question about the Communist Party. Will it win out over freedom? My answer is no, and my sense is that Osnos would agree. As he points out halfway through, \u201cthe Internet had long ago exceeded\u201d what the censors could handle, and it was growing faster by the day. At best, censors were chasing after information the speed of which was soaring. In the words of Osnos, \u201cwords were being expressed first and censored second.\u201d The Party will lose. Freedom will win. China\u2019s story will get better and better, and it will improve despite occasional hiccups like Hong Kong. Capitalism is too fast for the controlling in government. Read the remarkable Age of Ambition to see why it's moving too fast in China.", "description": "In 1975, Hedrick Smith released The Russians.
