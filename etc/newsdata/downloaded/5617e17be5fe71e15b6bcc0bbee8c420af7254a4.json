But it was another part of the audio\u2014the part where he shared his secret for evading culpability\u2014that truly revealed the underpinnings of his worldview.\n\n\u201cWhen you're a star,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey let you do it.\u201d\n\nAs the inheritor of a major real estate enterprise, Trump has been a star\u2014more or less\u2014since the day he was born. And he has expanded on that stardom throughout his career, even managing to be a headline-grabber when his fortune vanished and his marriages crumbled. Through it all, they let him do it. The banks with which he did business bailed him out; the newspapers that recognized the hollowness of his self-constructed image ran his tips; the network that had incriminating recordings of him off-camera on his top-rated show kept them secret.\n\nOne of the great gambles Trump made was that this particular brand of stardom could be translated into politics. And, largely, he was right. No one in the Republican Party stood up to him as he championed the birther movement. No one in the party took him on directly as he launched his campaign railing about Mexicans being rapists. And though Republicans reacted in horror to his mocking of John McCain, Megyn Kelly, a gold star mother, and the Billy Bush tape, they eventually got over it\u2014as Trump knew they would. He was, after all, their star. They\u2019d let him do it.\n\nBut being president has proven fundamentally challenging to that basic life ethos. And if Trump needed proof of that, it has come this week in what can only be described as the most harrowing and dangerous moment of his presidency.\n\nTrump is on track to be impeached. In doing so, he will become just the fourth person to occupy his office who has ever faced that fate.\n\nThat, of course, would be alarming in and of itself. But it is the manner in which it is all transpiring that must be proving so unnerving and unfamiliar to him. A whistleblower from within his administration has decided to speak out about\u2014what appear at first blush to be\u2014illegal and unscrupulous acts involving the president calling a foreign leader, encouraging him to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, and then having the record of that conversation hid away.\n\nThe contents of the complaint were not just produced by one alarmed person choosing to speak out, however. Instead, they were described and detailed to the whistleblower by several White House aides who, it is presumed, shared similar fears.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump\u2019s own director of national intelligence affirmed that the complaint was credible. He also called the crisis presented before the country unprecedented, leaving the impression that he too was a bit shaken by the totality of it all.\n\nThat same morning, videos of Trump\u2019s speech to the U.S. mission at the United Nations and his address to a private fundraiser at a swank Manhattan restaurant were both quickly leaked to the press. And not because they showed the president in a fine light. Instead, he was caught ruminating about his desire to see the whistleblower executed like treasonous spies in days of old. That night, Trump\u2019s private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, ran one of the more harebrained CYA moves in recent memory by sharing text messages implicating the State Department in the president\u2019s scheme to pressure the Ukrainians. And by the next day, the official whom he was texting\u2014Trump\u2019s envoy to Ukraine\u2014quit.\n\nBefore then, came other revelations: that Trump had records of his call with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman hidden and that he\u2019d casually mentioned to his \u201cChina whisperer\u201d that he\u2019d like to see if he too could get Biden dirt. And later that evening came, perhaps, the most alarming news break of all. The Washington Post published another story on another private meeting with another set of world leaders\u2014this time involving Trump telling senior Russian officials that he was unconcerned about Moscow\u2019s meddling in 2016 elections.\n\nThere have been famous leaks before, including many of far more significance and historical weight than these. But rarely has a president been so under siege from within. For Trump\u2014who is used to living in an insular world created by his media ingenuity and relentless efforts at self-promotion\u2014the lack of control must feel petrifying.\n\nAnd yet, the threats from within are the ones that are easier to handle right now. It\u2019s those coming from outside the White House that are existential. Though some Trumpworld figures may believe otherwise, House Democrats are not bluffing in their impeachment push. They are firm in their desire to see it done and to see it done with as much pain applied to the president as they can muster.\n\nJust on Friday, they demanded records from Trump\u2019s budget office as to why it delayed congressionally authorized military aid payments to Ukraine and subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for answers about what Foggy Bottom knew about Rudy\u2019s travails. There are plans to talk in closed session to the inspector general of the Intelligence Community and to bring Kurt Volker, the recently resigned U.S. special representative for Ukraine, in as well. Eventually, they will come asking for the documents we now know Trump tried to hide. And if he doesn\u2019t disclose them, it will be portrayed\u2014perhaps accurately\u2014as a cover-up.\n\nFaced with this mortal threat, Trump\u2019s plan seems to be to simply tweet through it. A senior White House official told The Daily Beast that he explicitly said he doesn\u2019t want a war room created to handle impeachment. And even if he did, who would staff it? Many of the people initially brought into the White House have left on poor terms. And those who would be comfortable being brought back are not trusted. It\u2019s not surprising that the source for Friday night\u2019s story in The Post was \u201cthree former officials.\u201d\n\nCertainly, Trump may find his way through this. He remains a star, after all, among his base of supporters. And in a Senate run by Republicans worried about being primaried this cycle, that seems like enough to see him through a trial that would follow the House\u2019s impeachment. But even then, this week has provided a jarring and potentially crippling lesson for a president who isn\u2019t particularly keen on making personal adjustment.
