The email showed something called the \u201cDragonfly Futuref\u00f6n,\u201d a kind of computer-phone hybrid. The Futuref\u00f6n\u2019s page showed a sleek, palm-sized touchscreen that slotted into a laptop dock, then folded flat and flipped open again, revealing a second screen and a full-sized laptop keyboard. It could run both Windows and Android, and its creator, a startup called IdealFuture, promised to replace your phone, laptop, and tablet at an incredible price of $799. Dubious but intrigued, Tschiltsch put down a $200 deposit.\n\nFive years later, Tschiltsch still wouldn\u2019t have a Futuref\u00f6n. Instead, he\u2019d be sitting in an Illinois courthouse testifying at the behest of the FBI, which claimed the device was the last step in a decade-long fraud operation that cost victims nearly $6 million. \u201cI always thought it was ambitious,\u201d Tschiltsch says now. \u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to me that the guy had just taken the money.\u201d\n\nTschiltsch is just one of many angry Indiegogo backers who say Futuref\u00f6n creator Jeff Batio strung them along with lies, excuses, and faked product updates. But the backers aren\u2019t just angry with Batio. They\u2019re frustrated by how easily a scammer could flourish in the high-risk world of gadget crowdfunding \u2014 and how poorly Indiegogo was equipped to deal with it.\n\nAccording to its crowdfunding campaign, the Dragonfly Futuref\u00f6n was a convertible, dual-screened notebook meant to dramatically simplify computing. Its \u201cSlingshot\u201d section was a 7-inch Android phone with a stylus, but that was only one part of the device. That phone plugged into a split-hinged keyboard base, which was also equipped with a slide-out touchpad, a second 7-inch display, a dockable Bluetooth headset, and a separate battery and processor.\n\nThe device was modular: you could use both pieces separately, or you could plug the phone into the base and get a dual-display laptop that looked like two tiny netbooks. (An optional upgrade added \u201cWin-Droid\u201d capability, which let the laptop section run either Windows or Android.) The combined effect was simultaneously cute and futuristic, especially with an eye-catching clip-on cover. Batio \u2014 in a quote attributed to himself on the Indiegogo page \u2014 declared it as nothing less than \u201ca mobile metamorphosis.\u201d\n\nFuturef\u00f6n backer Rebecca Pillinger was blown away by the renderings. \u201cThis just sounded like an amazing product,\u201d she says. She\u2019d never owned a smartphone, her tablet had recently broken, and she loved her dual-screen desktop setup at work. Wrapping all three devices into one $800 package sounded fantastic.\n\nFans of straightforward computing might find a three-in-one transforming dual-screen laptop ridiculous. But in 2014, lots of major electronics companies were chasing similar ideas. In 2011, Motorola had released a full-sized laptop shell for its Atrix Android phone called the Lapdock. The 2013 Razer Edge was a high-powered laptop that doubled as a handheld gaming console. The 2012 Asus PadFone was a 4-inch phone that fit completely inside of a 10-inch tablet that paired with a laptop-style keyboard and an electronic stylus, which was also a wireless headset. The same year as the Futuref\u00f6n campaign, Asus announced an even more ambitious five-in-one Android / Windows phone / laptop / tablet at Computex, although the idea never made it to market.\n\nA convertible laptop seemed downright staid when you could earn $23,000 with a mind-reading headset for dogs\n\nCrowdfunded gadgets, meanwhile, were taking the world by storm. Facebook had just acquired the crowdfunded Oculus Rift virtual reality headset for $2 billion. More than 85,000 people had backed a surprisingly good smartwatch called the Pebble. A company had raised $13 million to build a tricked-out, high-tech cooler. If you could earn $23,000 by promising a mind-reading headset for dogs, selling an $800 convertible laptop was downright staid.\n\nThe Futuref\u00f6n wasn\u2019t a sure bet \u2014 but to many backers, it seemed like a calculated risk. \u201cThis will probably never see the light of day, but it\u2019s too cool not to back for $200,\u201d thought Tschiltsch. Pillinger figured she could only afford the Futuref\u00f6n at its early-bird Indiegogo price, not its full retail cost. \u201cThe worst thing I thought could happen was that they would have set out with the honest intention of producing the phone, but procrastinate and not get around to putting the work in,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Indiegogo campaign was designed to allay those doubts. IdealFuture portrayed Batio as an entrepreneur who\u2019d been building exotic personal computing hardware for decades. Its Indiegogo page touted a \u201cmulti-display transforming laptop\u201d he\u2019d unveiled in 2002, called the Xentex Flip-Pad Voyager. Social media VP Bridget Hogan claimed in an interview that IdealFuture already had a US-based manufacturer, allowing it to ship the Futuref\u00f6n within six months. After Tschiltsch tweeted doubts about the project, he remembers, someone from IdealFuture reached out to say they had \u201ceverything lined up.\u201d\n\nBatio didn\u2019t claim to have vast technical knowledge, but he made up for it with vision. His personal website described him as a \u201cdynamic futurist\u201d \u2014 a term he\u2019d coined for \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t \u2018see\u2019 the future based on studying the trends being created by others, but instead is someone who helps to create the future.\u201d Other dynamic futurists included Thomas Edison and Bill Gates, and an Indiegogo promotional video compared IdealFuture to Rosa Parks and the Tiananmen Square protesters.\n\nA closer look at Batio and IdealFuture might have raised several red flags. IdealFuture had posted reams of 3D models but virtually no pictures of actual hardware \u2014 a practice that Kickstarter had banned two years earlier, but Indiegogo had not. The Dragonfly Futuref\u00f6n\u2019s specs seemed almost impossibly good; its 7-inch phablet weighed precisely as much as the far smaller Samsung Galaxy S5 phone, for instance. And while Batio had been working on experimental computers for decades, he hadn\u2019t actually shipped any \u2014 including a laptop he\u2019d already promised Indiegogo backers in an earlier campaign. His ventures had left a string of disgruntled investors and contractors, some of which might have been ready to talk if anyone called them. But the Futuref\u00f6n raised hundreds of thousands of dollars before anybody picked up the trail.\n\nJeff Batio\u2019s computing dreams started in the late \u201890s when he was struck by the idea of a super foldable, split-screened laptop. Batio filed several patents for his unique design, and around 2000, he founded a company called Xentex to build it.\n\nThe resulting Flip-Pad Voyager was created with help from legendary design firm Frog. It was essentially a dual-monitor portable desktop, folding once like a huge traditional laptop, then again across a split-screen and keyboard for more convenient traveling. Unlike the Futuref\u00f6n, it had no smartphone component, but it still had its share of weird features. In addition to the dual-screen setup, you could use the two panels as a single giant display with a seam down the middle, or you could swivel one to face away from you \u2014 in case, for example, you needed to show somebody else a spreadsheet or slideshow.\n\nThe Voyager received positive (if someone bemused) press coverage when it was announced, even making it to the cover of PC Magazine in 2002. The writeup, which is still online, calls the Flip-Pad Voyager \u201cthe mother of all desktop replacement notebooks,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nBut the device never made it into stores. In Batio\u2019s telling, the Voyager was almost ready to ship when its Korean manufacturing partner went bankrupt, effectively killing the product. But not everyone agrees with that story. A lawsuit from angry investors accused Xentex of hiding serious technical problems that doomed the project. Batio wasn\u2019t a defendant in the lawsuit, but plaintiffs alleged that he\u2019d spent company money on houses and luxury cars, making the company\u2019s financial challenges even harder to overcome.\n\nBatio denied the claims and called the lawsuit a transparent attempt to seize control of the company. He noted that two of the plaintiffs were charged with trying to fraudulently sell Xentex stock, among other offenses. Even so, Xentex dissolved, and the Voyager was never seen again \u2014 except for one semi-functional prototype that appeared on eBay in 2008.\n\nMikal Greaves, who led Frog\u2019s engineering team during the years Xentex was active, believes Batio really had a functional computer. \u201cJeff had money, Frog, and a contract manufacturer, who got him very close to a shippable product,\u201d he says. That didn\u2019t mean the Voyager was commercially viable. The market for a 12-pound, nearly $5,000 portable desktop was always going to be limited. But in Greaves\u2019 opinion, it wasn\u2019t a scam. \u201cCrowdfunding Futuref\u00f6n,\u201d he says, was \u201canother thing altogether.\u201d\n\nBatio bounced back from Xentex\u2019s failure almost immediately, founding a new company called Armada and launching the IdealFuture brand in the early 2010s. His Voyager design morphed into the Radian desktop docking station and the IF Convertible, a transforming laptop that\u2019s nearly identical to the Futuref\u00f6n. IdealFuture brought the IF Convertible to Indiegogo in 2013, where it earned $18,000 from only 33 people. But a year later, the company claimed to have \u201credesigned the entire device,\u201d and it launched its Futuref\u00f6n campaign to far greater success.\n\nThree people who worked with IdealFuture describe being initially fascinated but quickly disillusioned by the project \u2014 and losing thousands of dollars in the process. Realtor and musician Ryan Farhood says he invested $10,000 in IdealFuture and worked on a song for the company. (The jingle was sadly lost to history.) A friend had vouched for Batio, and Farhood was impressed enough to share the Futuref\u00f6n design with a connection at chip-making giant Qualcomm. But when Qualcomm was unenthusiastic and Farhood started asking hard questions about the project, he claims, his relationship with Batio soured. \u201cEverything was pure pose. There were no prototypes. There was no working, functional model,\u201d says Farhood. \u201cToo bad I\u2019d already deposited the money.\u201d\n\nWeb designer Allison Sugahara met Batio through a business partner who\u2019d gone to school with Batio\u2019s \u201cVP of Social Media\u201d Bridget Hogan. (Three sources describe Hogan as Batio\u2019s only long-term employee.) \u201cHe was really compelling and got us really excited for the project,\u201d she says, and Sugahara stayed up all weekend building the site on a tough deadline. But when she tried to collect the $2,000 fee, Batio claimed he was strapped for cash. The phone number she\u2019d been given stopped working, and her company was left with a $150 first payment and a certificate for 50,000 shares of IdealFuture stock.\n\nA friend of Sugahara, who asked to be identified only as Chris, ended up in a similar situation. He\u2019d toured Batio\u2019s apartment building for a crowdfunded film he was shooting, and Batio had offered him much-needed work making videos for the first Indiegogo campaign. \u201cWhen he said something, he said it to the point where you were like \u2014 wow, is it here right now? This sounds amazing,\u201d says Chris. But Batio kept putting off his invoices, and when the second campaign rolled around, Chris finally gave up on getting paid.\n\nFuturef\u00f6n backers in 2014 seemingly didn\u2019t look too closely into IdealFuture\u2019s background, and neither did reporters. Where the IF Convertible had gotten little press, the Futuref\u00f6n attracted attention from several tech sites \u2014 even CNBC, which featured the device in a crowdfunding \u201cface off\u201d article. The coverage was skeptical but generally polite, taking the company\u2019s claims in good faith while noting that IdealFuture was probably aiming way too high.\n\nBut there was one place where the Futuref\u00f6n wasn\u2019t just a cool oddity: r/ShittyKickstarters, a Reddit forum for discussing shady crowdfunding campaigns. \u201cThe \u2018Dragonfly\u2019, a fake device that will never work, is nearing $500,000!\u201d a member posted in late 2014. \u201cEnding today. Recap in comments. I\u2019m dying inside.\u201d\n\nOther members gleefully vivisected IdealFuture\u2019s product. \u201cIt\u2019s like they found a list of recent things that are \u2018hot\u2019 in technology and just put them into a blender,\u201d wrote one person. Others tried to pin down the backers\u2019 psychology: \u201cTechnology is magic. This sound magic-er-er. So they throw money at it.\u201d A few simply cracked jokes about Batio\u2019s inspirational quotes. \u201cAny fool can make something complicated. It is hard to make something simple,\u201d one pronouncement claimed. A Shitty Kickstarters poster quipped back: \u201cNow I understand the vision behind the two-tablet-split-keyboard-bluetooth-docking-sort-of-Android-sort-of-Windows-sort-of-laptop/tablet/phone device.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo make a device like that would be like making a new car line, like making a Tesla. Or like making an iPad.\u201d\n\nThe community was hooked. \u201cFrom the start, you could tell that it was completely wrong,\u201d says one member, who goes by the username Otidder. \u201cIt looked tacky, the specifications were completely overblown. Like, there was no way they were going to be able to sell this thing at the price that they said they would.\u201d Google searches pulled up Xentex\u2019s legal drama and the stalled IF Convertible campaign, cementing skeptics\u2019 conviction that the Futuref\u00f6n would never ship. A member even discovered that somebody else had built an almost identical-looking laptop called the Dragonfly back in 2009.\n\nThe original Dragonfly\u2019s creator could have warned backers that IdealFuture wouldn\u2019t deliver. Like Batio, MIT graduate Ed Bullister started filing laptop patents as a side project in the \u201890s. (According to Bullister, the two have never met, and Bullister only learned about the Futuref\u00f6n when a Redditor contacted him.) He eventually produced a mechanical mock-up to show manufacturers and investors.\n\nBut the more people Bullister spoke to, the less feasible a custom-built folding laptop seemed. \u201cEverything has to be new. The display is a non-standard size. The keyboard is probably the easiest thing \u2014 but that has to be split in half, and you\u2019ve got a lot of wires that have to go across the hinges,\u201d he tells The Verge. \u201cIt was a huge project.\u201d One adviser said it would cost $100 million to bring to market.\n\nPlenty of crowdfunding companies set unrealistic goals or hit intractable technical snags. But Bullister doesn\u2019t think a campaign like IdealFuture\u2019s, with its massive promises and comparatively tiny budget, could possibly be launched in good faith. \u201cTo make a device like that would be like making a new car line, like making a Tesla. Or like making an iPad,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond \u2018fake it till you make it.\u2019 It\u2019s like, I\u2019m either so clueless that I shouldn\u2019t be in the business, or \u2014 I just think this is a fraud.\u201d\n\nDespite all this, IdealFuture cruised past its minuscule $10,000 goal, taking in nearly $650,000 by the campaign\u2019s December end date and continuing to raise money through Indiegogo\u2019s brand-new InDemand feature. IdealFuture posted flurries of updates at first, boasting about hiring a new engineering team and working on a functional prototype. But slowly, backers like Tschiltsch started to lose faith. \u201cThey were really active on their Indiegogo campaign. They were always posting updates and showing stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was all mockups all the time.\u201d\n\nMembers of r/ShittyKickstarters, who had created a dedicated subreddit for the Futuref\u00f6n, started welcoming newly minted skeptics. In mid-2016, they finally found what seemed like clear evidence of fraud.\n\nIdealFuture had posted a video of Bridget Hogan walking around Los Gatos, California, with the latest Futuref\u00f6n mock-up. Critics pored over the footage, convinced it was a trick. Somebody spotted a 2014 date on one screenshot and called it out, but Batio convincingly shut the claim down, saying that his filmmaker had just pulled an old image from Google. Then, some remarkably determined Redditors zoomed in on two chalkboard signs in the background of the shots. They cross-referenced the promotional deals with announcements on Facebook, only to find matching posts from 2014 \u2014 before the campaign had even closed.\n\nBy that point, many backers had already given up on the Futuref\u00f6n. \u201cAt first, it seemed like a project that got away from them,\u201d says Leland Babitch, one of the backers. \u201cBut as it went on, the updates really had this tone of a coverup \u2014 you know, sort of giving just enough to keep people going and feel like they weren\u2019t being cheated out of their money. \u2026 And then they just stopped.\u201d IdealFuture posted one last update in July 2016, claiming to have found a manufacturing partner. Then, the page went dark forever.\n\n\u201cThe updates really had this tone of a coverup.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Tschiltsch figured IdealFuture was just the latest of several crowdfunding startups whose dreams had been too big for reality. By the summer of 2016, Kickstarter and Indiegogo gadgets seemed like clearly risky propositions. The impossibly thin CST-01 watch had proven virtually impossible to manufacture. The unique YotaPhone smartphone saw \u201cunforeseen delays\u201d and initially failed to ship in the US. The Coolest Cooler, once hailed as a Kickstarter success story, had been dubbed one of crowdfunding\u2019s biggest disasters after serious delays. \u201cI just sort of wrote it off,\u201d says Tschiltsch. He\u2019d almost forgotten about the project by 2018 \u2014 when an FBI agent called him up.\n\nThe agent told Tschiltsch that \u201cthere was this case they\u2019d been working on \u2014 that it was getting ready to go to trial,\u201d and he started asking about the Futuref\u00f6n. What had Tschiltsch expected to get when he backed the campaign? Why had he done it? What did he think about IdealFuture\u2019s long string of updates? After Tschiltsch answered the questions, the agent invited him to testify in court.\n\nIdealFuture, it turned out, hadn\u2019t just disappeared. Batio had been indicted on fraud charges that spanned 13 years, from Armada\u2019s early days to the last Indiegogo updates. And the alleged total profits were far higher than even IdealFuture\u2019s biggest skeptics imagined: in addition to the $725,000 he\u2019d gotten for the Futuref\u00f6n, he\u2019d supposedly collected $5 million from Armada investors, a fundraising venture that now seemed like fraud.\n\n\u201cMr. Batio worked consistently and against the odds to realize his products.\u201d\n\nIt was a genuinely surprising development. The government had cracked down on crowdfunding campaigns before, starting in 2015, when the Federal Trade Commission went after the creator of a board game called The Doom That Came to Atlantic City. But \u201ccaveat emptor\u201d was still a central principle of crowdfunding \u2014 and the line between a scam and an honest failure could be difficult to find.\n\nThe case finally went to trial a year later. Tschiltsch testified, as did Farhood and several other backers and former associates. (Hogan, who many Futuref\u00f6n skeptics also considered a scammer, did not appear or testify at the trial.) A jury convicted Batio of 12 mail and wire fraud counts, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for September.\n\nBatio has strongly disputed the allegations against him, saying that Armada was close to shipping a product and IdealFuture was on track to deliver the Futuref\u00f6n. He asked for a new trial after the conviction, claiming that the jury had refused to discuss vital information and that the court had denied a critical witness request. The government, he said, was attempting to \u201ccriminalize failure\u201d \u2014 presenting normal startup setbacks as evidence of fraud. \u201cThe government misunderstood and misrepresented the product development process,\u201d reads the filing. \u201cMr. Batio worked consistently and against the odds to realize his products.\u201d\n\nToday, some of IdealFuture\u2019s backers acknowledge that they were looking at the Futuref\u00f6n through rose-colored glasses. \u201cI was quite new and na\u00efve regarding crowdfunding,\u201d says backer Aur\u00e9lien Cornil, who believed in IdealFuture\u2019s good intentions until the very end. \u201cI thought I could trust the people posting projects and that Indiegogo checked the projects it hosted.\u201d But they\u2019re also angry at Indiegogo. While Batio clearly didn\u2019t need crowdfunding to raise millions of dollars, it helped him reach a huge audience in a short period of time. And during that time, numerous people seemingly reached out with complaints \u2014 only to be ignored or put off.\n\nOne Redditor claimed to have flagged the Futuref\u00f6n back in 2014, saying Indiegogo\u2019s support staff had promised to review it. In reality, Indiegogo let IdealFuture keep raising money until a month after the final update in 2016, even as angry backers berated the platform in comments. \u201cI felt bad for some of the backers, because they were clearly in way over their heads,\u201d says Otidder. \u201cIndiegogo really needs to shoulder some of the responsibility here \u2014 because they\u2019re the ones giving a platform to these people.\u201d A detailed 2016 expos\u00e9 of the Futuref\u00f6n emphasized that crowdfunding scams were rare but called them an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the system. \u201cIf Indiegogo sweeps this under the rug, they are sending a signal to the market that fraudulent campaigns will never have any consequences,\u201d wrote the author.\n\nPillinger says she doesn\u2019t expect Indiegogo to police every campaign for potential fraud, but the platform\u2019s promotional email felt like a stamp of approval. \u201cI think the reason it didn\u2019t occur to me that the Futuref\u00f6n might be a scam was precisely that it was promoted by Indiegogo,\u201d says Pillinger. \u201cI would have exercised more skepticism if I had come across it just searching their site, or promoted by a stranger on Twitter, for example.\u201d Indiegogo even tweeted a fresh ad for the Futuref\u00f6n in 2016 while IdealFuture was fielding constant inquiries about its failure to deliver.\n\nIndiegogo declined to be interviewed for this story, but a spokesperson says campaigns are currently evaluated by its trust team before being promoted. \u201cWe have evolved and learned from our past campaigns to improve and protect our backer community,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cSomebody has an idea, and all that person needs is media.\u201d\n\nBut the problems with Futuref\u00f6n may have been bigger than crowdfunding platforms. Tech media rewards interesting concepts all the time \u2014 even when they almost certainly won\u2019t work, like a bracelet that projects a working smartphone on your forearm or the aforementioned dog mind-reading kit. In that context, the Futuref\u00f6n hype just didn\u2019t seem that strange. \u201cSomebody has an idea, and all that person needs is media,\u201d says Farhood. \u201cLike, hey, look at this cool video! I know it\u2019s not a real working prototype. But look how cool this cool video is!\u201d Even if sites don\u2019t endorse a product, they\u2019re helping it spread \u2014 and a few people might decide it\u2019s worth throwing a few (or a few hundred) dollars at it.\n\nHardware crowdfunding is still a huge market. After the early exuberance and the inevitable fallout, Kickstarter and Indiegogo are trying to make the whole process less risky, even if that means dramatically changing how their services work. But for some of the Futuref\u00f6n\u2019s backers, these sites\u2019 sheen is long gone. \u201cI kind of soured on it now,\u201d says Tschiltsch, who also backed the Pebble smartwatch, the Coolest Cooler, and the failed CST-01. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to vet, with the information you\u2019re given on these websites, for any kind of real complex hardware project.\u201d He\u2019s still backing campaigns, but he sticks to more achievable creative projects like animated horror film To Your Last Death, which is currently set for a US premiere next month.\n\nBabitch says that when he realized IdealFuture was a fraud and not just a failure, it just didn\u2019t bother him that much. \u201cI also, probably at the same time, realized that a lot of the stuff I have gotten really hasn\u2019t been all that interesting,\u201d he says. While a device like the Futuref\u00f6n might be exotic, mainstream products like the Microsoft Surface \u2014 a convertible tablet that can functionally replace a laptop \u2014 are a lot more usable.\n\nBut he concedes that getting scammed didn\u2019t keep him away from crowdfunding. \u201cI probably still haven\u2019t learned my lesson. I like technology. I like cool things,\u201d he says. \u201cI like having gadgets.\u201d", "description": "The IdealFuture Dragonfly Futuref\u00f6n seemed too good to be true.
