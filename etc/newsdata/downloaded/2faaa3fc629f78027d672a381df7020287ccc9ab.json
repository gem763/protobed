As solid as the walls to the new factory might seem, the company behind them \u2014 Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn \u2014 has repeatedly backtracked on ambitious visions that attracted billions of dollars in state incentives. Foxconn assures that it will meet the original employment target for the project, but Gov. Tony Evers (D) has said he doesn\u2019t think vows to hire thousands of new workers will ever be fulfilled. And experts maintain the entire strategy makes little sense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the U.S. economy teetering between sunny predictions of greater growth and dark fears of a recession to come, the fate of this factory \u2014 and all it represents \u2014 is wobbling right alongside.\n\nFew places in America have more riding on which way the winds ultimately blow. Long a political bellwether \u2014 the surrounding county of Racine voted for President Barack Obama twice before flipping to Trump \u2014 this area is now an economic one, too.\n\nThe question of whether the Foxconn factory will be a boon or a bust has split the community, with neighbors, friends and relatives divided. The fault lines run less between supporters and opponents than between true believers and reluctant skeptics. Just about everyone wants Foxconn to succeed, but not everyone is convinced it will.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis area desperately needs the investment. There\u2019s nothing here anymore,\u201d said Tom Johnston, a 54-year-old veteran of the area\u2019s once-vaunted manufacturing sector.\n\nAD\n\nYet Johnston, who owns an upscale gift shop on a struggling Main Street in the city of Racine, has little faith that Foxconn will bring salvation: \u201cI hope to God it happens, but I think it\u2019s all a crock.\u201d\n\nDirectly across the street, Ken Brown has no such doubts. He has lived here for decades and has seen his once-prosperous community pummeled as factories fled, stores shuttered and unemployment spiked. Foxconn, he said, will change all of that.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that one of the best places in America to be born was Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d said Brown, who owns an eyewear shop and is active in local Republican politics. \u201cI expect that to be true again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was that promise of a return to greatness that has propelled the project since its inception \u2014 and attracted Trump\u2019s enthusiastic support.\n\n\u201cThis is a great day for American workers and manufacturers and for everyone who believes in the concept and the label, \u2018Made in the USA,\u2019 \u201d Trump told reporters at the official unveiling of the project in the East Room of the White House in July 2017.\n\nAD\n\nA year later, he was on site in Wisconsin for the groundbreaking, hailing a factory that he said would restore \u201cAmerica\u2019s industrial might.\u201d\n\nThe lofty rhetoric reflected the grand scale of Foxconn\u2019s plans, which were negotiated under former governor Scott Walker (R). The company would create 13,000 jobs and pay its workers $53,000 a year, plus benefits, to work at a $10 billion facility covering 20 million square feet. The factory would do something that no other company has dared attempt: produce state-of-the-art, giant LCD screens in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIn video promotions, Foxconn showcased what appeared to be an entire city\u2019s worth of futuristic, Silicon Valley-esque glitz rising from the flatlands of southeast Wisconsin.\n\nThe vision was alluring enough to win the company over $4 billion in tax and other incentives from the state and local governments, including vital infrastructure work \u2014 the largest such package ever given to a foreign firm in U.S. history. (The previous record was $1.65 billion.)\n\nAD\n\nYet, almost from the start, Foxconn\u2019s behavior has raised questions about whether it intends to follow through.\n\nPlans to produce giant screens were swapped with smaller ones. At one point, the company appeared to scrap the factory idea altogether before a phone call from Trump prompted another abrupt pivot. All along, hiring has lagged far behind what was forecast.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery couple of months there\u2019s been a different plan,\u201d said Steven Deller, an economist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cFirst it was 13,000 jobs. Now it might be 1,000 jobs. They\u2019ve really scaled back on what they plan to do.\u201d\n\nEven the start of construction has raised doubts rather than allay them, he said. The structure now emerging bears little resemblance to the model of 21st-century, high-tech manufacturing that was promised.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis was supposed to be the future,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it just looks like a big warehouse.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed response, Foxconn said it remains committed to its original hiring and investment pledges while acknowledging that some plans have shifted.\n\nAD\n\nThe company said it intends to begin producing technology in the 1-million-square-foot facility now under construction by late next year. But it is vague about its exact plans for the rest of the 20-million-square-foot site, saying its development is \u201ca process that will be carried out over a number of years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a complex project and while timelines have been adjusted to address a range of internal and external factors, Foxconn has never wavered from our commitment to our contract with the State of Wisconsin and the creation of 13,000 jobs as part of our broader effort to make the Badger state a global technology hub,\u201d the company said.\n\nAD\n\nBut Deller said that Foxconn\u2019s original plans always lacked grounding in economic reality: The factory was too far from its supply chains, and the promised number of jobs was far too high in the age of automation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were promising more than they could deliver,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnston, the gift shop owner, said he had that instinct the moment he heard about the project.\n\nHis father was a lifelong machinist, and he had worked in factory management and sales. He wanted to believe that Racine could get back to the manufacturing glory days of the 1970s when, he said, \u201cthis whole city smelled like metal.\u201d\n\nBut the Foxconn project always struck him as a fantasy. \u201cWe don\u2019t make electronic anything in the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nTo backers, changing that is the point.\n\nRacine \u2014 wedged between Milwaukee and Chicago along the shores of Lake Michigan \u2014 was once a hub of innovation, responsible for inventions ranging from the garbage disposal to the panoramic camera. Foxconn gives the community the opportunity to get back to that, said Jonathan Delagrave, Racine county executive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe really have a chance to redefine ourselves,\u201d Delagrave said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be celebrating next summer the return of advanced manufacturing in the United States, and doing it right here in Racine County. It can\u2019t be overstated enough that that\u2019s a really big deal.\u201d\n\nDelagrave was a central figure in the quest to lure Foxconn to Racine, and he has remained resolutely behind the company even as plans have shifted and hiring schedules have slipped. The company\u2019s willingness to adjust, he said, is a virtue, not a vice.\n\n\u201cIf the economy changes and they can\u2019t change with the economy, that\u2019s going to make the project a little more difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gamble on Foxconn has come with a cost. Both the county and the village of Mount Pleasant, where the plant will be located, have had their credit ratings downgraded as they borrow money to finance road, sewer and other infrastructure improvements.\n\nAD\n\nThat, coupled with the company\u2019s shifting stance, has some local officials worried that the community hasn\u2019t adequately prepared for what happens if Foxconn fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThe more you invest in anything, the more exposure you have,\u201d said Nick Demske, a county supervisor. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be a doomsday prophesier. I just want us to be thinking about contingency plans.\u201d\n\nFor many, it\u2019s more appealing to think of the upside. Racine was one of the last places in America to recover from the last recession. The unemployment rate here, about 4.4 percent, remains higher than most of the state, and even those with jobs say their lives feel untouched by the longest economic expansion in the nation\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cEvery month it\u2019s, \u2018Do I pay my electric bill this month or do I pay my phone bill?\u2019 \u201d said Minisha Honeycutt, who supports herself and her two children on the $11 an hour she makes working part time as a nursing assistant.\n\nAs she waited for a bus on Main Street, with the blue waters of Lake Michigan shimmering in the distance, she allowed herself to dream of a day when the factory opens and her life changes for the better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in this situation,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cAnd if Foxconn comes and gives me a chance, I won\u2019t be.\u201d", "description": "Plans to bring a high-tech factory to Wisconsin have repeatedly changed, sowing doubts.", "authors": ["Griff Witte", "Roaming America After Years Overseas In Europe", "The Middle East", "South Asia"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tW2epdqXLIgnWYxUUup7eX_a3Cc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPDFQ6G3FAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
