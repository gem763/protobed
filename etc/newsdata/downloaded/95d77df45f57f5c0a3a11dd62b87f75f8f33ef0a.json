Their (Russia's) identity is probably what you expect with Lyn,\" said former Cardiff Blues head coach Wilson.\n\n\"They are a very good defensive team, their contact area defence is a real handful. Knowing Lyn, he will be heavily involved in coaching that.\n\n\"Their kicking game is pretty astute as well so they are probably the areas we need to be fully aware of.\"\n\nWilson added: \"At times they frustrated Ireland and I think they turned them over eight times, and five of those were around the breakdown. So we know what is coming. We have to get the imprint on the game we want.\"\n\nReflecting on the time he had spent in Jones's company, Wilson said: \"He's great fun, he's got a lot of good stories. He is one of the brains of the game in my opinion.\n\n\"I am sure he will have something up his sleeve that we will have to deal with.\"\n\nMeanwhile Wilson said it was vital Scotland's forwards maintained the form they had shown in a 34-0 win over Samoa, after a lacklustre display in an opening 27-3 loss to Ireland.\n\n\"Their tight-head (Kirill Gotovstev) has scrummaged really well... The seven (Tagir Gadzhiev) has been outstanding. We are certainly aware of what's coming and we need to prepare for this fixture in the right way.\"", "description": "Scotland are well aware of the tactical as well as physical challenge ahead of them against Russia in their bid to qualify for the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9373/ac26979cb3eb4d43aac2003f57d66ef2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
