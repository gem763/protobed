He also raped his two stepdaughters: HO/Texas Department of Criminal Justice/AFP\n\nA death row inmate has been executed for killing his wife and stepsons before raping his stepdaughters.\n\nRobert Sparks, 45, was given a lethal injection at 6pm (2300 GMT) on Wednesday at a death chamber in Huntsville, Texas, for the 2007 murders.\n\nA jury convicted Sparks of capital murder in 2008 after he stabbed his 30-year-old wife Chare Agnew 18 times as she lay in bed in their Dallas home.\n\nHe then went into the bedroom of nine-year-old Harold Sublet and 10-year-old Raekwon Agnew and took them into the kitchen separately, where he stabbed them.\n\nRaekwon was stabbed at least 45 times.\n\nSparks then raped his 12- and 14-year-old stepdaughters, authorities said.\n\nHe locked his stepdaughters in a cupboard and left the home, stopping at his mother\u2019s house to borrow her car, and then his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home, where he told her he had killed his wife and two stepsons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\nTrump demands death penalty for all hate crime mass murders\n\nOn arrest, he told police his wife had been poisoning him.\n\nHe provided blood, hair and fingernail samples, as well as a cheek swab, to be tested for evidence of poisoning, but investigators were unable to find a lab capable of that type of test, according to court papers.\n\nHe also told a psychologist that a voice told him \u201cto kill them because they were trying to kill me\u201d.\n\nAs relatives and friends watched through a death chamber window, Sparks told them: \u201cI am sorry for the hard times. And what hurts me is that I hurt y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after his death, one of Sparks\u2019 stepdaughters said: \u201cThe day when the situation was going on, he said that we wouldn't make it.\n\n\u201cTwelve years later, we\u2019re both standing here... I want him to know we\u2019re not suffering. We\u2019re hurt emotionally but physically we\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nSparks\u2019 lawyers had argued he suffered from severe mental illness and had been diagnosed as a delusional psychotic and with schizoaffective disorder.\n\nThey also claimed he was intellectually disabled and was therefore not eligible for the death penalty, however the 5th US Circuit of Appeals on Tuesday declined to stop the execution on these grounds.\n\nSparks also argued that a prosecution expert gave false testimony and that the trial jury may have been influenced by a bailiff who wore a tie with an image of a syringe which showed his support for the death penalty.\n\nSparks is the 16th inmate in the United States and the seventh in Texas to be executed in 2019, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre.\n\nTexas has executed more prisoners than any other state since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump demands death penalty for all hate crime mass murders", "description": "A death row inmate has been executed for killing his wife and stepsons before raping his stepdaughters.Robert Sparks, 45, was given a lethal injection at 6pm (2300 GMT) on Wednesday at a death chamber in Huntsville, Texas, for the 2007 murders.", "authors": ["Chiara Giordano"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DAp2ysgGj7rjzFMiB9voUQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/51b480eb001a0e3db83888be56663190", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
