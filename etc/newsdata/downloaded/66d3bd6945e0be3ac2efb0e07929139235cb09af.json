All credit to those who run the things, but I wonder if they are actually the best way \u2013 or, and perhaps more to the point, the most enjoyable way \u2013 to learn about wine.\n\nI say this because I\u2019m trying to learn Spanish at the moment, and rather than poring over textbooks and trying to master my tenses, instead I\u2019ve been practising with the help of an app and focusing on trying to make myself understood, while grabbing hold of unfortunate native speakers and subjecting them to my execrable grammar and accent. (Fortunately, it turns out that the Spanish are very nice.)\n\nThe trick is simply to plough on, and pretty much the same applies to learning about wine, too. Too many people apologise for their lack of wine knowledge, but even if you work in the trade, you\u2019re never going to know everything there is to know about a region such as Bordeaux, for instance. And if you do know a lot about that, it probably means you don\u2019t know a whole lot about Greece, say, or Chile.\n\nThe key thing is to be open-minded. Buy something unfamiliar every time you go to the supermarket. In restaurants, order wines by the glass, rather than by the bottle, especially when you\u2019re dining \u00e0 deux or on your own. Taste and keep some kind of record of what you find, and what you like and don\u2019t like so much (apps such as Vivino are good for this). Taste wines comparatively and notice what\u2019s different about them \u2013 you can do that just as easily with a group of friends as in a class.\n\nI\u2019m not saying classes don\u2019t have value \u2013 they definitely do if you want to get a wine qualification; it\u2019s just that you can, if you wish, take control (to use an unfortunate expression) of your wine education yourself and it can be equally rewarding. Like travelling solo rather than as part of a group.\n\nYou might want to buy a couple of books, of course. One major go-to reference book that conveniently pulls everything together in one place is the just-published new edition of Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson\u2019s magisterial World Atlas of Wine (Mitchell Beazley, \u00a350), now in its eighth incarnation, or Rajat Parr and Jordan Mackay\u2019s The Sommelier\u2019s Atlas of Taste: A Field Guide to the Great Wines of Europe (Ten Speed Press, \u00a330), which explains really well why wines taste as they do.\n\nFour wines that might expand your horizons\n\nConsentido Macabeo 2018\n\n\u00a39.25 Stone Vine & Sun, 12%.\n\nI love this fragrant, Spanish white \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect aperitif.\n\nSaint-Chinian Grenache Blanc 2018\n\n\u00a38 Asda, 13%.\n\nSaint-Chinian is normally red, but this award-winning example is a delicious, peachy white.\n\nSalic\u00f3rnia D\u00e3o Reserva 2016\n\n\u00a36.99 Aldi, 13%.\n\nA Portuguese region that used to be noted for its heavily oaked reds, but this lovely fresh one would be great with pizza.\n\nNostru Nerello Mascalese Terre Siciliane 2017\n\n\u00a311.50 Jeroboams,\n\n\u00a311.95 Slurp, 13%.\n\nJuicy, joyous, slurpable organic red. Drink with fish as well as meat.\n\n\u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
