(Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of the action from a rainy Labor Day at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\n\nNaomi Osaka goes down in straight sets\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWorld No. 1 and defending US Open champion Naomi Osaka fell to No. 13 Belinda Bencic in the Round of 16. Osaka won her first Grand Slam title last year when she topped Serena Williams in the final, later going on to win the 2019 Australian Open.\n\nThis was the third time in 2019 that Bencic knocked off Osaka after previously beating her in the BNP Paribas Open in March and Matua Madrid Open in May. Those wins have helped her rise from outside the top 50 at the start of the year.\n\nBack in the QF! \ud83d\udcaa@BelindaBencic defeats World No. 1 Osaka 7-5, 6-4 to reach the QF stage in Flushing Meadows for the first time since 2014...#USOpen pic.twitter.com/U77E34blRi \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 2, 2019\n\nOsaka went down in straight sets \u2014 7-5, 6-4 \u2014 and had only lost one game in her previous three matches this tournament. Bencic completely dominated by winning 82 percent of her first serves and 81 percent of his second serves. Osaka only had one chance to break a set and never won more than three games in a row.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI was so excited to come on the court, the challenge could not be bigger so I had to be on top of my game,\u201d Bencic said after the match, via The Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased with how I played and how I managed my nerves in the end. Taking the serve early, trying to anticipate because she has a lot of power ... I\u2019m not the person with the most winners or aces, I had to play it a bit like chess with tactics on the court.\u201d\n\nBencic advances to the quarterfinals on Wednesday, where she will face Donna Veki\u0107, who defeated her in the third round of the French Open earlier this year.\n\nDonna Veki\u0107 outlasts Julia G\u00f6rges\n\nDonna Veki\u0107 is off to her best start yet at a Grand Slam.\n\nThe 23-year-old from Croatia outlasted No. 26 Julia G\u00f6rges on Monday in a 2-hour, 45-minute affair that ended 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. Veki\u0107 had lost all three of their previous matches and showed exquisite vitality.\n\nA tremendous effort and a tournament to be proud of...\n\n\n\nSee you next year, @juliagoerges \ud83d\ude4c#USOpen pic.twitter.com/zTk7glDH3P \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 2, 2019\n\nVeki\u0107 had to overcome 21 aces from G\u00f6rges, which is the most in a women\u2019s singles match since 1998. She minimized mistakes with just four double faults and reached break point 12 times, doing so four times.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I won this match. She served for it, she had match points. I kept fighting and believing I could win,\u201d Vekic told WTA Tennis. \u201cI was just trying to get a return in the court. She served amazing today. I felt confident in the rallies and I felt that if I got the ball in, I\u2019d have a good chance.\u201d\n\nVeki\u0107 will face No. 13 Belinda Bencic in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Her Swiss opponent looked strong in her last match, knocking off world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in straight sets.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Defending US Open champ Naomi Osaka lost in the Round of 16.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nJspGXI523O58nSrUxarUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wHlV20Tjg5qyMZ84RZi.1w--~B/aD0zMDY4O3c9NDYwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b7a14f40-cda9-11e9-bfff-67be752d4486"}
