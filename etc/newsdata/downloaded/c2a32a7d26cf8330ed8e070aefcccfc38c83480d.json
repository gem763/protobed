Thatpromptedawhistleblower toaccuseTrump of asking a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, which isnow the subject of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's assertion contradicted\n\nThe actions at the center of Trump's allegation occurred in late 2015 and early 2016, when U.S. aid was critical to Ukraine. Russia had seized control of Ukraine'sCrimean Peninsula and was supporting separatists who were fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.\n\nBiden took an interest in Ukraine, said Steven Pifer, a William J. Perry fellow at Stanford University and former ambassador to Ukraine under PresidentBill Clinton.\n\n\"You saw the vice president begin to emerge as really sort of the senior policy lead on Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"It's good to have attention at that level.\"\n\nAt one point, Biden withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to pressure the governmentto remove Shokin from the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nTrump and his personal attorney Rudy GiulianiclaimBiden did this to quashShokin's investigation intoUkraine's largestgas company, Burisma Holdings, and its owner,oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nThey say thisbenefited Biden's son,Hunter Biden, who served onBurisma's board of directors for which he was paid $50,000 a month.\n\nTheir assertion is contradicted by former diplomatic officials who were followingthe issue at the time.\n\nBurisma Holdings was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Bidencalled for Shokin's ouster, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, an independent agency set up in 2014 that has worked closely with the FBI.\n\nShokin's officehadinvestigated Burisma, but the probefocused on a period before Hunter Biden joined the company, according to the anti-corruption bureau.\n\nThe investigation dealt with the Ministry of Ecology, which allegedly granted special permits to Burisma between 2010 and 2012, the agency said.Hunter Biden did not join the company until2014.\n\nRead it yourself: The full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint\n\nCritics of Hunter Biden have questionedhow he landed such a lucrative role with no experience in Ukraine or the gas industry.", "description": "Trump has claimed Biden forced out Ukraine's top prosecutor in order to benefit his son.
