The three men \u2013 who walked not into a bar but a coffee shop \u2013 are trying to bring a smile back to the face of a community that has suffered its share of recent blows.\n\nAs a collective, they hope their string of initiatives to reach people in their darkest hour could establish St Ives as a model town for others to emulate, in an age of growing mental discomfort.\n\nAn old market town around 12 miles north-west of Cambridge \u2013 population 16,384, according to the 2011 census \u2013 St Ives is venerable enough to feature in the Domesday Book. Back then it was known as Slepe. There have been some rude awakenings of late.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside?

Last December, 26-year-old Adam Hyde, a keen cricketer for St Ives and Warboys cricket club, did the same.\n\nTim Drye, who replaced Pope as mayor in May 2018 \u2013 and whose son was a friend of Carl\u2019s \u2013 decided it was time to act. \u201cIt resonated with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d had mental health issues of my own at university. I said something in my speech about supporting a few existing charities and wanting to make St Ives a better place for mental health and to do something, not knowing what it would be. That phrase created a ripple that spread to others.\u201d\n\nFinch was one. A textbook trendy vicar, boyish, with tousled locks and a ready smile, Finch marked his 40th birthday by cycling from London to Paris for Calm, the Campaign against Living Miserably. Wearing Calm\u2019s T-shirt initiated conversations that brought home just how many people struggle with mental health. \u201cIn all, 84 men under 45 take their lives every week in the UK \u2013 and no one talks about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this was affecting the baby-boomer generation, or retired people, we\u2019d be all over it.\n\n\u201cSo, Tim and I said: \u2018Let\u2019s try to make St Ives a Calm Town.\u2019 Around 50 people \u2013 including Carl\u2019s mum \u2013 came to our first meeting, which drew out people\u2019s details, interests, gifts and talents. We planned another and invited people to be part of a guiding team.\u201d\n\nThat sparked a network of spontaneous activity, as Amanda Mumford, a hydrologist with a cheery smile and winningly self-deprecating manner, explains. \u201cI\u2019d been reading one of those books you pick up in Waterstones, written by the CEO of the Danish Institute for Happiness \u2013 there was a chapter about getting to know your neighbours, and building communities,\u201d she says. \u201cNot long before there was a lady on our street whose husband had died. I wanted to knock on her door, but wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d know what to say, which seemed a real shame.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The calm couch \u2013 a travelling, customised sofa taken to local events that has become a staple of a range of initiatives to improve mental health in St Ives, England, Photograph: St Ives calm town\n\nInspired by the meeting, Mumford decided to get everyone together. \u201cSo, last Christmas, we took a drinks invitation to every house on our street \u2013 46 in all \u2013 just to pop in, low-key, on a Saturday for a mince pie. We thought: \u2018What\u2019s the worst that can happen? No one will come and we\u2019ll have a load of mince pies.\u2019 But people showed up \u2013 including many who have lived on the street for years, decades, and hadn\u2019t met each other. I think there\u2019s a lot of loneliness out there \u2013 and it can be easier to open up to people you don\u2019t know well.\u201d\n\nOn a sultry night in late summer, the Calm Town team gather at Floods to discuss their push for the autumn. Monday is market day in St Ives. Under the stern gaze of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s statue in the market square \u2013 the erstwhile lord protector once lived here \u2013 local people go about their business. Once cattle and grain were traded by those going to St Ives. Now, against a backdrop of high street staples such as Wetherspoons and Greggs, they rummage among anything from Turkish towels to \u201cGraveside vases - \u00a32\u201d and boxes of batteries, cooking foil, coin holders and assorted frippery.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days for Calm Town \u2013 the group admit they are finding their feet \u2013 but they are clearly energised and exercised by giving structure to their simple initiatives: group walks, coffee mornings and signposts to help.\n\nThe junior section at Warboys cricket club now sport caps with the Calm Town logo; there are school tie-ins where seven-year-olds are pen pals with 97-year-olds. Discussions are going on about establishing the group as a charitable trust.\n\nThe committee natter about their Facebook page, whether a separate website is required, and where the \u201ccalm couch\u201d \u2013 a customised sofa taken to local events \u2013 is wanted next. It\u2019s all very English, very polite and, it has to be said, motivational.\n\n\u201cIf we can develop a culture in our town now that it\u2019s OK to talk \u2013 and my 12- and eight-year-old sons grow up realising that this is how you spot if your mate\u2019s struggling \u2013 that could be an amazing 10-year project,\u201d Finch enthuses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a town that has a vocabulary around mental health when starting conversations is often the most difficult part.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re about is a movement for change \u2013 and I think any town, any village can do what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just saying: \u2018We care passionately about this.\u2019\u201d\n\nPope\u2019s next wishlist item is mental health first-aid training courses for local businesses, having been on one himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t had one person say no,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might sit in a hairdresser\u2019s chair for up to an hour \u2013 they\u2019re the kind of people who really are going to be able to tell where you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nWhen I suggest to Drye that it\u2019s reminiscent of the Games Makers, the volunteers who so enlivened the 2012 Olympics, he agrees wholeheartedly. \u201cAnd I was so cynical about that!\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut the wonderful thing is that it\u2019s triggered a lot of really creative people. I was back in my home town, Barnsley, the other day, thinking: \u2018How could you make that work here?\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clare Lorman-Hall at the Beech Drive BBQ in St Ives, Cambridgeshire. Photograph: John Robertson/Guardian\n\n\u201cSt Ives is a very good place to live \u2013 a nice vibrant town with a good economy \u2013 you\u2019ve not got that there. Still, if it only encourages some people to give it a shot, and they make the place better than it was, that\u2019s a good enough place to be.\u201d\n\nBesides Mumford\u2019s \u201cmeet the street\u201d initiative \u2013 a forthcoming community barbecue has garnered several offers of help \u2013 there are calm walks, courtesy of yoga and pilates teacher Nicola Guitart, weekly 25-minute strolls from the top of the town with rallying points.\n\nLisa Valla, head of Eastfield infant and nursery school, holds a monthly calm coffee morning for parents to come and chat. \u201cIf you just put \u2018free cake\u2019 and \u2018I promise we won\u2019t speak to you, you\u2019re just there to chat to each other\u2019, you get them in,\u201d she laughs. Designer and art gallery assistant Laura Bridgens feels planting the seed is as critical as the work itself, especially for a group who are, essentially, enthusiastic volunteers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger of trying to do too much,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm cuppa, calm walk, meet the street, first-aiders \u2013 linking Calm Town to the school community, pointing people to links with teenage mental health \u2013 that\u2019s enough for now. If we clarify and crystallise the simple things we\u2019re trying to do and do them really well, then, hopefully, it should grow organically.\u201d\n\nDrye agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a group of people who\u2019ve grasped the nettle and run with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in trying to see how a ground-up approach to mental health might complement a strategy developed by somebody in the NHS to try to impose on the location.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surprised me is how many different things are already in place, like the NHS 111 option 2, where you can ring up and talk to somebody \u2013 I\u2019d never heard of that. If all we end up doing is raising awareness of some of these professional groups, then that would be really good.\u201d\n\nMumford adds: \u201cBecause we\u2019re still relatively new, very amateur, we\u2019re still trying to work out exactly what Calm Town is \u2013 and what it isn\u2019t. But it\u2019s brought together people interested in making a difference. There aren\u2019t many of us and it\u2019s quite challenging, but it\u2019s got legs.\n\n\u201cIf you just make a little effort to do something, you can make a big difference \u2013 and helping people makes you feel good.\n\n\u201cWe want to inspire people to develop their own initiatives and do them in their own way, whatever works for them, rather than dictating what people should do, or doing it for them.\u201d\n\nThe steering group winds up \u2013 monthly responsibilities and checklists are doled out, farewells are said. On the River Great Ouse that has flowed past the Grade II-listed Floods beer garden for centuries, a gull alights on the surface, creating a ripple illuminated by the rays of a brightly fading sun. All is calm.\n\n\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. You can contact the mental health charity Mind by calling 0300 123 3393 or visiting mind.org.uk.
