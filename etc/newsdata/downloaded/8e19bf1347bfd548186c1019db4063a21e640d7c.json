Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg called him \u2013 and other world leaders \u2013 out for their malign neglect in failing to address the single most existential threat humanity faces, while revealing the energy with which a new generation of leaders is determined to act.\n\nEach year, leaders come to New York and remind us of the promise of the United Nations \u2013 the notion that the international community can work together to solve shared challenges. The meetings can also showcase the ability of US leadership to encourage countries to tackle serious threats. These gatherings can yield genuine results \u2013 commitments to tackle a pandemic like Ebola, for instance. Whether crafting solutions to pressing challenges or inspiring the world to act, UNGA can remind us how much America can achieve when it leads and works together with partners.\n\nNot this year. Of course, Trump\u2019s mere presence is more than enough to sap the power of American diplomacy on the world\u2019s greatest diplomatic stage, and this year Trump again came ready to embarrass himself \u2013 and America \u2013 by roaming the halls of the UN reminding the public that he attempted to force the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in a move that should be worthy of a unanimous impeachment conviction.\n\nAnd so, Trump refusing to participate in the UN climate summit was little surprise from a president who gutted domestic environmental protections, announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, and is even trying to prevent California from enacting higher emissions standards for automobiles.\n\nEnter 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. The climate activist from Sweden \u2013 who has helped spark a global movement of young people striking from school to press their leaders to urgently confront climate change \u2013 was the star of the show. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look like.\n\nSpeaking to the assembled world leaders, Thunberg outlined the stakes of inaction on climate change and denounced the world\u2019s focus on \u201cmoney and fairytales of eternal economic growth.\u201d Thunberg made clear what\u2019s coming: \u201cYou are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal\u2026 We will not let you get away with this\u2026 The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nRead all of what Thunberg said. Watch the passion \u2013 and the justified anger \u2013 in how she said it. Too many of the world\u2019s leaders \u2013 political, corporate, civic \u2013 are collectively robbing the world\u2019s youth of their futures. The lack of action means that young people like her have to sacrifice, Thunberg said: \u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s sacrifice couldn\u2019t find a stronger contrast than the selfishness of Trump, who only looks out for himself. His egotism was illustrated yet again when he mocked Thunberg\u2019s speech.\n\nIf politicians can\u2019t find a way to act quickly and on a scale the likes of which the world has never seen in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, the student strikes and marches will pale in comparison to what we are likely to see in the future. If entire generations know as a scientific fact that earth will, in their lifetimes, become violently inhospitable to vast swathes of humanity, what kinds of actions would we expect them to take?\n\nThunberg is right \u2013 change is coming. There are leaders of countries and businesses making commitments to tackle climate change. Local governments, like California, are trying to move ahead on their own when their countries abdicate their responsibility. And, as Thunberg exemplifies, younger generations are beginning to mobilize. One poll of US teenagers noted that roughly one in four people ages 13 to 17 have taken action \u2013 attended a protest, taken part in a walkout, written to an public official \u2013 to advocate for change in climate policy.\n\nBut time is not on our side, and the longer that the actions of Trump and other leaders defending the use of fossil fuels are allowed to stand, the more catastrophic the results will be for our children.\n\nTackling the climate crisis requires American leadership. America is by far the largest cumulative contributor of emissions since the industrial revolution and is currently the second largest emitter (after China). America has a responsibility to act; the worst effects of climate change cannot be averted without US action, and Americans are already feeling the pain of the climate crisis.\n\nFurthermore, American leadership, when wielded the right way, can produce results. The United States has the unique ability to bring countries together on climate, as we saw when the US and China (the world\u2019s largest current emitter) struck a deal that created the political momentum that led to the Paris agreement.\n\nThe speech that Thunberg gave should be echoed by an American president and accompanied by sweeping actions to cut emissions. Unfortunately, right now, such an America lies dormant. In his annual UN speech, Trump yet again trumpeted his nationalist \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies that do nothing but spurn the world. Trump has, for the time being, eviscerated the power of American leadership to do good.\n\nBut Greta Thunberg and her generation are ready to lead and to sacrifice. The world\u2019s youth won\u2019t accept failure \u2013 they have no choice.", "description": "The climate activist from Sweden was the star of the UN climate summit.
