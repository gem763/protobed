He\u2019s the one who will take Warren\u2019s punches, not Sanders.\n\nNo one expects fireworks between Warren and Sanders even though Warren has gained ground in recent polls at Sanders\u2019 expense, and the Houston debate stage presents an opportunity for her to differentiate herself as a self-proclaimed capitalist and not a Sanders-style democratic socialist. If she can do it purely on policy grounds, that wouldn\u2019t violate the agreement she has with Sanders, her senior by several years, and in many ways her mentor.\n\n\u201cBoth of them are going after a similar voting pool, and at some point some form of differentiation has to happen,\u201d pollster Jefrey Pollock told The Daily Beast. \u201cMaybe it gets fought out on the policy level. Voters want to see a contrast, but I don\u2019t expect fire and brimstone in this debate.\u201d\n\nPollock advised Kirsten Gillibrand until she left the race last month, so he understands firsthand the challenges a candidate faces in drawing the necessary contrast. On the debate stage, he cautions that Sanders is \u201cmuch more unpredictable. He can pop off. [Warren] is far more likely to fight on a policy and academic level, and not rhetorically. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not willing to throw a punch.\u201d\n\nBut that punch will likely land on Biden and not on Sanders. Background interviews with Democrats friendly to both the Warren and Sanders camps see the candidates going the distance in the primaries with one important caveat. Should Sanders fall behind Warren, there\u2019s no assurance that he would leave the race. \u201cHe\u2019s headstrong, he\u2019s not going to say goodbye early,\u201d says one Democrat. \u201cYou cannot rule out this could go to the convention.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Party rules award delegates proportionately to candidates who get at least 15 percent of the vote\u2014meaning there could be a pileup at the end of the primaries, with no one candidate able to claim the nomination outright. In that scenario, Warren would want Sanders\u2019 delegates, and as long as she plays nice, it\u2019s more likely Sanders would move over to Warren. \u201cShe\u2019s playing very good politics now,\u201d says this Democrat.\n\nSanders is a loner, without many friends in the clubby U.S. Senate, where he\u2019s been a member since 2007. Warren, elected in 2012, worked hard to fit in and reached out to a lot of senators, including Sanders. \u201cSenators from New England have to work on bills together,\u201d says a Democrat who helped elect Warren. \u201cThey hit it off. They didn\u2019t sign some democratic socialist pledge card.\u201d\n\nSanders routinely called her \u201cmy favorite senator.\u201d New York magazine reported that he was ready to defer to her in 2016\u2014that if she ran for president, he would have stood aside. Warren stepped back, and the fraught relationship between Sanders and Hillary Clinton helped to create the phenomenon of the Bernie Bros or Berniecrats, who refused to support Clinton and voted third party or stayed home.\n\nAnother Democrat who is advising multiple campaigns on policy makes the case that Warren is better off with Sanders in the race: \u201cHe provides a kind of heat shield. Without Bernie, Warren becomes the crazy socialist.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, says this Democrat, \u201cIf I were advising Warren on politics, I would say, \u2018Do not go after Bernie, you don\u2019t have to do that. You don\u2019t have to convert the Bernie Bros. The only thing that will get them is if he endorses you. You want to stay on Bernie\u2019s good side. You don\u2019t want to goad him into being the angry old man spoiler.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the Sanders camp, the greatest imperative is to stay in the race, much like he did in 2016. \u201cThe longer he stays in, he can hold everybody\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d says one of the party regulars in touch with both campaigns.\n\nThere\u2019s no percentage at this point for Warren in trying to draw a distinction with Sanders unless it happens organically with a debate question that allows Warren to explain, for example, that she is working for change within the system while Sanders wants revolution\u2014a distinction that Warren may better be able to pull off than Clinton, who radiated annoyance at Sanders spoiling her party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bernie as Larry David, and Senator Warren as someone trying to persuade you,\u201d says Pollock.\n\nBoth camps seem content for now with voters making up their mind between two candidates, who are as different in their personas and approach as they are bound together by their policy views. Two for the price of one is a risky strategy, but it just might work.", "description": "The non-aggression pact between the two Democrat hopefuls could spell trouble for their rival.", "authors": ["Eleanor Clift"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568252431/190912-clift-biden-warren-bernie-hero_tteoqr"}
