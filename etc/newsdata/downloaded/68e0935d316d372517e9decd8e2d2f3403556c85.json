Thursday\u2019s win was their 100th of the 2019 season.\n\nHow the Yankees won the AL East\n\nGary Sanchez, left, and Gleyber Torres, right, lead the Yankees in home runs. (Photo by Daniel Shirey/Getty Images)\n\nThe Yankees won games the 2019 way.\n\nAs the league set new home run records, New York powered the most productive offense in baseball, scoring 905 runs. Throughout the season, the Yankees (currently 292 home runs) and the Minnesota Twins (currently with 292) went punch-for-punch at the top of the long ball leaderboards. That race will likely continue through Game 162.\n\nIn addition to the home-run record, the Yankees reached new heights in another category they\u2019d probably have preferred to stay away from. New York\u2019s injury report read like a tragic novel, as the club put an MLB-record 30 different players on the injured list.\n\nBut those injuries opened the door for some unlikely candidates to contribute to the best record in baseball.\n\nGio Urshela earned his place as a mainstay in the lineup despite being acquired as a defense-first third baseman once Miguel Andujar suffered a torn labrum. Mike Tauchman (currently on the IL with a grade-2 calf strain) was brought in as outfield insurance \u2014 which they needed once Giancarlo Stanton or Aaron Judge spent a combined 222 days on the IL \u2014 but he\u2019s produced a 3.5 WAR in 87 games.\n\nStory continues\n\nGleyber Torres and Gary Sanchez lead the club with 38 and 34 home runs, respectively. Along with Judge and Brett Gardner, they\u2019ve been the best of the returning members of the 2018 club. But free-agent signing D.J. LeMahieu has been the most productive player in baseball\u2019s best offense \u2014 perhaps most important, he\u2019s stayed off the IL all season.\n\nThe Yankees also have bullpen depth that rivals any in baseball, producing a unit that\u2019s in the top-10 in baseball in reliever ERA. They will, however, be without Dellin Betances who is now out for the year again after returning last week from injury.\n\nThe emergence of Domingo German helped stabilize an injury-riddled rotation, but his immediate future is now in question after being placed on administrative leave pending a domestic violence investigation by MLB. James Paxton had a disappointing start to the season, but discovered his form since August. Masahiro Tanaka has avoided the IL but hasn\u2019t performed like the front-end starter the Yankees might need in the postseason.\n\nWhat do they need to win the World Series?\n\nIf the club can get some consistency from the rotation, they\u2019ll be very dangerous in October.\n\nActually, they\u2019ll probably be a dangerous team regardless, but quality starting pitching should put them over the top. They have the lineup and bullpen depth to overcome mediocre starting pitching. And that Yankees starting unit, though it has struggled overall, has shown recent improvement.\n\nIf the starters can hold up their end, it will probably be very difficult to beat the Yankees.\n\nLingering questions\n\nFor pretty much the entire season, anyone who\u2019s put on the pinstripes has performed \u201clike a Yankee.\u201d But how long can that last?\n\nThe players like Cameron Maybin and Mike Ford, who helped the team get to this point, probably won\u2019t join them in October. Severino and Stanton have the ability to make a big impact, but it remains to be seen whether they\u2019ll return to All-Star form after missing that much time.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The New York Yankees have clinched their first American League East championship since 2012.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/scs4Hxqpm4yUtC2.I3uvPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AcdLOnFkYJ9CZ_s95EuPqw--~B/aD0yNzUxO3c9NDEyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f410bde0-d95b-11e9-b43f-2421a0c67c05", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
