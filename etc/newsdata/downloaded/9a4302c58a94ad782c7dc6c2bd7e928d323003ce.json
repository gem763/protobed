Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control. It affects up to six million people in the UK and 17 million in the US to some extent. Some sufferers occasionally leak urine when they sneeze or cough, whereas others get urges that are so sudden they do not get to the toilet in time. It is more common with age and can occur due to conditions such as arthritis if patients cannot undo their trouser buttons quickly enough. Other causes may include a urinary tract infection, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, a hysterectomy and prostate cancer. Alcohol, caffeine, carbonated drinks and spicy foods can stimulate the bladder, making symptoms worse. Sufferers should seek help from their GP as urinary incontinence can indicate a more serious underlying condition. It can also restrict people's everyday activities and increase their risk of falls if they rush to the bathroom. People can reduce their risk by maintaining a healthy weight, eating lots of fibre, practicing pelvic floor exercises and not smoking.

I turned to the public and ask them how they deal with it.'\n\nReflecting on how she's adjusted to life as a single mother, Ferne - who shares Sunday with jailed ex Arthur Collins - explained: 'I actually had no expectations about motherhood I wasn\u2019t overly maternal before I fell pregnant.\n\n'I kind of took everything in my stride and that\u2019s what the show portrays, it was a real challenge. it's like as it happened, there\u2019s no self-editing, its fly on the wall warts and all.'\n\nThe I'm A Celeb star shared her delight over the latest series of her reality show First Time Mum, which debuts on ITVBe on Wednesday.\n\nShe explained: 'I can\u2019t believe it series four, the first series followed my pregnancy, then learning to be a mum and now toddler. She\u2019s two on Saturday.'\n\nFerne also touched on whether she'll have more children and experiencing 'mum guilt' whenever she fulfills her work duties.\n\nShe said: 'I think every mum suffers with mum guilt. especially because I had no choice going back to work I had to go back to work being a single parent being her only provider.\n\n'I'm learning to be a mum to a toddler': The I'm A Celeb star shared her delight over the latest series of her reality show First Time Mum, which debuts on ITVBe on Wednesday\n\n'You feel so turn between work, and am I don\u2019t the right thing... sometimes I feel like I spend too much time looking at my phone and I look up and think oh no.\n\n'I would love to have more children... when I gave birth to Sunday and people asked so will you have more and I thought \u201cwhoa, let me have this one first\u201d.\n\n'She\u2019s two on Saturday and I\u2019d love to extend and grow the family, definitely. I can\u2019t get there on my own. I definitely need a man first, it is so tough dating.'\n\nThe former This Morning showbiz correspondent has been single since she split from Sunday's father Arthur in early 2017, but recently enjoyed a brief fling with Love Island star Jordan Hames.\n\nIn good company: Following her lunchtime TV appearance, the Essex beauty cradled her daughter as they left the ITV studios\n\nHaving fun: The blonde looked typically stunning in a semi-sheer navy dress, paired with nude fringed boots\n\nOn her 'difficult' dating life, Ferne shared: 'Being in the public eye is weird, I can\u2019t even going on a date without it getting in the press.\n\n'Believe it or not, this is me before I had a child, I\u2019m very much like right should I get married. Even on a night out with the girls, I have to get planning and have a baby sitter. It\u2019s very difficult to go on a date.'\n\nEssex beauty Ferne also revealed she's set to move out of her flat and settle into her new house in the coming months.\n\nShe said: 'Well, at the moment I\u2019m still in my flat and its pretty much on one level, but shortly I\u2019m moving to a house and it'll have stairs - which I'm slightly apprehensive and nervous.'", "description": "The media personality, 29, detailed her 'embarrassing'\u00a0incontinence battle as her daughter Sunday, 23 months, made her Loose Women debut on Wednesday's edition of the talk show.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382168-0-image-a-94_1572449364264.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
