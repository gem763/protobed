I know when Stephen died he was the happiest he's ever been in his life,\" David said.\n\n\"I think sometimes God wants the good pure souls early and that's the way I think of it. I can't make sense of it any other way because he was such a good man.\"\n\nInside the chapel, every aisle was adorned with lillies - Stephen's favourite flower, and pictures of the star throughout his life were displayed in the walls.\n\nLoved ones left gifts at the alter, including a Mickey Mouse teddy to signify his love of Disney and \"belief in fairy tales\", moisturiser to reflect his love of beauty products and a microphone as a symbol of his voice.\n\nBut it was the eulogy from Boyzone that proved to be the most heart-rending, with Ronan desperately to speak through his tears.\n\n\"We have lost a brother and I have lost my wingman,\" he said, his voice cracking.\n\nWaiting for his breath to steady, he continued, \"He will live on in our songs and whenever us four are together, his spirit is alive. But it will never be the same without him.\n\n\"A beautiful man who is now the perfect angel. Forever young and never forgotten. A man, a friend, a brother, a son, a husband and a hero.\n\n\"I'm going to really miss you brother, I love you, we always will. But we know you've found peace. Perfect peace.\"\n\nHe promised to finish the fantasy novel Stephen had been working on, titled The Tree of Seasons, and sang the hymn Happiness before the tearful band lifted Stephen's coffin and carried him out of the church for a private cremation Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nThat night, they gave their brother one last knees-up, remembering their beloved friend in an emotional late-night meal with manager Louis Walsh, Westlife and David Furnish.\n\nThey sang songs, drank bottles of vintage champagne and shared stories about Stephen at Dublin's Four Seasons hotel until the early hours.\n\nOne onlooker told The Mirror: \"Ronan, Keith, Shane and Mikey arrived together after the funeral and looked down-hearted. The strain of the day had taken its toll.\n\n\"But they decided Stephen deserved a good send-off so they picked themselves up and celebrated his life with some of his closest pals.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"It was like a who's who of the Irish pop world with the Westlife lads and Louis Walsh at the head of the table. Louis later put a card behind the bar and told everyone to drink whatever they wanted because it was on him.\n\n\"It was great to see everyone with a smile on their face at the end of the night. They obviously got a lot of strength from being together.\n\n\"At one point some of the lads were sitting in the corner of the room and they started singing ballads and swapping funny stories about Stephen.\"\n\nThe stars finally left around 2am and embraced each other before being whisked off in black cars.\n\nAnd Shane told how Stephen would live on in the four members of Boyzone.\n\nShane said: \"The past week has been terrible for us. But we want Stephen to live on through every one of us in everything he does. He is with God now. He is in a better place.\n\n\"He was our brother and we will miss him for the rest of our lives. We will never forget him.\"", "description": "Boyzone's Ronan Keating sobbed as he delivered a eulogy for his 'brother and wingman', Stephen Gately", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Pa", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545165.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Stephen-Gately-Funeral-at-St-Laurence-OToole-Church-Dublin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
