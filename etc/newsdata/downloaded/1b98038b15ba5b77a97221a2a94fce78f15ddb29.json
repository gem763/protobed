They were on the 10m line and generating some good momentum and he incorrectly penalised Alun Wyn Jones for holding on.\n\n\n\n\"Garces should have penalised South Africa as Franco Mostert did not move away and prevented Elliot Dee from clearing out Francois Louw. Wales should have had a kickable penalty that would have put them 19-16 up.\"\n\nMoments later, South Africa won a penalty off a powerful driving maul which flyhalf Handre Pollard coolly slotted to give the Boks a 19-16 victory.\n\n\n\nDebney also questioned that penalty, writing: \"Just a few minutes later, he penalised Wales either for coming in from the side at a maul or collapsing it, but he had been letting this sort of thing go all game. Why give it at that stage of the game?\n\n\n\n\"He changed the way he refereed in the final 10 minutes and contributed to South Africa winning it, which is not what a referee should do.\"\n\nPrior Sunday's match, the Springboks had a torrid 4-14 win-loss record under Garces as referee.\n\nREAD the full column on The Times' website\n\n\n\n- Compiled by Herman Mostert", "description": "Former Test referee Rob Debney says a late call went incorrectly against Wales in Sunday's Rugby World Cup semi-final defeat to South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7987/3f3f148922654fa9a36b3be4a77b27c5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
