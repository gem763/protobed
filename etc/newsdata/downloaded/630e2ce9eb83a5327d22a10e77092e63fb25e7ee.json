It is unacceptable, and it must change.\u201d\n\nIn the policy Warren remarks on the unequal environmental burdens placed on communities of color and low income families, many whom still suffer from past racist policies such as redlining. Studies have shown, for example, that black families are more likely to live in areas with high air pollution than white families.\n\nIf elected president, Warren lays out how she\u2019d take climate action by shepherding a \u201cjust transition\u201d to renewable energy use, as laid out in the Green New Deal climate resolution, which Warren co-sponsored in the Senate.\n\nWarren said she would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to better map environmental impacts on at-risk communities and adjust power plant permitting rules to better consider the impact of pollution. She would also mandate all federal agencies to consider climate impacts when issuing permits and submitting rules.\n\n\u201cClimate action needs to be mainstreamed in everything the federal government does. But we also need a standard that requires the government to do more than merely 'assess' the environmental impact of proposed projects \u2014 we need to mitigate negative environmental impacts entirely,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHappy Wednesday!

Smart grids are electrical grids that incorporate digital components such as real-time energy meters and smart appliances.\n\nThe panel, which was established nearly a decade ago under former President Obama, is the third advisory board confirmed to have been terminated for fiscal 2020, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Protected Areas Federal Advisory Committee and the Interior Department\u2019s Invasive Species Advisory Committee.\n\nNeither the White House nor any government agency has released a comprehensive list of committees cut under Trump\u2019s order, which mandated that all agencies \u201cterminate at least one-third of its current committees.\u201d The due date for cuts was Sept. 30.\n\nThe 11 advisers on the Smart Grid Advisory Committee were first alerted by an official from NIST at the end of September that the committee\u2019s charter would not be renewed but were offered no explanation.\n\n\u201cIt was a very straight forward call,\u201d said Paul Centolella, chairman of the advisory committee and president of Paul Centolella & Associates.\n\nCentolella said members were made aware of the likelihood that the panel might get the ax during the June meeting, which ended up being the advisory board\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cWe were told that considering the number of advisory committees, there were not a lot of choices in the department. So that was a factor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a decision that obviously came from high up in the administration for the agencies.\u201d\n\nA Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed the agency\u2019s termination, saying it was the only advisory board ended at NIST, which falls under Commerce.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Commerce has conducted a comprehensive review of its advisory committees pursuant to the Executive Order \u2018Evaluating and Improving the Utility of Federal Advisory Committees,\u2019 in an effort to use government resources more efficiently. As part of the review, Commerce recommended to the Office of Management and Budget that the Smart Grid Advisory Committee would cease operations by September 30, 2019,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement provided to The Hill.\n\nA spokesperson for NIST would not provide details on what other committees at Commerce were ended under the executive order.\n\nRead more here.\n\nEASING ROYALTIES ON MINING: The Trump administration is proposing a rule to make it easier for mineral mining companies to lower their royalty rates and cut fees.\n\nThe rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on Wednesday aims to \u201cstreamline\u201d the regulations placed on nonenergy U.S. mineral development and make those companies more competitive.\n\nThe proposal argues that \u201cexisting regulatory requirements are overly restrictive, inflexible, and burdensome\u201d and that the Interior secretary has the power to reduce ongoing royalty rates, rental fees and minimum production requirements to promote development.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is dedicated to enhancing the exploration and development of federal solid mineral resources in an environmentally conscious manner,\u201d Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement. \u201cBy eliminating burdensome regulations, the U.S. will have a stronger foothold to compete globally in non-energy, solid, leasable commodities markets and increase job opportunities at home instead of abroad.\u201d\n\nRecommendations to simplify the process for obtaining royalty rate reductions were first made in February 2018 by Interior\u2019s Royalty Policy Committee, a controversial advisory board made up largely of fossil fuel industry representatives established under former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Lawmaker, scientists challenge move to eliminate key advisory boards | White House nixes climate language from emissions proposal | Raffle offers deer hunt with Donald Trump Jr. Raffle offers deer hunt with 'modern-day Teddy Roosevelt' Donald Trump Jr. Overnight Energy: White House axes advisory boards for marine life, invasive species | Northeast states move to reduce transportation emissions | Judge allows Bears Ears lawsuit to proceed MORE. The charter of the committee was to advise on ways to eliminate obstacles to drilling and mining, including for minerals, faced by companies.\n\nThe committee, which was quietly terminated earlier this year, recommended at the time that Interior \u201crevise, clarify and simplify process for granting varying royalty rate for declining or particularly costly fields.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups in 2017 had asked a federal judge in Montana to disband the advisory board and strike down its recommendations.\n\nAn Interior spokesperson denied that the latest proposal was pulled from the committee\u2019s recommendations.\n\nWednesday\u2019s draft proposal follows a concerted effort by the Trump administration to jump-start the mining of what are known as \u201ccritical minerals,\u201d or elements considered key to national security.\n\n\u201cThis would improve the BLM\u2019s ability to provide relief to producers of non-energy solid leasable minerals, from burdens, such as geological hardships and market transformations,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\nRead more here.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\nNearly 800,000 Californians will lose power as PG&E cuts power to avoid wildfires, CNN reports.\n\nClimate Readiness Plan: Just (Let the Rivers) Go With the Flow, Stateline reports.\n\nState parks fee would be required for vehicle registration under Michigan House bills, MLive reports.\n\nMinnesota shuts down oil, manufacturing groups' attempt to derail Xcel EV pilot, Utility Drive reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Wednesday...\n\nProposed Trump rule aims to ease restrictions on mineral mining companies\n\nWarren environmental justice plan focuses third of climate investment on disadvantaged communities\n\nTrump officials eliminate board that advised on smart grid innovation\n\nReport: Top Interior official has denied climate change, blamed migrants for disease\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: An environmental justice plan released by Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren promises to invest one-third of her climate-focused spending on low-income communiti", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenelizabeth_091919getty2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
