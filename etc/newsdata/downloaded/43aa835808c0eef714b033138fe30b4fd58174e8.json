He rose to prominence as a Republican during the 1980s by leading the committee to recall then Arizona Governor Evan Mecham, who was impeached over accusations of fraud and perjury.\n\nThis is the third instance of a methamphetamine overdose at Buck\u2019s residence since 2017. While the current victim survived, the two previous victims died as a result.\n\nLaTisha Nixon, the mother of victim Gemmel Moore who was found dead at Buck\u2019s apartment in 2017, had filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Buck which accused the latter of injecting a fatal dose of methamphetamine into Moore.\n\nNixon, who along with Moore is African-American, also accused Buck of having a \u201cwell-documented history of isolating Black men for predatory sexual encounters.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles police didn\u2019t charge Buck in relation to Moore\u2019s death because, according to court documents, they couldn\u2019t prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that suspect Buck furnished drugs to Gemmel Moore or that suspect Buck possessed drugs,\u201d\n\nIn January 2019 the second victim, Timothy Dean, died of an overdose in Buck\u2019s apartment. Dean was also African-American, a fashion consultant who played in gay basketball competitions.\n\nAfter Dean\u2019s death, California Representative Ted Lieu announced he would donate $18,000 in contributions from Buck to civil rights organizations, while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee donated Buck\u2019s contributions to a Latino group called the NALEO Education Fund.\n\nThe current charges against Buck concern only the September 11 incident.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Democratic mega-donor Ed Buck was arrested on Tuesday and charged with with battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house.The arrest came after an incident on September 11 incident in which Buck, 65, injected a 37 year old man with methamphetamine at his home", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2RQLAF7nCxxYrSTZiI66uQ--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/fd07decbcad8580f7966aee6c8044b97", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
