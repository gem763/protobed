Meanwhile, growth in wealthy, advanced economies has also flagged.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

If the 5G networks are rolled out as expected in the next year, conditions will improve.\n\nOverall, the ADB downgraded its forecasts for 17 regional economies that account for nearly all economic activity in the region. It kept 17 unchanged and increased growth estimates for 11, mainly in Central Asia and the Pacific.\n\nIn an accompanying report, the ADB urged regional governments to do a better job of providing affordable housing and public transport to help support growth and improvements in living standards.\n\nThe housing to annual income ratio is as high as 17, compared to a more reasonable benchmark of four, Sawada said.\n\nThe poor suffer disproportionately from inefficient public transport and long commutes from distant suburbs.\n\n\u201cHousing affordability is a big issue, but it\u2019s one critical issue across a broader landscape,\u201d Sawada said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The Asian Development Bank has downgraded its growth forecasts for Asia, saying escalating trade tensions are sapping economies.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19267345082025.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
