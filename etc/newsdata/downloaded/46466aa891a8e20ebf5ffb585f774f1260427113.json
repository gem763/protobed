In the game, Parker had to either take a sip of her new wine or answer a juicy question that the fans are dying to know.\n\nAnd when it came to which of her iconic characters she would like to bring back, the New Yorker had several ideas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore the public outcry for Hocus Pocus,\u201d she told ET of the beloved Halloween flick. \u201cI mean, it's really hard to ignore the deafening cry for a sequel. But I think to do some episodes of Sex and the City, I wouldn't call it a reboot, I would call it a \u2018revisit.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhy the need to revisit Carrie and her pals?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see where all of them are,\u201d Parker noted. \u201cI'm curious, the world has changed even since the movie. I mean, the world has changed so much, technology and social media. They never -- which is maybe a virtue too because I would have complicated things even more -- so those characters never talked about social media, which I think would be really interesting and just also sexual politics and the #MeToo movement and Time\u2019s Up has really steered conversations about sexual politics, and I think Carrie Bradshaw would just be so greedy to share her feelings and thoughts.\u201d\n\nParker also revealed that she\u2019s kept about 75 or 80 percent of the outfits from her Sex and the City days in archives.\n\nAnd though she admitted that she\u2019s \u201cspent rent\u201d on a pair of shoes before, Parker added, \u201cI don\u2019t shop the way people think I shop because there\u2019s a big distinction between me and Carrie Bradshaw, always has been.\u201d\n\nWhat about Carrie\u2019s on-screen loves? Is there a favorite kiss in her past?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad! How could I ever in a million years [choose]?\u201d she asked Turner, followed by taking a sip. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that because I\u2019ve worked with such great men and women. Because I\u2019ve kissed women as well, haven\u2019t I? Alanis [Morissette]?\u201d\n\nAnd though Parker\u2019s new wine is 100 percent her own, she did have some fantastic ideas for what Carrie would name her own label.\n\n\u201cWould it be called Wonder?\u201d she pondered. \u201cDidn\u2019t she always say, \u2018I couldn\u2019t help but wonder?' Or it could be called, \u2018Meanwhile, Meanwhile Uptown, Meanwhile in Tribeca\u2019?\u201d\n\nParker also opened up to ET about raising her three kids.
