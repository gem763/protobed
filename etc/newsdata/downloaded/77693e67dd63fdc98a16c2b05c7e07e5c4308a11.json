Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said on Wednesday the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process is \u201csubstantially different\u201d to past impeachment investigations.\n\nSen. Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said allowing House Intelligence Committee Chairman amounts to a significant break from precedent on impeachment.\n\nThe South Carolina senator said the Democrats\u2019 process is \u201csubstantially different than the way we\u2019ve done it in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Intel committee is part of the process, which has never been done, and the president\u2019s counsel is not allowed to participate in the Intel committee,\u201d he added.\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 resolution directs the Intelligence Committee and five other committees to continue their investigations of the president and other administration officials.\n\nThe resolution also grants House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (D-CA) equal time and the ability to question witnesses during the committee\u2019s hearings.\n\nThe House plans to vote on the resolution Thursday; however, some Democrats have reservations about how the House proceeds.\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ), a freshman swing district Democrat, said Tuesday he will likely vote against the resolution.\n\n\u201cI would imagine that I\u2019m not voting for it,\u201d Van Drew said when asked if he supports the measure.\n\n\u201cI have long maintained the position that the impeachment or potential impeachment would not be good for Democrats or Republicans,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said in September.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) signaled he will not commit to a vote this week to formalize the Democrats\u2019 secret impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to consider whether or not it\u2019s ready to go on Thursday. I hope that\u2019s the case,\u201d Hoyer told reporters Tuesday.", "description": "Lindsey Graham said that the Democrats' impeachment process is \"substantially different\" compared to past impeachment investigations.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/at-the-lecturn-Lindsey-Graham-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
