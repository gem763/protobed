Bush at a football game. USA TODAY\n\nEllen DeGeneres' witty response to those critical of her taking in Sunday's showdown between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers next to former President George W. Bush isn't the only time she's addressed others' judgment.\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of her show, the comedian said she is \"friends\" with the former leader of the country and reminded viewers, \"When I say 'be kind to one another,' I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\"\n\nThough the talk show host typically avoids conflict, she has spoken out following backlash and false reporting. Here are some of the times DeGeneres got the last word in.\n\nSupporting Kevin Hart, 2019\n\nWhile hosting her fellow comedian on her program, DeGeneres attempted to convince him to host the Oscars, a gig he backed away from after homophobic comments and tweets resurfaced.\n\n\"That's a small group of people being very, very loud,\" DeGeneres told him. \"We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars.\"\n\nHart said it was hard because he viewed this as \"an attack to end me.\"\n\n\"But they're going to win if you don't host the Oscars,\" DeGeneres offered, adding that she's \"praying\" that Hart will eventually be restored as host.\n\nAfterward, Twitter users took to the social media site to express their frustration with the comedians' conversation, which DeGeneres addressed in a tweet.\n\n\"However you feel about this, the only positive way through it is to talk about it,\" she posted. \"Thank you for being here, @KevinHart4real.\"\n\n'Be kind': Ellen DeGeneres says backlash for sitting with George W. Bush is out of bounds\n\n'This is what the world needs': Ellen DeGeneres meets hugging toddlers from viral video\n\nHowever you feel about this, the only positive way through it is to talk about it. Thank you for being here, @KevinHart4real. \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/FVKZ6FIQAx \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 4, 2019\n\nDenying Portia de Rossi divorce rumors, 2013\n\nDeGeneres said she noticed a tabloid with a photo of she and wife Portia de Rossi on the cover once while getting her hair done.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh that's so sweet, they're honoring us,' \" she told her audience. \"Then, I read the headline underneath, and it said, 'Ellen & Portia Marriage Crumbles.' I was like, 'Oh, what happened, they seemed so happy?' And then I was like, 'Oh, wait, I'm Ellen,' and that I should know if that was happening.\"\n\nThanks to a missing page in the magazine, DeGeneres joked she \"will never know what is tearing my marriage apart.\" In a more serious moment, she said, \"I know they have to fill magazines. Every issue, every week it has to be filled up, but I don't know how they can print lies like that.\"\n\nDenying the story outright, DeGeneres said, \"there\u2019s not one ounce of truth to any of it.\n\n\"I am very happily married,\" she continued. \"In fact, the only thing we ever argue about is who loves who more. That is all.\"\n\nTaking on Larry Tomczak, 2015\n\nDeGeneres responded to Tomczak's Op-Ed in The Christian Post which analyzed \"the Avalanche of Gay Programming Assaulting Your Home\" on her daytime program\n\nHe mentioned DeGeneres on a list of ways \"Hollywood is promoting homosexuality right now,\" stating she \"celebrates her lesbianism and 'marriage' in between appearances of guests like Taylor Swift to attract young girls.\"\n\n\"First of all, I'm not 'married,' \" DeGeneres said using air quotes. \"I'm married. That's all.\"\n\n\"Larry, I don't even know what it means to celebrate my lesbianism. I mean, well, I guess I do,\" she added removing a confetti popper from her pocket, and saying, \"I'm gay!\"\n\nMaking note of his references to \"Glee,\" \"Modern Family,\" Anderson Cooper, DeGeneres quipped, \"If you ask me, Larry's watching a lot of gay TV.\"\n\nAddressing him directly, she also explained, \"Larry, the only way I'm trying to influence people is to be more kind and compassionate with one another.\"\n\nAddressing a condemned tweet, 2016\n\nAmid the Summer Olympics in Rio, DeGeneres tweeted an image of herself photoshopped on the back of the incredibly fast Usain Bolt. \"This is how I\u2019m running errands from now on,\" her post read.\n\nSome were upset by the image, expressing their frustration in replies on Twitter. \"So riding on his back like a mule, a horse as some form of property is fun to you...\" one person commented. One user said the image was \"in very poor taste,\" while another declared: \"Ellen, your whiteness is showing!\"\n\nDeGeneres responded to the criticism the next day, tweeting: \"I am highly aware of the racism that exists in our country. It is the furthest thing from who I am.\"\n\nEllen vs. One Million Moms, 2012\n\nFollowing the announcement that the comedian would be a spokesperson for JCPenney, One Million Moms spoke out against the decision, calling for her firing.\n\n\"This organization doesn't think that I should be the spokesperson because I\u2019m gay,\" the talk show host informed viewers. \"So, for those of you just tuning in for the first time, it\u2019s true, I\u2019m gay. I hope you were sitting down.\"\n\nDeGeneres also jabbed the group for its membership numbers at the time.\n\n\"Not that there's anyone counting, but for a group that calls themselves the 'Million Moms,' they only have 40,000 members on their page,\" she said. \"So, they're rounding to the nearest million, and I get that.\"\n\nEllen DeGeneres dishes on meeting with 'cutest couple' Harry, Meghan and their baby Archie\n\nShe also made a lighthearted attempt to shift focus to another spokesperson who might be problematic.\n\n\"I mean, if they have a problem with spokespeople, what about the Pillsbury Doughboy?\" she joked. \"He runs around without any pants on and basically begging for people to poke his belly. What kind of message is that?\u201d\n\nShe closed her segment by highlighting the ideals she holds dear.\n\n\"Here are the values that I stand for: I stand for honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need,\" she said. \"To me, those are traditional values.\"\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson\n\nEllen DeGeneres reveals she dated one of Brad Pitt's exes: We 'have similar taste in women'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/08/ellen-degeneres-george-bush-times-shes-addressed-critics/3906283002/", "description": "Though Ellen DeGeneres typically avoids conflict, she has spoken out following backlash and false reporting.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
