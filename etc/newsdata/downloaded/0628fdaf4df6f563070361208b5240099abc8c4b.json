Martin Center for Academic Renewal", "language": "en", "text": "Public colleges spend public money, but college officials are reluctant to make information about their budgets easy to understand. That aversion to transparency makes it easier to pass non-instructional expenses along to students.\n\nMany experts have discussed the problem. But without transparency, it can be hard to show just how much so-called instruction is actually some other activity.\n\n\u201cThe accounting habits of research universities obscure the fact that professors are hired to perform research as well as teaching and simply record the totality of their academic year salaries as expenditures for \u2018Instruction,\u2019\u201d wrote Charles Schwartz, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California-Berkeley.\n\nIn a 2008 report on North Carolina higher education, Andrew Gillen and Richard Vedder explained that many universities \u201cdistinguish themselves through their research, not their teaching. Thus, some \u2018instructional costs\u2019 likely include research activities, at least those funded by the institution through low teaching loads for faculty.\u201d\n\nBut universities don\u2019t reveal which expenditures are for actual instruction and which are for research. As a result, tuition essentially subsidizes the cost of research for professors, but students are unaware.\n\nFaculty expenses \u201care the major cost driver in higher education,\u201d according to Vance Fried, an economist at Oklahoma State University and the author of a 2011 study from the American Enterprise Institute on making colleges more efficient. Spending on faculty can be divided into instructional, research, or service. Of these, Fried says the instructional portion is the largest. Or, at least it appears to be the largest.\n\nThanks to an accounting convention that college administrators follow when reporting expenses, colleges lump together instructional and research spending, leaving students with the bill for activities unconnected to their education.\n\nNor is that bill a minor burden. Fried estimated that \u201cperhaps 40 percent of reported instruction costs at both public and private research universities are really research costs.\u201d\n\nCharles Schwartz argues that it\u2019s worse than Fried estimated. In an analysis of the University of California system, Schwartz found that instructional expenditures are double or triple the actual amount of educating students. He estimated instructional costs are actually $7,560 per student, but the UC system\u2019s budget calculated them as $16,387 per student (with a narrow definition) or $24,200 (with a broad definition). Schwartz wasn\u2019t low-balling the numbers, either: He included academic support, student services, and overhead in his instructional spending estimates.\n\nSome research spending is treated differently, Schwartz noted. Currently, if academic research isn\u2019t funded by an outside grant, it\u2019s classified as \u201cdepartmental research,\u201d and its expenses counted as instructional. But if a professor receives outside funding, such as a grant from a nonprofit foundation, that research doesn\u2019t count as instructional.\n\nThe problem is more pronounced at research-intensive universities. Community colleges (which engage in very little research) and teaching-focused liberal arts colleges have less distortion between research and instructional spending.\n\nBy mixing the two expenditures, college officials can argue that educating students is more expensive than it really is, which becomes an excuse to raise tuition.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable, after all, that students pay for their education. But it is not as reasonable that they pay for research. While a strong research record can improve a professor\u2019s prestige in their academic specialty, the research rarely benefits undergraduates.\n\nStudents have a right to know how their tuition dollars get spent, and the public has a right to know how and what public money pays for. In an email, Schwartz said that his experience has been that higher ed leaders don\u2019t want to touch the problem and prefer the status quo. They fear that public knowledge of how per-student costs are calculated could threaten public funding for higher ed. Regardless, \u201cwe have a moral responsibility to be much more honest about how we spend that money,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a moral responsibility to be much more honest about how we spend that money.\u201d\n\nChanging how colleges report instructional and research spending, however, is not so simple. As Schwartz noted, colleges follow accounting standards endorsed by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). The Department of Education, which publishes financial information for all schools that receive federal funds in a database called IPEDS, follows similar standards. Until NACUBO or the Department of Education direct schools to report instructional spending more accurately, it\u2019s highly unlikely that anything will change.\n\nAn alternative approach, called Activity-Based Costing (ABC), could make it more obvious how student tuition revenue gets spent. The ABC method estimates the cost of providing a product or service rather than grouping spending by function or by department. Johnson County Community College in Kansas and the University of California system have promoted the use of ABC, but with the goal of making programs more productive rather than making the budget easier for the public to understand.\n\nSome attention has been focused on universities\u2019 lack of accounting transparency, but not enough. Robert Martin, a retired professor emeritus at Centre College, wrote a Martin Center report in 2009 on the \u201crevenue-to-cost spiral\u201d of higher ed and pointed out that \u201caccounting standards allow administrators considerable latitude in deciding where to apply costs.\u201d Though colleges may be non-profit entities, they still have profit-maximizing incentives like a private business. Martin argued that schools\u2019 \u201ccreative use of accounting conventions\u201d can mask where the money actually goes.\n\nIn his 2011 report, Vance Fried suggested that the way to lower spending was to separately fund the research and public service missions of universities\u2014or eliminate them entirely. For public colleges with an explicit mission to provide public service and research to the people of the state who fund them, abolishing non-teaching related activities may not be feasible, but Fried\u2019s analysis encourages colleges to be honest and open with students about how their tuition is used.\n\nBut until public colleges are more transparent about how they classify costs, researchers can only make educated guesses about why one school spends so much more than another. One thing is fairly clear, though: Research activity makes educating students more expensive.\n\nWhen a public institution has more eyes watching it, its leaders tend to behave better. If the public gets better information from college officials responsible for providing an education, public trust may improve. But to build the public\u2019s faith in state higher education, state leaders need to be more honest about how tuition and tax dollars get spent.\n\nAnthony Hennen is managing editor of the James G.
