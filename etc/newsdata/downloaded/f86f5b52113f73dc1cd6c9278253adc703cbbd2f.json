The strawberry tree (Arbutus unendo) and lime trees also had some medicinal activity.\n\n\"Understanding which plants are needed to maintain a healthy balance between bees and their parasites can help us restore habitats that maximise bee health,\" said Prof Mark Brown from Royal Holloway.\n\nDr Koch said the chemical is also found in heather honey, which deserves further research for possible benefits in humans.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Current Biology.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "description": "Preserving heather in the natural landscape could have benefits for wild bees, say scientists.", "authors": ["Helen"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1665A/production/_109183719_mediaitem109183718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
