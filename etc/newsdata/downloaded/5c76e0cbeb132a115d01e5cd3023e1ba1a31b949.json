The Trump administration cut off its access to U.S. technology in May, part of a broader geopolitical feud between Washington and Beijing over technology and trade.\n\nThe top U.S. cybersecurity diplomat, Rob Strayer, said that along with testing equipment and software for vulnerabilities, governments should also take into account the background of the manufacturer\u2019s home country, including whether it has independent courts and the rule of law.\n\nU.S. officials worry that companies in China are required to cooperate with intelligence requests under a national intelligence law.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s technology that\u2019s untrusted deployed in their networks, then we have to reassess how we share information with countries like Germany,\u201d Strayer told in a telephone media briefing, though he added he hadn\u2019t yet reviewed the German rules, which are open for consultation and could become law by the end of the year.\n\nStrayer also praised a European Union assessment of 5G security risks last week that warned about a range of cyber threats including from hostile countries and \u201cstate-backed actors,\u201d even though it avoided singling out China or Huawei.\n\nNew 5G networks promise superfast download speeds and reduced signal delay that can power a wave of innovations such as factory robots and remote surgery, but their increased reliance on software raises the risks of cyberattacks.", "description": "Germany released draft security guidelines on Tuesday for next-generation wireless networks that stopped short of banning Huawei, as the U.S. warned again it...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ780_huawei_ZG_20181205210838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
