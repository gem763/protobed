AAP\n\nThere's something about the slot-renting mechanism at The Everest that rather appeals to MaxCap co-founder and chief investment officer Brae Sokolski. He structures commercial real estate debt deals in his day job, and so reckons he took to the bartering around getting his horse Yes Yes Yes a slot like a fish to water.\n\nOn Saturday, Yes Yes Yes is a good shot at Peter V'landys' three-year-old $14 million turf race. Ownership is split between Sokolski and some of his clients, including Melbourne real estate identities Jeff Xu, Tim Price, Aziz Kheir, Brett Griffith, Tim Storey, Brett Griffith and Rich Lister Larry Kestelman. Sokolski will be there to watch in person, giving the Caulfield Cup a miss, even though he also part-owns that race's favourite, Finche.\n\nThe shortest odds are split between Santa Ana Lane and Arcadia Queen. Santa Ana Lane belongs to the Australia Club-centred William St Syndicate, managed by mining executive Michael Ramsden (who's also a long-standing director of the Victoria Racing Club), while Arcadia Queen is owned by Perth motor retail veteran Bob Peters.\n\nAmong other notables racing on Saturday is two-time Everest winner Redzel, which is controlled by an absolutely massive syndicate that includes Chinese billionaire Yuesheng Zhang, of the Yulong Investment Group. Also starting is Alizee, owned by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Godolphin stable.\n\nThere's a few other well-known faces in the ranks of horses who'll get a call-up if any of the starters are scratched. Since June, fund manager Geoff Wilson has a very small stake in first emergency Brutal. Godolphin's second horse in the race, Home of the Brave, is the second emergency.", "description": "There's something about the slot-renting mechanism at The Everest that rather appeals to MaxCap co-founder and chief investment officer Brae Sokolski.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2482%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0350ac5cebc297cad85e4a4817149aeb08a39d7a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
