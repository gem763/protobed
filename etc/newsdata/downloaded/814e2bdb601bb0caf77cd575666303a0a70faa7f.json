Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.):\n\nNews from Syria is sickening. Turkish troops preparing to invade Syria from the north, Russian-backed forces from the south, ISIS fighters attacking Raqqa. Impossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) October 9, 2019\n\nOn extorting allies, she declared, \"The notion that we are somehow now going to charge them cost plus 50 is really, it\u2019s wrongheaded and it would be devastating to the security of our nation and to our allies.\u201d And as for Trump\u2019s siding with Putin at Helsinki, Cheney once declared, \u201cI am deeply troubled by President Trump\u2019s defense of Putin against the intelligence agencies of the U.S. [and] his suggestion of moral equivalence between the U.S. and Russia.\u201d There are more where those came from. Lots more.\n\nAD\n\nThese and oodles of other expressions of disbelief and horror from Republicans about Trump\u2019s conduct do raise the question as to how these Republicans could possibly support a president whose foreign policy is so dangerous. So, come to think of it, campaign ads featuring Republicans could pull double-duty \u2014 both in excoriating Trump and in raising deal doubts about the sincerity and judgment of his Republican enablers.\n\nAD\n\nLots of the Republicans who condemned Trump will be on the ballot in 2020. McConnell is one of them, as is Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) who declared, \u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent.\u201d Should she not support impeachment, voters will want to know how she can condone Trump\u2019s behavior and how they should risk giving Trump four more years.\n\nVoting affirmatively to keep Trump in office after soliciting foreign help and committing an inexcusable blunder on Syria would seem to be a bit of a problem for Republican candidates for House and Senate \u2014 including McConnell, Collins, and Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.), John Cornyn (Tex.), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.).\n\nAD\n\nWhat would prevent this avalanche of confession (both of Trump\u2019s unfitness as commander in chief and of Republicans\u2019 spinelessness when confronted with an unfit commander in chief)? If Trump, say, were to leave office under duress, Republicans would then be freed from the task of seeing their own criticisms of a ruinous president played back to them. It would be so much easier, wouldn\u2019t it, for the party\u2019s fortunes \u2014 for their own reelection chances and for their place in history \u2014 if they could just figure out some way to dump him?\n\nAD", "description": "Republicans now attest to Trump's debacles.
