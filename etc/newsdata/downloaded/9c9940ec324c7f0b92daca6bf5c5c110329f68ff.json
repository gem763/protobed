The Greens have never had a seat in the four-party Federal Council.\n\nThe far-right People\u2019s Party (SVP), which won record seats in 2015 amid Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, slipped 3.1 points to 26.3% while the Green Party\u2019s share surged 5.6 points to 12.7% of the vote, according to a projection for broadcaster SRF based on partial results.\n\nThe smaller, more centrist Green Liberal Party (GLP) also advanced to 7.6%, bringing the two parties\u2019 combined strength to more than 20% should they overcome policy differences and decide to join forces.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s system of direct democracy gives voters a final say on major issues decided by referenda, but Sunday\u2019s results showed the green wave gripping Europe has reached Switzerland.\n\nThe centre-left Social Democrats remained second on 16.5% and the centre-right Liberals (FDP) third at 15.2%, but the Greens leapfrogged the centrist Christian Democrats (CVP), which has one seat on the Federal Council.\n\nCabinet seats have been divvied up among the SVP, SP, FDP and CVP in nearly the same way since 1959. The three biggest parties get two seats and the fourth-biggest gets one under the informal \u201cmagic formula\u201d system.\n\nIn December, the two parliamentary chambers will elect the government, but in the past it has taken more than one national election cycle for that selection procedure to change the cabinet lineup to more closely reflect the results.\n\n\u201cClimate change: I think it is pretty obvious that is the most important topic of all in our time and age. There is really not any time to lose,\u201d said one 25-year-old psychology student, who gave her name only as Anja, at a Bern polling station.\n\nAnalysts caution against expecting too radical a shift after a campaign that was light on typical hot-button issues such as migration and Swiss ties with the European Union that have given the anti-EU SVP a boost in the past.", "description": "The Greens made strong gains in Switzerland's election on Sunday while the far-right party lost ground, early results showed, potentially putting environmentalists in the mix for a seat in the coalition that has governed the country for decades.", "authors": ["Marina Depetris", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
