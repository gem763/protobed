Bitcoin Bulls Squirm as Popular Indicator Flashes 'Sell'\n\nSome blame the bitcoin whales. Others blame constant bashing by lawmakers. But this week could be traced to fear about lines on a chart signaling it may be time to run for the exits.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram \u2013 used to determine whether a bullish or bearish move is strengthening or weakening \u2013 fell below zero, signaling the start of a downward trend for the first time since February.\n\nBut the MACD, the difference between a 26-day and 12-day exponential moving average of closing prices, is not without its faults.\n\nLike all moving averages, the MACD is a lagging indicator. Some learned this the hard way.\n\nDuring its previous bull run from around January 2015, bitcoin recorded several pullbacks that coincided with the MACD flagging bearish trends, but that turned out to be nothing more than a bear trap, as the popular crypto surged to $20,000 at the end of 2017.\n\nWith the MACD flashing 'sell' once again, cries of \u201cbear trap\u201d are not without merit as bitcoin is still holding onto its bull run, with gains of more than 150% since the start of the year.\n\nStill, the squiggly lines on a chart that signal buy or sell have earned their place in the crypto market, in which fundamental reasons for wild swings are sorely lacking.\n\nUnderscoring the dearth of fundamental reasons for moves in the crypto market, it is not uncommon for even the most prominent bitcoin watchers to point fingers at BTC whales \u2013 big-time traders with huge bitcoin holdings that, when deployed, can cause ripples.\n\nDays before moved above $5,000 in April earlier this year, Fundstrat Global Advisors head of research, Thomas Lee, attributed the climb to the return of \u201cold whales.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin had a rough 2018 and for much of 2019, it\u2019s been steadily climbing and from what we can gather, it\u2019s because there have been positive things taking place,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou know a lot of the old whale wallets are buying bitcoin so it\u2019s been slow accumulation.\u201d\n\n2. Markets Still Struggling to Match Last Year\n\nHere's a thought that should give pause: Despite this year's gains (16.7% for the , 13.2% for the and 19.7% for the ), the stock market overall is actually below the peaks of the fall of 2018.\n\nSo, though the major indexes are only 3% or so below peaks reached in July, the S&P 500 is also off 3% from its 2018 peak, while the Dow is off 2% and the Nasdaq is down 2.3%.\n\nThat's how ugly the late 2018 slump really was. Traders saw a loss of 20.2% for the S&P 500 from its peak in September, 19.4% for the Dow from its peak in early October and nearly 24% for the Nasdaq from its peak in late August. Moreover, the peaks this summer only modestly passed last year's highs before falling back.\n\nOther pieces of the market aren't doing so well, at least on a relative basis. The index is trading 12.6% below its peak in September 2018. The index is off 14% from its 2018 peak reached on August 31.\n\nThe index is still down 16% from its 2018 peak on Oct. 1. There's an irony in that number. Forty-three health care companies have gone public this year, the most of any sector, according to Renaissance Capital data.\n\nThe index is off nearly 60% from its 52-week high. That probably has a lot to do with falling more than 17% since peaking in April. Bankruptcies are rising among oil-and-gas production companies, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. The problem is too much debt.\n\nNow autumn is coming, often the most volatile time of the year. And the problems that have caused the current malaise \u2013 U.S.-China trade tensions, slowing business investment, slowing European economies and the probability of a messy U.K. departure from the EU \u2013 haven't gone way.\n\n3. Germany\u2019s Trade Problems Aren\u2019t About Tariffs Worries\n\nThe stock market has been at the mercy of trade headlines for a while. The primary issue is, of course, China and the U.S., but President Donald Trump has also targeted other trade partners.\n\nJust on Friday, he complained about the European Union\u2019s currency advantage and took the opportunity to rail against his own central bank at the same time.\n\nIn the EU, its economic engine, Germany, is in trouble. German came in at 0.1% earlier this month and are struggling.\n\nBut for all the tariff saber-rattling, the problem may be closer to home: Brexit.\n\nGerman exports to the U.S. rose from April to June, but sales to the U.K. tanked, according to a Reuters report.\n\nExports to the U.K. fell nearly 15% compared to the same period a year ago, Reuters reported, citing trade figures form the Federal Statistics Office. That was compared to a jump of 6% in the first quarter when a Brexit deal still seemed possible.", "description": "3 Things Under the Radar This Week", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE930QT_L.jpg"}
