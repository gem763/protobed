It can only be fought because of the complicity and arms sales of the UK and other arms-exporting governments.\n\n\u201cThis support will be on display next week, when the Saudi regime will be in London for the DSEI arms fair, one of the biggest arms fairs in the world. If the UK government wants to promote peace in Yemen then it must end the arms sales and stop its uncritical support for the Saudi dictatorship.\u201d\n\nThe Houthis drove Yemen\u2019s government out of the capital Sanaa in 2014.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim states intervened the following year to restore the ousted government, a conflict that has since killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe prospect of famine has created what the United Nations describes as the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crisis, where 24 million people rely on aid.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Britain, the United States and France may be complicit in war crimes in Yemen, the United Nations has said.
