(Justin Fowler/The State Journal-Register via AP, File)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 One of the nation's most powerful state legislators has for decades tended to shrug off the latest scandal involving Illinois politicians, but the sight of FBI agents hauling bags of evidence from an office on the Democratic side of the Capitol building this week may have startled the normally unflappable Mike Madigan.\n\nMadigan, the longest-serving state House speaker in modern American history and the head of the Democratic Party in Illinois, hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. But over the past 10 months at least half a dozen Democrats \u2014 including some confidants and allies \u2014 have been charged with crimes or had agents raid their offices and homes.\n\nCourt papers mistakenly unsealed in one case involving a powerful Chicago City Council member even described a businessman wearing an FBI wire and secretly recording Madigan.\n\nPhil Turner, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said it would be wrong to deduce Madigan, 77, is an FBI target now based on raids of one-time associates. But he said Madigan may still have reason to worry since those facing charges often scramble to cough up unfavorable information on others with more status.\n\n\"Even if you haven't done anything wrong, the people that are targets may have done things and they learn what to tell investigators as a way to stay out of jail,\" Turner said. \"When people get into a vise, they will start saying something about someone else \u2014 even if it's not true.\"\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Chicago, headed by John Lausch, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, is spearheading the investigations against the Democrats, some of them acknowledged powerbrokers in the party. One of his predecessors, Patrick Fitzgerald, cemented his own legacy by convicting two Illinois governors \u2014 Democrat Rod Blagojevich and Republican George Ryan.\n\nAlthough once-unthinkable questions about whether investigations of so many Democrats could adversely impact Madigan are now being asked, there's no sign he is losing his more than 35-year stranglehold on lawmaking processes in the Legislature \u2014 where little gets passed without his approval. Madigan infrequently fields questions in public or grants interviews to reporters, which has fostered his reputation as inscrutable and unaccountable. Madigan spokesman Steve Brown declined comment.\n\nThe Capitol raid Monday was at the office of state Sen. Martin Sandoval, who represents a Chicago district that overlaps with Madigan's. The Chicago Tribune, citing \"a source with knowledge of the case,\" reported that investigators are looking at whether Sandoval got kickbacks for steering business to at least one company. Sandoval hasn't commented since the raid.\n\nProsecutors already brought charges against City Council member Ed Burke, who personified Chicago machine politics for five decades, and state Sen. Thomas E. Cullerton, a distant cousin of the Illinois Senate's top leader, John Cullerton. Thomas Cullerton pleaded not guilty in August to embezzlement charges for allegedly receiving more than $250,000 in salary and benefits from the Teamsters while doing little or no work.\n\nMike McClain and Kevin Quinn, among those whose homes have been raided, could potentially create the most trouble for Madigan. McClain is a state lawmaker-turned-lobbyist and a longtime Madigan confidant. Quinn was a Madigan political consultant.\n\nThe FBI in May raided McClain's western Illinois home, and the Chicago homes of Quinn and Madigan ally Michael Zalewski, an ex-alderman. Citing an unnamed law enforcement source, the Tribune reported that agents searched for communications among Madigan, McClain and Zalewski about obtaining lobbying work for Commonwealth Edison for Zalewski. None of the three has been charged.\n\nCiting unnamed sources and records, the Tribune also reported that the FBI was investigating $10,000 payments to Quinn from former and current lobbyists for the energy utility. It reported at least some money came from accounts linked to McClain and the money was paid after Madigan dismissed Quinn in early 2018 amid allegations by a campaign worker that Quinn had sexually harassed her.\n\nElectric utility ComEd in July confirmed it and its parent company, Exelon, had received a subpoena \"requiring production of information concerning its lobbying activities in the State of Illinois.\"", "description": "One of the nation's most powerful state legislators has for decades tended to shrug off the latest scandal involving Illinois politicians, but the sight of FBI agents hauling bags of evidence from an office on the Democratic side of the Capitol building this week may have startled the normally unflappable", "authors": ["Michael Tarm"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pfv2Sj.z2fEsR9CV2kBu2A--~B/aD0yMDQ2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/a7f84b01e013332a1576085a7a806489", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
