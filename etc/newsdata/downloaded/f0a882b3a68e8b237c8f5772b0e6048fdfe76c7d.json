O\u2019Neill. You know, the Navy Seal who actually killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nAdmit it.\n\nYou just thought, \u2018Oh Hell yeah.\u2019\n\nMaybe a fist-pump or two? Unless you\u2019re hate-reading this piece in which case you probably look like you just smelled a fart.\n\nGod bless you, Robert. \u2014 Deebs (@DeebsFLA) September 12, 2019\n\nAmen.\n\nThank you, sir. \u2014 Anna James Zeigler (@ajzeigler) September 12, 2019\n\nHow does this tweet make you feel @TamimBinHamad @A_AlAthbah @saifaalthani @ahjh_althani @MBA_AlThani_ Mohammad al Masnad, @QatarEmbassyUSA? Do you feel sad that you couldn\u2019t save Bin Laden one more time? \u2014 Imam Mohamad Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) September 12, 2019\n\nOuch.\n\nSo much ouch.\n\nOn behalf of my wife\u2019s best friend from work, who lost her dad 18 yrs ago in the north tower. Thank you. He didn\u2019t work there. He was there for a meeting. Everyone in the meeting escaped except him. He was former Chief of his towns VFD. He stayed to help his brothers. \u2014 epcpotown (@epcpotown) September 12, 2019\n\nWanna see something funny?\n\nGot any sources?? \u2014 Luc Vareilles (@LucVareilles) September 12, 2019\n\nHA HA HA HA HA HA\n\nTo be fair, Luc may not have realized it was Robert himself who pulled the trigger.\n\nHe is the source douchebag \u2014 Michael Rice \ud83c\udf7b (@MikeRice74) September 12, 2019\n\nWhat he said.\n\nRob dropped the \ud83c\udfa4 literally! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d \u2014 David Benjamin (@thetoyman1) September 12, 2019\n\nThank you. \u2014 David B. Cohen (@DavidBCohen1) September 12, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I picture when I hear \u201cOsama bin Laden.\u201d I see a coward hiding behind his wife. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t say \u201cOsama bin Laden\u201d with intensity. You don\u2019t say \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d with intensity. But \u201cthe United States of America\u201d \u2014that carries weight.
