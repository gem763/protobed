Joe Biden met with Hunter\u2019s Chinese partners days before they established a new investment firm.\n\nIn December 2013, Hunter landed in Beijing aboard Air Force Two, accompanying his father on an official visit to China. Less than two weeks later, Hunter\u2019s company, Rosemont Seneca, became a partner in a new investment company backed by the state-owned Bank of China.\n\nChristening the new firm Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), the partners set out to raise $1 billion for the new fund.\n\nRepresentatives of the Biden family have denied any connection between the vice president\u2019s visit and Hunter\u2019s business.
