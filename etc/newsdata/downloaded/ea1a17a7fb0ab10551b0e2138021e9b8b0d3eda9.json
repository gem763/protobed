Although government figures had been pessimistic ahead of the verdict, they were still taken back by the fact the ruling was unanimous.\n\nOn hearing the news, Brexiteers were quick to take to the Tory MP WhatsApp group to query the judgment. A number pointed out that in reading the judgment, Lady Hale \u2013 president of the supreme court \u2013 had wrongly named Conservative MP Mark Harper as chief whip when in fact it is Mark Spencer. If she got that wrong, they contended, what else?\n\nThe verdict is in: Boris Johnson is a liar. And he should pay the price | Rafael Behr Read more\n\nThe official party line is to question the judgment but not the judges who made it. During a cabinet call on Tuesday night, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, said colleagues ought to refrain from criticising the motives of the judges. As for the ruling, the mood in government is unapologetic. Michael Gove has publicly said he believes the government did nothing wrong.\n\nExpect more non-apologies in the coming days as Johnson and his ministers find themselves forced into the Commons and unable to avoid awkward questions. With no working majority \u2013 it\u2019s currently in the region of -40 \u2013 the government will be the subject of ritual humiliation for weeks to come.\n\nWhile Labour remains unwilling to go for an early election until no deal is off the table, Johnson is stuck in the Commons against his will. Opposition MPs \u2013 with some help from Tory rebels \u2013 have a host of measures planned to try to strengthen their anti-no-deal plans and to force Johnson to face scrutiny on a range of issues, and ask for an extension from the EU next month.\n\nAs for Johnson, there are limits to how he can respond. He could try to prorogue again \u2013 but it could only be for a couple of days this time. Until opposition MPs agree to an election, the most obvious route out is for the prime minister to resign \u2013 something he has repeatedly said he will not do. Senior Tories worry about the implication of a resignation in a subsequent general election campaign. He would be expected to recommend someone to lead in his place. It\u2019s much harder to argue that Jeremy Corbyn is unfit for the office of prime minister if you have suggested to the Queen he could be your stand-in.\n\n\u201cWe are trapped,\u201d laments one member of government.\n\nA growing number of Tory MPs are blaming Johnson\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings. They believe No 10 miscalculated the appetite among opposition MPs for a general election and have now antagonised MPs to the point that the atmosphere in the Commons could not be more hostile. Few believe they will be able to pass a recess motion for Conservative party conference next week. Instead, MPs and ministers could be ferried from London to Manchester. The bigger worry, however, among senior Tories is that the rebel alliance manages to agree to a second referendum before any general election.\n\nThose remaining Tory moderates hoping the judgment will force the government to regroup and have a rethink over its Brexit strategy will likely be left disappointed. While the practicalities of Johnson\u2019s current predicament are stark, politically speaking, figures in No 10 remain optimistic and believe they are on the right track.\n\nThere\u2019s been much talk in recent weeks about Johnson\u2019s plans for a people vs parliament election. The idea is the Conservatives would run on an anti-establishment ticket \u2013 pitching their party as the radical choice that is actually listening to what voters want. They would depict Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour \u2013 alongside the Liberal Democrats and SNP \u2013 as ignoring the will of the people.\n\nThe supreme court judgment could play into this narrative. Anything that adds to the view that Johnson is the prime minister committed to delivering Brexit at whatever cost is something that can be used to the Tories\u2019 advantage. The voters Johnson and Cummings are pitching to in any snap poll are different to those who gave David Cameron his majority in 2015. The Tories this time hope to pick up seats in traditional Labour heartlands that voted heavily to leave \u2013 from the Midlands and north to Wales. Current polling has proved encouraging to government figures that their plan is working. \u201cIt\u2019s very messy but I am getting a lot of supportive messages from constituents,\u201d says one Conservative MP of the current political chaos.\n\nThe supreme court judgment is a devastating blow for a failed prime minister | Martin Kettle Read more\n\nBut even if the message is landing, there is unease about the long-term implications. \u201cWe\u2019ve already trashed big business now we\u2019re trashing judges. It might win votes but where does it end?\u201d asks a Tory party insider.\n\nThe crux of the matter, however, is that the bulk of Tories see no viable alternative to the current strategy. The Conservatives are so far down the \u201cBrexit by any means necessary\u201d track that even MPs who would prefer a different approach broadly accept this is the only route left to success in a general election \u2013 whenever it eventually comes.\n\n\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor", "description": "The prime minister\u2019s supreme court defeat could convince many that he represents Brexit\u2019s best chance, says Katy Balls, the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor", "authors": ["Katy Balls"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e81de020680556d3cb52783890adc12c39f71c4/0_257_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9b5b2ada9dab96b97c6d4f9056a29fe0", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
