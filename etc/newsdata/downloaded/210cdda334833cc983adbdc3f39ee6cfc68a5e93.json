Babak Sarani, a trauma surgeon at the hospital, said the technology enables doctors to take a CT scan and project a hologram onto the patient.\n\n\u201cWhat you want, is a surgeon who is highly precise \u2014 a surgeon who knows exactly where to make the incision, minimizes any further dissection, gets down to where the problem is, takes care of the problem and gets you off that table as fast as humanly possible,\u201d said Dr. Sarani. \u201cWell, how do you do that to a structure that has a curve to it using two-dimensional imaging?\u201d\n\nUsing augmented reality, he said, surgeons had a clearer idea of where to make an incision and could more quickly operate on patients.\n\nWendell Gibby, CEO of the health care technology firm Novarad Corp., said augmented reality allows doctors to see a patient and through a patient simultaneously.\n\n\u201cWe have robotics in medicine. We have 3D. But this is the first time we are really able to just take garden variety 3D imaging and project it onto the patient,\u201d Dr. Gibby said. \u201cWe merge reality with the virtual images.\u201d\n\nThe technology, created by Dr. Steven Cvetko, Novarad\u2019s director of research and development, has been used on about 20 patients over the past two years for a variety of procedures, including breast biopsies and abdominal abscess drainage.\n\nDr. Gibby said augmented reality technology could assist with medical training, pre-operative planning and, most importantly, precision medicine.\n\n\u201cI think there are many, many areas of medicine where operations could be faster, safer, cheaper and less risky because we can do it more quickly and precisely,\u201d Dr. Gibby said, commenting on future potential use of augmented reality.\n\nFor virtual reality, Mr. Herur-Raman said the development of \u201cuntethered VR\u201d \u2014 which would not require a computer or sensors close by \u2014 to make the technology more mobile is underway.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
