There is no sense that any law or regulation has been violated. We are concerned with the manner in which Rapport reported the matter by publishing a picture of the leader\u2019s home on its front page last week Sunday. This amounts to a violation of his privacy as well as that of his family.\u201d\n\nThose who sought clarity wanted Maimane to produce the lease agreement, which would supply details about whether Maimane was in fact paying market value for it.\n\nOne MP told City Press that the party leader could not avoid answering to the claims indefinitely.\n\n\u201cNo one was really moved when he spoke at the caucus on Thursday. It came across like he wanted sympathy, but I can\u2019t say anyone really bought it. He must come clean and be honest about what is happening because people will keep digging. He has an office full of people who handle his admin, so it doesn\u2019t make sense that a mistake was made.\u201d\n\nAnother MP raised concerns about the call for an early congress, saying it was irresponsible.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the money. It is odd that he would call for that congress just to prove that he is in charge while knowing how bad the books look. It is not the greatest display of leadership,\u201d the MP said.\n\nMeanwhile, a provincial leader has laid a formal complaint \u2013 which will be investigated \u2013 against MP Ghaleb Cachalia for his role in the establishment of the 1959 Committee of the Parliamentary Caucus of the DA, a lobby group within the parliamentary caucus.\n\n\n\nAt the time, chief whip John Steenhuisen criticised plans to formalise the group, saying it undermined the caucus.\n\nThe federal executive also discussed the party\u2019s bad showing in recent by-elections, calling on MPs to use the upcoming constituency period to engage voters.\n\n\u201cThe federal executive reflected deeply on the by-elections that took place after the general elections. We are deeply concerned with the results, especially where we have lost ground. In this regard, the federal executive has directed that, during the two-week constituency period, MPs intensify their efforts in communities, and provincial leaders must continue with their engagements with their structures as we build towards the 2021 local government elections,\u201d its statement read.", "description": "The DA\u2019s federal executive has rejected a proposal made by its embattled leader Mmusi Maimane for an early congress.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8904/f11119cf450f41df8452e7fb1a9e2a0b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
