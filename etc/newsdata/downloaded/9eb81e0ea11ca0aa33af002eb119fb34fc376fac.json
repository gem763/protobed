Points Of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public.\n\n\"Newswatch - while an important programme - isn't.\n\n\"Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch.\n\n\"Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points Of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this.\"\n\nA statement from BBC Women said: \"We know that this is a case Samira did not want to bring.\n\n\"BBC managers had every opportunity to pay her equally for equal work in line with the law.\n\n\"We stand with Samira as she stands with so many of us facing similar battles.\"", "description": "Newswatch presenter Ahmed is claiming that she was paid 'a sixth' of what Vine earned hosting Points Of View", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Emma Bowden", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Pa", "Ken Mckay Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758527.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Samira-Ahmed-employment-tribunal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
