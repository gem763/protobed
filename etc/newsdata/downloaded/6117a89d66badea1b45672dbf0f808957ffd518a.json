More encouragingly, some of the players were smiling. They felt they\u2019d made \u201ca major statement\u201d, according to Gareth Southgate, both in how they played amid such difficult circumstances and how they dealt with it all.\n\n\u201cThey actually are in the dressing room smiling, because they\u2019ve played so well,\u201d the England manager said following a 6-0 win over Bulgaria that will not be remembered for any of the game. \u201cThey also know they\u2019ve made a statement and they want the focus to be on the football.

The same could be said of the Bulgarian journalist who shouted down Southgate and FA chairman Gregg Clarke for \u201coverreacting\u201d. More denial.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There was the sense of empowerment of the England players.\n\nThe Uefa three-step protocol in dealing with racist abuse allowed them to make an unprecedented stand in such situations by having the game stopped twice. They could have walked off \u2013 but chose not to. This was similarly unprecedented.\n\nAs Southgate acknowledged, there will be all manner of debate about whether this went far enough, and whether they should have walked off.\n\nThat is however almost irrelevant next to the fact this was the players\u2019 will, that they got to enact. That is something that hasn\u2019t been allowed before. That does not necessarily vindicate Uefa\u2019s approach or history of this, of course, but it meant control of this situation was with the team.\n\nAnd, ultimately, nobody can tell people what their own individual appropriate reaction to racist abuse should be. The pride in their response should have told enough, as Tyrone Mings illustrated.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision at half time to come out and play the game which we thought was the right decision and if anything else had happened we would have taken appropriate action,\u201d the defender said. \u201cHe became a symbol for England\u2019s bravery on the night, all the more so because he was making his debut.\n\nAt half-time, having already made the decision to stay on at the second stoppage four minutes before the break, the players rallied together.\n\n\u201cNo, we want to play,\u201d they told Southgate and the FA officials. \u201cWe want to finish. We want to win the game. We don\u2019t want the racists to win.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the FA officials came down from their seats to the tunnel, to show solidarity with the players and staff.\n\nThey were also consulting with Uefa, and the big question now will be as regards what they do next.\n\nKick It Out have already called for a sanction as strong as expulsion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now time for Uefa to step up and show some leadership,\u201d a statement read. \u201cFor far too long, they have consistently failed to take effective action. The fact Bulgaria are already hosting this game with a partial stadium closure for racist abuse shows that Uefa\u2019s sanctions are not fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cThere can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If Uefa care at all about tackling discrimination \u2013 and if the Equal Game campaign means anything \u2013 then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow.\u201d\n\nFA chairman Gregg Clarke wouldn\u2019t add to such commentary, saying his body now had to be mindful of respecting the process and not prejudicing it. There do remain unanswered questions.\n\nHow was it that the \u2018Lauda Army\u2019 ultras \u2013 who became immediately identifiable to anyone who didn\u2019t have previous knowledge of them \u2013 were allowed in in the first place? Did the Bulgarian authorities care enough?\n\nAt the same time, there has been some questionable commentary about the country\u2019s society as a whole over this, apparently overlooking how often we insist a conspicuous minority of supporters should not colour the perception of the rest on our side.\n\nClarke and Southgate both made astute statements in this regard.\n\n\u201cBulgaria\u2019s full of decent people and decent football fans and a few people have embarrassed their country,\u201d Clarke stated. \u201cAnd I would not try to take the moral high ground because we are still fighting racism in our country. But I do think Uefa have to take time to collect all the facts and then decide how to act appropriately.\u201d\n\nSouthgate had been asked whether his players would be psychologically scarred by the events, only to offer a dose of reality.\n\n\u201cSadly, my players, because of their experiences in our own country, are hardened to racism. I don\u2019t know what that says about our society but that\u2019s the reality, so that actually saddens me that when I speak to them about it, they are absolutely hardened to it.\u201d\n\nTo only deepen the point, there was an incongruity to England supporters so quickly going from \u201cyou racist bastards\u201d to songs about \u201c10 German bombers\u201d and \u201cNo Surrender to the IRA\u201d.\n\nThis is obviously not to say that these chants are the equivalent of monkey chants, but they are part of a spectrum that does feed into this problem and create the kind of animosity that fosters hostile atmospheres. That cannot be overlooked.\n\nNeither, in all this, should the fact the England players made a choice.\n\nThat, for all the debate, is a clear positive of a bad night.", "description": "There were a few different emotions in England\u2019s Sofia dressing room, in accordance with what was a grimly chaotic night.
