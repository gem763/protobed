As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 Make no mistake about it: Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott does not think it\u2019s good to lose an NFL game.\n\nThe 2016 fourth-round pick playing on the last year of his contract does not believe it\u2019s good to lose two.\n\nAnd the Cowboys captain certainly doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s ever a good time to lose three straight football games.\n\nAnd yet, Prescott said from his locker Thursday, he thinks there is no better time than now for his team\u2019s three-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cI have a weird way of looking at things,\u201d Prescott said ahead of the Cowboys hosting the Eagles. \u201cI\u2019d rather right now than any time ever. And simply from the fact we started 3-0, felt good about ourselves, know the team that we have and then basically lose three to three different types of teams really by getting in your own way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d\n\nMORE: How can 'pissed off' Dallas Cowboys snap three-game losing streak?\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news and exclusive analysis delivered to your inbox\n\nDak Prescott has thrown for 2 TDs and 4 INTs during the Cowboys' three-game losing streak. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Prescott willingly, or even passively, took an \"L\" as the Cowboys came up short against the Saints, and then the Packers, and then the previously winless New York Jets.\n\nThe Saints defense troubled Prescott, but the offense was hurt less in that contest by its quarterback than by uncharacteristic fumbles from Jason Witten and Ezekiel Elliott. Against the Packers, Prescott threw three costly interceptions and failed to play to his standards. Still, he went all in trying to rally from a 31-3 deficit, finishing the contest with a career high 463 passing yards in the 34-24 loss. And against the Jets? Prescott didn\u2019t throw for a touchdown, but the 4-yarder he rushed for with 47 seconds to play gave the Cowboys a chance to tie the game in its final minute. He weathered eight hits from the Jets\u2019 explosive pass rush but kept playing.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel great when you\u2019re calling plays and he\u2019s taking hits at the level he did,\u201d offensive coordinator Kellen Moore said. But \u201cDak doesn\u2019t flinch.\u201d\n\nOff the field, he hasn\u2019t either. Prescott believes the three losses will help his team snap the streak in this week\u2019s battle for first place in the NFC East.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never good to lose three, never ever,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if there ever was an ideal time I\u2019d say it\u2019s now. \u2026 We\u2019re going to learn from it. We\u2019re going to move (on) from it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather it happen now when we still have a chance to go into Game 7 playing for first place in the division than have it happen late in the year when we only have a game or two left before the playoffs or we\u2019re forced to be trying to make the playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to definitely get better because of these three games.\u201d\n\nPrescott has led the Cowboys out of 3-3 straits before.\n\nWhen he was a rookie in 2016, Dallas dropped its opener to the Giants before winning 11 straight. The streak was enough to retire Tony Romo. But in the three seasons since, the Cowboys have found themselves at 3-3 every year. In 2017, they cobbled together six more wins but missed the playoffs. Last year, the team rebounded from 3-5 to win seven of its last eight contests and outlast the Seahawks in a wild-card matchup. Dallas ultimately lost to the Rams in the divisional round.\n\nReaching the divisional round isn\u2019t the goal for what Prescott, teammates and Cowboys management view as the most talented team the franchise has assembled in years. The Cowboys haven\u2019t played in, much less won, a conference title game since the 1995 season. They feel they have the talent to contend. The defense has stifled third-down opportunities at a better rate than 30 teams, but allowed too many plays. The offense is still averaging 443.8 yards per game, second best in the league, but its red-zone conversion has fallen from 85.56 percent the first three games to 44.44 percent the last three.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the whole offense is playing bad,\u201d center Travis Frederick said. \u201cIt\u2019s that on this play one guy has an issue, on this play one guy has an issue. The key to that is either all having your issues on the same play and it being really bad or eliminating those issues. \u2026 There\u2019s a focused effort on cleaning up those things.\u201d\n\nPrescott is among the leaders of that effort. Teammates asked him what to make of the discrepancy between the offensive yardage and its resulting points. His response: This team needs to practice more intensely, go back to the drawing board and understand that \u201c[expletive] doesn\u2019t hit the fan.\u201d\n\nHe still believes \u2014 insists, even \u2014 that his team has been finishing games a few costly mistakes away from excelling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re there,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWe\u2019re right there [but not] getting out of our own way. We\u2019re a good team that hasn\u2019t been getting it done. So we\u2019re going to make that step, we\u2019re going to change and get out of our own way and we\u2019ll make that step.\n\n\u201cI know we have a great team. I know it.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
