(Photo: Michel Boutefeu / Stringer, Getty Images)\n\nBefore he sadly passed away last November, the final months of Stan Lee\u2019s life were mired by a seemingly endless back-and-forth of legal entanglements and allegations of elder abuse as various parties sought to control the wealth and intellectual properties of the legendary comics writer.\n\nNow, those legal battles are being continued by his daughter, J.C. Lee.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has word that Lee has filed a new lawsuit against POW! Entertainment \u2014 the company Stan Lee founded alongside Gill Champion and Arthur Lieberman in 2001 as a holding firm for the writer\u2019s various intellectual properties since he departed Marvel Comics in the 1990s \u2014 in California.\n\nThe new suit revives claims from a prior, billion-dollar lawsuit filed against the company on Lee\u2019s behalf back in May 2018, which alleged that POW! executives, including Champion, took advantage of Lee\u2019s deteriorating health in an attempt to sell his intellectual property, name and likeness rights to Chinese holding company Camsing International.\n\nAs part of the confusing status over just who was speaking on Lee\u2019s behalf from not just a legal standpoint but even across his social media feeds, that lawsuit was dropped two months later, with POW! taking control over Lee\u2019s social media accounts in the process.\n\nPow! Regains Control Of Stan Lee's Twitter Account, Promises Full Transparency Stan Lee\u2019s personal and professional well-being has been in question for months, but some things seem to finally be settling down. Just two days after Lee announced he was dropping his $US1 billion ($1.4 billion) lawsuit against Pow! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, the company has announced it\u2019s once again running Lee\u2019s Twitter account. Read more\n\nThe new suit, however, stretches back even before POW!\u2019s formation in 2001, as Lee also hopes to gain access to parts of her father\u2019s intellectual property stored in a self-named holding company set up in the wake of Marvel\u2019s bankruptcy and her father\u2019s departure from the publisher in the mid-1990s.\n\nAlthough in the time since his departure and the foundation of POW!, Lee rekindled his relationship with the publisher in 2005 \u2014 to the tune of a reported $US10 million ($15 million) settlement, as well as an honorary Chairman Emeritus title at the company and a reported annual $US1 million ($1.5 million) stipend \u2014 the filed complaint against POW! is framed by J.C. Lee as an opportunity for the Lee Survivors trust and herself to \u201cremedy the wrongs inflicted by trusted business associates over the last two decades\u201d:\n\nBy this lawsuit, Stan Lee\u2019s heir and Estate seek to perform the covenant Stan Lee made with his namesake company and remedy the wrongs inflicted by trusted business associates over the last two decades. It is intended to restore the rights he assigned to the namesake company he founded when he was liberated from a 60-year career with Marvel Comics, the comic book company he founded and creatively directed to become the preeminent Superhero entertainment company in the world.\n\nAmong other things, the suit aims to collect damages and claim name and likeness rights, as well as domain names and websites.\n\nIt should be noted that this is not the first time that J.C. Lee has become embroiled in the murky circumstances which surrounded her father in his final years. As initial allegations over elder abuse of her father emerged, public court documents were released alleging that J.C. had verbally and physically abused both of her parents in the final months of their lives over access to a car leased in Stan Lee\u2019s name.\n\nReport: The Stan Lee Saga Is Only Getting Stranger And Sadder A new report out today sheds more light on the allegations that 95-year-old Stan Lee is surrounded by bad actors who are all trying to get their hands on as much of the famed comics creator's money as they can. Read more\n\nThe allegations were made all the more complex by the at-the-time confusing and conflicting information about which of several business partners and purported legal guardians of Stan Lee were representing the writer in court.\n\nOne such caretaker, Keya Morgan \u2014 himself also a former associate of J.C. \u2014 ultimately had several restraining orders filed against him on Lee\u2019s behalf, and was formally charged with five counts of elder abuse involving Lee by a Los Angeles court earlier this year.\n\nThe tragedy of Lee\u2019s passing last November was only further compounded by the messy disarray of the final years of his life slowly becoming public. Now it seems, in the months after his passing, those suddenly public grievances are just going to continue to emerge.", "description": "Before he sadly passed away last November, the final months of Stan Lee\u2019s life were mired by a seemingly endless back-and-forth of legal entanglements and allegations of elder abuse as various parties sought to control the wealth and intellectual properties of the legendary comics writer.
