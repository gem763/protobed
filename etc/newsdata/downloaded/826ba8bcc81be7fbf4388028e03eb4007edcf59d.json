It was first announced at the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention in August 2018, and a nice long trailer just debuted at New York Comic-Con. It's practically a Star Trek: The Next Generation reunion, featuring plenty of familiar faces alongside the new cast.\n\nRumors began swirling about a Picard-centric spin-off series shortly after Star Trek: Discovery showrunner Alex Kurtzmann signed a five-year development deal with CBS to further expand the franchise for its streaming service. One potential snag was whether Patrick Stewart, who created the character, would be willing to reprise his role. Kurtzman envisioned a more contemplative tone, describing the series as \"a more psychological show, a character study about this man in his emeritus years.\" The concept was sufficiently unique that Stewart signed on.\n\n\"I truly felt my time with Star Trek had run its course,\" Stewart said at the 2018 convention. But he professed himself \"humbled\" by the stories from fans about how much the character of Picard and ST:NG had brought comfort to them during difficult times in their lives. \"I feel I'm ready to return to him for the same reason\u2014to research and experience what comforting and reforming light he might shine on these often very dark times.\" There are ten episodes in the first season, with plans for two additional seasons if the series succeeds.\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\n\n\nYouTube/CBS All Access\n\nThe first trailer debuted at San Diego Comic Con in July. Picard has retired to the family vineyard, filled with regret because Data sacrificed his life to save him in Star Trek: Nemesis. (The series is set about 20 years after those events.) His bucolic existence is interrupted by the arrival of a mysterious woman named Dahj (Isa Briones), who pleads, \"Everything inside of me says that I'm safe with you.\" It's unclear who she is, but she has shapeshifting powers and is quite the athlete. Clearly Picard has his suspicions, telling an admiral at what appears to be a Starfleet outpost, \"If she is who I think she is, she is in serious danger.\"\n\nWe caught glimpses of of Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) and Data (Brent Spiner). And the SDCC unveiling included confirmation that at least two other regulars from ST:NG would at least make an appearance on Picard: Hugh (Jonathan Del Arco) and William Riker (Jonathan Frakes). We do indeed catch sight of Riker in this latest trailer, along with Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). The new cast members include Christobal (Santiago Cabrera), a skilled thief who becomes the pilot of Picard's ship; Raffi (Michelle Hurd), a former intelligence officer and recovering addict; Dr. Agnes Jurati (Alison Pill); and two Romulan refugees, Elnor (Evan Evagora) and Narek (Harry Treadaway).\n\nThe new trailer opens with a dream sequence, as Picard encounters Data in the vineyard working on a strangely haunting painting of a woman. He offers to let Picard complete the painting but Picard responds he doesn't know how. \"That is not true, sir,\" Dream Data replies, handing him the paintbrush. As images of past tragedy flash by, Picard wakes up next to his trusty dog, Number One. \"I came here to find safety,\" he says in a voiceover. \"But one is never safe from the past.\"\n\nWhen the mysterious Dahj shows up, he travels to Federation headquarters to convince them to help her. But he's been gone a long time, and his entreaties are rebuffed. Never one to admit defeat, Picard amasses his own crew, both old and new faces, for a top-secret unauthorized rescue mission. \"The past is written,\" he intones. \"But we are left to write the future,\"\n\nStar Trek: Picard premieres January 23, 2010, on CBS All Access. Feel free to toast the occasion with a nice glass of Star Trek Wine.\n\nListing image by YouTube/CBS All Access", "description": "New spinoff series will bring Jean-Luc Picard out of a 20-year retirement.", "authors": ["Jennifer Ouellette"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/picardTOP-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
