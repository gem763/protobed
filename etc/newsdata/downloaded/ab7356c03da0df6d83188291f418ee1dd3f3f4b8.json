Pooka Williams ran for 121 yards on 22 attempts with a TD, and Herbert added a late score. Stanley was 20 of 27 for 238 yards with an inception on his first attempt.\n\n\u201cIf anybody wants to know why a guy would come back to college football, this tells you how fun and how important college football is,\u201d said Miles, hired by the school last November after being fired from LSU two years ago.\n\n\u201cIt shows the Jayhawks are coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very realistic that we can be a great program and have real quality football teams year after year - not today, not tomorrow. Shortly, in the future.\u201d\n\nAJ Dillon ran for 151 yards on 27 carries and Anthony Brown went 18 for 36 with 195 yards a TD pass for the Eagles (2-1). Brown also caught a TD.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d BC coach Steve Addazio said. \u201cI think we saw a few signs of this last week. I think today that we didn\u2019t play well at all, and that\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d\n\nKansas went into the locker room with a 28-24 lead at the end of a wide-open first half that saw the teams combine for 623 yards (BC 313, Kansas 310). They also totaled 17 plays of 10 yards or more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a Kansas fan my whole life and I can\u2019t remember when it was,\u201d Kansas linebacker Jay Dineen said of the last Power Five road win. \u201cIt\u2019s huge having it off our shoulders.\u201d\n\nTrailing 24-21, Kansas ran a simple pitch play at their own 15 with 40 seconds left and Herbert broke up-the-middle and headed down the right sideline for 82 yards before being knocked out of bounds.\n\n\u201cWe needed to get this win,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cThe manner that we got it was huge.\u201d\n\nTwo plays later, Stanley hit Andrew Parchment - his second of two TD catches - for a 3-yard score.\n\nMidway into the third quarter, the Jayhawks increased it to 38-24 when Williams had a 12-yard scoring run, capping an 87-yard drive.\n\nBC had taken a 24-21 edge when Brown caught his 12-yard score from receiver CJ Lewis.\n\nThe Eagles scored on their first two drives and led 10-0 before the Jayhawks scored on six straight possessions.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nKansas: The Jayhawks rebounded from a miserable loss at home against Coastal Carolina when they collected only 280 total yards by putting up 567 yards Friday. . They beat Central Michigan on the road last season. Before that, their last road win was at Texas El-Paso on Sept. 12, 2009.\n\nBoston College: It\u2019s the worst home - and probably overall - loss in Addazio\u2019s seven seasons at the school. Unless the defense gets fixed quickly, it could lead to a rough year when conference play and a tough late schedule loaded with road games at Clemson, Syracuse and Pittsburgh - and a nonconference matchup at Notre Dame - kicks in.\n\nFLYING QB\n\nOn a third-and-4 at BC\u2019s 28 early in the second quarter, Stanley rolled to his left on a keeper and hurdled over Eagles\u2019 DB Nolan Bergersen for a first down.\n\nMiles was fired up on the sideline.\n\n\u201cIt shows everybody that he cares as much as they do to put your body at risk for his teammates. They realize that,\u201d Miles said before joking. \u201cThere\u2019s somethings that I\u2019d like to take back - like the jump over the top of the guy.\u201d\n\nBIG CHUNKS\n\nKansas had five scoring drives of 78 yards or more, finding big holes through BC\u2019s defense on numerous plays.\n\nERASE THE PAIN\n\n\u201cMoving forward, I think you\u2019re going to see a hungrier team - a team that\u2019s not really taking any of these shots for granted,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKansas: Hosts West Virginia in its first Big 12 matchup next Saturday.\n\nBoston College: Travels to Rutgers next Saturday for its first road game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top 25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kansas coach Les Miles' return to college football brought him some quick joy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Powtak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/kansas_boston_college_football_80270_c0-195-4663-2913_s1770x1032.jpg?f76a069a7d5db66c274c1bc44635f90bb7df0124", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
