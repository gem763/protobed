Though growth has been modest, averaging about 1.6 percent during her tenure, it's been fairly steady, ensuring Germans have the stability they crave. Some economists even refer to the Merkel years as a \u201cgolden\u201d era for Europe's largest economy.\n\nBut now, just as Merkel enters the final stages of her chancellorship, her Midas touch appears to be fading. News last week that the German economy had contracted in the second quarter of the year sparked fears of a looming recession. If that happens, the effects would be felt far beyond Germany\u2019s borders, with the impact rippling across the Continent.\n\nDespite loud calls from industry for government stimulus to boost the economy, Merkel\u2019s government has so far taken a wait-and-see approach. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said this week that the government is prepared to spend as much as \u20ac50 billion to \u201ccounter a crisis with full force.\u201d The coalition also agreed to all but scrap the so-called solidarity tax, imposed in the 1990s to help rebuild former East Germany, a step many hope will give the economy a much-needed jolt.\n\nGermany\u2019s problems are also homemade and, many economists argue, the result of Merkel\u2019s decision to leave the economy on cruise control for years.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing though is a longer-term vision to put the economy back on track, economists say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a clear and convincing strategy,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief Germany economist at ING. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that they\u2019re doing nothing, it\u2019s just not enough.\u201d\n\nGermany isn\u2019t alone in facing economic headwinds. As world leaders gather for the Group of Seven summit at the weekend in Biarritz, France, the dimming global economic outlook is expected to top the agenda.\n\nMost economists and policymakers blame Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and Europe, along with Brexit, for endangering the longest economic expansion in recent memory.\n\nYet Germany\u2019s problems are also homemade and, many economists argue, the result of Merkel\u2019s decision to leave the economy on cruise control for years instead of pushing through reforms that could have helped it weather the tough times ahead.\n\nDepending on how deep the German downturn ends up being, the political ramifications could be considerable, particularly for Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. The party, which has been in power under Merkel\u2019s leadership since 2005, will inevitably be blamed for the weakness, especially if unemployment begins to rise. That could open the door to rivals, especially the Greens, who recently pulled neck-and-neck with the Christian Democrats in some national polls.\n\nThough the German job market remains robust overall \u2014 at 5 percent, the German unemployment rate is one of Europe\u2019s lowest \u2014 signs of softness have begun to appear. Major German companies, including Deutsche Bank and chemical giant BASF, have announced thousands of job cuts in recent weeks and more firms are taking advantage of Kurzarbeit, a government-funded program introduced during the financial crisis that allows companies to reduce workers\u2019 hours.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist by nature, but I\u2019m still worried about Germany as a place to do business,\u201d BASF Chief Executive Martin Bruderm\u00fcller told Handelsblatt in an interview Sunday.\n\nBruderm\u00fcller, whose company issued a profit warning last month, said Germany needs a new \u201cAgenda 2010,\u201d a reference to a package of welfare and labor market reforms introduced under Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in 2003. Though many blame the social spending cuts that ensued for Schr\u00f6der\u2019s political demise, the Agenda 2010 is credited with resuscitating the economy, transforming the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d into the Continent\u2019s economic powerhouse.\n\nNo one benefited more from the reforms than Merkel. By the time the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the German economy was in such solid health that it recovered quickly, helped by the expansive monetary policy of the European Central Bank, the injection of government stimulus, and a surge in demand for German machinery and vehicles in China. The U.S. recovery further buoyed German exports, as Trump never tires of pointing out.\n\nIndeed, since the financial crisis, Germany\u2019s dependence on exports has only grown, leaving it with by far the world\u2019s largest trade surplus. The value of its exports equals nearly half of the country\u2019s $4 trillion GDP.\n\nThanks to years of underfunding, Germany\u2019s once-vaunted public infrastructure, from bridges to telecommunications, is cracking.\n\nAs long as foreign demand for German goods remained robust, Germany\u2019s export model was hard to beat.\n\nProblem is, those days now look to be over. And unlike in 2009, neither the Chinese nor Americans are likely to come to the rescue as they grapple with their own slowdowns.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the foundation of the German economy isn\u2019t as solid as it was then. The German car industry, the lifeblood of the economy, has been hit by the double whammy of the Dieselgate scandal and the advent of electric vehicles, which German carmakers have been slow to embrace. German industry overall, which is still dominated by small and medium-sized companies, lags on another seminal shift: digitalization.\n\nGermany\u2019s ambitious shift to renewable sources of electricity production, known as the Energiewende, has proved to be another challenge for business, saddling companies with the most expensive electricity prices in Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, thanks to years of underfunding, Germany\u2019s once-vaunted public infrastructure, from bridges to telecommunications, is cracking.\n\nThe answer to the conundrum would be for the government to stimulate domestic demand through higher wages, tax cuts and investment, most foreign economists argue. After all, the country can afford it: Germany has recorded budget surpluses since 2013.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for Germany to return to being the sick man of Europe,\u201d Simon Tilford, a prominent British economist, argued in an analysis this week. \u201cThe biggest challenge facing the country comes from its own politics rather than the worsening international environment.\u201d\n\nDespite the consensus among international economists that Germany has plenty of scope to stimulate its economy, the political reality in the country is that it will likely enter a deep economic downturn before such a step becomes palatable. The financial traumas of the 20th century have left Germans extremely wary of the government taking on too much debt.\n\nIn 2011, Merkel\u2019s coalition passed a balanced budget amendment to the German constitution aimed at preventing the government from spending more than it takes in. Even the current negative interest rates on German debt \u2014 meaning the government can borrow money for free \u2014 hasn\u2019t prompted a serious rethink of Germany\u2019s fiscal policy.\n\nEconomists agree that even if the situation worsens, the German economy won\u2019t fall off a cliff.\n\nPaul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, described Germany\u2019s aversion to debt as ruinous obsession, in his New York Times column this week.\n\nThe underlying principle, known as the Schwarze Null, or \u201cblack zero\u201d in German, was propagated for years by former Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble to become a shibboleth of contemporary German politics.\n\nSuch is the Schwarze Null\u2019s power in the public mind, especially in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis, that even Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s Social Democratic successor, Olaf Scholz, has avoided questioning it.\n\nBefore long, he may have no choice.\n\nIf Trump decides to ratchet up the pressure on his trade war with Europe, the impact on Germany would be substantial because the U.S. is its largest market, accounting for nearly 9 percent of total exports. A no-deal Brexit would only compound those problems.\n\nEconomists agree that even if the situation worsens, the German economy won\u2019t fall off a cliff. The concern is that without serious reform, it could enter a long period of stagnation, similar to what Japan has experienced since the 1990s, with low interest rates and weak growth.\n\nBy the time that becomes clear, however, Merkel will be long gone.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had great timing,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cShe arrived just as the economy was improving and now that she\u2019s preparing to leave the outlook is turning.\u201d", "description": "The shrinking German economy suggests the Midas touch of its longtime leader is fading.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Emma Anderson", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1155783001-1200x628.jpg"}
