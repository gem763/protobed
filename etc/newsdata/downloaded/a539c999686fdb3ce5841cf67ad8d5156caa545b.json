But while programmes at companies including Microsoft and accounting firm EY are small and focused around supporting neurodiverse workers in the office, Ultranauts has redesigned its entire business around neurodiverse employees, changing hiring efforts to actively recruit and accommodate individuals on the autism spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe set out to change the blueprint for work, and change how a company could hire, manage and develop talent,\u201d says Anandan.", "description": "Our brains don\u2019t all work the same way.
