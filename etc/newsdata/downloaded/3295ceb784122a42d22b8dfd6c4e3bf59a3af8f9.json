And so we made a bucket list, and one of her things was to become a firefighter.'\n\n'The outpouring of support that our little community has given, you just can never repay that,' she said. 'You just take it one day at a time and we're thankful for what we have.'\n\nGant created the GoFundMe page in 2015 and updated it regularly with news of Olivia's 'illnesses'.\n\nThere she claimed that Olivia started having medical issues at nine months old and as of November 2014, had 'endured numerous hospital stays, surgeries, treatments, invasive testing just to sustain living.'\n\nGant created a GoFundMe page for Olivia in 2015 which raised more than $22,000\n\nDr Kristen Park told investigators that she found no evidence that Olivia ever had seizures and said she told her mother three separate times to stop giving her daughter an anti-seizure medication\n\n'A few months ago, Olivia added a new diagnosis to her already long list. Which includes hydrocephalus, autism, seizure disorder, motility issues, sensory processing disorder, AV vascular malformation, focal cortico dysplasia, tumor on the paratiod gland and developmental delays,' Gant wrote.\n\n'This diagnosis however doesn't come with a cure, with treatments to prevent or a promise of life. This diagnosis Neurogastrointestinal Encephalomyopathy.'\n\nTwo day's after Olivia's death, Gant posted: 'August 20th, 2017 will be a day of utter JOY for me. Ive seen all the numerous posts on facebook of everyone saddened and heartbroken over the loss of sweet livi and all day I have wondered why?\n\n'I couldnt help it, I took a picture at 736pm and she took her last breath at 740pm. There were tears but only for a moment...The Dr was called, other workers to let them know she had passed. Within about 30 minutes staff members were showing up to hug us, love us, cry but mostly tell of how she touched them.'\n\nOne of Olivia's 'bucket list' wishes was to be a police officer for the day, so before she died cops took her on a patrol\n\nGant has been charged with defrauding the Medicaid system of more than $538,000 and ripping off the Make-a-Wish Foundation and several charities\n\nBut according to the indictment, several of Olivia's doctors at the Children's Hospital Colrado were skeptical of her medical issues and doubted they were terminal.\n\nOne of Olivia's physicians, Dr Robert Kramer, said he was 'shocked' to learn that Gant had withdrawn medical care and that Olivia had died, according to the indictment.\n\nHe described Olivia as 'social and very talkative' and said he never diagnosed her with any of the diseases Gant described on the GoFundMe page.\n\nAnother of her physicians, Dr Kristen Park, told investigators that she found no evidence that Olivia ever had seizures and said she told her mother three separate times to stop giving her daughter an anti-seizure medication that had serious side effects.\n\nOther doctors doubted Olivia even had autism.\n\nDr Thomas Walk told investigators that she 'did not exhibit the symptoms [her mother]described most of the time,' and described Olivia as 'very active, interactive, social and fun to be around.'\n\nDr Jaime Belkind-Gerson had a similar assessment of Olivia, describing her to investigators as 'always smiling and playful.'\n\nOlivia's cause of death was determined as intestinal failure, but her body was exhumed and a forensic pathologist found no evidence of intestinal failure\n\nGant denied any wrongdoing during questioning but mentioned the psychological disorder 'Munchausen syndrome by proxy,' where parents or caregivers seek attention as a result of the illness of someone in their care\n\nOne of Olivia's physicians, Dr Robert Kramer, said he was 'shocked' to learn that Gant had withdrawn medical care and that Olivia had died, according to the indictment\n\nGant denied any wrongdoing when she was questioned by investigators about her daughter by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office, but according to the indictment, she mentioned the psychological disorder 'Munchausen syndrome by proxy,' where parents or caregivers seek attention as a result of the illness of someone in their care.\n\nKelly Gant indicted on 13 separate charges in 2017 death of her daughter Olivia Two counts of first-degree murder:\n\nOne count of child abuse:\n\nThree counts of theft: one alleging she defrauded Medicaid and/or HealthFirst Colorado of an estimated $538,991.67; another alleging she used deception to obtain cash and services of $22,700 from GoFundMe, $11,264.88 from Make-a-Wish Foundation, and $3,000 from Professional Miracles Foundation; and one alleging that she stiffed Heflebower Funeral Home for $425 and Seven Stones Cemetery for $4,973\n\nThree counts of charitable fraud: each alleging that she 'devised or executed a scheme' to solicit money, property, or services 'by means of a false or fraudulent pretense, representation, or promise \u2026'\n\nTwo counts of attempting to influence a public servant\n\nTwo counts of forgery\n\nThis disorder was made popular by the Gypsy Rose Blanchard case - which has been turned into several films and TV shows - in which her Dee Dee Blanchard claimed her daughter Gypsy Rose suffered from leukemia and kept her confined to a wheelchair, despite not actually being ill.\n\nGant said during questioning: 'That has never been my case, like at all, whatsoever. You can talk to anyone that stood by my side through \u2026 all of this.'\n\nThe indictment points out that Gant was the one who raised the subject of Munchausen syndrome as it was never mentioned by detectives during questioning.\n\nGant was indicted on 13 separate charges in the death of Olivia and the mistreatment of her other daughter.\n\n'I am extremely proud and impressed with the determination of all agencies involved, especially my detectives. While it has been an extremely emotional case, they have investigated all aspects of it with diligence and professionalism,' stated Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock.\n\nGant is being held without bond and is scheduled to appear in court on November 1.", "description": "Kelly Gant, 41, was arrested Friday for the 2017 death of her daughter Olivia, 7, at a hotel in the Denver area.
