I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true.\u201d Elgin James, who created the show with Sutter, will fully takeover running Mayans, which his now-former collaborator is very supportive of.\n\nSutter has worked with FX for almost 20 years, and was the man behind one of the network\u2019s first big hits, Sons of Anarchy. He is known for his difficult and frequently inappropriate manner, having previously acknowledged a framed letter he keeps detailing incidents of \u201cunprofessional behavior\u201d with Fox execs. Sutter hung it, he says, as a reminder that, \u201cI\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 idiot and that behavior creates fucking lawsuits.\u201d According to THR, the culture change at Fox following its acquisition by Disney prompted closer scrutiny of Sutter\u2019s behavior, which he seems comfortable admitting was questionable. \u201cThis morning I was fired by Dana Walden and John Landgraf for all the complaints levied against me. Not the way I wanted to end my 18 year relationship with FX. At least being fired for being an abrasive dick is on brand,\u201d reads Sutter\u2019s letter, which continues immediately with, \u201cI deeply apologize if I\u2019ve made people feel less than or unsupported. My intention was literally the opposite.\u201d", "description": "Kurt Sutter, who created the hit series \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d has been fired from the spinoff series, \u201cMayans M.C.,\u201d for being, in his own words, \u201can abrasive dick.\u201d", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-kurt-sutter.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
