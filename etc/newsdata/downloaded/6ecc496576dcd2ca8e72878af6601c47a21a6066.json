But now we need to stop the epidemic (opinion)", "language": "en", "text": "Dr. Kevin J Tracey is president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nAs part of its tentative $10 billion agreement to settle with 24 states and more than 2,000 cities and counties over the opioid crisis, Purdue Pharma filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month. And an Oklahoma court ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for using sales practices that minimized the known risks of opioid addiction, a decision the company plans to appeal.\n\nWhile these settlements are a step in the right direction, it's dangerous to celebrate them as a victory. Across the nation, more than 130 people die daily from opioid abuse, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)\n\nThe Big Tobacco settlements in the '90s should serve as a cautionary tale on how to best spend the funds today. Instead of using the majority of the opioid settlement money for prevention and cessation programs, states should invest it in addiction and pain research, which would help to eliminate the opioid epidemic. While education, prevention and access to opioid treatment is an important component to combating the crisis, understanding the scientific basis of addiction and alternative pain treatments is even more important.\n\nIn 1998, the landmark \"Master Settlement Agreement\" forced the four major cigarette manufacturers to pay, at minimum, $206 billion to 46 states to recover tobacco-related health care costs. Lawmakers, health officials and anti-smoking advocates sprang into action as many states used the settlement money to fund cultural and educational anti-smoking programs, including the formation of The Truth Initiative . These and other anti-smoking initiatives do great work to aid smoking cessation and prevent millions of young people from ever becoming smokers. But recent CDC data continue to implicate tobacco use as the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, some states used some of the money to plug budget deficits, and researchers, scientists and medical investigators across the nation were eager for states to invest in basic science research, including addiction and nicotine. Since the Big Tobacco settlement was signed, some states have allocated a percentage of restitution money for science research, but in my opinion, not nearly enough.\n\nWhen it comes to the opioid settlement funds, it is time to learn from history, not repeat it.\n\nThe core problem lying at the heart of both the opioid and tobacco epidemics is that scientists have not identified the molecular basis of addiction. Without this knowledge, neither epidemic can be cured. Solving both of them requires a significant commitment to studying the molecular, neuroscientific and behavioral mechanisms of dependence. We need to invest in addiction research.\n\nMore than 70,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2017, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse . Since 2001, the economic cost of opioid addiction and treatment far exceeds $1 trillion, with the bulk of the financial burden stemming from lost wages and productivity, according to Altarum , a nonprofit health research and consulting institute. Lives have been ruined, jobs lost, families fractured and communities aggrieved. Despite major advances in science and medicine, today we do not have anything more than a rudimentary, simplistic understanding of why opioids cause addiction.\n\nUnlike the '90s, the Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson settlements should be used to support the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation's medical research agency, with earmarked funds used for addiction and pain research programs. For many years, the NIH and numerous government and nonprofit panel commissions have recommended additional research to solve this national problem. This new knowledge will be the basis for the development of new therapies needed by desperate patients. Is there any downside to this investment?\n\nTo quote the famous health advocate Mary Lasker , \"If you think research is expensive, try disease!\" The current NIH budget is $39.2 billion , and just a fraction of that is allocated to opioid addiction research. History proves that basic research investments, while expensive, can help to cure an epidemic. It has worked before, and it will work again to solve the current opioid crisis.\n\nThe alternative is that absent investment in research, opioid deaths will continue just like cigarette deaths. But I am confident that if adequately resourced, we'll find new, safer, non-addictive therapies to replace opioids.\n\nWe need to learn from our history. It's time to focus on pain research as the target of the opioid crisis and to support the might of the American scientific enterprise to find a new cure, as we have done successfully with so many other epidemics.", "description": "While the Purdue Pharma settlements are a step in the right direction, it's dangerous to celebrate them as a victory, writes Kevin J Tracey, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health.
