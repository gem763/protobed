Bernie Sanders\u2019s hospitalization, doctors say", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack earlier this week before a stent procedure was conducted to clear an artery, doctors said Friday in a statement released by his presidential campaign.\n\nSanders, 78, was released from a Las Vegas hospital Friday.\n\n\u201cSen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction,\u201d his treating physicians, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj, said in the statement Friday.\n\nThe independent Vermont senator, dressed in a blue button-down shirt and a dark blazer, waved to cameras as he departed the hospital Friday afternoon alongside his wife, Jane. He told reporters he felt \u201cgreat, thank you\u201d before entering a dark SUV.\n\nThe statement, released after Sanders left the hospital, marked the first time the campaign had acknowledged he had a heart attack. Aides had previously declined to answer questions about his diagnosis.\n\nAsked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, \u201cWe just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Sanders\u2019s campaign said he was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a Tuesday night campaign event. After doctors discovered an artery blockage, the campaign said then, they inserted two stents.\n\n\u201cThe Senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion,\u201d his doctors said Friday. \u201cAll other arteries were normal.\u201d\n\nThey said his hospital stay was \u201cuneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear what effect Sanders\u2019s health issues would have on his second straight campaign for the presidency. While he was hospitalized, a senior aide said his campaign events were canceled \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\nSanders planned to fly home to Vermont on Saturday, his campaign said. Over the weekend, surrogates are fanning out across early nominating states to campaign on his behalf.\n\nHis wife Jane said before his release that Sanders would \u201ctake a few days to rest\u201d but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate. It was not clear whether he would resume his normal campaign activities before then.\n\nAn artery blockage such as Sanders\u2019s typically has a good prognosis and does not normally require a long recovery period, medical experts said earlier this week, before it was known that he had suffered a heart attack.\n\nSanders\u2019s condition has revived a debate over age and health in the Democratic Party. The three candidates leading the polls in the Democratic primary \u2014 Sanders, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 are in their 70s. President Trump is also a septuagenarian.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, some younger candidates made the argument that it was time to turn the party\u2019s leadership over to a new generation. But that pitch was mostly aimed at Biden, at the time the clear leader in the polls.\n\nSanders\u2019s medical crisis occurred amid some good news for his campaign \u2014 an announcement this week that he raised $25.3 million, more than any other candidate for the Democratic nomination, in the third quarter. In recent weeks, Sanders has slipped in the polls, dropping behind Biden and Warren .\n\nSanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir sought to emphasize his position in the money chase on Friday.\n\n\u201cOur third quarter fundraising totals make clear that Bernie\u2019s campaign is part of a working class movement taking on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite,\u201d Shakir said in a statement. \u201cLet me thank all of our contributors and volunteers. We\u2019re going to win and create the political revolution.\u201d\n\nSanders, in a tweet issued from the hospital this week, used his hospitalization to argue for his agenda, specifically the Medicare-for-all plan he has long championed. He noted that a health emergency can come as a surprise, as his did.\n\nIn the statement released by his campaign Friday, Sanders thanked the doctors and nurses who treated him.\n\n\u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Sanders said.", "description": "Sanders, 78, who was released Friday from a Las Vegas hospital, experienced chest pains at a Tuesday campaign event.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f7Nz2cYtGXCSwdcXsoaRZqYeW8E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/76GFYFXG64I6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
