Unfortunately, the growth in awareness and demand for digital assets has seen sophisticated fraudsters turn their attention to duping those who may be inexperienced when shopping around for crypto.\n\nWhy are there so many crypto scams?\n\nIt\u2019s an undeniable truth that the crypto world has become a hotbed for scams because of how con men have been allured by the prospect of anonymity once their crimes are complete. Inadequate security can turn platforms into sitting ducks for an audacious security breach that puts consumer funds at risk. Fraudsters have even been known to set up their own platforms \u2014 often promising extravagant returns \u2014 only to run away with the capital that has been invested. Some of these exchanges also offer rates that are simply too good to be true, and once a na\u00efve crypto enthusiast has deposited their funds, it can be near impossible to withdraw it again.\n\nStaying ahead of the game\n\nTo illustrate the scale of the problem, just look at this research reported on by Cointelegraph earlier this year. A CipherTrace study revealed that, from January to August 2019 alone, losses at the hands of cybercriminals had topped a whopping $4.3 billion \u2014 a mix of outright thefts, scams and funds being misappropriated.\n\nMuch of this was attributable to PlusToken, which Chinese officials allege is a pyramid scheme. It is believed that more than 100,000 users were affected, and the amount of money held by the sham company is in excess of $2.9 billion. It\u2019s an insane sum that puts the ruse among some of the biggest scams of all time, let alone the crypto industry.\n\nThe PlusToken saga was an \u201cexit scam\u201d \u2014 a trend that appears to have been on the rise in recent years. This is when a business practically vanishes overnight, even though it appeared to be genuine at first. In a recent article for Cointelegraph, experts recommended trying to get as much primary information about a project as possible before signing on the dotted line \u2014 looking at their media engagement levels with reputable publications, verifying the partnerships they announce, and keeping an eye on the activity in the company\u2019s blockchain wallets. Alarm bells to be aware of include an amateurish white paper that\u2019s full of typographical errors and shoddy research, as well as unrealistic profit expectations, scant details about team members and a social media presence that\u2019s been inflated by artificial likes.\n\nThe case of Blockchain Cuties Universe\n\nUnfortunately, legitimate companies can end up getting caught in the crossfire of crypto scams \u2014 having a detrimental effect on their business and the customers they serve. Fraudsters notice a firm that is thriving and trusted by the community and attempt to ride off its coat tails.\n\nBlockchain Cuties Universe, a crypto collectible game company, says it has fallen victim to such an incident. It alleges that a Russian high-yield investment program has been infringing on its copyright \u2014 using its graphical assets to scam gamers for fiat money. Adverts led to a near-identical version of the Blockchain Cuties Universe website, leading users to believe that the scammers were affiliated with the company \u2014 or worse, its official online presence.\n\nA Cuties player managed to interact with the alleged scammers, known as Zooks Family, to find out what was going on. They inaccurately claimed that investing $200 in a digital pet could realize returns of 3.7% a day for 50 days \u2014 185% over the course of the period. Given the fact that the purported fraud used imagery from a reputable website, it is possible that some people were duped into parting with their hard-earned cash, only to realize later on that they\u2019d made a mistake.\n\nThe company says that, as a whole, the crypto community has been trying to clamp down on malicious activity that causes significant reputational damage to the entire industry. Although Blockchain Cuties Universe believes the crypto world has a chance to become a place free of scams, it says vigilance from firms and users alike is essential.\n\nVladimir Tomko, the CEO of Blockchain Cuties Universe, said: \u201cWe will do our best to protect our reputation and gaming community in general. Right now we are actively preparing all the necessary papers to take legal action. What I would like to highlight is that common sense and asking a lot of precise questions will always help you to spot a scammer. Make sure you know who you are dealing with. Stay decentralized, stay secure. With the help of our powerful community, I believe, we will emerge victorious.\u201d", "description": "Fraud is a sad but undeniable part of the crypto world.
