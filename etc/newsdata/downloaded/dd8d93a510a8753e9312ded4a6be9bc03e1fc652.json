According to state media outlet ECNS, there are also an \"undetermined number of glass walkways or slides\".\n\nThe glass attractions are an attempt to attract thrill-seeking tourists and capitalise on China's growing domestic tourism.\n\nThe Zhangjiajie bridge in Hunan province - which was the highest and longest glass-bottomed bridge in the world when it opened in 2016 - arguably kicked off the craze.\n\nBut earlier this year, one tourist died and six others were injured after they fell off a glass slide in Guangxi province.\n\nRain had made the glass extra slippery, causing the man to crash through the guardrail, and fly off the slide.

In 2017, a tourist died after an accident on a glass slide in Hubei.\n\nAnd in 2016, someone was injured after being hit by falling rocks while walking on a glass walkway in the city of Zhangjiajie.\n\nIn 2015, a glass skywalk in Henan province cracked despite being open for only two weeks, sending tourists fleeing.", "description": "The glass attractions were built to attract tourists - but extra checks are now being carried out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/45C9/production/_109456871_gettyimages-592277034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
