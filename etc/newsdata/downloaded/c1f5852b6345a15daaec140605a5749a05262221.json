But as [heart disease] rates continue to fall, cancer could likely become the leading cause of death worldwide, within just a few decades,\" said Gilles Dagenais, a professor at Quebec's Laval University in Canada who co-led the work.\n\n\n\nOf an estimated 55 million deaths in the world in 2017, the researchers said, around 17.7 million were due to cardiovascular disease \u2014 a group of conditions that includes heart failure, angina, heart attack and stroke.\n\n\n\nAround 70 per cent of all cardiovascular cases and deaths are due to modifiable risks such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diet, smoking and other lifestyle factors.\n\nHospitalization rates for heart disease were substantially lower in poorer and middle-income countries than in wealthy ones. (Kim Kyung Hoon/Reuters)\n\n\n\nIn high-income countries, common treatment with cholesterol-lowering statins and blood-pressure medicines have helped bring rates of heart disease down dramatically in the past few decades.\n\n\n\nDagenais's team said their findings suggest that the higher rates of heart-disease deaths in low-income countries may be mainly due to a lower quality of healthcare.\n\n\n\nThe research found first hospitalization rates and heart disease medication use were both substantially lower in poorer and middle-income countries than in wealthy ones.

Global health policies should be adapted to different groups of countries based on factors such as the expected benefit and access to health care.\n\nPresenting now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESCCongress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ESCCongress</a>\u2014<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CVD?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CVD</a> remains leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for 40% of deaths, but in HIC, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cancer?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cancer</a> is now responsible for twice as many deaths: findings from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PUREStudy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PUREStudy</a><br><br>Free to read with reg until Sept 10 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LancetCardiology?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LancetCardiology</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iXSfIio77D\">https://t.co/iXSfIio77D</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/eHEJ0kWWfa\">pic.twitter.com/eHEJ0kWWfa</a> \u2014@TheLancet\n\nStephanie Read of Women's College Research Institute in Toronto and Sarah Wild of the University of Edinburgh, U.K., wrote a journal commentary published with the research.\n\n\"[T]heir findings can inform the effective use of limited resources \u2014 for example, by indicating the importance of improving education across the world and improving diet and reducing household air pollution in less developed countries.
