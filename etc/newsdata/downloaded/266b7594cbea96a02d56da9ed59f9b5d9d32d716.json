But Transit Systems had a strong track record of being able to both win new contracts and secure renewals.\n\nOn October 10, SeaLink revealed that Transit Systems had been awarded binding contracts to keep operating the Claremont and Marmion bus service in Perth for an extra 10 years to 2030, and had also won a new contract for Joondalup in Perth for 10 years.\n\nTransit Systems operates 3129 buses across 40 different long-term contracts in Australia, London and Singapore, mainly on behalf of governments. It carries 344 million passengers annually.\n\nSeaLink bought the marine division of Transit Systems, which operates passenger ferry and barge services in south-east Queensland and Gladstone, for $125 million in 2015.\n\nThe bus services operated by Transit Systems in Australia deliver solid and consistent income. The overall business generated revenue of $895 million in 2018-19 and earnings before interest and tax of $61 million on a pro-forma basis.\n\nTransit Systems chairman Neil Smith will join the SeaLink board after the acquisition is completed and Transit chief executive Clint Feuerherdt will take over as boss of the whole company as SeaLink chief executive Jeff Ellison steps down after 21 years.\n\nSeaLink is buying Transit Systems for an enterprise value of $635 million, plus an earn-out component of up to $63 million.\n\nSeaLink expects to pull out between $4 million and $4.6 million in synergies by combining the two companies.", "description": "SeaLink shares have risen above both an independent expert valuation and a $4.75 indicative price in a 2018 mystery buyout proposal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_115%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e1bff81af8b39fe6559b8ecf42634b263c3d3833", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
