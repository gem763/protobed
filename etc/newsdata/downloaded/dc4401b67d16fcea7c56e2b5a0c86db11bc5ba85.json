Because of Taiwan\u2019s political status, the People\u2019s Republic of China considers any mention of or allusion to its independence as an offense against its sovereignty.\n\nApple\u2019s region lock of ROC Taiwan flag extended beyond CN devices to HK and Macau\u2019s in the iOS/iPadOS 13.1.1 rollout. Interestingly, the new lock only affects the keyboard, and has no problem displaying and is easy to bypass by switching region. https://t.co/RVRKNQyc1l pic.twitter.com/8eQXambiAQ \u2014 \u738b\u535a\u6e90 Wang Boyuan (@thisboyuan) October 3, 2019\n\nThe change comes in the midst of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which have been ongoing for months and only continue to intensify as the Chinese government has taken measures to crackdown on the movement. The heightened tensions have had all sorts of ripple effects on American businesses, too, as companies fearful of being shown the door by one of the world\u2019s most economically influential countries are bowing to pressure from China to stay away from politically sensitive topics.\n\nChina pressures foreign companies to adhere to its political worldview to do business in the country\n\nThe NBA this past weekend formally apologized to China for a tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey that voiced support for Hong Kong; China is the NBA\u2019s biggest foreign market. And video game company Activision Blizzard removed a recording of a professional Hearthstone player calling for Hong Kong\u2019s liberation in a post-game interview. There\u2019s a long history of other companies, from the Gap to Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler, issuing public apologies to avoid running afoul of China\u2019s strict speech policies and its stance on hot-button topics like Hong Kong\u2019s independence and political turmoil in Taiwan and Tibet.\n\nApple has a history of appeasing China as well, considering how large a market China is and the iPhone maker\u2019s manufacturing supply chain in the country. Earlier this year, Apple censored a number of Hong Kong singers on the China version of Apple Music, and the company has in the past removed VPN apps from the Chinese version of the App Store. It has even hidden this emoji before, too \u2014 since 2017, iPhone users in mainland China have been unable to see or type the Taiwan flag on their devices at all, according to Emojipedia.", "description": "When Apple released iOS 13.1.1 in late September, it appears to have dropped the Taiwan flag from the emoji keyboard for users that have their iOS region set to Hong Kong or Macau, as noticed by the blog Hiraku and later corroborated by Hong Kong Free Press.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YU3sn5Vs0Pfst-2LBA8M3q0YHc=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9404651/DSCF5845.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
