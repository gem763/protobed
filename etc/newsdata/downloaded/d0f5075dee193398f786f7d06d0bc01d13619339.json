One is properly dressed, the other is so-so and the third, I thought he was the driver. Of course that was Roman.\n\n'He wanted to buy a club in Moscow so we went to Moscow for three days. We saw all the clubs and I said buy Dinamo. They had the best facilities.\n\n'I went on holiday and his right-hand man phoned. Roman changed his mind. He wants to buy a club in London.\n\nThe Russian billionaire opted to buy the Blues instead of Tottenham or Dinamo Moscow\n\n'Tottenham or Chelsea? I said, \"What does he want to do?\" He said he wants to win.\n\n'I said, \"So buy Chelsea. You have to change half the team. Tottenham you have to change the whole team.\"'\n\nThe pair remain friends and Chelsea have won 16 major trophies, including five Premier League titles, in the 16 years following Abramovich's takeover.\n\nMeanwhile, Tottenham have won one trophy in that time, lifting the League Cup in 2008.", "description": "Sven-Goran Eriksson has revealed he encouraged Roman Abramovich to buy Chelsea instead of Tottenham in 2003, after mistaking the Russian for a driver at their first meeting.", "authors": ["Tom Caldon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19684884-0-image-a-3_1571046055610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
