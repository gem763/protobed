So stock up on all of your undies and socks for every male you need to buy Christmas presents for.\n\nThe massive clearance sale comes after the retailer faced a huge slump in sales in recent months. Back in August, the classic Aussie store announced that they\u2019ll be closing 30 locations across the country over the next few years. Although it\u2019s bad for the company, it makes for some pretty great bargains for shoppers.\n\nMore than 1000 products are included in the clearance, covering everything from socks and underwear to electronics and home goods. So if you\u2019re in need of, well\u2026 anything, be sure to check it out.\n\nBut who has time to scroll through all 1000 products? Not you! Well, lucky for you, I do have the time, so I\u2019ve rounded up some of the best and most fucked products you can snap up with the gross spare change that\u2019s accumulated on the floor of your car.\n\nAfter an extensive look at everything included in the sale, it looks like somebody has just walked around blindfolded and picked out a bunch of random shit. But if you\u2019re smart about it, you can pick up some bargains on stuff you need or just really want like travel adapters for $14, $40 off Bluetooth speakers or this silver one-piece swimsuit for one singular buck. ONE. There\u2019s also $250 off a 55\u2033 TV, which means you can spend $250 on wine and snacks for your next movie night.\n\nThis sale is also a good time to stock up on the boring shit you need, like deodorant, tampons and giant inflatable flamingos. Or maybe you need a 6-person tent for festival season and want to save $70? Who knows? I don\u2019t know your life story, all I know is that there\u2019s huge bargains on everything you could ever need.\n\nThere are two options here. You can stock up on essentials and household items you need, or you can splurge on ridiculous things you don\u2019t need, like a Dunlop Auto Putter or this dinosaur chalkboard that you can write \u201cdicks\u201d on. I\u2019m not going to tell you how to live your life. What am I? Your mum?", "description": "Retail giant Big W has just started a massive sale, with up to 95% off a wid erange of products from socks and underwear to pool toys.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/big-w.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
