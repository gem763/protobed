Specifically, \"the Open Skies Treaty allows the United States and our allies and partners in Europe to monitor Russian military deployment,\" especially in Ukraine, Engels said, and \"American withdrawal would only benefit Russia.\"\n\nIt isn't clear that Trump's odd relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin is behind the prospective switch.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Russia and former National Security Adviser John Bolton could both want to scrap the treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngels asked that before Trump burn the treaty, the decision be put through \"a transparent process that includes a thorough interagency review and consultation with Congress.\"\n\nGuys, GUYS. I know today is not the day to say \"not everything is a Russian plot,\" but Trump has no idea what an Open Skies Treaty is, and Putin's not gonna burn chips on an argument over that. There's lots of nutballs loose in this WH; not everything is an order from Moscow. \u2014 Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) October 8, 2019\n\nIs it possible that the Russians mentioned dumping Open Skies just to raise some hell in NATO and the EU? Sure. It's more likely that this is the anti-treaty mania that Bolton represented. Bolton and his minions hate treaties, in general. Bolton's gone, but the minions remain. \u2014 Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) October 8, 2019", "description": "On Monday, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) released a letter to National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien expressing his deep concern about \"reports that the Trump administration is withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty\" and urging the administration to abandon", "authors": ["Peter Weber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
