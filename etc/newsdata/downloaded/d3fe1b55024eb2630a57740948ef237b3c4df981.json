Liverpool don\u2019t want him, they\u2019ve got Jurgen Klopp. Pep (Guardiola) is at Manchester City, they don\u2019t want him.\n\n\u2018OK, if Real Madrid comes up he may fancy going to Spain, obviously being from Argentina. The language wouldn\u2019t be a problem and living in Madrid would be very nice.\n\n\u2018Managing a club like Real Madrid, if that came up I\u2019m sure it would be a difficult one for him to turn down.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer is under huge pressure at Manchester United (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018But other than that, I don\u2019t see where he goes. Manchester United? Maybe but Pochettino is not silly, he knows he\u2019s got a massive rebuilding job there.\u2019\n\nTottenham were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Colchester United last month and suffered a demoralising 3-0 defeat to Brighton before the international break.\n\nSpurs are expected to oversee a clear-out in January and Redknapp fears a number of players have had their heads turned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The problem they\u2019ve got is that those players who wanted a move are maybe not playing particularly well,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Eriksen\u2019s form has not been what it was. I think he\u2019s a great player. There are a few of them who haven\u2019t been playing so well.\n\n\u2018The two centre-halves as well (Vertonghen and Alderweireld) \u2013 the two Belgian boys \u2013 they have to start performing as well.\u2019\n\nMORE: Bulgaria goalkeeper Plamen Iliev says England overreacted to racial abuse and the fans \u2018behaved well\u2019", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino would be 'silly' to leave Tottenham for struggling Premier League giants Manchester United, according to Harry Redknapp. The Argentine manager, who led Spurs to the Champions League final...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11791508091_1571139809.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
