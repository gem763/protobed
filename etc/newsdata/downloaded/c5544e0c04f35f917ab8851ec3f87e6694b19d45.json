Kaera said on its website that only package trips consisting of at least two elements, such as travel and lodging, were covered. Customers who booked only flight or only lodging weren\u2019t covered, it said.\n\nThe head of German unit Thomas Cook GmbH, Stefanie Berk, said she hoped that some of the company\u2019s operations, which include Neckermann, Oeger and Bucher travel brands, could soon resume operations. The company is seeking bridge financing from the government to keep operating while it restructures.\n\nIn Poland, Thomas Cook\u2019s unit, Neckermann Polska, said Wednesday it was filing for bankruptcy. About 3,600 customers were on vacations outside of Poland. Polish regional authorities are responsible for helping stranded tourists from their regions.\n\nNeckermann Polska cancelled bookings late Tuesday to Mallorca and to the Greek island of Zakynthos and cancelled all trips to all destinations on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile German airline Condor, another Thomas Cook subsidiary, said it has been promised 380 million euros ($419 million) in credit guarantees from the German government and the state of Hesse to enable it to meet its cash needs for six months.\n\nThe airline, which has 4,900 employees and is oriented toward leisure travel, says it remains profitable but needs ready cash to operate over the winter when bookings are lower. The airline said it was going to court to separate itself legally from the liquidation proceedings affecting its parent company so it could keep operating as an independent business.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The German and Polish units of collapsed tour operator Thomas Cook said Wednesday they were entering bankruptcy proceedings and shutting down normal business operations in the wake of the parent company entering liquidation in Britain.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/spain_britain_thomas_cook_98091_c0-90-2146-1341_s1770x1032.jpg?7b44c0743c8dc46809a075056014d3e938213701", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
