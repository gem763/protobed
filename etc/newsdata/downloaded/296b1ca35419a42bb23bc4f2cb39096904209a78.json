Companies that adhere to the Secure by Design code of practice can therefore prove their devices are secure, allowing the public to make informed decisions when buying and installing IoT products.\n\nThe code of practice is still in its relative infancy, and vendors can still ignore it, but the NCSC believes it can act as a template for ensuring that other emerging technologies are secured against current and future threats.\n\nx\"Let's use that model when we're thinking about quantum [computing], when we're thinking about aspects of artificial intelligence, when we're thinking about 5G. Let's use that model of working out how this digital economy is going to work and what action we can take to make it safer,\" Martin concluded.\n\nMORE ON CYBERSECURITY", "description": "When the internet was built, nobody anticipated the problems hackers and cyberattacks could cause.
