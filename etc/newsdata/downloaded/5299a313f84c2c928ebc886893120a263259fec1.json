Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\u201d\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing: Asia and Australia Newsletter\n\nThe president\u2019s abrupt decision overrode the objections of the Pentagon and State Department, which sought to maintain a small American troop presence in northeastern Syria, and caught even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top allies off guard. One of the top Republican hawks in Congress quickly castigated the president and promised to try to sanction Turkey if it followed through with its plans.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t see Donald Trump\u2019s name on the tweet, I would have thought it was Obama\u2019s rationale for getting out of Iraq,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a top backer of the president\u2019s, said on Fox News.\n\nAs with President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to pull out American troops from Iraq in 2011, Mr. Graham said, this would create a vacuum for remnants of the Islamic State, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and others to surge forward again.\n\n\u201cThis is a big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI will do everything I can to sanction Turkey if they step one foot in northeastern Syria. That will sever my relationship with Turkey. I think most of the Congress feels that way.\u201d\n\nRelated: Donald Trump - life in pictures (Photos)\n\nMr. Graham said he would also introduce a nonbinding resolution asking Mr. Trump to reconsider his move, which he called \u201cshortsighted and irresponsible.\u201d The president\u2019s assertion that the Islamic State has been defeated is \u201cthe biggest lie being told by this administration,\u201d Mr. Graham added.\n\nThe announcement set off a swift and bipartisan backlash from other lawmakers as well, with some of the president\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill taking to Twitter to denounce the decision, all while carefully avoiding the president\u2019s name.\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the House Republican leadership, called withdrawing United States forces from northern Syria \u201ca catastrophic mistake.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said it would be \u201ca grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.\u201d\n\nWithdrawing US forces from Northern Syria is a catastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens US security. This decision ignores lesson of 9/11. Terrorists thousands of miles away can and will use their safe-havens to launch attacks against America. \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Senate, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, previously relayed their displeasure with Mr. Trump\u2019s isolationist instinct in Syria in January, when it voted overwhelmingly to rebuke Mr. Trump over his planned withdrawal of military forces from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Trump came to office promising to get out of overseas wars, contending that the country\u2019s military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has been largely a waste of lives and money with little to show for it.\n\n\u00a9 Erin Schaff/The New York Times Senator Lindsey Graham on Capitol Hill in July. \u201cThis is a big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nA similarly sudden decision last winter to pull American troops out of Syria prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, accelerated his own planned departure in protest.\n\nLet us be clear: The president has sided with authoritarian leaders of Turkey and Russia over our loyal allies and America\u2019s own interests. His decision is a sickening betrayal both of the Kurds and his oath of office. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 7, 2019\n\nMr. Trump later walked back his decision to some extent, but has been frustrated not to be doing more to extricate the United States from entanglements in the region.\n\nHis latest decision came after a telephone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. American officials indicated that the 100 to 150 United States military personnel deployed to northeastern Syria would be pulled back in advance of any Turkish operation but that they would not be completely withdrawn from Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish forces in the area, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have been the most reliable American ally in the region for years, a critical element in recapturing territory once controlled by the Islamic State. But Turkey has long considered the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists and has lobbied the United States to abandon support for them.\n\n\u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Monday. \u201cWe stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.\u201d Now, he said, it is time to leave.\n\nThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nHe offered little sympathy for the fate of America\u2019s Kurdish allies: \u201cThe Kurds fought with us,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has been particularly irritated that the United States continues to pay to detain thousands of Islamic State fighters. For months, he has tried to pressure European states and others to take those fighters who originated from there, only to run into strong resistance.\n\n\u201cEurope did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cI said \u2018NO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.\u2019 They again said \u2018NO,\u2019 thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the \u2018sucker,\u2019 on NATO, on Trade, on everything.\u201d\n\nBut if Turkey moves against the Kurds, the S.D.F. could abandon camps to fight the Turks, potentially allowing some 10,000 Islamic State fighters, including 2,000 foreigners, to escape. United States military officers were trying to reassure the S.D.F. in hopes of avoiding such a scenario.\n\nCatie Edmondson, Eric Schmitt, Eileen Sullivan and Lara Jakes contributed reporting.", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump vowed on Monday to pull back from military involvement in the Middle East and leave it to others \u201cto figure the situation out,\u201d even as one of his strongest supporters condemned him for abandoning allies and emboldening regional enemies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIpbez.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1143&y=1540", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
