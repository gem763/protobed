In one of the most fun and evenly matched NFL games of the weekend, this battle of the big cats will hinge on the two noobs taking the snaps.\n\nRookie Monster\n\nGardner Minshew has been turning heads with his arm, not just his mustache. The sixth-round draft pick has gone from an afterthought to a leading offensive rookie-of-the-year candidate. After guiding the Jaguars to a nail-biting win over the Broncos last week, Minshew should be riding high on momentum.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have their own impressive 23-year-old QB in Kyle Allen. Since Cam Newton went down with an injury, Allen ranks third in the NFL with a 118.3 QB rating, causing some to wonder if he should remain the starter when Newton returns. Minshew isn\u2019t far behind at 106.9. While both quarterbacks have been stellar, Minshew has taken double the snaps as Allen this year, proving he can sustain his level of play. With rising star wideout DJ Chark by his side, Minshew has a slight advantage.\n\nDefense Will Be Key\n\nMinshew, however, will have his work cut out for him against the best pass defense in the NFL. Led by defensive backs coach Perry Fewell, who coached the Jaguars to the elite pass defenses the past two seasons, this Carolina unit could wreak havoc. The Panthers also lead the league in sacks at 18. Luckily for Gardner Minshew, they will be missing a key cog in cornerback Donte Jackson. Starting safety Eric Reid is also questionable.\n\nJacksonville will still be without their all-pro cornerback, Jalen Ramsey, who\u2019s dealing with a back injury and a trade request. Their 21st ranked pass defense has cratered without the all-pro. The defense, however, is tied for sixth in the NFL in sacks, and with the Panthers missing two starters from the offensive line, look for them to blitz young Kyle Allen into costly mistakes.\n\nThe Tale of Two Running Backs\n\nThe Carolina Panthers sport the NFL\u2019s leading rusher in Christian McCaffrey. The third-year running back is picking up where he left off last year when he scored 13 total touchdowns. McCaffrey will face a solid Jacksonville rush defense. They\u2019re one of 12 teams to allow fewer than 100 rushing yards-per-game this year.\n\nThe Carolina rush defense, meanwhile, is allowing 130 rush yards/game, bad enough for 24th in the NFL. The Jaguars have a running game that can take full advantage. Leonard Fournette\u2019s 225-yard explosion against the Broncos last week catapulted him to third in the league in rushing yards. Jacksonville averages nearly 30 yds/g more on the ground than the Panthers and their ground attack could be the deciding factor in this game.\n\nPrediction\n\nThis evenly matched game could go either way but look for Jacksonville to take advantage of the Panther\u2019s weak run defense. With Carolina\u2019s secondary and offensive line hobbled, Gardner Minshew and the Jaguars should be able to eke out another win:\n\nJacksonville Jaguars \u2013 20 Carolina Panthers \u2013 17", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/minshew-afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
