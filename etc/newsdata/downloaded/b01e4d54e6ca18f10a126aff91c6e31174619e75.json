Sometimes, however, the tricks that we think work wonders actually don\u2019t do a thing. We\u2019ve rounded up five such sex tips that are extremely popular, but don\u2019t really work the way they\u2019re meant to.\n\nNext Story : Indulge in luxurious oils with Lakme Salon\n\nIt\u2019s kind of sexy to hear affirmative moans. But you\u2019re taking it a little far if you\u2019re making noises that could wake up the neighbours. Loud grunting, groaning and screaming can be a bit unnerving and might just spoil the mood.Car sex can be exciting, but going down on your partner while he\u2019s driving is risky. What they show in the movies doesn\u2019t work in real life, so it\u2019s better to skip the road head and park the car somewhere safe to get things going.A few soft nibbles and light scratches can be tantalising, even encouraged. But when you go all-out crazy and bite/scratch your partner until you break skin, well, that\u2019s a strict no-no.By \u2018somewhere unexpected\u2019 we mean your partner\u2019s behind. Rimming, which means stimulating someone\u2019s anus during sex, is only fun when the other person is aware about it. Don\u2019t stick a finger up someone\u2019s butt without warning them about it.There\u2019s a dominant partner in every sexual relationship. But when that sexy, dominating personality changes into a rude taskmaster, it ruins all the fun. Don\u2019t be the person who orders his/her partner around and makes him/her do all the work.Using household items like a feather duster might work during foreplay, but cutlery items like forks rarely work. Pressing a fork into various different parts of your partner's body will only elicit an anguished grunt from him, so maybe steer clear of it?Sure, using tongue while kissing can be sexy... if you don't overdo it. Slobbering all over your partner, dipping your tongue into ears, and generally creating little puddles of saliva in various places on your partner's body can be quite revolting.Sure, things can get wild in the heat of the moment, and sure, pulling at your partner's hair might seem like a good idea, but refrain from pulling too hard. Not only can it be painful, but it can be quite a turn off too.Talking dirty is one thing, but when you start going overboard with the dirty talk, things go downhill really fast. Plus, dirty talking is an acquired skill; not everyone can pull it off, and you should definitely take baby steps where it is concerned.Spanking can be sexy if both partners are into it. If you're spanking your partner and he/she doesn't like it, it's not a good idea to continue. But if you've mutually agreed on the spanking, do it gently unless specified otherwise.", "description": "You\u2019ll find a million sex tips on the internet.
