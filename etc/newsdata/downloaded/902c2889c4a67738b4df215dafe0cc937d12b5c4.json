The results showed that while 59% of respondents are worried about their parents as they age, 54% have not discussed any aging plans with them.\n\n\n\nThe survey also found that when it comes to implementing care plans, 54% of adults do not live in the same city as their parents and have to consider remote options. Most are open to hiring in-home caregivers, but 81% say they have a difficult time trusting that the caregiver is taking good care of their parent.\n\nOther Findings:\n\n84% of respondents do not have any money set aside for their parents as they age\n\n58% of respondents said that the cost of care is their biggest concern when it comes to caregivers\n\n40% of respondents do not believe their parents are equipped to pay for their own needs as they age\n\n82% of respondents would consider hiring an in-home caregiver for their parents if it were at an affordable price\n\n\u201cMany people in this age group are known as the Sandwich Generation, because they are often caught in the middle between caring for their children and caring for their aging parents,\u201d said Dr. Adam Blackman, CEO and co-founder of Mavencare. \u201cFor this group especially, it\u2019s so important to start having these conversations with their loved ones so they can arrive at the optimal solution to ensure their loved ones\u2019 happiness and safety.\u201d\n\nAging can become a massive financial strain when families are not prepared. Mavencare\u2019s survey shows that 84% of respondents do not have any money set aside specifically for their parents\u2019 aging plans, and more than 40% do not believe their parents are equipped to pay for their own needs as they age.\n\nThe results show this generation views home care as the preferred option to care for their aging parents but have concerns about the quality of care. To ensure quality and peace of mind, Mavencare\u2019s on-demand home care technology matches seniors with heavily vetted caregivers \u2013 only 4% of applicants are accepted \u2013 who are specific to their care needs. For complete transparency, the Connected Home Care app provides families with real-time updates and houses all communication between caregivers, families and Mavencare\u2019s clinical team. In addition, its intelligent notification system uses predictive analytics to identify any potential issues from caregiver-reported data, and as a result, prevent avoidable adverse health events, including hospital readmissions.\n\nIn addition to working directly with families, Mavencare has partnered with payers in both New York and Massachusetts to collaboratively promote better health outcomes, enhanced client satisfaction and lower overall healthcare costs for seniors.\n\nMavencare provides services in Toronto, New York City and the Greater Boston area.
