REUTERS/Ann Saphir\n\nAfter cutting the Fed\u2019s asset holdings by more than $600 billion in the past two years, the time to expand again \u201cis now upon us,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the National Association for Business Economics convention in Denver on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banking system, even routine increases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest rates,\u201d Powell said.\n\n\u201cThis volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it,\u201d he said.\n\nPowell\u2019s remarks come on the heels of an announcement on Friday that Fed officials will continue injecting liquidity into cash markets until early November. Those daily operations in the repurchase agreement - or repo market - were scheduled to end this week.\n\nBorrowing rates in the repo market spiked to 10% from about 2.25% in mid-September after larger than expected tax payments and Treasury auctions increased demand for cash.\n\nAt that time, the New York Federal Reserve was able to stabilise rates by injecting cash into overnight lending markets through daily repo operations.\n\nBut investors, traders and strategists have wanted the Fed to deliver a more permanent fix to help minimize volatility through the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe market wants to be reassured that the Fed stands ready to add liquidity as needed,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nFALLING RESERVES\n\nFed officials had anticipated that its reserves, which shrunk after the Fed began reducing its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2017, would fall short of demand from banks. But they reached that point earlier than expected, in part because regulations have altered the level of reserves banks need to have on hand.\n\nAlthough Powell did not specify how much they would be adding to the balance sheet, he said he thought the equilibrium level for reserves, which is estimated to have stood at about $1.4 trillion at the time of the September volatility, is close to $1.5 trillion.\n\nSome analysts and strategists say that the right level is between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion.\n\nBolstering the balance sheet could help the Fed soothe markets through periods of potential stress expected through the end of the year, analysts say, citing a corporate tax deadline in mid-December, Treasury auctions in the fourth quarter and adjustments from banks worried about regulatory requirements.\n\nDemand for the daily repo operations has declined in recent days, suggesting that the Fed may have relieved the \u201cmost acute pressure\u201d that existed in the system, Cabana said. Term repo loans, with offerings of up to two weeks, also helped to provide some clarity for investors in need of cash, he said.\n\nPowell said on Tuesday the Fed would continue to conduct temporary repo operations as needed to keep rates under control.\n\nBut some analysts believe the central bank should consider the longer-term step of creating a standing repo facility, which would allow financial firms to borrow cash as needed at a fixed rate.\n\nSuch a facility could help to prevent a liquidity crunch by reducing the demand for cash reserves, said Joseph Abate, short rates strategist for Barclays.\n\nSome banks are currently holding on to more cash to meet liquidity requirements because they are concerned that Treasury bonds could need to be sold at a loss during a crisis, he said.\n\nIf firms knew that they could turn to a standing repo facility at the Fed any time they needed cash, they might feel comfortable holding more Treasuries and less cash, Abate said.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that banks currently hold more reserves than they need to,\u201d Abate said.\n\nFed officials discussed creating such a facility in June, but members disagreed over how the programme would be structured, which market participants interpreted as meaning it was not likely to happen anytime soon.\n\nPhiladelphia Fed president Patrick Harker said last month that the \u201cdiscussions are in their infancy.\u201d\n\nMinutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting, due to be released on Wednesday, could offer more clues into the options officials are leaning towards and how quickly they expect to act.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly showing a determination to act as needed to stabilise the money market,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question as to whether they\u2019re going to do a standing repo facility.\u201d", "description": "The Federal Reserve's plan to start adding to its $3.6 trillion (2.9 trillion pounds) bond portfolio soon is the clearest signal yet that the central bank is looking to deliver long-term solutions to address recent disruptions in key short-term funding markets.", "authors": ["Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438621575&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971Y1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
