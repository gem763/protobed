I do. I always wanted to be a teacher. I was fascinated by the knowledge they impart, the stories they share and the good they do. Just like our good old days of dreaming about we'd grow up to be, there are millions of kids out there who are already dreaming of nothing but a bright future and equal prospects, but here\u2019s the catch \u2013 for some, there\u2019s no finish line to their dreams in sight.\n\nWhen it comes to quality education, India still hasn\u2019t managed to reach the remotest towns and villages in the country. There are thousands of children, especially girls, that don\u2019t have access to education but are still dreaming big. They dream of being doctors in white coats, they want to see the stars but with no access to education, these girls are waiting for the window of miracles to open up.\n\nLuckily for girls like Anjali, Ganga, Zainab and countless others, MG Hector is taking it upon themselves to open these windows of opportunities for these little girls. With their new CSR activity \u2018Worth Waiting For\u2019, MG pledges to donate towards quality education every time a customer books an MG Hector. In partnership with IIMPACT, MG is molding the future of India with the education of one girl child at a time. As a gesture of gratitude, this short film 'Khwaishein' by MG highlights the \u2018Worth Waiting For\u2019 message, thanking each one of their customers who patiently wait for the two-week delivery period of the car.\n\nWatch this beautiful short film to know why an MG Hector is worth the wait!", "description": "Remember what you wanted to be when you were a kid?
