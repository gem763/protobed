REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo\n\nThat would be a stark contrast from a year ago, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments that the balance sheet reduction was on \u201cautopilot\u201d gave investors the impression the central bank was on a strict course of tightening monetary policy, with no flexibility to tackle concerns about market liquidity or slowing global growth.\n\nSince then, the Fed has shifted course, both on policy and in its messaging.\n\nIt moved from raising rates to cutting them. Officials moved from shrinking the balance sheet by $50 billion a month, which was viewed as an action to tighten policy, to growing it by $60 billion a month. And they did so with a strong message that the purchases of short-term bills are not intended to \u201chave any meaningful effects\u201d on the economy. The balance sheet now stands at nearly $4 trillion.\n\nInvestors waiting for updates from the Fed on Wednesday are now free to focus on what is usually the main attraction of the policy meeting: the direction of interest rates.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee is largely expected to announce a quarter-percentage-point cut to the central bank\u2019s overnight benchmark lending rate when it releases its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell will hold a news conference to elaborate on the decision half an hour later.\n\nA rate cut would be the third this year, bringing the policy rate to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75%. Investors will also be tuning in for clues as to whether policymakers feel like they have acted appropriately to address the potential headwinds to the U.S. economy or if more easing is needed.\n\nSome economists say the efforts to separate the discussion about the balance sheet from the question of monetary policy appear to be working.\n\n\u201cI do think the two issues are separate, and they have and will continue to try and reinforce that,\u201d said Karim Basta, chief economist for III Capital Management. \u201cMy main interest at the next meeting is more on the interest rate policy and how they might characterize the risks.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s messaging is intentional. In its response to the last recession, it paired its massive purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities with clear forward guidance that the goal was to lower long-term rates and stimulate the economy.\n\nThis time, officials are calling the purchases a \u201ctechnical adjustment\u201d and have couched nearly every mention of the initiative with a reminder: This is not quantitative easing.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s toolbox isn\u2019t just increasing or lowering the federal funds rate - it\u2019s also how they communicate with markets,\u201d said Nela Richardson, an investment strategist with Edward Jones. \u201cWords matter.\u201d\n\nNOT SO EASY\n\nThe balance sheet expansion program announced in mid-October is part of a concerted effort by the Fed to avoid a repeat of the liquidity crunch in mid-September that led to a spike in short-term borrowing rates. The Treasury purchases, combined with daily repo operations, are meant to resolve the liquidity issues so that they do not get in the way of the Fed\u2019s main job of setting monetary policy.\n\nBut some investors say it\u2019s not so easy to completely isolate those large asset purchases.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to send the signal to everyone else to think about them as separate,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura. \u201cI frankly have a problem with that.\u201d\n\nAlexander said he would like more clarity on how the Fed decides which assets it is going to buy when managing its balance sheet. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how they\u2019re thinking about this decision,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s efforts to improve liquidity in financial markets could stimulate the economy by boosting investors\u2019 outlook, said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist for BTIG. Some financial firms may feel more comfortable with making investments if they believe markets are operating smoothly, he said.\n\nBy snapping up short-term Treasury bills, the Fed also helped to reverse the so-called inverted yield curve, which happens when the yields on long-term bonds fall below those on short-term bonds. The pattern is typically viewed as a red flag for the economy because it has preceded every recession since the late 1950s. Some people might take the recent steepening as a sign that recession risks are diminishing, Emanuel said.\n\nConcerns, however, remain about the central bank\u2019s plan to ensure that money markets run smoothly through the end of the year and beyond.\n\nFor example, some investors will want to know how much officials discussed the possible creation of a standing repo facility, said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.\n\nThe Fed calmed money markets in mid-September by injecting cash into the overnight borrowing markets for cash, operations that will continue into next year. But some investors say they still have questions about what caused the volatility.\n\n\u201cIt does not engender confidence,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial. \u201cThe problem may be more systemic than what the Fed is suggesting.\u201d", "description": "When Federal Reserve officials conclude their two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, they may at last have succeeded in divorcing the actions they take in managing the U.S. central bank's massive balance sheet from interest rate decisions.", "authors": ["Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446414530&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T08R", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
