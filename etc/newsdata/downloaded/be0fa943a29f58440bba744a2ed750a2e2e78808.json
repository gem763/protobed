No matter how old we get, no one can stop us from grabbing the first day first show of these classics.\n\nOne such movie that all Disney fans are pumped about is 'Maleficent 2'. This story first started when 'Maleficent' was released in 2014 as a new take on the story of Sleeping Beauty. For those who don\u2019t know, 'Maleficent' was a kind-hearted fairy, who was deceived by the love of her life, Stefan. She then goes on to take a turn for evil and places a curse on his daughter, Aurora also known as Sleeping Beauty, in order to avenge her thirst for justice.\n\nThe first movie was loved by audiences as the relationship between Aurora played by Ella Fanning and Maleficent played by Angelina Jolie blossomed turning the evil into good.\n\nNow, the duo is back in Maleficent: The Mistress of Evil as a formidable Queen Ingrith played by Michelle Pfeiffer causes a rift between Maleficent and Princess Aurora. The story brings them together again as they must face new allies and enemies in a bid to protect the magical lands which they share.\n\nAs the trailer shows, the situation now is that Aurora\u2019s love, young Prince Phillip (played now by Harris Dickinson) has proposed marriage, infuriating Maleficent. Still, because she loves her adopted daughter, Maleficent accepts an invite to a royal meet-the-parents shindig and even wears a shawl to hide her horns. Phillip\u2019s dad King John (Robert Lindsay) is all about brokering peace between the Moors and Ulstead, though not his wife Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), the kind of ice queen who doesn\u2019t let anything go.\n\nThe movie has already hit the theaters and it is not only released in English but also in Hindi. In order to get the perfect voice for Maleficent in Hindi, makers chose actress Aishwarya Rai to dub for the lead role and we think she would make the perfect Maleficent if there ever was a Bollywood remake.\n\nSo, no matter if you like watching it in English or Hindi, it's time to book your tickets and enjoy the cinematic experience.", "description": "The duo is back in Maleficent: The Mistress of Evil as a formidable Queen Ingrith played by Michelle Pfeiffer causes a rift between Maleficent and Princess Aurora.
