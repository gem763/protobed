Actual news outlets noted the presence of unplugged Ethernet cables, like moon landing conspiracists pointing out suspicious shadows. It should be noted that similar absurdities directed toward Obama rocketed around the Internet after the bin Laden news broke.\n\nAppropriately, many Americans used to roll their eyes at the brazen pettiness of Fox news. During the Obama years, the network seemed constitutionally incapable of reporting positive news of any kind, or even dealing with anodyne developments rationally. \u201cThis is proof he\u2019s a Marxist,\u201d was a famed Fox line about Obama\u2019s decision to wear a tan suit.\n\nTrump is inspiring similar insanity now with Fox\u2019s opposites at the Times, Post, CNN, MSNBC, etc. I\u2019m no fan of Trump either, but this has gotten to the point where there\u2019s no longer anyplace to go, if you\u2019re looking for unslanted first-draft takes on news. I\u2019m increasingly forced to turn to the BBC and AFP to try to grab raw quotes and numbers before spin doctors in American outlets have a chance to salt news with hot takes.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Taibbi", "Rollingstone.Com Politics Political-Commentary"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-31"}
