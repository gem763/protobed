Under its current eligibility requirements, channels with more than 100,000 subscribers can be verified regardless of need for proof of authenticity.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nThat will change starting in late October, when YouTube will shift to verifying \u201cprominent\u201d channels that have \u201ca clear need for proof of authenticity,\u201d product manager Jonathan McPhie wrote in a blog post about the change.\n\nYouTube\u2019s previous verification policy \u201cworked well when YouTube was smaller, but as YouTube has grown and the ecosystem has become more complex, we needed a new way to verify the identity of channels and help users find the official channel they\u2019re looking for,\u201d McPhie said.\n\nAs a result of the new policy, some channels that already have the verification badge will no longer meet the criteria to be verified, YouTube says in a notice in its help center. There\u2019s no process to request channel verification. According to YouTube, channel owners who have been notified that they don\u2019t qualify anymore for certification will be able to appeal the decision.\n\nYouTube\u2019s new verification process encompasses several factors. Those include confirming whether a channel really belongs to the creator, artist, public figure or company it claims to represent; whether the channel represents a well-known or highly searched creator, artist, public figure or company; and whether it\u2019s a popular channel that has a very similar name to many other channels.\n\nYouTube provides different pointers for owners of non-verified channels to help distinguish their channels. Those include: using a unique channel name; using a high-quality image for the channel icon \u201cto make your channel look professional in search results\u201d; and customizing channel art and layout for a personalized look. Meanwhile, creators who believe that another YouTube channel is impersonating them can report it at this link.\n\nIn addition to the new verification process, YouTube will roll out a \u201cnew look\u201d for the verification badges next month, which it says will be displayed more consistently across the service (including on mobile apps) and will be harder to fake. \u201cThrough our research, we found that viewers often associated the check mark with an endorsement of content, not identity,\u201d McPhie explained.\n\nCurrently, verified channels have a check mark next to their channel name. The new verification badge will replace that, as well as the existing music note on YouTube\u2019s official artist channels.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
