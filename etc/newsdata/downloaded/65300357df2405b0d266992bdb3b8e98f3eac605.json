(AP) - When the Pitt Panthers went into halftime against Syracuse with an 18-point lead, quarterback Kenny Pickett didn\u2019t like what he saw and let his teammates know it.\n\n\u201cToo many smiles,\u201d Pickett said, recounting his impassioned halftime speech. \u201cI play this game real seriously. The game was far from over, so when I came in I saw guys smiling and I didn\u2019t like it. I just wanted to make sure we came back down to earth and got the job done.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers scored just three points in the second half, but that proved just enough behind a defense that registered nine sacks in a 27-20 victory over the Orange on Friday night, Pitt\u2019s fourth straight close triumph.\n\nThe Panthers entered the game ranked second in the nation in sacks with an average of 4.50 per game and now lead the nation with 36. The sack total was the most in a game for Pitt since 2001, and 10 players had a hand in them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been doing a great job playing off each other,\u201d said defensive tackle Jaylen Twyman, who was in on one of Pitt\u2019s 12 tackles for a loss. \u201cThere were a couple of times where I stepped up and made the quarterback move. We\u2019re just doing a great job playing off each other. We really appreciate each other. We\u2019re like brothers.\u201d\n\nPickett threw for 232 yards and two touchdowns, one of them coming on a trick play to put Pittsburgh ahead for good. He finished 18 of 33 with zero turnovers.\n\nPittsburgh (5-2, 2-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) had won its previous three, by a combined seven points, and two of those victories came in the final minute. This one was different until the end, with the Panthers gaining a 24-6 halftime lead and keeping the Orange at bay despite a tense final 2 minutes.\n\nClayton Welch hit Aaron Hackett for a 7-yard touchdown with 2:44 left to move the Orange within striking distance, and the Panthers averted a meltdown after Vincent Davis lost a fumble but was ruled down with under 2 minutes left near the Pitt 35.\n\n\u201cGreat team win. Our kids find a way to win,\u201d Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it the easy way. Nine sacks. This is what we\u2019ve done all year. Our kids have been relentless. And we missed some, too.\u201d\n\nSyracuse (3-4, 0-3), which had lost only once in its previous nine games in the Carrier Dome, is the only team in the ACC\u2019s Atlantic Division without a conference win and now has lost two straight.\n\n\u201cObviously, disappointing,\u201d Syracuse coach Dino Babers said. \u201cYou don\u2019t take any pleasure in losing. I appreciate the effort. We need to regroup. Right now, everybody\u2019s job is in jeopardy. It\u2019s not fair to keep playing the same guys if the results don\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nPickett hit a wide-open Aaron Mathews for a 43-yard score after a pair of laterals to give Pitt a 10-3 lead late in the first quarter. A.J. Davis, who finished with 103 rushing, scored on a 5-yard run with 4:53 left before halftime, and Pickett hit Maurice Ffrench for a 14-yard score with 23 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nSyracuse finally broke through early in the third after quarterback Tommy DeVito was hit hard and forced to leave the game in favor of Welch, a junior college transfer. Welch, who had broken two nice runs when inserted briefly in the first half, found Taj Harris down the left side on a third-and-9 play and Harris outraced the defense for a 94-yard score.\n\n\u201cThe outcome didn\u2019t come out like we wanted,\u201d Welch said. \u201cWe never gave up.\u201d\n\nTRICKERATION AGAIN\n\nPittsburgh stunned UCF 35-34 a month ago on the final play of the game with a play offensive coordinator Mark Whipple dubbed the \u201cPitt Special.\u201d Davis took a direct snap from center, ran to his left and flipped the ball to Mathews, who was headed right. Matthews, a former high school quarterback, then elected not to run, pulled up as he rolled right and found Pickett in the end zone. Against the Orange, Pickett did the throwing and Mathews the catching, though he did juggle it briefly.\n\n\u201cWe felt it was the right time,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cA great play by the entire offense. Great execution.\u201d\n\nSACKED AGAIN\n\nSyracuse has now allowed 35 sacks on the season, the most in the Bowl Subdivision. Ten Pittsburgh players were in on the nine sacks as they spread the pressure around.\n\n\u201cThey brought the house on Tommy. They brought the house on me,\u201d Welch said.\n\nSTREAK LIVES\n\nSyracuse extended its streak of consecutive games with at least one takeaway to 21, second longest in the nation. Jawhar Jordan recovered Ffrench\u2019s fumble on a booming punt by Syracuse\u2019s Sterling Hofrichter in the first half. The Orange have 46 turnovers in that span, 21 of them fumble recoveries.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPittsburgh: The Panthers have a swarming defense and an efficient offense with some gifted receivers like Ffrench (6 catches for 92 yards) and a solid quarterback in Pickett. That should make Pitt a threat going forward as they try to repeat as Coastal Division champions.\n\nSyracuse: The Orange\u2019s uptempo attack that\u2019s Babers\u2019 calling card is misfiring way too often and needs a quick fix before the season slips away. Welch finished 8 of 20 for 176 yards and two touchdowns. DeVito was 11 of 23 for 101 yards passing. Take away the long pass play and Syracuse managed 234 yards on 77 plays.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPittsburgh hosts Miami in a homecoming game on Oct. 26.\n\nSyracuse plays at Florida State on Oct. 26.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the Pitt Panthers went into halftime against Syracuse with an 18-point lead, quarterback Kenny Pickett didn't like what he saw and let his teammates know it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/pittsburgh_syracuse_football_28231_c0-171-2961-1898_s1200x700.jpg?997ce7d3ca5f79ed465552da4d0e06584afe4ea2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
