'I don't think it's right for tech companies to censor politicians in a democracy.'\n\nFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg addresses the audience at a forum hosted by Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service on Thursday\n\nIn recent weeks, Facebook has come under fire from Democrats and Senator Elizabeth Warren (above) for refusing to remove ads for President Donald Trump 's re-election campaign\n\nZuckerberg admitted that he had considered banning political ads from Facebook entirely, noting that the revenue they brought in was 'not worth the controversy' that they generated.\n\nHe explained that after careful consideration, he decided that banning political ads was not the right choice for several reasons.\n\n'Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover,' he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were many ads about political issues, such as healthcare and the environment, than about particular candidates.\n\nHe said that it would be difficult to determine where to draw the line in banning political issue ads, and ludicrous to allow anyone to have their say except for the actual candidates in elections.\n\nZuckerberg admitted that he had considered banning political ads from Facebook entirely\n\nHe explained that after careful consideration, he decided that banning political ads was not the right choice for several reasons\n\nZuckerberg said that while misinformation was a concern, he wanted Facebook to err on the side of free speech.\n\n'While I certainly worry about erosion of truth, I don't want to live in a world where people can only post content that tech companies judge to be true.'\n\nZuckerberg's remarks come as the company comes under increasing scrutiny from antitrust regulators and faces criticism from Democrats.\n\nWarren, in particular, has called for the company to be broken up, and blasted Zuckerberg for allowing Trump's campaign to run ads that she says are false.\n\nThe Trump ad, which also ran on Twitter and YouTube, claimed that Biden had promised Ukraine $1 billion if the country fired a prosecutor investigating a company linked to Biden's son.\n\nWarren's campaign ran this ad to protest Facebook's reluctance to censor Trump's ads\n\nLast week, Warren attacked Facebook's policy by running an ad on the social network with the false claim that that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump's re-election bid.\n\n'Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies - explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes,' Warren tweeted on Saturday. 'We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims.'\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also blasted Facebook after it refused to take down Trump's ad.\n\nThe Warren campaign ads, some of which feature a photo of Zuckerberg and President Trump together, link to a petition supporting her plan to break up major tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon on antitrust grounds.\n\n'Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,' one ad reads.\n\n'You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.'", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg's remarks came during an address on Thursday at Georgetown University, which he described as 'an unfiltered take' of his views on free expression and censorship.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/20/19853958-0-image-a-39_1571341431919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
