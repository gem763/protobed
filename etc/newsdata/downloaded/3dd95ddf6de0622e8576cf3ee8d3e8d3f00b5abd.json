Unstructured, uninformative and not very entertaining.\n\n\"People left after few minutes, wish we had. Having seen many great lit fest events, a shame this was so poor.\"\n\n(Image: Unknown)\n\nAnother tweeted: \"@CheltLitFest Debbie Harry interview was appalling. The interviewer was possibly the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. So many people left.\"\n\nA third posted: said: \"@CheltLitFest fantastic festival but what the hell was that Debbie Harry debacle? Walked out with loads of others! Worst ever. Disgrace!!!\"\n\nAnother agreed: \"Amazing to see Debbie Harry at @CheltLitFest but boy, was it poorly done. Terrible, disjointed questioning. Such a shame.\"", "description": "Blondie fans slammed the dry questions and boring answers given by Debbie and Chris Stein at the event", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Getty Images", "Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577664.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Blondies-Chris-Stein-Debbie-Harry-Discuss-Chris-New-Book-Point-Of-View-Me-New-York-City-And.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
