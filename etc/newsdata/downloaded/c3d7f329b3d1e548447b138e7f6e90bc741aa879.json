His tenure at the White House ended in his resignation in July 2017.\n\nHis appearance on the show, as well as his outfit choice, have gotten mixed reviews on Twitter.\n\nSome users called to boycott the show in the lead up to the show's premiere.\n\nOthers applauded the decision as a smart career move.\n\nTwitter was ablaze talking about his bright green shirt and shimmy during the show's intro.\n\nSome users tweeted that the shirt was his worst career decision.\n\nOthers called the choice criminal.\n\nSpicer was clearly in on the joke, and in a tweet before the show said that people \"won't forget for quite some time\" the outfit he wore.\n\nEven before the show's premiere, Spicer's \"Dancing With the Stars\" casting caused controversy. Some were upset that politics were being dragged into the show, while others felt that ABC was giving Spicer a platform after his infamous stint in the White House.\n\nThe 47-year-old has prompted criticism for questionable statements he made during his time in the Trump administration \u2060\u2014 he once claimed Trump's inauguration crowd size was the largest in history, which it wasn't, and defended Trump's false assertion that millions of people voted illegally.\n\nHost Tom Bergeron previously stated that he was unhappy with the producer's decision to cast a political figure, and said he hoped that the show would offer a \"joyful respite from our exhausting political climate.\"\n\n\"It is the prerogative of the producers,\" he said in a statement posted to Twitter in August. \"We can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it's their call.\"\n\nSpicer also appeared apprehensive about joining the show and previously denied that he would be appearing on the dance competition.\n\n\"It's a no,\" he said during a 2018 town hall promoting his memoir \"The Briefing.\" \"Zero on the rhythm. I wouldn't do that to the viewers.\"", "description": "People had mixed reactions to his appearance on the show, but it was his outfit choice that sent Twitter into a frenzy.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d802bcc2e22af2b23670882-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
