Scientists named it 'Greater Adria.'", "language": "en", "text": "The map of the world looked very different 240 million years ago.\n\nEarth's modern-day continents were joined together in one Pac-Man-shaped supercontinent known as Pangea, which eventually split into two fragments: Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. The former became Europe, Asia, and North America. The latter dispersed to form modern-day Africa, Antarctica, South America, and Australia.\n\nBut now, scientists have discovered the fate of a fifth continent that was born from Gondwana's bosom, which they named Greater Adria. A study published last week showed that geologic forces slowly shoved the Greenland-sized land mass underneath southern Europe between 120 million and 100 million years ago.\n\nThe continent was already half-submerged to start, but as it rumbled toward the Earth's mantle (the rocky inner layer of our planet), its top layer got peeled away, jutting up to become fodder for mountains in what are now 30 European countries.\n\nThe Istria region of Croatia.

As you push your arm under the table, the sweater sleeve stays behind, getting folded and jutting upward. The folded sleeve is the \"equivalent of the upper few kilometers of Adria's crust, and your arm is the plate that is now sinking in the mantle, hundreds or even thousands of kilometers below our feet,\" van Hinsbergen said.\n\nThose \"sweater folds\" became Eurasian mountain belts like the Apennines in Italy, the Dinarides in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Swiss Alps, the Zagros mountains of Iran, and the Himalayas.\n\nReconstructing Greater Adria's geologic history\n\nIn order to piece together Greater Adria's past, van Hinsbergen and his colleagues spent a decade aggregating geological data from countries across Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.\n\nNaturally occurring magnets in the Earth's crust can help scientists track 240 million-year-old tectonic-plate movements. When hot lava cools at the boundary between two shifting plates, it traps rocks containing magnetic minerals that align with the Earth's magnetic fields at the time. The rocks keep that alignment, so scientists can use their orientation to calculate where those magnets were on the planet millions of years ago.\n\nThe researchers looked at magnetic rocks from 2,300 ancient sites across the Mediterranean region. Then they used that data to create computer simulations of the movements of Earth's tectonic plates before, during, and after Greater Adria's descent into the mantle.\n\nThe researchers determined that the hidden continent broke off of what is now Africa 220 million years ago, then further splintered away from what became the Iberian Peninsula 40 million years later. By about 140 million years ago, van Hinsbergen told Live Science, Greater Adria was likely a string of archipelagos.\n\nAt that time, Adria probably looked like modern-day Zealandia, the minicontinent that underpins New Zealand's north and south islands. Only 7% of Zealandia is above sea level.\n\nRead more: Earth has a brand-new continent called Zealandia, and it's been hiding in plain sight for ages\n\nA reconstruction of what Earth's land masses looked like 140 million years ago.

They eventually became parts of Italy, like Turin and Venice, and the Istria region of Croatia.\n\nKnowing what the Earth looked like millions of years ago might aid the search for valuable mineral deposits\n\nAccording to van Hinsbergen, reconstructions of our planet's geologic history can help countries and companies looking to mine valuable mineral deposits because scientists can highlight regional patterns in the way certain magnetic materials are deposited in the Earth's crust.\n\n\"Metals, ceramics, building materials, everything came out of a rock,\" he said. \"You don't find the next gold or copper mine, or the 25 materials you've never even heard of that make your iPhone work, by taking a stroll in the woods.\"\n\nGeologic reconstructions could also help researchers better understand how existing mineral and ore deposits \u2014 ones we already know about \u2014 formed and where any remaining materials might be buried.", "description": "Millions of years ago, the supercontinent Pangea broke up into land masses that became modern-day continents.
