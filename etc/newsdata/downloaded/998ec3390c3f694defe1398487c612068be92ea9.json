As a result, it\u2019s a secretive place, and FDA officials declined repeated requests to tour the lab or speak with its leadership. An agency spokeswoman answered questions that The Enquirer submitted by email.\n\nIn the vaping investigation, the laboratory has received more than 400 samples of vaping products from 18 states, \u201cand those numbers continue to increase,\u201d the FDA said.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the vaping liquid products have undergone some form of evaluation, and additional testing on these and other samples continues daily,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cMany samples have contained little to no liquid, which limits the number and types of tests FDA is able to conduct on each submission.\u201d\n\nDiscontinued: E-cigarette sales discontinued at Walgreens, Kroger as crisis continues\n\nThe lab is testing the cartridges for chemicals \u201cincluding nicotine, THC and other cannabinoids, opioids, cutting agents/diluents and other additives, pesticides, poisons and toxins.\u201d\n\n\u201cSample results to date have not identified a single substance associated with all illnesses,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cIdentifying compounds present in the samples associated with illnesses will be one piece of the puzzle and will not necessarily answer all questions about causality, which makes our ongoing work critical.\u201d\n\nThe lab\u2019s website says the facility is the nation\u2019s \u201cpremier national forensic laboratory\u201d where scientists conduct \u201canalyses related to criminal, regulatory and counterterrorism investigations.\u201d\n\nSixty scientists work at the lab. Another 11 people work in administration, information technology, chemical hygiene and quality management. Among its high-profile investigations that officials were willing to reveal include examining seafood from the Gulf of Mexico for contamination after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nDeaths rise to 18: Vaping-related lung injury cases surge to 1,080\n\nThe lab supports the FDA\u2019s criminal investigations, enforcement and import operations as well as other federal and state agencies. It investigates \u201cproduct tampering, counterfeit and unapproved drugs, and fraudulent/adulterated FDA-regulated products,\u201d the FDA said.\n\nThe Forensic Chemistry Center\u2019s portfolio is growing so much that the FDA intends to start work in the next year on a laboratory expansion. The lab would get new equipment as well as more space, thanks to moving the FDA's regional office to the federal building downtown.\n\nThe lab\u2019s director is Doug Heitkemper, who received his doctorate in analytical chemistry from the University of Cincinnati in 1989. He has spent his career at the FDA and served as the lab\u2019s branch director for 13 years before taking the top job this year.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that 1,080 cases of lung disease have been confirmed in 48 states and one U.S. territory. Eighteen deaths in 15 states have been attributed to the illness.\n\nNew York and Massachusetts have banned vaping products in light of the lung diseases, and on Oct. 1, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine proposed a ban for the Buckeye State.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: US government lab in Cincinnati is investigating vaping cartridges", "description": "Sixty scientists are working to crack the mystery of what's causing a mysterious lung disease in people who use vape pens and cartridges", "authors": ["Anne Saker", "Cincinnati Enquirer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nEbzM1nA4bOpKop3VJYl8Q--~B/aD0yNzg7dz02ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/3e3bc458c54c165590eb9fadff4ebf7e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
