Photograph: Li Muzi/Xinhua/Barcroft Media\n\n\u201cEvidence of this is found in references throughout many multilateral global health policy documents to interpret \u2018comprehensive sexuality education\u2019 and \u2018sexual and reproductive health\u2019 and \u2018sexual and reproductive health and rights\u2019 to diminish the role of parents in the most sensitive and personal family-oriented issues. The latter has been asserted to mean promotion of abortion, including pressuring countries to abandon religious principles and cultural norms enshrined in law that protect unborn life.\n\n\u201cThese approaches undermine our shared commitment to sustainable development and to achieving health for all, leaving no one behind.\u201d\n\nEfforts to advance these policies at the UN, specifically at the World Health Organization, were \u201cdisturbing and must be challenged\u201d, the letter said.\n\nThe message called on governments to sign a joint statement \u2013 similar to one delivered to the World Health Assembly in May \u2013 that would be presented at Monday\u2019s meeting, \u201cand to work together to achieve an outcome document \u2026 that reflects our shared values\u201d.\n\nThe May statement was signed by the US, Brazil, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Haiti, Ghana, Nigeria and Iraq. It stated that references to sexual and reproductive health \u201ccause confusion and misunderstanding\u201d. It called on the WHO to \u201cfocus on terms that enjoy broad consensus among member states\u201d.\n\nRequests for comment on the authenticity of the letter from the US State Department and Department of Health and Human Services went unanswered.\n\nRevealed: the fringe rightwing group changing the UN agenda on abortion rights Read more\n\nThe Trump administration has made repeated attempts to dilute and remove language from decades-old UN agreements.\n\nIntense lobbying by US officials in April resulted in the removal of references to sexual and reproductive health from a UN security council resolution on combatting rape in conflict.\n\nThe US previously attempted to water down language and remove the word \u201cgender\u201d from UN documents.\n\n\u201cThis letter just shows how they are trying to erode international consensus and roll back the clock for women and girls,\u201d said Shannon Kowalski, director of advocacy and policy at the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just abortion that they care about, they care about women\u2019s ability to exercise autonomy over their bodies and about denying them critical access to the services they need.\u201d\n\nThat Pompeo and Azur both signed the letter suggests an escalation of the US strategy to undermine policy statements, she added.\n\nKeifer Buckingham, senior policy adviser for international public health at the Open Society Foundations, said that rather than an escalation, \u201cit could be them just putting out in public what they have been doing in private\u201d. She said the US was effectively sending a message of \u201cif you\u2019re not with us, you\u2019re against us\u201d, which could have funding implications.", "description": "Attempt to \u2018roll back the clock\u2019 condemned as governments are urged to oppose UN support for reproductive rights", "authors": ["Liz Ford"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a1ff53b055e43b6589ff264650b78b1827f5f43/0_358_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05ed406ccdf5e1ca8634db3071e08708", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
