The football players that we have now are amazing at what they do, but also they are not bobsledders or skeleton athletes. We are trying to create more opportunities for Nigerians.\"\n\nNafeesat Aliu, centre, performed well in the September tryouts session in Lagos.

Overall, they were last in the women's bobsleigh. Jamaica was just behind them, while Germany won.\n\nBut it is just the beginning.\n\n\"The hope is not only to continue to increase the awareness of the sport in the country but also in the continent and also let people know,\" said Adigun, \"that we can do this sport, even in Nigeria.\"", "description": "Women's bobsleigh team made Olympic history as the first Africans to compete.
