After all, this is the prime minister who in 2014 rewarded his hairdresser, Lino Carbosiero, with an MBE.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s Isabel \u2018Bells\u2019 Spearman, Samantha Cameron\u2019s Girl Friday \u2014 who organised Mrs Cameron\u2019s social engagements and clothes \u2014 who has been put forward for a gong.\n\nThe resignation honours list reported yesterday also includes Thea Rogers, former special adviser to George Osborne.\n\nHer contribution to the UK economy is unknown, but she is credited with changing his hairstyle and putting him on the \u20185:2\u2019 diet.\n\nThe fact is that Cameron has never made much pretence of upholding the integrity of the honours system.\n\nAs Leader of the Opposition at the height of Blair\u2019s \u2018cash for honours\u2019 scandal in 2006, he was careful not to make any hostages to fortune about how he would distribute gongs, saying only that it was time to \u2018stop the perception\u2019 that peerages could somehow be bought by big donations from the rich.\n\nPrivately, he later indicated that he was relaxed about rewarding big party donors. His dissolution list shows that he meant what he said.\n\nAmong those in line for awards are Ian Taylor, a businessman who poured hundreds of thousands into the Remain campaign, and has handed the Tories a reported \u00a31.6 million over the years.\n\nThen there\u2019s Andrew Cook, another high-rolling Tory donor, who donated up to \u00a3300,000 to Cameron\u2019s battle to keep Britain in the EU.\n\nCameron\u2019s final flourish is entirely consistent with the way he conducted his premiership.\n\nFrom the moment he entered Downing Street, he relished exercising his powers of patronage to benefit his friends.\n\nWitness the rewards for his old university mate Andrew Feldman, a man who has never stood for elected office.\n\nOn taking power in 2010, Cameron made him co-chairman of the Tory party and a life peer.\n\nHe then repeatedly protected his old friend when he ran into trouble, firstly when he was accused of castigating Eurosceptic Tory party members as \u2018swivel-eyed loons\u2019, and more recently over the scandal involving the suicide of a young party activist who is alleged to have been badly bullied by a party official known as the Tatler Tory.\n\nThe list once again illustrates that for the chosen few, screwing up is no bar to preferment.\n\nHis decision to reward three of the architects of so-called Project Fear \u2014 Will Straw, ex-Cameron adviser Dan Korski, and former chancellor George Osborne, who brazenly spread alarmist misinformation in the run-up to the referendum \u2014 is particularly egregious.\n\nWhen it comes to Straw, voters have twice delivered a damning verdict on his contribution to public life.\n\nFirstly in 2015, when, as a Labour Party candidate, he spectacularly failed to win a parliamentary seat in the constituency of Rossendale and Darwen; and secondly, this summer, when as director of Britain Stronger in Europe, he spectacularly failed to win the argument in the referendum campaign.\n\nYet Cameron wants to make him a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \u2014 an accolade usually reserved for highly distinguished and long-term national service.\n\nHere the former prime minister has clearly been willing to overlook the convention that resignation honours are issued only to members of the outgoing premier\u2019s political party.\n\nWhy, then, is Nigel Farage \u2014 the man who has done more than any other individual to get Britain out of the EU and who was on the winning side of the argument in the referendum \u2014 not on the list?\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Korski, a former deputy director of the Downing Street Policy Unit who was seconded to the Remain campaign, has been put forward for a CBE.\n\nThis is despite his disgraceful role in the ousting of British Chambers of Commerce director-general John Longworth for supporting Brexit.\n\nCameron\u2019s resignation honours also include a dozen or so spin doctors and special advisers.\n\nIn recommending gongs for these characters, the former prime minister is simply showing whom he valued most.\n\nCertainly, it is not the army of quiet volunteers who devoted years of unpaid service to his regime, organising cheese-and-wine evenings and cake stalls to raise a few pounds for the coffers, keep local party branches alive and help parliamentary candidates win marginal seats.\n\nCameron has instead rewarded a string of Downing Street insiders who have rarely had to leave the comfort of their desks.\n\nIt is believed that the former Prime Minister has requested knighthoods for businessmen Ian Taylor, left, and Andrew Cook, right, who have donated more than \u00a31million to the Tories\n\nThese elevated press officers may have done a decent enough job, but their public service could hardly be considered exceptional.\n\nSome names on Cameron\u2019s wish list are said to have raised eyebrows on the nomination committee, which may have something to do with the entire list being leaked to the Sunday Times yesterday.\n\nCameron must know this list will do nothing for his legacy. Then again, perhaps he no longer cares.\n\nHe and his inner circle blithely assumed they would be in power for another four years.\n\nNow he has been unceremoniously ousted from office, perhaps he sees these gongs as a small consolation prize for those he has brought down with him.", "description": "Never has the honours system seemed more discredited than it does today, as the former prime minister attempts to shower his friends with fancy titles, writes ISABEL OAKESHOTT.", "authors": ["Isabel Oakeshott For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/01/00/1325F64500000514-0-image-a-38_1470007339178.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-31"}
