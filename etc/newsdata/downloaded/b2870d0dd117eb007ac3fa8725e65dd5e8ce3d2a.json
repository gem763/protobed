(AP) - Mike Fiers wants to show he can confidently take the ball in a wild-card game and pitch the Oakland Athletics into the AL Division Series.\n\nFiers struck out five and didn\u2019t walk a batter over eight dominant innings to win for the first time in four starts. The Oakland Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 8-0 on Friday night to maintain a two-game lead for the top AL wild card.\n\n\u201cI guess his elbow\u2019s OK,\u201d manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nChad Pinder hit a three-run homer in the second inning and Mark Canha also connected as the A\u2019s (93-61) kept their margin over Cleveland and Tampa Bay (91-63). Oakland is a season-best 32 games over .500.\n\nFiers (15-4) allowed two hits and faced the minimum, helped by a double play and a pickoff. The right-hander had gone 0-1 over his prior three outings following a 12-0 stretch over 20 starts that began with a no-hitter against the Reds on May 7. He exited his start last Saturday at Texas with nerve irritation in his arm and underwent an MRI on Tuesday. Fiers said his latest effort provided \u201cpeace of mind that I can go back out there and pitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last three starts haven\u2019t been ideal, so I want to show these guys I\u2019ve still got it,\u201d Fiers said. \u201cComing out today, I needed to make a statement and show them that I can still pitch.\u201d\n\nChris Bassitt struck out two in a perfect ninth to finish Oakland\u2019s 11th shutout in 2 hours, 38 minutes.\n\nCanha, a versatile outfielder team executive Billy Beane considers one of the season\u2019s biggest surprises, hit his 25th homer leading off the fifth. Canha and Marcus Semien had RBI doubles as Oakland won for the ninth time in 10 games.\n\nMike Minor (13-10) allowed six runs, six hits and four walks in five innings as Texas lost its sixth straight game. Minor also lost to the A\u2019s in Texas last weekend.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the stats are but when you don\u2019t throw the ball where you want to and you can\u2019t throw an off-speed pitch for a strike, it\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Minor said.\n\nMONTAS\u2019 STATUS\n\nFrankie Montas will be available to pitch for the A\u2019s on Wednesday at Anaheim after completing his 80-game drug suspension, perhaps in a relief role. The right-hander was 9-2 with a 2.70 ERA in 15 starts and 90 innings before the discipline, and he has been throwing up to 100 pitches on a starter\u2019s schedule at the club\u2019s minor league complex in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nMOTIVATED ANDRUS\n\nElvis Andrus grounded into a double play in the first and went 0 for 3.\n\n\u201cI do want to see him improve,\u201d manager Chris Woodward said. \u201cWe have a lot of question marks around the team for sure. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s immune to that if you\u2019re not producing. It\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRangers: While outfielder Joey Gallo could be activated from the 60-day injured list Sunday, the Rangers aren\u2019t sure it makes sense for him to return if his surgically repaired right wrist isn\u2019t strong enough for him to bat with the extreme torque generated by his powerful swing. Woodward said the Rangers might have begun his rehab process at too quick a rate and spoke with Gallo about the situation. \u201cHe\u2019s had too much progress this year to come back and play a couple games,\u201d Woodward said. \u2026 Texas selected the contract of C Tim Federowicz from Triple-A Nashville.\n\nAthletics: It\u2019s unclear whether RF Stephen Piscotty will be healthy from a sprained right ankle in time to play the rest of the season given he has been out since Aug. 25 and won\u2019t have a chance to get rehab at-bats. He also missed extended time with a sprained right knee from June 30-Aug. 2. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go down to the wire, I think,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cHe still has some challenges. There are certain days that he feels good and the next day maybe not as much. We\u2019re up against it here with nine left. It\u2019s going to be a challenge to do it but he\u2019s going to continue to work and try to be part of it toward the end.\u201d \u2026 RHP reliever Lou Trivino slipped away from the field and fell on his ribs and oblique. He hasn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 14 but played catch Friday. \u201cLou feels a lot better,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Sean Manaea (2-0, 0.50 ERA) makes his fourth start of the season for the A\u2019s after returning Sept. 1 from a yearlong absence following shoulder surgery. He has allowed one or fewer runs in his first three outings. Texas counters with LHP Brock Burke (0-1, 5.19) in his sixth career start, still seeking his first victory.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Fiers wants to show he can confidently take the ball in a wild-card game and pitch the Oakland Athletics into the AL Division Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/rangers_athletics_baseball_85223_c0-42-2700-1616_s1770x1032.jpg?1a7e909a6c155ad661205a4b85942063b87730fe", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
