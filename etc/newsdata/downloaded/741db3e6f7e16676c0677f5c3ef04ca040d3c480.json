So long as I have it tucked in my bag, I can work from any corner of the globe. It\u2019s an expensive piece of gear too, having set me back $1,500 a year or so ago. Protecting it on a daily basis, wherever I happen to be, is not optional but a must. Luckily, I\u2019ve found a brand of sleeves I can trust with the job: Knomo London.\n\nThe beauty of these products is in their simplicity. They\u2019re unassuming\u2014the sleeves will hardly draw unnecessary attention\u2014yet classic in design. The PU material offers a leather-esque look, which is soft to touch. They\u2019re also available in an array of understated tones from bronze to gold. I chose silver, which appears more gray in practice, but dazzles all the same.\n\nAround the edge of the Knomo 12\u201d sleeve, there\u2019s visible stitching, a flair that follows through to the tag on the zip. This manufacturing choice accentuates the designer vibe of the sleeve, as though it was custom-made for you and, of course, your precious laptop. Top and center, you\u2019ll find the only decoration: subtle debossed lettering saying \u2018Knomo London\u2019.\n\nWhen you unzip the sleeve and peek inside, you\u2019ll notice that it lacks the abundance of padding that you may expect from a modern-day laptop cover. The sleek and thin design showcases the inner workings of the sleeve, which are made from thick microfiber. Slide your laptop inside and you will find that the fit is tight and secure. Think of the sleeve as a protective skin that wraps around your tech to keep it safe and sound.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the habit of misplacing your stuff, there\u2019s yet another trick in the sleeve. Each Knomo product has a unique code stitched inside, which you can register online. Should you lose it and a good Samaritan find it, they can contact Knomo. The company literally goes the extra mile, picking up the lost product and returning it to you. Personally, I\u2019ve never had to use this safety net but it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s there, ready and waiting.\n\nAs careful as I am, I\u2019m human too. I\u2019ve knocked my bag into sharp corners, dropped it from overhead compartments (yes, really!), and made my fair share of mistakes. Each time, gripped with fear, I\u2019ve peered inside the sleeve, worried that my laptop would be collateral damage. Knomo has passed the test every time. Not a scratch or dent in sight. So, if you have a laptop worth protecting, I promise you can trust in this leading British brand. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
