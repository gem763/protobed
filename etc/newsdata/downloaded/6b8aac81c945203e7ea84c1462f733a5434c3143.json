Do as many launch control starts as you like. See you on the other side of Germany.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not the official instructions you might expect for a completely new model, and certainly not for an electric car. But the suggestion here was pretty clear. The Taycan sedan \u2013 perhaps the most eagerly anticipated car of the electric revolution \u2013 is driven solely by batteries, and weighs 2.3 tonnes as a result. But it can do anything any other Porsche does.\n\nAll charged up and ready to drive from Munich to Berlin.\n\nWe took up the challenge during the Australian media\u2019s first chance behind the wheel, pushing the Taycan hard over a wide range of roads and very changeable conditions (dry, moist and soaking). We used the launch control system to maximise the blast from rest to 100 km/h and well beyond. We cruised at close to the 260 km/h top speed on the unrestricted autobahns. We covered 750 kilometres on a circuitous route from Munich to Berlin and the only problem encountered was with the optional passenger instrument panel, which sometimes turned off for reasons not entirely obvious.\n\nThe only other Porsche as quick off the mark is the GT2 RS, at $645,000.\n\nBased on the European price, the range-topping Turbo S will likely cost $350,000 when it arrives here in about 12 months. A base model will perhaps be in the low $200s but, in keeping with marketing tradition, only the dearer variants (Turbo and Turbo S) are being offered while the car is new and demand is at its highest.\n\nThere is no turbocharger in an electric car, of course, but Porsche says the word has always been associated with the premium version of their model lines, and they\u2019re going to stick with it.\n\nThe profile bears a striking resemblance to the 911.\n\nThe styling of the Taycan (pronounced Tie, as in neck, and Cannes, as in French Riviera) is not as extreme as the Mission E concept that previewed it in 2015. It does without the suicide doors, as engineers couldn\u2019t achieve the necessary body stiffness without a B-pillar, but it does capture the stunning proportions.\n\nThe low body delivers a Porsche 911-style driving position, though that also means it\u2019s more a sports car than a family sedan to climb out of. The boot is big and the rear-seat passengers have reasonable space, thanks partly to what Porsche calls \u201cfoot garages\u201d. These are the gaps between the floor-mounted batteries that provide depressions for the passengers\u2019 feet.", "description": "Turn on the \u201cSports Sound\u201d, if you must \u2013 but this quiet achiever can take everything thrown at it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2102%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a3fa1d3ad2b980136c5b318bc4eef549d0034039", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
