Which in turn makes it very likely that Blastoise and Venusaur, or one of their previous evolutions, will also be able to Gigantamax.\n\nGigantamax-ready pok\u00e9mon are rare can be caught in the new four-player Max Raid Battles in Sword and Shield\u2019s open world areas.\n\nAs well as the physical transformation and improvement in stats, Gigantamax pok\u00e9mon are the only ones that get to use a G-Max Move, which is specific to each pok\u00e9mon and a powered-up version of one of their existing moves.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield is due for release on Nintendo Switch on 15 November and we\u2019ll have an exclusive hands-on preview tomorrow.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Galarian Ponyta is Pok\u00e9mon Shield exclusive, equivalent to Sirfetch\u2019d\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: are pok\u00e9mon being made into sausages?\n\nMORE: Nintendo might have accidentally leaked Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield evolutions", "description": "You might know about Dynamax in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield but some pok\u00e9mon can go even bigger, as images leak of Giantamax Pikachu.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EG-mzpZWsAAXkth-31af_1571213316.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
