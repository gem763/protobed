It is thought the event triggered wildfires over 900 miles away, as well as sparking a devastating tsunami.\n\nMany dinosaurs would have died that day, but others may have perished from the atmospheric fall-out that followed. Scientists think the earth cooled dramatically after sulfur was released into the atmosphere, blocking the sun and killing off life.\n\nThe new research was based on rocks collected in 2016 from the Chicxulub impact site off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nProfessor Sean Gulick, who led the study, told CNN: \"For me personally, successfully collecting the cores from the peak ring of the Chicxulub crater was the fruit of years of proposal writing and planning made reality.\n\nRead More", "description": "Scientists have found evidence that the impact of an asteroid as powerful as 10 billion WWII-era atomic bombs brought about the extinction of the dinosaurs.", "authors": ["Rory Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910122514-asteroid-impact-illustration-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
