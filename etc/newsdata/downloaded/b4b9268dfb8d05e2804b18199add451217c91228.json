More people are diagnosed with breast cancer in the united States than any other type of cancer. More women are diagnosed with it than any other place in the world. Breast cancer surgeon Dr. Kristi funk, the author of \"Breasts: The owner's manual\" and co-owner of pink lotus is back with the latest findings offering hope for the 250,000 diagnosed this please welcome back Dr. Kristi funk. Always enjoy you. Always appreciate it. Thank you so much. There's some real breakthroughs. Three in particular beginning with new medications. The Dru is this CD 4k inhibitor. They slow or even stop it. Two trials just reported out. All in advance stage cancer, hormone driven, her-2 negative. Half got the cdk incontinue Hore andplacebo. Three years down, 29% drop in death from breast cancer in the inhibitor group versus Mr. Seen bow. In this stage 4 group they haven't seen more than a 5% benefit in 25 years That's incredible. 29, take that, cancer. Absolutely. That is significant. Metastatic is no joke. All right. We often hear about our diet. How that can be helpful. What is new about that? Okay, so to eat or not to eat? That is the question. If you've had breast cancer and you fast 13 or more hours a day, you'll have a 36% drop in recurrence relative to someone who eats more -- fasts less than that so the key seems to be lower insulin levels. A new study recently showed in a bunch of mice all obese all injected with breast cancer cells and all eating the exact same diet this group could only eat eight hours a day, this one partied 24/7. What they found is that the injected cells became tumors way less in the time restricted feeding group. So it's literally science like in that backs the physicians committee for responsible medicine launching today the let's be breastcancer.org this encouraging women to take a pledge to follow a four-pronged approach to beating breast cancer. You can drop it up to 80% by choosing a month-based diet, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol, and watching your weight. Okay. I have to say, I love how you put the key to that. Because you think like 13 hours but if you get eight hours of sleep so if you make sure your last meal isn't too late. Stop eating at 7:00, breakfast is at 8:00 A.M. Now, what about implants? So, this textured implants have been recalled off the market so texture as opposed to smooth is leading to thankfully a very rare and low grade lymphoma so it's very curable but it definitely is caused by these implants. They're thought that harbor bacteria and create inflammation between the implant and the capsule that forms around it forming a fluid with abnormal cells that are lymphoma. Luckily it's very obvious. As soon as you realize it if caught early the complete cure is remove both. No chemo, no radiation, no death. If you have these seek a doctor if you notice a change. Your bottom line. Where are we? With these breaks and where are I think we're going to a place where we realize that only 5% to 10% of all breast cancer is genetic and have so much more control over this disease than provigil thought through diet and lifestyle interventions and for those affected with the disease we're really getting good at more biological targeted industry and you can visit online video or in person in California to talk about what you can do to control this disease. Yes. I love hearing that. Thank you.
