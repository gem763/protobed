They just have to do it in a fair manner. I would agree with you that China has not fully embraced free markets in this regard.\n\nI disagree with how the current administration is going about doing it though. It is going to be difficult to bully China into conforming to their American directives. Past administrations had issues with that. It is even more difficult when the approach is unilateral. Buy my debt...and eventually pay for it....is a tough pill for China (or anyone) to swallow.\n\nIs a recession, or perhaps a depression, needed to restore \"American\" global order? I don't buy into the scare tactics that \"all is lost\" if we share the lead...or take a back seat to China economically in some regards.\n\nI always thought that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a very good start in controlling China's influence, especially in Asia. The TPP had some very good trademark and copyright clauses in it. Unfortunately, politics...and not seeing the long-term took America in a different direction.\n\nTPP was shot down because it was said to be bad for the American worker. Now the American worker is being asked to accept tariffs and potentially brace for a recession/depression.\n\nAmerica needs to join TPP and multilaterally....through such trade agreements......bring China into the fold. I would prefer this approach over tariffs.", "description": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jackson-hole-notebook-talk-of-full-fledged-trade-war-growing-us-recession-risk-2019-08-24?mod=article_inline \" - 19411", "authors": ["Contributor", "Participant", "Follower", "Explorer"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
