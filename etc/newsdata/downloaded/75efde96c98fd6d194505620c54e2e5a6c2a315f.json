For seven athletes, Saturday\u2019s UFC 243 event marked that special moment in their career.\n\nCheck out this week\u2019s rookie report to see what kind of first impression those fighters made on the sport\u2019s biggest stage from Marvel Stadium in in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBruno Silva\n\nDivision: Bantamweight\n\nResult: Khalid Taha def. Bruno Silva via submission (arm-triangle choke) \u2013 Round 3, 3:00\n\nRecord: (11-4-1 MMA, 0-1 UFC)\n\nGrade: C+\n\nBruno Silva would prefer to compete in the flyweight division, but when the UFC calls, you take what you get, and that meant a bantamweight matchup against a very tough Khalid Taha.\n\nThe difference in power was evident at the start, with Taha\u2019s punches causing damage from the opening bell. To his credit, Silva turned to his wrestling to claim the second round and put the result in the balance of the third. Unfortunately, his energy level noticeably dropped, and Taha was able to the take the action to the canvas, where he set up an arm-triangle choke to finish the fight.\n\nSilva showed a willingness to engage and a strong wrestling game, not to mention some grit when it was clear he was down early, but he was simply overmatched here at 135 pounds. Perhaps the Henry Cejudo protege will get a chance to compete in his natural weight class next time out. Otherwise, it might be a tough run for him in the UFC.", "description": "Fighters from around the globe dream of the day they'll step into the octagon the first time \u2013 so how did the newcomers perform on Saturday?", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Ken Hathaway", "Mike Bohn", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brad-riddell-jamie-mullarkey-ufc-243-5.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
