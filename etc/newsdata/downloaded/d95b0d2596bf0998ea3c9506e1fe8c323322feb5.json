The indigenous groups allegedly organizing the riots have not offered an explanation for how the economic boost to the country specifically hurt indigenous peoples, but they have called for a march onto Quito and forced Moreno to move the government temporarily to Guayaquil on Tuesday.\n\nMoreno said on a broadcast Tuesday that he believed his predecessor, authoritarian socialist Rafael Correa, and Maduro were behind the \u201cdestabilization\u201d of his country.\n\nCorrea is currently a fugitive in Belgium, his wife\u2019s home country, after an Ecuadorian judge issued an arrest order on charges of having abducted a political dissident. Correa also faces significant questions regarding lucrative oil deals with China that Moreno claimed had left Ecuador, an oil-rich nation, destitute.\n\nCorrea is a television host on Russia\u2019s RT network.\n\nColombia, Brazil, Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru all published a joint statement Wednesday supporting Moreno and condemning Maduro.\n\nThe governments said they \u201cmanifest their sound rejection against all destabilizing attempts against legitimately constituted democratic regimes and express their firm support for the actions taken by President Len\u00edn Moreno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also reject all actions intended to destabilize our democracies on the part of the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regime and those who seek to extend the influence of his nefarious government project to the democratic countries of the region,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe OAS issued a similar statement of support to Moreno without condemning Maduro.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression and peaceful protest are fundamental rights protected by Inter-American regulations \u2026 However, it is indefensible that some actors use them as a right to violence, looting, and vandalism,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe General Secretariat of the Organization of American States (GS/OAS) strongly condemns the acts of violence recorded in recent days in Quito. The kidnapping of police and military personnel is totally unacceptable, as is the destruction and looting of public goods, the burning of patrol cars and attacks on ambulances.\u201d\n\nMoreno was the first to accuse Maduro of aiding the rioters, who have, as the OAS noted, also abducted police officers and soldiers attempting to enforce the current state of emergency Moreno invoked to quell the protests.\n\nSpeaking on a national broadcast Monday, Moreno called the riots an attempt at a coup d\u2019etat and linked Maduro to the leftist organizations conducting them.\n\n\u201cMaduro the satrap has activated, along with Correa, a destabilization plan,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThey are the corrupt ones who have felt the steps of justice getting nearer so that they have to be held accountable. They are the ones behind this attempted coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nMoreno insisted that the riots \u2013 which have featured lootings, business vandalism, arson, and violence against police \u2013 were \u201cnot a manifestation of discontent. The looting, the vandalism, and the violence show that this is an attempt to break the democratic order.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most violent ones are foreign individuals, paid and organized,\u201d he alleged. Moreno also claimed he had intelligence that Correa had recently visited Venezuela to meet with senior leaders there.\n\n\n\nEl saqueo y vandalismo no son manifestaciones ciudadanas.\n\nDemuestran la intenci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Correa, Maduro y de los corruptos que deben responder a la justicia y al pa\u00eds por desestabilizar este Gobierno democr\u00e1tico. #EcuadorPa\u00edsDePaz #DecididosACrecer pic.twitter.com/esyJv9RK5n \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno (@Lenin) October 8, 2019\n\nMaduro responded on state-sponsored television by dismissing Moreno\u2019s allegations as being \u201coutside of relaity\u201d and part of a conspiracy to \u201cprivatize everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLen\u00edn is brave when it comes to taking social benefits from people, brave in handing over his country, to hand it over to the International Monetary Fund,\u201d Maduro alleged, according to the radical leftist propaganda outlet Telesur, which branded Moreno \u201cvile.\u201d\n\nCorrea\u2019s response was to immediately demand a special presidential election and hint that he might run in it, despite having been term-limited off the ballot during the past round of elections and endorsing Moreno.\n\nFavor compartir.\n\nMensaje a mis compatriotas en estos momentos tan dif\u00edciles de nuestra historia.\n\n\u00a1Hasta la victoria siempre!#YoTambienSoyZangano pic.twitter.com/fXWSjd4cnh \u2014 Rafael Correa (@MashiRafael) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cI made a mistake with Moreno, the biggest scammer of our era,\u201d Correa said.\n\n\u201cThey have destroyed the country but we will rise, we will move forward we should all learn from this strong lesson \u2026 there was never a need for an aid package,\u201d Correa claimed. \u201cThe price of oil never fell, there was no natural disaster. It\u2019s all corruption and ineptitude.\u201d\n\nCorrea\u2019s allegation did not specify the need for a gasoline subsidy in the event that, as he said, there were no significant changes to the status quo.\n\nCorrea also appeared at the European Parliament on Wednesday, joking that it had relocated to Barquisimeto, a Venezuelan city, to mock Moreno\u2019s claim he had recently visited the Maduro regime.\n\nThe Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio reported that the national economy has lost $120 million a day since the protests began as of Wednesday, a total of $720 million. One person, a protester, died after being hit by a vehicle in an accident; rioters blocked the ambulance attempting to reach him and he did not receive first aid care in time to save his life.", "description": "Seven Latin American nations issued statements supporting Ecuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno amid leftist riots.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ecuador-rioting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
