Joseph F. Dunford Jr. speaks Wednesday at an observance of the 18th anniversary of the 9-11 attacks at the Pentagon. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nGen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who will retire this month, is that rare senior official in Donald Trump\u2019s Washington whose career and reputation don\u2019t seem to have been tarnished by his dealings with the president.\n\nThe explanation is simple: The low-key, Boston-Irish Marine maintained the distance and discipline of a professional military officer. He didn\u2019t try to be Trump\u2019s friend or confidant, and he stayed away from palace intrigue. The White House treated him with respect, and his fellow commanders came to regard him with something approaching awe: \u201cWe\u2019d all like to be Joe Dunford,\u201d says one four-star general.\n\nIn the ceaseless turmoil of the Trump administration, Dunford has been a steady hand who helped insulate national security policy from disruption and political pressure. His Pentagon colleagues say he will be keenly missed \u2014 several described him as the best chairman in recent decades \u2014 and they are hoping Gen. Mark Milley, his successor, can sustain the independence and cool judgment that defined Dunford\u2019s tenure.\n\nDunford doesn\u2019t like talking about his relationship with the White House. The closest he has come was probably a Pentagon news briefing last month: \u201cI\u2019ve worked very hard to remain apolitical and not make political judgments. . . . I work very hard to provide military advice . . . and make sure that our men and women in uniform have the wherewithal to do their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe Dunford is a man for all seasons,\u201d says Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary and a fellow Marine. \u201cJoe has a quiet mind, not easily distracted; he quantifies things, but he brings in the nonquantifiable. Still waters run deep in him. You simply can\u2019t shake his faith in his fundamental values.\u201d\n\nMattis cites two combat anecdotes to explain Dunford\u2019s unflappable style. In March 2003, on the eve of the invasion of Iraq, Mattis told Dunford that because of a last-minute change of plans, his regiment had to move out in five hours, rather than at dawn the next morning. \u201cHe just took it in stride,\u201d says Mattis.\n\nA few days later, Dunford\u2019s unit had fought its way to the Tigris River, with the loss of some Marines, and was ready to seize a strategic bridge. Mattis told him he had to fall back until conditions were safer for the assault. Dunford obeyed that painful retreat order without hesitation, Mattis says.\n\nDunford was born for the job. The son of a Marine who fought at Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War, he grew up in Quincy, Mass., a working-class suburb of Boston. Colleagues say he retained those grounded values throughout a rapidly rising career.\n\nGen. Frank McKenzie, head of the Central Command and another fellow Marine, remembers that Dunford faced a delicate problem as a young lieutenant colonel on the staff of the Marine commandant. He had to manage a popular but misplaced protocol officer. He promptly removed the officer, to the consternation of some politically powerful friends.\n\nDunford\u2019s dream was probably to become Marine commandant himself, and after he was appointed to that position in 2014, friends say he assumed it was his last military post. When President Barack Obama nominated him chairman in 2015, \u201che took the job with a Catholic sense of guilt\u201d to do his duty, says one friend.\n\nOn Dunford\u2019s desk as chairman, he placed the admonition of a venerated predecessor, Gen. Omar Bradley, who cautioned his staff that they didn\u2019t have the \u201cluxury\u201d of focusing on just one theater but needed to think globally. Dunford has prodded the different services and combatant commands to do just that \u2014 move toward integrated global strategy, rather than separate fiefdoms.\n\nDunford built a powerful joint staff to coordinate policy, directed by strong officers such as McKenzie and Adm. Michael Gilday, the new chief of naval operations. The joint staff\u2019s importance grew as the interagency process of the National Security Council decayed. Some grouse that the joint staff is now too powerful, but it helped fill a dangerous vacuum.\n\nIn dealing with Trump, Dunford\u2019s friends say his model was Gen. George C. Marshall, the celebrated wartime chief of staff to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Marshall didn\u2019t try to be FDR\u2019s pal, or laugh at his jokes, or join his social gatherings. Marshall simply did his job.\n\nOne four-star general recalls that Trump would sometimes ask Dunford whether he liked a particular policy option. \u201cI\u2019m not in love with any of them,\u201d Dunford would answer. \u201cMy job is to give you choices.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Dunford\u2019s legacy that in a time of national tumult and division, the military seems to have remained steady as a rock.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "It\u2019s his legacy that in a time of national tumult and division, the military seems to have remained steady as a rock.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs", "September At Pm", "David Ignatius Writes A Twice-A-Week Foreign Affairs Column."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ch9XpPRLOWmeqpD3fHYwXI_Mk_g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AUOZUFGVRQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
