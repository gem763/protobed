REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File Photo\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement he would look at the panel\u2019s recommendations and take appropriate action following the \u201cunvarnished and independent review of the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.\u201d\n\nMCAS UNDER SCRUTINY\n\nThe U.S. planemaker has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 MAX, or MCAS, which repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down in the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes while the pilots struggled to intervene.\n\nHowever, it has said erroneous Angle of Attack (AOA) data fed to MCAS - the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System - was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to the crashes.\n\nThe JATR report recommended the FAA review the stalling characteristics of the 737 MAX without MCAS and associated systems to determine if unsafe characteristics exist and if so, if a broader review of the system design was needed.\n\nJATR said MCAS and those systems could be considered a stall identification or stall protection system, depending on how the aircraft handled without them.\n\nBoeing has said MCAS was not meant to prevent stalls and was instead designed so that the 737 MAX would have similar handling characteristics to its predecessor, the 737 NG.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last month said it planned to undertake flight tests of the 737 MAX including a test without MCAS to check its performance during high-speed turns and stall.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBoeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both AOA sensors, and has added additional safeguards. If the AOA sensors differ by 5.5 degrees or more then MCAS cannot operate, FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell said last month.\n\nIf MCAS does operate it can only operate once unless the problem had been \u201ccompletely resolved,\u201d he added.\n\nThe JATR is headed by Christopher Hart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and includes air safety regulators from the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, European Union, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Japan.\n\nLast month, Hart said it was important to note \u201cthe U.S. aviation system each day transports millions of people safely, so it\u2019s not like we have to completely overhaul the entire system, it\u2019s not broken. But these incidents have shown us that there are ways to improve the existing system.\u201d", "description": "A panel of international air safety regulators on Friday harshly criticized the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) review of a safety system on Boeing's 737 MAX airliner later tied to two crashes that killed all 346 people aboard.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439707408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1BV", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
