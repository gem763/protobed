At the same time, inmates complained they had little heat during an extreme cold snap in the city, when temperatures dropped as low as 2 degrees.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut a probe by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice found that the heat problems had nothing to do with the fire or power outage \u2014 and that the jail\u2019s lack of proper equipment to monitor temperatures was actually to blame.\n\nPrison officials were aware of the heat problems, but failed to address them, the inspector general says.\n\n\"This report confirms that there have been longstanding management problems at MDC that must be rectified,\" said Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-Brooklyn).\n\nThe Sunset Park jail houses 1,600 men, most of them held before trial. Complaints at the lock-up during the power outage, which lasted from Jan. 27 to Feb. 3, sparked outrage from members of Congress and a lawsuit by defense attorneys.\n\nInmates were kept locked in their cells for long hours during the power outage and were barred from meeting with their lawyers or families, due to security concerns while most of the facility was in darkness.\n\nTemperatures in many areas dropped below the target of 68 degrees \u2014 while in other areas, prisoners were sweating in temperatures over 80 degrees. Inspectors said the lowest temperature recorded was 59 degrees a week before the fire, but that the readings aren\u2019t reliable because the jail lacks proper equipment.\n\n\u201cMany inmates housed in units experiencing these temperature regulation issues told the OIG that they were \u2018freezing\u2019 or very cold during the week,\u201d the report says.\n\nInmates were left shivering in jail-issued short-sleeved jump suits and T-shirts \u2014 unable to buy warmer clothes because the power outage knocked out the purchasing system. Sweat suits and long underwear are available only to inmates who buy them from the commissary.\n\n\u201cOnce management decided not to evacuate the facility, in light of the extremely cold weather that was forecast for that week in New York, management should have recognized the importance of ensuring that inmates had sufficient warm clothing and blankets given that the commissary was closed and that indigent inmates especially were unable to purchase additional clothing for themselves,\u201d the inspector general writes.\n\nThe power outage left prisoners who rely on CPAP breathing machines unable to use them for six days, until an inmate complained to a member of Congress and authorities allowed them to move to cells with electricity.\n\n\"I found it particularly striking that OIG found the heat outages were unrelated to the fire that had occurred at the building, suggesting these problems may be more widespread than previously thought,\" Rep. Vel\u00e1zquez said.\n\nThe report also found that tight-lipped jail authorities failed to inform inmates, attorneys and politicians on how they were handling the outages, leading to an escalating crisis.\n\n\u201cManagement failed to provide any meaningful information to defense counsel, the courts, family members of inmates, the public, and members of Congress about the conditions at the facility and the decision to cancel legal and social visits during the power outage,\u201d the report says.\n\n\u201cThis lack of information and associated confusion about the nature of the situation resulted in disruption by inmates inside the facility, protests outside the facility, congressional scrutiny, and rumors and speculation about the seriousness of conditions at the facility,\" the report continued.\n\nThen-warden of the Metropolitan Detention Complex, Herman Quay, was accused of lying about conditions there. He has since been promoted and a new warden was installed at MDC.\n\n\"I recently met with the new MDC Warden and am hopeful this leadership change will engender badly needed improvement at this long-troubled institution,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said. \u201cWe have a moral and legal obligation to ensure those in federal custody are treated fairly and humanely. Nothing less can be tolerated.\"\n\nIn a response to the investigation, the Bureau of Prisons says it will complete an upgrade to its heating, cooling, and ventilation equipment. It also agreed to begin giving inmates sweat suits and thermal underwear as part of their standard-issue clothing package until all the heating problems are resolved.", "description": "Protests broke out over conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Complex last winter, where a fire sparked a week-long, partial power outage.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a3/b3/c794a60d494a9118404b810a9d9e/metropolitan-detention-center-brooklyn-900-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
