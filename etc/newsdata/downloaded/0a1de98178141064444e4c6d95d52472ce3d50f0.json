But the couple, who\u2019d both spent their careers in corporate sales, didn\u2019t jump into the deep end all at once, either. Instead, theirs was a series of well-calculated baby steps.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: She\u2019s 63 and living by the beach in Mexico on $1,000 a month: \u2018I can\u2019t imagine living in the U.S. again\u2019\n\nFirst, the Rutherfords sold their 6,000-square-foot home in Parker and moved into a rental townhouse they owned in the same town. The new place was less than one-third the size (1,800 square feet).\n\nNext came the major downsizing tasks.\n\n\u201cWe made a purposeful choice to have less stuff,\u201d Amy Rutherford says. The couple began by donating carloads of items to Goodwill and selling furniture on Craigslist for pennies on the dollar.\n\nInstead of feeling deprived or missing the things they gave or sold, the Rutherfords say their new home has felt cozy and welcoming. \u201cTo us, physical clutter equaled mental clutter,\u201d says Amy Rutherford. \u201cOur collective things needed to be insured, maintained, repaired and cleaned. Opting to downsize provided us with a wider range of life choices.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, the couple sold their big house as well and said goodbye to their careers, retiring in their late 40s. And they have no regrets about the choice. In fact, Amy Rutherford gushes that \u201cthe past four years have been the best of our lives.\u201d\n\nThe money the couple has saved by downsizing has also been impressive.\n\nAmy Rutherford says that in their \u201cpast life,\u201d they spent an average of $115,000 per year. The biggest chunk went toward their home: mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and other costs. Now, they spend roughly $36,000 per year \u2014 and that includes more than 100 days of annual travel.\n\nAlso read: Why you need to downsize\u2014now\n\n\u201cOur intention wasn\u2019t to cut $6,500 a month from our spending,\u201d Amy Rutherford explains. \u201cWe just paid attention to where our money was going. Then we thought about ways to reduce or eliminate. Some categories went up \u2014 travel and health. Dining and entertainment went down significantly. Those were our splurges in the past.\u201d\n\nMinimalism has played such a big role in helping the Rutherfords enjoy retirement on their terms that they\u2019ve decided to make another big purge and sell their townhouse. \u201cThis time around, we\u2019re getting rid of things that are a little harder\u2026our bikes, my KitchenAid mixer, Tim\u2019s tools,\u201d says Amy Rutherford.\n\nBut she has been surprised once again: \u201cWith our goal in mind, it\u2019s not as hard as I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nAnne Chapple: \u2018Toward a simpler life\u2019\n\nAnother grateful minimalist: Anne Chapple, 66. After more than 30 years as an English professor, she retired two years ago and lives in Ann Arbor, Mich. Chapple now writes as a lifestyle expert for the personal finance website, Money Done Right.\n\nChapple describes weeding out her possessions as \u201cthe first step toward a simpler life.\u201d Inspired by famed declutterer Marie Kondo, when Chapple began her road to the minimalist life, she handled each possession in her home and kept only those that sparked joy. \u201cIf [it doesn\u2019t spark joy],\u201d Chapple explains, \u201cthen it\u2019s time to find it a new home. Simple as that!\u201d\n\nNetflix A woman sorts through all of her clothes on \u201cTidying Up with Marie Kondo\u201d on Netflix.\n\nBut, Chapple says, the process took six months and \u201cit was painful, no doubt about it.\u201d A big reason: \u201cI felt guilty about handing off things I\u2019d owned for years, especially mementos given to me by friends and family.\u201d\n\nChapple also found that getting rid of certain possessions was especially difficult. \u201cI have long been a collector of books,\u201d she explains. \u201cNot all of them bring me joy, to be honest, but they are important to me. In the end, getting rid of my library was more than I could do. My books had come to define me, and I couldn\u2019t part with them.\u201d\n\nChapple discovered, however, that it was much easier to part with items like clothing, furniture and things she hadn\u2019t touched for years.\n\nAlso see: Poshmark, eBay and Buffalo Exchange are cleaning up thanks to Marie Kondo\n\nShe also learned a better method for parting with her unneeded items. \u201cGifting them to friends felt much better than selling or dumping them in the trash,\u201d Chapple says.\n\nPracticing minimalism, Chapple notes, made her transition into retirement easier. She feels few regrets after downsizing and strongly encourages others do try it before retiring.\n\n\u201cShedding possessions and responsibilities lessens stress enormously and contributes to better health,\u201d Chapple says. \u201cIf achieving better health while saving money doesn\u2019t inspire those looking to their golden years, I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d\n\nRiley Adams: Saving time by living the minimalist life\n\nRiley Adams, a San Francisco-area based CPA and the millennial founder of YoungAndTheInvested, makes a living advising people how to achieve their financial independence and retirement goals. He and his wife also practice minimalism in their own lives.\n\nAdams says that while many people focus on the money savings with minimalism, he suggests considering its potential to save time.\n\nThere\u2019s \u201ctime saved from not shopping, from mental attention and time spent thinking of what you want to buy and from not needing to clean or maintain as many possessions,\u201d he notes.\n\nTo embrace minimalism while preparing for retirement, Adams says, it\u2019s important to \u201clearn to be content with less.\u201d\n\nRemember, too, that it\u2019s OK to move at your own speed. You might even join an online community of like-minded people for encouragement. You just may find that minimalism can be incredibly freeing \u2014 more than you might have ever believed possible.", "description": "For some, it has made retirement easier, cheaper, and more fun.", "authors": ["Michelle Black"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS143_na_min_ZG_20190926120121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
