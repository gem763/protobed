And while Tiffany, 25, did appear in a limited role while her father was first running for office, including at the Republican National Convention, she does not speak at his rallies, appear on TV or give interviews about his administration.\n\nPolitico reported in July that she was \u201cnot expected to play any role in the [2020 re-election] campaign, apart from appearing at the occasional event.\u201d\n\nThe abrupt departure of Madeleine Westerhout, President Trump\u2019s 28-year-old personal assistant, revealed there may be other dynamics at play.\n\nRELATED: What Trump\u2019s Assistant Madeleine Westerhout Said About Tiffany Trump That Forced Her Out of the Job\n\nMultiple news outlets reported that Westerhout was pushed out of her job after speaking indelicately about the Trump children at an off-the-record dinner with the press in August.\n\nSpecifically, according to sources cited by The New York Times and Politico, Westerhout spoke candidly about Tiffany\u2019s weight and how she looked \u2014 claiming Trump, 73, believes she is overweight and does not want to be photographed with her. (He later told reporters this wasn\u2019t true.)\n\nWesterhout, according to Politico, also told reporters that she felt she had a better relationship with Trump than either Tiffany or Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s eldest daughter and a senior aide.\n\nWesterhout had been drinking when \u201cin an uncharacteristically unguarded moment, she opened up to the reporters,\u201d a source told Politico.\n\nFrom left: Madeleine Westerhout, President Donald Trump and Tiffany Trump | Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images; Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images; Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images More\n\nMadeleine Westerhout | TIMOTHY A.
