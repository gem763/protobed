Beijing recently reinforced its People\u2019s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong with thousands of troops and authorized a new wave of arrests to intimidate peaceful demonstrators. In parallel, it reportedly blocked the Hong Kong government\u2019s proposal to work out a compromise with the city\u2019s massive and grassroots pro-democracy movement.\n\nWhat began as a protest against an unjust extradition bill backed by China has now become a fight for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and future. Yet what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong is not simply China\u2019s internal affair. The United States and other responsible nations are not watching from the sidelines.\n\nThe extradition bill is only the latest example of China\u2019s many broken promises to the Hong Kong people and the world. Most obviously, the Chinese Communist Party is preventing the city\u2019s government from acting with the autonomy that Beijing had promised it in a legally binding 1984 international treaty with Britain, under Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, and in China\u2019s diplomatic outreach to the United States and other nations.\n\nIn 2014, Beijing also backed off its commitment to allow Hong Kong citizens to choose their city\u2019s chief executive through universal suffrage, a provocation that sparked the city\u2019s massive Umbrella Movement protests. And in 2016 and 2017 , the High Court disqualified a total of six democratic lawmakers from their Legislative Council seats using a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong\u2019s constitution.\n\nThirty years after People\u2019s Liberation Army troops massacred reform activists and ordinary Chinese citizens on the way to Tiananmen Square, Beijing now appears poised to intervene overtly and aggressively in Hong Kong.\n\nThe paramilitary People\u2019s Armed Police \u2014 built up in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre \u2014 has thousands of personnel and vehicles in Shenzhen, just across the boundary between mainland China and Hong Kong. Chinese officials and state media have steadily escalated their warning rhetoric and outlined what they describe as the legal case for intervention based on \u201csigns of terrorism.\u201d An unsigned editorial in Xinhua, a state-run news agency reflecting the institutional voice of the party center, claimed that Hong Kong is engaged in a \u201ccolor revolution.\u201d\n\nThe world ignores these warning signals at the peril of the Hong Kong people and the hundreds of thousands of foreigners \u2014 including roughly 85,000 U.S. citizens \u2014 living in the city. China\u2019s leaders today are using the same messaging playbook that they have followed since they intervened in North Korea in 1950. We were surprised then; we should be prepared now.\n\nThe United States and the international community must make clear to Chinese leaders and power brokers that their aggression toward Hong Kong risks swift, severe and lasting consequences.\n\nIn particular, the administration should make clear that the United States can respond flexibly and robustly in Hong Kong. Our options are much more than just a \u201cnuclear option\u201d of ending Hong Kong\u2019s special status under U.S. law.\n\nThe Hong Kong Policy Act, authored by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and enacted in 1992, allows the president to apply to Hong Kong those laws that address the People\u2019s Republic of China. The law\u2019s power is selective and flexible, however, and not necessarily all-or-nothing for Hong Kong\u2019s special status. For example, the Tiananmen sanctions could be applied to target the city\u2019s police force, which has collaborated with organized crime, instigated violence and now might be torturing detained demonstrators.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s special status \u2014 and therefore Beijing\u2019s ability to exploit and benefit from it \u2014 depends on the city being treated as a separate customs area, on open international financial connections and on the Hong Kong dollar\u2019s peg to the U.S. dollar. The United States both administratively and diplomatically can constrain these conditions.\n\nThe administration also can impose sanctions against individual officials who have committed serious human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Act, which enables sanctions against foreign individuals or entities. In addition, Congress should pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill that I co-authored with Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). The bill, among other things, would mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city\u2019s autonomy are vulnerable to such sanctions.\n\nThe United States and other nations have options precisely because Beijing benefits from Hong Kong\u2019s special status. Indeed, the city has proved irreplaceable as a gateway for international finance, even as China attempts to build up a mainland alternative.\n\nChina\u2019s leaders must either respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and rule of law or know that their escalating aggression will inexorably lead them to face swift, severe and lasting consequences from the United States and the world. Today, that choice is theirs.", "description": "Beijing must respect the rule of law in Hong Kong or face the consequences.", "authors": ["Marco Rubio", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FFaE2vqpX8eFG8_FNOKRyTJlwxw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LHLFFAGORYI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
