She is pictured with her four youngsters on social media\n\nHe wrote: 'As one would guess, once the mother is separated from her children, desperation sets in, even with the brightest and most determined of mothers \u2014 and Megan Angelina Webbley was that bright and determined mother.'\n\nEdwin additionally urged 'enhanced funding for treatment in general' for people battling with opioid addiction.\n\nWhile the crisis is causing heartache in all parts of America, Vermont has been one of the worst states affected.\n\nAccording to Fox News, there were 114 drug overdose deaths involving opioids in Vermont in 2017.\n\nThat is a rate of 20.0 deaths per 100,000 persons - far higher than the national rate of 14.6 deaths per 1000,000 persons.", "description": "Edwin Webbley composed the piece for Seven Days on Monday - a week after mother-of-four Megan Webbley, 31, died at a treatment center in New Hampshire.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19600652-0-image-a-17_1570814894471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
