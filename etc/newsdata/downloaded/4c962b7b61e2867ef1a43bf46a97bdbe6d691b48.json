Greg Abbott (R) declared a state of emergency for portions of the state.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m sitting in right now makes Harvey look like a little thunderstorm,\u201d Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne told KTRK, an ABC affiliate in Houston.\n\nImelda, which developed quickly and made landfall Tuesday near Freeport, Tex., soaked the region with as much as three feet of rain. The National Weather Service declared a flash flood emergency for parts of five counties in the southeastern area of the state, calling it a \u201cPARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION\u201d and urging residents to \u201cSEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!\u201d\n\nA 19-year-old man drowned after being electrocuted, according to a statement from the family of Hunter Morrison that was shared online by the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The sheriff\u2019s office did not immediately provide further information.\n\n\u201cRight now my family and I are going through one of the most horrific times in our lives with losing Hunter,\u201d the family statement read, saying Morrison, of Beaumont, died while trying to move his horse.\n\nThe storm upended the lives of residents like John Smith, who had packed everything he and his wife owned into a 17-foot trailer this week, ready to hit the road for their new home in Florida.\n\nAround 5:30 Thursday morning, Smith and his wife woke up to see water rising along their street in the Southeast Texas city of Nederland. Over the next six hours, Smith watched anxiously as water from his flooded street inched closer to the couple\u2019s house \u2014 and the trailer containing all of their worldly possessions.\n\n\u201cWe flooded here during Harvey and I had to completely redo my whole house,\u201d Smith told The Washington Post. \u201cSo you can just imagine what\u2019s going through my mind at 7 o\u2019clock this morning when water was knocking at the door. It was literally half an inch from coming into the house.\u201d\n\nFor Craig Mullenix, the flooding that forced his family out of their northeast Houston home was a first. Mullenix, his wife and their two children waded through chest-deep water to reach a police boat, holding their two dogs and cats in cages over their heads.\n\nThey eventually made it to a community center-turned-makeshift shelter, where Mullenix held a wiggling, wet puppy amid dozens of other drenched people taking refuge.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t flood through Harvey or through the last storm,\u201d 53-year-old Mullenix said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t flood for Ike, didn\u2019t flood for Alison, which was in 2001. \u2026 But we flood now.\u201d\n\n[Capital Weather Gang: Flash flood emergency in coastal Texas as hundreds rescued from high water]\n\nAs authorities raced to respond to the crush of calls for help Thursday, the National Weather Service said an additional six to 12 inches of rain could fall in some areas. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 which has jurisdiction over Houston \u2014 said that as of noon dispatchers had received more than 300 weather-related calls, including 133 involving rescues from high water. Photos showed waist-high water in the city of Aldine, where officials retrieved employees and nine children from a day care, according to Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.\n\nClasses were canceled Friday in the Hardin-Jefferson Independent School District, while school officials in Houston canceled Thursday after-school activities.\n\nHouston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport has closed, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and is expected to reopen Friday afternoon. Flooding on the roads surrounding the facility Thursday forced the delay or cancellation of hundreds of flights, and no arrivals were allowed, according statements from the airport. Drivers sat stranded along the usually bustling Interstate 10 between the cities of Beaumont and Winnie.\n\nPatients were evacuated from a medical center in Winnie, where officials estimated to local media that 20 percent of the town\u2019s 2,500 residents had water in their houses.\n\nCurrent situation in Aldine. Please be safe, never drive into a flooded roadway. Please continue to shelter in place if possible. #HouNews #HouWX #Imelda pic.twitter.com/vXssXyOtao \u2014 HCSOTexas (@HCSOTexas) September 19, 2019\n\nFirst look at the SHUTDOWN part of i10 btwn #Winnie and #Beaumont.

In Beaumont, a city of about 120,000, police asked for patience as authorities tried to manage nearly 600 calls for service. They asked residents to stay off the roads, noting that \u201cmore people lose their life during flooding events by leaving a safe location (which may be taking on water) and driving into flooded streets.\u201d First responders were focusing on emergency situations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in strict lifesaving mode right now,\u201d Beaumont police spokesperson Carol Riley told the Beaumont Enterprise.\n\nWe are experiencing a high volume of calls to our 911/311 center. Please be patient, we are working extremely hard to get to those who need help! As daylight emerges, PLEASE DO NOT get out on the roads! As of 8:00 a.m. there have been over 590 flood related calls for service. \u2014 Beaumont Police Dept (@beaumont_police) September 19, 2019\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with poweroutage.us indicating that close to 75,000 customers lacked electricity Thursday afternoon.\n\nImelda is the first named storm to strike the area since 2017, when Harvey dropped a historic 60 inches of rainfall, causing catastrophic flooding. The hurricane caused at least 68 deaths and became the second-most-expensive hurricane in U.S. history, after Katrina.\n\nAshley Hale\u2019s childhood home in the Houston neighborhood of Kingwood didn\u2019t flood during Harvey. But it did Thursday \u2014 for the second time this year. In May, an unusually strong storm caused $30,000 worth of damage to the house, where Hale\u2019s 71-year-old father has lived for more than three decades.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s uncontrollably hysterical,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even really talk to him.\u201d\n\nDallas Thomas was also reeling Thursday as he learned from a Facebook post that Morrison, a former member of his youth worship group, had died in the devastation.\n\nThomas remembers Morrison as the kind and funny boy he tried to enlist several years ago in the band at a Lumberton, Tex., church where he used to work. Morrison played the drums, and Thomas was eager to recruit his talent.\n\nMorrison turned him down repeatedly. But Thomas learned after moving away that the teen later relented and joined.\n\n\u201cHe ended up being one of their really committed musicians,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe U.S. once forced this Native American tribe to move.
