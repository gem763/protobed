It was the first time that all of the remaining Democratic presidential hopefuls have shared the same stage on one night.\n\nBut the attention was almost all focused on one candidate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has emerged as the frontrunner after a slow and steady rise in her support, and who has crystalized her position in recent months as the party\u2019s intellectual and ideological center of gravity. Questions were framed around her policy positions, her past statements, her agenda; other candidates staked their claim to positions almost exclusively in relation to where Warren stands.\n\nEven on the rare occasions when Warren was not speaking, not directly being spoken to, and not being spoken about, her dominance hung over the conversation, making itself known in unexpected moments. At one point, a moderator, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, addressed another contender \u2013 Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar \u2013 by Warren\u2019s name. Klobuchar smiled and graciously deflected, but within minutes, she was bringing up Warren herself.\n\nWarren\u2019s new dominance reflects not only her slow but dramatic rise in the polls, where she is now besting the longtime establishment favorite, Joe Biden, but also a renewed Democratic political landscape in the wake of the opening of an impeachment inquiry against President Trump in the House of Representatives. At the debate, the impeachment proceedings provided a brief opportunity for unity among the ideologically divided candidates, with a softball opening question about the inquiry providing all of them an opportunity to voice their distaste for Donald Trump. But the unity ended there. From that point on, half of the stage dedicated themselves to the project of attempting to discredit Warren.\n\nShe was attacked by Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg over how she plans to pay for Medicare for All. She was attacked by Andrew Yang over her plan to break up big tech and enforce a strict anti-trust agenda. She was attacked by Kamala Harris, who alleged that Warren was hypocritical for, of all things, not calling on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account. She was attacked by Joe Biden for supposedly being \u201cvague\u201d on Medicare for All. She would have been attacked by Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for her lack of military experience, except Gabbard was cut off by a moderator.\n\nFor the most part, Warren weathered these attacks with patience, grace, and an agility in her rhetoric that rivals that of a gymnast on a balance beam. She refused to take the bait repeatedly offered to her by moderators and other candidates, who attempted to goad her into saying that she would raise taxes to cover Medicare for All. This denied her opponents a video clip that they could use to discredit her; instead, she hammered home the larger point that total costs would go down under her plan. She refused to get mired down in the petty point of whether or not Twitter should suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account; instead, she focused on how Big Tech companies have too much influence over our politics to go unregulated. She wouldn\u2019t concede Andrew Yang\u2019s dubious assertion that unregulated tech giants encourage innovation; instead, she focused on the ways that monopolies in all sectors of the economy\u2014she cited agriculture and pharmaceuticals\u2014need to be broken up to protect consumers.\n\nIt was a front runner\u2019s strategy, a deflection technique meant to avoid inconvenient commitments and stymie the attack strategies of her rivals. Warren made moral cases instead of economic ones, refusing to get mired down in the kinds of specifics that can only be communicated poorly and haphazardly to voters within the confines of the contentious debate format. To make her case in a general election, she will have to become more willing to communicate the specifics of her multitudinous plans on a mass scale, more ready to get down to brass tacks on television and on the debate stage. But Tuesday\u2019s debate was her first as the object of rivals\u2019 ire\u2014before tonight, her opponents had more or less held their fire against her. The discipline and poise she showed in this newly antagonistic role bodes well for her performance in a general election against the erratic and taunting Trump. He will bait her and goad her, and she will be able to calmly and convincingly remain on message.\n\nOther candidates, meanwhile, shifted their strategies in the wake of the new political circumstances. Buttegieg was newly combative, displaying a strategy of attacking the more progressive wing of the party that he had debuted in a series of left-punching statements made in the days ahead of the debate. He criticized Warren on her wealth tax and on Medicare for All, which he deemed impossible; he criticized former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke for his call to institute a nationwide buy back for automatic weapons, a prospect that Buttegieg deemed a \u201cshiny object.\u201d The message was that better things are not possible, and that Democrats, and Americans more broadly, must lower their hopes. It was hardly an inspiring assertion, especially considering that Buttegieg delivered it with sneering condescension, apparently impressed with his own callous brand of pragmatism. The combination of cynicism, contempt, and Buttegieg\u2019s extreme youth was disquieting. The South Bend mayor\u2019s debate performance conjured the image of a character in a dark teen drama, an ambitious prep school debate captain who would throw his best friend under the bus in order to secure his own admission to Princeton. In reality, Buttgieg actually graduated from Harvard.\n\nNot everyone performed so poorly. Booker and Castro made dexterous pivots into auditions for the Vice Presidential slot. Booker made pleas for civility and called on the candidates to unite against Trump; Castro made a concerted effort to expand the breadth of each question to include the concerns of marginalized communities, pointing out the role of police shootings in his answer to a question about gun violence and the role of class in response to a question about abortion rights.\n\nBernie Sanders, returning to the debate stage and effectively to the campaign trail after his October 1 heart attack, performed with a degree of mental acuity and physical vitality meant to convey that he is capable of continuing his run. After the debate aired, his campaign announced an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, billed for a rally this weekend in Queens. The heart attack seems to have effectively ended Sanders\u2019 meaningful bid for the presidency \u2013 at 78, the concern over his health is not only severe but also greater than it would be for other candidates, and Sanders was already falling in the polls before his hospitalization. But his fundraising remains robust \u2013 he led with nearly $25 million last quarter, trailed narrowly by Warren \u2013 and he will not be exiting the race soon. On the debate stage he signaled that he will be an advocate for progressive values throughout the primary contest and beyond. Sanders\u2019 endorsement will be coveted by whoever wins the nomination, and he will have an unusual degree of power in determining his or her agenda.\n\nStill other candidates seemed nearly ornamental. Tom Steyer, the billionaire impeachment advocate who launched a vanity run in July, effectively bought his way into the debate, where he was largely decorative.\n\nBut the most notable irrelevancy of the night was Joe Biden. Supposedly the candidate to beat, he was remarkably quiet on the debate stage, rarely mentioned and rarely called to speak. He mostly observed when the other candidates attacked Warren, looked on absently as she parried their attacks back at them. Over the three hours of the broadcast, the former Vice President was usually silent, frequently incoherent, and never able to get through a talking point without fumbling a poorly memorized phrase or mispronouncing an unfamiliar word. It was hard to imagine him as the president. It was hard, even, to decipher what he was trying to say. Joe Biden is a bit taller than Elizabeth Warren, but standing at the lectern next to his, she looked ten feet tall.", "description": "Warren weathered attacks from opponents with patience, grace and an agility in her rhetoric that rivals that of a gymnast on a balance beam", "authors": ["Moira Donegan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2caad94732f162894800d2fee368d6c8cbc8a8/0_69_2052_1232/master/2052.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=44302a916f4f95c36b960cf67c107c16", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
