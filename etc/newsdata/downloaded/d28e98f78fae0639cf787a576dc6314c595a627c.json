The company turns failing local hotels into Oyo franchises, provides some capital to redecorate and ensure there's functioning WiFi, then sells those rooms through its booking platform. The promise to hotel owners is a boost in occupancy rates and revenue.\n\nThe company has expanded to more than 80 countries, including China. It has more than 500,000 rooms on its platform, and says it's seen a 3.8 times increase in revenue growth year-on-year. It employs some 20,000 staff.\n\nThe firm has raised more than $2 billion in total, giving it a massive war chest to fund its expansion.\n\nIt has also attracted growing scrutiny from critics and the press, partly thanks to its apparent similarity to another SoftBank backed property business, WeWork. Scott Galloway, an NYU professor who has been heavily critical of WeWork, compared the two. \"Just like WeWork, OYO is a REIT [real estate investment trust] with too much SoftBank capital,\" he wrote last week.\n\nWeWork's CEO Adam Neumann announced at the end of September that he would step down and the firm was forced to delay its IPO after an onslaught of negative press about the business model behind its core office sharing offering, its valuation, and unconventional company culture.\n\nOyo's business has ballooned beyond budget hotel rooms to office-sharing, student accommodation, high-end Airbnb-style \"homes,\" upmarket business hotels, and even magazine publishing.", "description": "It is unusual for founders to buy shares back from their investors.", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b0872ee40e42bf804c777?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
