Cash was flowing as freely as Soylent as every Stanford graduate with a half-baked idea about a \u201cpinch point\u201d and a semi-plausible pitch book was lining up checks from venture capital firms. Into this mix came Washboard, a startup so utterly absurd that most of the news outlets that wrote about it (and boy did they write about it) took the trouble to clarify that it was, in fact, \u201creal\u201d.\n\nWashboard was designed to solve a real, if insubstantial, problem: it can be difficult for those who rely on coin-operated laundry machines to acquire enough quarters to run a load. Banks have limited hours, small businesses are not always obliging, and most apartment buildings don\u2019t have change machines. Washboard offered a solution: $20 in quarters, sent to you by mail each month, for the totally normal and understandable price of $27.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about Washboard this week amid the latest spate of headlines about WeWork and its co-founder Adam Neumann, who is walking away from the rubble of his startup with a $1.7bn windfall while thousands of his former employees are left to file for unemployment. (The co-CEOs who took over for Neumann last month have reportedly already negotiated multimillion-dollar exit deals of their own; about 1,000 janitors will lose their jobs to an outsourcing firm, according to the Financial Times.)\n\nWeWork\u2019s business model always made about as much sense as Washboard\u2019s. A charismatic CEO, Instagram-ready aesthetic and on-tap kombucha only go so far in papering over the cracks that arise when your company has no assets, tons of long-term obligations, and a customer base that only commits to short-term agreements in a highly cyclical market. That\u2019s all before you factor in Neumann\u2019s dilettantish side projects, penchant for extravagance and general mismanagement. The goose was cooked before anyone took an ill-advised tequila shot.\n\nWashboard was similarly, fatally flawed, though when I spoke to one of its co-founders, Caleb Brown, this week, he pointed out that his company did achieve something over its six-day lifespan that WeWork will probably never do.\n\nFrederick Douglass, MLK and Facebook: Zuckerberg has a bizarre take on history | Julia Carrie Wong Read more\n\n\u201cWe did make a profit,\u201d Brown told me by phone from Pittsburgh, where he now works as a technical recruiter. \u201cWe did better than WeWork.\u201d\n\nBrown, 32, said that Washboard had, to the best of his recollection, 41 paying customers before it shut down due to problems with its payment processor. Most of the markup on the $20 worth of quarters actually went to cover the cost of postage \u2013 \u201cshipping quarters is expensive because they\u2019re heavy,\u201d Brown said \u2013 but about $1.50 was pure profit, leading to a total operating income of $60. Add in a $1,300 windfall when Washboard sold its domain name to another startup, and you have a company that performed about 10 million times better than WeWork has so far.\n\nBrown has a sense of humor about his moment of internet infamy, and he didn\u2019t seem to mind when I asked him to compare his company with WeWork.\n\n\u201cThe parallels are that they started out as flawed business models,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the difference is that, for whatever reason, WeWork and Adam Neumann were delusional enough to keep pushing forward, whereas when someone asked me if I was thinking about raising money for Washboard, I said absolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to know, even if it\u2019s really early, that it\u2019s OK to shut something down,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s not working, you shouldn\u2019t WeWork it.\u201d\n\nTechnical difficulties\n\nWhen an Amazon warehouse worker put a product in the wrong bin, management saw it on camera and came to reprimand him within two minutes, but when the same worker collapsed from a heart attack, it took 20 minutes for anyone to respond, according to this new Guardian report on workplace fatalities at Amazon by Michael Sainato.\n\nMore than 100 companies are using a system that claims to leverage artificial intelligence to analyze job applicants\u2019 face movements and generate an \u201cemployability\u201d score, the Washington Post\u2019s Drew Harwell reports.\n\nMillions of students around the US are being subjected to constant digital surveillance, the Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports.\n\nSarah Emerson digs into the Menlo Park police department\u2019s \u201cFacebook Unit\u201d in a fascinating report for Vice.\n\nDispatches from Silicon Valley is a weekly column of reporting and analysis from the epicenter of the tech industry.
