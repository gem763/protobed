But how can we walk more in our busy lives?\n\nOur research shows people walk more if the city\u2019s design provides them with places to walk to near where they live, work or study.\n\nHow Much Walking Should You Do Each Day? They say any amount of walking is better than none at all. While that's true, a major health improvement requires more than the occasional five-minute stroll. So how much is enough? Here's what the experts think. Read more\n\nThe research also shows people walk even more if they live in a place that has good public transport and plenty of jobs or employment opportunities they can easily access.\n\nWhat gets us walking\n\nOur study examined walking behaviours in nearly 5,000 adult commuters in Melbourne, drawn from the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity between 2012 to 2014.\n\nWe looked at what level of access they had for destinations to walk to, typically within about 800 metres, close to their home, work or study place. This could be local cafes, shops, supermarkets, libraries and other services, often referred to as local accessibility.\n\nThe amount walked on an average day by those with good local accessibility at home or near where they worked or studied was around 12 minutes. Those with limited access to local facilities walked only seven minutes.\n\nPeople with good local accessibility near their homes walked five minutes more per day than those with poor local accessibility. People with good local accessibility near where they worked or studied walked nine minutes more.\n\nBut to get our activity to the next level we needed to look beyond what was locally accessible to people.\n\nWe looked at people\u2019s relative travel commute time by public transport compared with driving, the level of public transport service accessible from where they lived, worked or studied, and the number of jobs within 30 minutes of people\u2019s homes by public transport. These are sometimes referred to as measures of regional accessibility.\n\nWe found that the greater access people had to resources and public transport regionally, the more they walked.\n\nFor example, after accounting for local accessibility, people living in places with a higher number of jobs available within a 30-minute public transport journey walked just over four minutes more on average than people in areas with very low job availability.\n\nPeople living in places where taking public transport was more efficient timewise than driving, walked more than seven minutes extra a day compared with people with low levels of public transport.\n\nWhy Walking Is Almost As Healthy As Running It seems like common sense that if you want to lose weight and be healthy, running is a quicker way to get there than walking. However, as the New York Times points out, in some cases, walking provides a lot of the same benefits without the difficulty. Read more\n\nA little extra help\n\nOur study also looked at the combination of local and regional accessibility to see if they encouraged people to walk even more.\n\nWe found that high exposure to both local accessibility and public transport accessible opportunities beyond the immediate neighbourhood was associated with greater walking benefits than exposure to just one or the other alone.\n\nThis combination of factors supported people to do around ten minutes more (give or take depending on the measures used) of walking on average per day.\n\nWe know people who travel by public transport are likely to walk more than those who travel by car.\n\nPublic transport effectively separates people from their own vehicle, be it at home or a park-and-ride stop. Public transport delivers them as pedestrians close to their destination, which in turn promotes walking throughout the day.\n\nIf people walk more in their residential environment (say to the shops, library, or post office), take public transport to their workplace or place of study and then walk more in this environment too (at lunchtime for example), they do ten more minutes of physical activity in a day than their counterparts who drive.\n\nA message to planners\n\nThe message this new research tells us is simple.\n\nCity and urban design and transport planning have the potential to deliver a regular extra dose of what\u2019s been described as the \u201cmiracle cure\u201d of exercise by encouraging us to walk more.\n\nA variety of walkable destinations that support people\u2019s daily living needs to be designed into existing and, more importantly, new developments. That means at locations where we live, work, and study.\n\nStop Walking On The Escalator Escalator walkers and escalator standers are forever locked in struggle\u2014they are like toilet paper over-the-roll installers and under-the-roll installers, or GIF pronouncers, or one-spacers and two-spacers, only brought head to head every day in the malls, airports, offices, train exits, and sundry moving staircases of the world. And the real-world evidence, it seems, is on the side of the standers. Walkers are a bottleneck, and they\u2019re slowing each other \u2014 and the standers \u2014 down.

This will encourage walking, cycling and public transport commuting. When this is not possible, employment opportunities should be embedded within well connected and efficient public transport networks.\n\nCities that support people to walk more will provide population health benefits through increased physical activity, helping them to become truly smart and healthy cities.\n\nRebecca Bentley, Associate Professor, Centre for Health Equity, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne and Hannah Badland, Principal Research Fellow, Centre for Urban Research, RMIT University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.", "description": "We know walking more and increasing our levels of exercise are good for our health.
