We all have features we can trace back: piercing eyes from Mum, curly hair from Dad, a love of music from Granny and a lack of rhythm from Grandad.\n\nI can look at my face and divvy it up along my family tree. It is the bits we like least that we spot first \u2014 the bump in my nose, moles on my neck \u2014 but the most jarring inheritance, and the one I can\u2019t see in the mirror, is the Alzheimer\u2019s gene I got from each parent.\n\nThat is not its official name, of course. It is ApoE4, a mutation of the ApoE gene, which everyone has two copies of. About 25 per cent of the population have one ApoE4 allele, or variant, making them twice as likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s as those without.\n\nHowever, only 2 per cent of people inherit a double dose like me. This means I am up to 15 times more likely to get Alzheimer\u2019s, with a 60 per cent chance I\u2019ll have it by the age of 85.\n\nFlora Gill, 28, (pictured) shared the shock of discovering that she has a 60 per cent chance of developing Alzheimer's\n\nWhen the odds are less than 50-50, humans are good at assuming they won\u2019t be the ones affected. It is what allows so many of us to carry on smoking or eating fatty foods worry-free \u2014 we count on being in the lucky majority. But with a risk of 60 per cent, it is hard not to be haunted by it.\n\nThe genetic results were not something I went in search of. I took a DNA test because I was curious to peer into my family\u2019s past. When I was given an offer to upgrade and \u2018explore my DNA\u2019, I took the promotion without much thought. It sounded enticing, a behind-the-scenes look at my body.\n\nI don\u2019t have any grandparents left. I miss my two grandmas and one grandfather deeply, but I never met my other grandad. I spoke to him, ate meals with him, but he didn\u2019t know who I was because of Alzheimer\u2019s. I was a stranger to him, and so he could never really be a grandad to me. To be honest, I hated visiting him.\n\nWhen people develop Alzheimer\u2019s, parts of their personality can change: they may become mean or violent or sad in a way they never were before. Fortunately for Grandad, he always seemed happy; his sense of humour grew as his memories faded.\n\nDad would tell him stories of the memories he should have had, while he smiled as if hearing them for the first time. Sometimes, Grandad would speak to me, but I could never follow his train of thought, as if half the conversation was happening in a world I wasn\u2019t privy to. The idea of following this path always scared me.\n\nFlora (pictured with her father A. A. Gill) hopes for science to find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s, as online support groups continue to pop up for those wanting to share their 'diagnoses'\n\nWhen I saw my DNA results, I burst into tears. The duplicitous gene was hidden inside me. I could feel it travelling through my blood.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society recommends avoiding these genetic tests because of their emotional toll. It points out that many people with copies of the high-risk gene may never get Alzheimer\u2019s, while those without them may well develop the condition.\n\nJames Pickett, the charity\u2019s head of research, says: \u2018There has been little research into the consequences of people finding out about their genetic risk of dementia. It\u2019s a highly personal decision, but could cause great anxiety without the correct support. The first port of call should be a GP, not a genetic test.\u2019\n\nIt turns out I have a 60% chance of Alzheimer\u2019s by age 85\u2019\n\nWorldwide, more than 26 million people have taken a consumer DNA test, with the number predicted to rise to 100 million in two years. Many are blindsided when they receive painful news, and there\u2019s no help currently provided to those who do.\n\nDementia is already the country\u2019s biggest killer, having overtaken heart disease in 2016, and the number of sufferers will grow as we live longer. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that more attention will be given to those living with the condition. Yet, often, that does not seem to be the case, partly because those affected are not the photogenic poster kids for whom we run marathons and text donations, but the country\u2019s elderly, whom we so often hide away and neglect.\n\nLast week, the U.S. company Biogen announced it was seeking regulatory approval for Aducanumab, a new drug heralded as a potentially \u2018transformative discovery\u2019 for patients. If approved, it would be the first drug to actually slow the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nFlora who is the daughter of Amber Rudd (pictured) spoke to Anna, 28, who claims to be constantly reminded of her chances of getting Alzheimer's\n\nAs someone relatively young \u2014 I\u2019m 28 \u2014 my best hope lies with the scientists searching for a cure.\n\nFor now, in lieu of counselling, online support groups have sprung up for people who wish to share their \u2018diagnoses\u2019.\n\nMembers discuss what they can do to rebalance the odds in their favour, and swap information on supplements they take, food groups they avoid and routines they have adopted.\n\nSome theories revolve around the Nigeria paradox \u2014 citizens of the African country have a high prevalence of the ApoE4 mutation, and yet some of the lowest Alzheimer\u2019s rates, suggesting lifestyle can affect your prognosis.\n\nAnna, 28, spoke about how the test affected her. \u2018It\u2019s been months now, and every time I forget a piece of information, I\u2019m reminded of it,\u2019 she said. \u2018I literally have to tell myself dozens of times a day to enjoy the present.\u2019\n\nBrian, 70, finds himself offering comfort to others, sharing his mother\u2019s advice to \u2018think on the bright side\u2019. He doesn\u2019t regret knowing the risks he faces and recommends discovering all you can about your \u2018genetic deck of cards\u2019.\n\nFollowing Brian\u2019s suggestion, I tried to view my results as a chance to control my future. In terms of preparing for the worst, the only thing I could think of that would make having Alzheimer\u2019s more bearable would be having loving, kind people to care for me.\n\nWhen it comes to prevention, people recommend keeping an active mind by learning a language or doing crosswords.\n\nFlora (pictured) revealed she's trying to live life a little more healthily and wants her life to be an epic story to listen to if she forgets her memories\n\nBut the most effective course of action is generally agreed: don\u2019t smoke, eat well, exercise. Pretty much the things doctors tell us to do anyway.\n\nAfter my father, the food critic Adrian Gill, watched his own father slowly being taken by the disease, he became an ambassador for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. But he didn\u2019t have time to develop the condition \u2014 he died of cancer.\n\nDad didn\u2019t have time to develop the condition \u2014 he died of cancer\n\nDad never had a genetic test, but he still worried about developing the condition and, when I think about this, I realise how silly and unfounded my own fears are.\n\nMyriad things can kill you, and reaching the advanced age when Alzheimer\u2019s strikes is a privileged fear. Not everyone is lucky enough to live so long.\n\nThanks to scientific developments, current fears could be allayed long before you reach old age.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else we must remember, too. Genetic testing may confront us with odds we don\u2019t like, but it also serves as a reminder that we should pay far more attention to those already trapped by this terrible disease.\n\nAnd perhaps now I\u2019ll try to live a little more healthily \u2014 but not too healthily. After all, if I\u2019m going to forget all my memories and hear my life recounted back to me by familiar strangers, I\u2019d better make it an epic story to listen to.\n\nWords: \u00a9 The Sunday Times / News Licensing", "description": "Amber Rudd's daughter Flora, discovered that she has a 60 per cent chance of developing Alzheimer's by age 85, after taking a DNA test.
