(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration is taking major political heat for opposing Obamacare in a high-stakes legal challenge, which a federal appeals court could rule on any day now.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t always the plan.\n\nIt turns out the administration originally intended to embrace all of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 including its protections for patients with preexisting conditions \u2014 until an influential trio of conservative advisers convinced President Trump earlier this year to do exactly the opposite. The reversal of course has not previously been reported and sheds new light on how the Trump administration has struggled to uphold and message its health-care plans following Congress's failure to repeal and replace Obamacare in summer 2017. It also suggests at least some Republicans close to Trump are concerned about the potential political backlash and likely chaos if the court rules to strike down the ACA.\n\nHere's the sequence of events: Last December, a district judge upheld a challenge from nearly two dozen GOP-led states saying the ACA is unconstitutional. A three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is expected to weigh in next, in a ruling that is sure to reignite the ACA debate and that is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe White House has refused to defend the ACA in this case. But former administration officials say \u2014 and the White House has confirmed \u2014 that two options were on the table in March 2019, right before a deadline for the Justice Department to submit a brief to the appeals court stating its position in the case Texas v. Azar.\n\nThe administration's choices: side with Texas and other Republican-led states contending the entire ACA is unconstitutional and must be struck down, or with California and other Democratic-led states defending the ACA.\n\n\u201cFolks thought the current posture in court wasn\u2019t the best posture,\u201d a senior administration official told me. \u201cThe question was then put to the president: Do you want to side with Texas or California? It\u2019s pretty simple to see where he\u2019d come down on that.\u201d\n\nSo in a legal filing on March 25, three Justice Department attorneys argued the entire ACA should be invalidated. They said the government would file a brief supporting the Texas-led coalition pursuing the law's complete nullification.\n\nUp until then, the administration had taken a middle-of-the-road position on the lawsuit. It only partially agreed with the Republican-led states. In a legal brief filed in June 2018, the Justice Department argued there were grounds only to strike down the law\u2019s popular consumer protections, including those for people with preexisting conditions. But it also contended that the rest of the law should stand.\n\nDemocrats seized upon that stance, casting the administration as hypocritical for claiming to support preexisting condition protections while simultaneously refusing to defend that part of the ACA. And the attacks worked out well for them: They gained the House majority and kept Republicans on the defensive on health care through the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Joe Grogan, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe tricky political optics led to a deep divide within the administration. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, wanted the Justice Department to revise its position to support the entire ACA, said former and current administration officials.\n\nBut several White House advisers wanted Trump to swing in the opposite direction and side entirely with the red states. Former and current administration officials said that perspective was pushed primarily by Russ Vought, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Joe Grogan, head of the Domestic Policy Council, at the behest of OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cGrogan did that at Mulvaney\u2019s urging,\u201d a former HHS official told my Washington Post colleague Yasmeen Abutaleb.\n\nThe former official recalled that when the news reached HHS that the decision had been made to abandon all support for the ACA, appointees there \u201cwere royally pissed.\u201d\n\nHHS Secretary Alex Azar and Verma \u2014 who are much more well-versed in the ACA \u2014 worried about the terrible political optics and potential consequences of opposing the law. But Vought, Grogan and Mulvaney were more concerned about appearing to be out of sync with the Republican-led states challenging it.\n\nIt all came to a head in March, on a week that Azar was on vacation, another former administration official told me. Partially because Azar wasn\u2019t there to make his case, the Mulvaney/Grogan/Vought camp carried the day and persuaded Trump to side with them.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind for just a minute. This whole conundrum arose from a decision by Texas to try to unwind the ACA, after Congress tried but failed to repeal the law so reviled by conservatives. Texas filed a lawsuit in February 2018 arguing the entire law is unconstitutional because its penalty for lacking health coverage (the provision the Supreme Court used in 2012 to uphold it) is gone.\n\nIt\u2019s the job of the federal government to defend laws passed by Congress, so it was unusual when Justice agreed to defend only part of the ACA. As a result, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) stepped in.\n\nHowever the appeals court rules, both sides are expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, potentially setting it up for a hearing next spring or fall.\n\nBut this all could have played out very differently.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

There have been 12 confirmed deaths in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri and Oregon.\n\nFederal health officials have not yet linked any one e-cigarette or vaping product or any substance to the spate of illnesses, and a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told lawmakers the investigation has been challenging. Along with the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration is also working with the Drug Enforcement Administration in a criminal investigation of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cBased on initial data from two states, officials know that most patients reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana,\u201d our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. \u201cSome reported using THC and nicotine products, and some have reported using only nicotine products. But officials and clinicians have said patients, particularly younger ones, are often reluctant to share information about their use of illicit substances, such as marijuana.\"\n\n(iStock)\n\nOUCH: Andrea Goldstein, a lead staff member for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, said she was assaulted last week at the VA Medical Center in Washington, the New York Times\u2019s Jennifer Steinhauer reports.\n\nWhile at the center\u2019s cafe, Goldstein said a man \u201cslammed her below the waist and told her that \u2018you look like you could use a good time,\u2019\u201d she told the Times.\n\nHouse Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) wrote a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, urging an arrest in Goldstein's case.\n\n\u201cMs. Goldstein said she had just come from a meeting on Capitol Hill and was carrying in her purse the draft of a bill designed to curb sexual assault and harassment when she became a victim of it,\u201d Jennifer writes. \u201c\u2026 The incident underscores an intractable problem for many V.A. hospitals across the nation as they scramble to provide better health care for the rising number of women in the system.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Veterans Affairs Department said: \"These are serious allegations, and V.A. is treating them as such.\"\n\nOPIOID OPTICS\n\nU.S. District Judge Dan Polster. (Tony Dejak/AP)\n\n\u2014 U S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, set to oversee the landmark opioid trial in Ohio next month, said he will not step aside, Lenny reports.\n\nPolster responded to the claim from drug manufacturers at the center of the case that his comments in court, such as calling on both parties to settle so that any money could go to affected communities, were biased. In a written ruling, he said \u201cpublicly acknowledging\u201d the toll of the nation\u2019s opioid crisis \u201cdoes not suggest I am biased; it shows that I am human.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcknowledging the immense scope of the opioid crisis, and calling on all entities who have the power to ameliorate it to join me in doing so without delay, does not reflect any bias or prejudice toward any party to the litigation; and no reasonable observer would so conclude,\u201d Polster added.\n\nSTATE SCAN\n\n(iStock)\n\n\u2014 California\u2019s law to address surprise medical bills is the center of focus in Washington, where lawmakers are trying to address the issue at a national level. The law, which sets a payment rate for out-of-network doctors based on what other doctors receive, is similar to one approach being considered in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe parties who have watched California\u2019s performance disagree, sometimes vehemently, on whether the prospect is rosy or grim,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Margot Sanger Katz and Sarah Kliff report. \u201cDoctor groups, particularly those representing specialties like anesthesia and emergency medicine, argue that a national version of a law like California\u2019s would disrupt medical care so much that patients would have difficulty finding a doctor.\u201d\n\nA system like the one being used in California, often called benchmarking, is similar to the bills that have advanced out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nMargot and Sarah add that new data \u201cfrom California state regulators and other sources suggest that the situation isn\u2019t as dire as the doctors\u2019 groups describe. Since the California law took effect in 2017, there has been little evidence that patients\u2019 access to health care has suffered. In other words: Some doctors may be hurting from a pay cut, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be hurting patients.\u201d\n\nINDUSTRY RX\n\n\u2014 Patrick Conway has resigned as chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina after an impaired-driving arrest.
