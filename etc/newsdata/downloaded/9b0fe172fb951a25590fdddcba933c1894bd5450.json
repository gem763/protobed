The diesels use two catalytic converters to reduce nitrous oxide emissions in an effort to address concerns raised by VW\u2019s past issues with engines that run on the fuel.\n\nThe hatchback shares a strong family resemblance to previous Golfs, but is now only available as a four-door and comes packed with the latest tech. Along with a standard full digital dashboard, it features Car2X technology, which is a developing network that allows vehicles to talk to each other and the infrastructure to share their locations, road conditions and local hazards to better enable safety and future autonomous systems.\n\nThe new Golfs are also wirelessly connected to the internet, which allows for the type of over the air feature updates pioneered by Tesla.\n\nVolkswagen has sold over 35 million Golfs since it was introduced in 1974 as a successor to the Beetle, making it the third best-selling model of all time behind the Toyota Corolla and Ford F-Series. The 2020 Golf goes on sale in Europe early next year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Only sporty models confirmed for now.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
