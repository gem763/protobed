Representatives for striking Chicago teachers expressed hope following late-night bargaining talks and says the Chicago Teachers Union \"has laid out a path for a settlement\" that could reopen classrooms in the nation's third-largest school district. (Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune via AP)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago's mayor on Tuesday accused leaders of the city's powerful teachers union of using its \"political agenda\" to hold up a contract agreement to end a strike that will keep students from classrooms for at least 10 days.\n\nChicago Public Schools canceled classes for Wednesday after the Chicago Teachers Union's House of Delegates met to review the latest offer from the Chicago Public Schools and didn't vote on it.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said the teachers union's bargaining team demanded \"at the eleventh hour\" that she support state legislation to elect rather than appoint the district's school board, as well as changes to state law governing what the union can strike over.\n\n\"Are we really keeping our kids out of class unless I agree to support the CTU's full political agenda wholesale?\" Lightfoot said at a news conference. \"If the CTU wants a deal, there's a deal to be had right now on the table.\"\n\nDuring a second press conference hours later, Lightfoot said she met with the union's president and vice president during the day to present a sweetened offer, putting more money toward reducing class sizes and increasing long-time teachers' pay.\n\nLightfoot said the union officials left her office without a deal.\n\nA union spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to a statement that leaders issued earlier in the week, blaming the city for failing to bridge the financial gap between the proposals.\n\n\"It took a strike to get the mayor and CPS just to trade proposals to bring down exploding class sizes and alleviate desperate shortages of school nurses, social workers, counselors, librarians and more,\" that statement said. \"We shouldn't have to work this hard \u2014 and we shouldn't have to strike \u2014 to get our students what they deserve.\"\n\nThe heated accusations follow several days of contentious closed-door talks seeking to settle the strike, which has kept more than 300,000 students out of classrooms since Oct. 17 in the nation's third-largest school district.\n\nAbout 700 teachers that make up the union's elected House of Delegates met Tuesday night for an update on bargaining talks. Union officials going into the meeting said no vote was planned.\n\nThe meeting would let members discuss \"next steps to push Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the CPS bargaining team to reach a just settlement of this strike,\" they said in a statement.\n\nLightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, was elected on promises to invest in poor neighborhoods, address Chicago's troubled finances and improve schools.\n\nAs a candidate, she said she supported moving to an elected Board of Education rather than the mayor-appointed model that gives the city's top elected official enormous control over the school district.\n\nShe said Tuesday that the legislation that union leaders back is \"fundamentally flawed\" but didn't provide details.\n\nBoth sides have said in recent days that they made progress on the teachers' top priorities, including stricter limits on class sizes and additional staffing.\n\nThe union's General Counsel Robert Bloch suggested after a late-night session that ended early Tuesday that Lightfoot could settle the dispute by committing to more resources for schools.\n\nBut Lightfoot and the district's CEO, Janice Jackson, said union leaders are to blame for the impasse.\n\nJackson called the union's demand for 45 minutes of preparation time every day \"a last-minute grab to take away precious instructional time.\"\n\n\"There is no justifiable reason that kids should be prevented from going back into class tomorrow because we refused to reduce the length of the school day or the length of the school year,\" she said.\n\nAdding preparation time has been among teachers' demands since negotiations toward a new contract began months ago. But as they prepared to strike and set up picket lines, union officials and teachers more often spoke about reducing the size of classes and adding staff, including librarians, social workers and nurses.\n\nUnder the 2012 deal that ended the last major teachers' strike in the city, teachers surrendered some paid preparation time.\n\nElementary school teachers were guaranteed at least 15 minutes at the beginning of the school day under the contract that expired this summer. The union argues that teachers need more time to prepare lessons and says it's unfair to expect educators to do that work unpaid outside of school hours.", "description": "Chicago's mayor on Tuesday accused leaders of the city's powerful teachers union of using its \"political agenda\" to hold up a contract agreement to end a strike that will keep students from classrooms for at least 10 days.
