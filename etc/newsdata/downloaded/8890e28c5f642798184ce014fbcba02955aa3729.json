REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion group has been taking action in several countries including Britain, Germany, Austria, Australia, France and New Zealand as it lobbies politicians to go further in cutting carbon emissions.\n\nThe protests are the latest stage in a global campaign for tougher and swifter steps against climate change coordinated by the group, which rose to prominence in April when it snarled traffic in central London for 11 days.\n\nPolice said 152 arrests had been made on Tuesday, taking the total number over the two days to 471 as some protesters lay down in the road outside parliament whilst others dressed in colourful costumes or brought tree saplings to give to lawmakers.\n\nPolice have introduced stricter conditions, saying anyone wanting to continue the protest can only do so in Trafalgar Square.\n\n\u201cThis action is necessary in order to prevent the demonstrations from causing serious disruption to the community,\u201d police said. \u201cAnyone who fails to comply with the condition is liable to arrest and prosecution.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson criticised the protesters when he attended an event late on Monday.\n\n\u201cI am afraid the security people didn\u2019t want me to come along tonight because they said the road was full of uncooperative crusties,\u201d he said, using a slang term for eco-protesters.\n\n\u201cThey said there was some risk that I would be egged,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, some protesters hit back at him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not helpful,\u201d Diana Jones, from the southern English county of Sussex, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just ordinary people trying to express our deep disappointment with how slow the process of getting climate change action to occur is taking place, with the government not really listening, not really taking it forward on the scale it needs to be taken.\u201d\n\nThe group wants Britain to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 rather than the government\u2019s 2050 target.", "description": "London police have made nearly 500 arrests as climate-change protesters, labelled \"uncooperative crusties\" by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, continue two weeks of civil disobedience to push for more to be done to protect the environment.", "authors": ["Simon Dawson Helena Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438399298&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970LX", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
