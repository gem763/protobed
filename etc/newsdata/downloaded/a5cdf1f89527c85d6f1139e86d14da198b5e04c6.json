If you read it, you\u2019ll never forget 5-year-old Jack, who describes living his entire life with Ma in a backyard dungeon. We see their lives as an unspeakable ordeal of deprivation and rape, but Jack\u2019s mother makes sure that her son sees their tiny cell as a world filled with wonder.\n\nWith her new book, \u201cAkin,\u201d Donoghue returns to the story of a child and an adult trapped together. But the circumstances are far less bizarre, the constraints less intense. If \u201cRoom\u201d was a horror novel laced with sweetness, \u201cAkin\u201d is a sweet novel laced with horror. It\u2019s the story of a man learning late in life to expand his sense of family, to realize as never before who his kin are.\n\nThe protagonist is a chemistry professor named Noah Selvaggio who recently retired to avoid the risk of becoming a laughingstock. \u201cProfessor in his late seventies sounded rather admirable,\u201d Noah thinks, \u201cbut professor in his eighties?\u201d No thanks. That sensible decision epitomizes Noah\u2019s tough realism. Confronted with the challenge of filling unscheduled days in New York City, he decides to jump-start his new life with a trip to Nice, France for the annual Carnival. There, he plans to celebrate his 80th birthday and reconnect with his hometown, a place he hasn\u2019t seen since he was shipped off to America as a child to escape the Nazis.\n\nDonoghue steeps the opening chapter in nostalgia. Noah may keep a stiff upper lip, but he regards his life as something behind him. He still carries on ironic conversations with his late wife. And he\u2019s become fascinated by a collection of mysterious photographs taken by his mother in the early 1940s in Nice. Perhaps while he\u2019s there, he thinks, he can identify the places and people in these long-forgotten snapshots.\n\nBut Donoghue disrupts Noah\u2019s retrospective plans in the first 10 pages. Just days before he\u2019s set to leave, he receives a call from the New York office of Children\u2019s Services. The news is so unexpected that it\u2019s practically incomprehensible to him: Due to a series of tragic deaths and incarcerations involving people he barely knows, Noah is the only relative available to provide shelter to an 11-year-old grandnephew named Michael. Guilted into taking temporary custody of this sullen urchin and unwilling to delay his trip, Noah decides to take the boy along to France.\n\nYes, this odd-couple situation is contrived, but it\u2019s also continuously charming. A lifetime of scientific research and high culture have done nothing to equip Noah to care for a sixth grader. \u201cIt was exhausting,\u201d Noah thinks, \u201chaving to translate almost every word into vocabulary he imagined an eleven-year-old would know.\u201d He\u2019s distressed by Michael\u2019s bloody video games, his constant swearing, his horrendous grammar. And what on earth will he feed him \u2014 stuffed olives or marcona almonds dusted with rosemary?\n\nDonoghue, a mother herself, has a perfect ear for the exasperated sighs of preteens. Noah can\u2019t understand why Michael would rather stare at his phone than enjoy one of the world\u2019s most beautiful cities. All his attempts at conversation are hilariously awkward, an excruciating transcript of impatience, misunderstandings, missed intentions:\n\n\u201cDo you skateboard?\u201d\n\n\u201cSkate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you prefer skating? Ice or roller?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called skating, dude.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019m just asking whether you do it on ice or dry land.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author Emma Donoghue. (Nina Subin)\n\nEvery little breakthrough of friendliness is quickly followed by another argument, a spat of defiance, an embarrassing display of rudeness. Never having raised a child, Noah finds all this drama constantly bewildering. The phrase on Michael\u2019s T-shirt \u2014 \u201cWinter Is Coming\u201d \u2014 seems belated in February, but Noah gradually learns to choose his battles. \u201cHow could anyone bear to be a parent?\u201d he wonders. \u201cLike contracting to love a werewolf.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Michael regards his new guardian as a dinosaur, hopelessly ignorant of anything that matters, like tennis shoes or selfies. When he asks Noah, \u201cWhat\u2019s your Wi-Fi?\u201d the old man starts rambling on about his wife.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of this comedy at an old fogy\u2019s expense. But Donoghue doesn\u2019t just play it for laughs \u2014 or sentimentality. Part of caring for Michael, which Noah is determined to do, is trying to understand the boy\u2019s background. And that challenge draws Noah into a world of poverty, drug use and police corruption that are totally alien to his privileged life as a university professor. Before long, Noah begins to realize just how remarkable this boy\u2019s resilience is. \u201cBehind the braggadocio,\u201d he thinks, \u201csuch grief.\u201d Michael may not know anything about prawns or cheese, but he\u2019s knowledgeable about realms of experience that Noah didn\u2019t even know existed \u2014 and suddenly the oppression of a previous century feels distressingly fresh again.\n\n\u201cAkin\u201d offers little in the way of plot \u2014 certainly nothing like the terror of \u201cRoom\u201d or the boisterous adventures of Donoghue\u2019s 2014 novel, \u201cFrog Music.\u201d Instead, \u201cAkin\u201d is true to the quiet investment of time needed to win a child\u2019s trust. The movement here is the slow accrual of affection. Noah and Michael wander around Nice, annoying French waiters and suppressing their irritation with each other with varying degrees of success. For us, the reward stems from Donoghue\u2019s ability to wring moments of tenderness and comedy from this mismatched pair of relatives who never crossed paths in their own country.\n\nAt first, they can\u2019t appreciate their shared passion for photography, but that gradually becomes the novel\u2019s abiding concern. Michael uses his selfie stick to snap pictures of himself all over Nice; Noah, meanwhile, keeps trying to find the buildings and people captured in his mother\u2019s old photos. In their own ways, they\u2019re both looking for something essential in these images. Michael wants to create an identity, while Noah hopes to confirm his past. But as the old professor searches into the darkest corners of France\u2019s wartime trauma, he\u2019ll find his young charge more helpful than he ever expected.\n\nEarly in the novel, when the social worker first calls with her outlandish proposition to save this stranded child, Noah wonders, \u201cIn what sense could you really be kin to someone you\u2019d never met?\u201d By the end, he knows the answer to that question. Michael\u2019s life isn\u2019t the only one being saved here.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.", "description": "At 80, Noah thinks he\u2019s too old to save a child, but the child saves him.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World", "September At Pm", "Ron Charles Writes About Books For The Washington Post.
