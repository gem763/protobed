The new victims are thought to have come from the same herd.\n\nThe ravines usually fill up with gushing water during the rainy season.\n\nSompote said that the death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai. Eight elephants died at the same waterfall almost 30 years ago.\n\nThe elephant population at the park is estimated to be about 300.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wildlife officials in Thailand said Tuesday they have discovered the carcasses of five more wild elephants downstream from a waterfall where the bodies of six other elephants were found last weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/thailand_elephants_28671_c153-0-1682-892_s1770x1032.jpg?40a7b5a6e02201eabeb83d73e40aab502bdc7d03", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
