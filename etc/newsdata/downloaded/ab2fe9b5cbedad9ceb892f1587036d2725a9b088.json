The shares rose on news that Google had made an offer to acquire US wearable-device maker Fitbit Inc. But Alphabet shares two percent in after-hours trade to $1,264.\n\n'A hint of pessimism'\n\nGoogle has tried to demonstrate that its cloud-computing business is roaring, disclosing last quarter about two billion dollars in revenue and saying that plans continued to hire thousands for that unit to stoke growth.\n\nHaris Anwar, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com, said the quarterly results cast a cloud. \"An earnings miss at a time when the Big Tech companies are being probed for their business practices adds to the uncertainty and creates a hint of pessimism around the company,\" he said in an email to the Reuters news agency.\n\nIn hardware, Google's debut in May of the Pixel 3a - its most affordable smartphone yet - went well according to technology analysts. It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter.\n\nGoogle also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks.\n\nBut cash continues to be spent and higher costs loom as Google prepares for intensified clashes with regulators. Total expenses in the third quarter reached $31.3bn, about 25 percent higher than a year ago and topping the previous high of $31.1bn in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nGoogle has previously acknowledged investigations by the US Congress, Department of Justice and 48 states into the company's competitive practices. It settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIt also got an additional 90-day reprieve from an export ban that would restrict its relationship with Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, one of its top partners in distributing mobile apps.\n\nGoogle has said it is cooperating with the increased scrutiny, while saying that it has survived calls for increased regulation many times.\n\nAlphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total third-quarter revenue of $40.5bn. That was up 20 percent over last year. Net income for the third quarter rose to $7.1bn, or $10.12 per share.", "description": "Under intense regulatory pressure, the search giant looks to broaden its business beyond search, advertising and video.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/fd1d10200dcd413282a1d445b2dbf4ed_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
