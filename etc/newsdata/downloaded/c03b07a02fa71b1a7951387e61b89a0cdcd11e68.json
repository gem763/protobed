It can keep your mind sharp and your heart healthy.\n\nThe first was done in the United Kingdom and published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\nStress-relieving hobby\n\nResearchers pooled results from 11 surveys that included a total of 49 000 people. The investigators compared the health effects of walking and dancing, and found that moderate-intensity dancing was associated with a lower risk of dying from heart disease. Note that it took moderate-intensity activity to bring about these results, so if you're a fan of slow dancing, you'll need to pick up the pace.\n\nThe heart-health benefits of dance are likely due to its interval-training-like bouts of high-intensity movement and it being a stress-relieving hobby you can do for life.\n\nStimulates the brain\n\nWhile many kinds of dance can make for great calorie-burning cardio, a separate study published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience and conducted by researchers at a number of US universities found that learning dance choreography can confer cognitive as well as physical benefits.\n\nResearchers specifically looked at the effects of learning the steps of a country dance and found this can stimulate a key area of the brain and slow down natural brain ageing.\n\nBoth studies also restated the positive effects that stem from dance as a social activity, a known brain booster.\n\nWhile it's easy to simply turn on your favourite tunes and dance around the house, consider joining a dance studio and taking lessons. With all the styles available, from ballroom to ballet, square dancing to tap, variety will be built in.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "Studies have found that the heart-health benefits of dance are likely due to its bouts of high-intensity movement and it being a stress-relieving hobby one can do for life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9113/3107e157211843e4978886688bb7a130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
