It costs you almost exactly half as much to buy any given Cascade Lake-X CPU as it would have cost for its Skylake-X counterpart last year, in obvious response to AMD's Threadripper CPUs\u2014and likely in part to the Ryzen 9 3950X, due out in November along with the next generation of Threadrippers.\n\nSkylake-X vs Threadripper 2x\n\nWe don't have a firm set of specifications on the third-generation Threadrippers yet, but we can get a quick look at how Cascade-X compares with Threadripper 2000 below:\n\nIntel CPU Model Cores /\n\nThreads Base/ACB\n\nFreq TDP Price\n\n(1ku) AMD CPU Model Cores /\n\nThreads Base/ACB\n\nFreq TDP Price\n\n(retail) i9-10980XE 18/36 3.0GHz/3.8GHz 165W $980 TR 2990WX 32/64 3.0GHz/4.2GHz 250W $1,700 i9-10940X 14/28 3.3GHz/4.1GHz 165W $785 TR 2970WX 24/48 3.0GHz/4.2GHz 250W $1,220 i9-10920X 12/24 3.5GHz/4.3GHz 165W $690 TR 2950X 16/32 3.0GHz/4.4GHz 180W $700 i9-10900X 10/20 3.7GHz/4.3GHz 165W $590 TR 2920X 12/24 3.0GHz/4.3GHz 180W $380\n\nFor one example, this year's high-end i9-10980XE goes for $980\u2014and last year's 9980XE went for just under $2,000. We see roughly the same cost reduction across the board, down to the 10900X at $590 vs last year's 9900X at $990. This takes aim squarely at Threadripper. The interesting question is how AMD will respond with new Threadripper pricing next month; we already know the company at least pretends to enjoy playing elaborate price games.\n\nPCIe 3.0 lanes", "description": "Cascade Lake-X is considerably faster than Skylake-X, at half the cost.", "authors": ["Jim Salter"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cascade-x-hero-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
