Pence appears to have been the guy to connect those things explicitly to the president.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton Diagnoses Trumps Mental State on The View\n\nWhen Maddow suggested that Pence could be \u201cimpeached too,\u201d Joy Behar chimed in with, \u201cThen it\u2019s President Nancy Pelosi!\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, that's a true fever dream of yours, Joy,\u201d Meghan McCain replied, before pivoting to try to get Maddow to agree that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) \u201cmuddied the waters\u201d on impeachment by saying he had not been in direct contact with the whistleblower when that wasn\u2019t entirely accurate.\n\nMaddow wasn\u2019t having it, telling McCain \u201cI feel like this focus on who the whistleblower is and how his complaint was handled, both by the Republicans and Democrats is a side story.\u201d She also pushed back on the notion that Schiff is a \u201cpartisan,\u201d arguing, \u201cHe actually was reticent on impeachment. As the head of the intelligence committee, he has been very much in the public eye on this, but not one of the people pushing for impeachment.\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s attempts to draw conflict with Maddow were nothing, however, compared to what Abby Huntsman asked her next.\n\n\u201cI think the Ukraine call, that to me, is very clear cut of an abuse of power,\u201d Huntsman said. \u201cAnd my frustration is that there has been a \u2018crying wolf\u2019 for so long. \u2018This is it, this is the smoking gun, he's out,\u2019 for two years now from Democrats, from some members of the media, that now you have people in this country that are, like, we don't believe anything anymore. They're shutting it off. They are not taking it as seriously as they should, and I ask you, do you think you're part of that problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cRachel?!\u201d Behar asked in disbelief.\n\n\u201cI think it's a really good point,\u201d Maddow answered as Huntsman started to backtrack a bit by saying \u201cwe\u2019re all guilty\u201d as members of the media. \u201cBut it\u2019s a consequence of having a really scandal-ridden presidency with all sorts of stuff that happens all the time, that in any other presidency, would have already led to impeachment.\u201d\n\nIn the final moments of Maddow\u2019s second segment with the crew, Huntsman turned to their guest and said, \u201cBy the way, Rachel, my dad\u2019s not the whistleblower,\u201d referring to her father Jon Huntsman, who as of today is no longer Trump\u2019s ambassador to Russia.\n\nThe Views Abby Huntsman Finally Convinced Trumps a Criminal: This Is Extortion\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
