That's a good thing,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nHis comments came on Saturday (AEDT) after he agreed to suspend a tariff hike on US$250 million ($368 million) of Chinese goods scheduled for this week in exchange for a commitment by Beijing to buy up to US$50 billion in goods from American farmers hurting from the prolonged trade war.\n\nThe US President said the \"phase 1\" deal, agreed during high-level trade talks in Washington, could be signed at a possible meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum summit in Chile next month.\n\n\"The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,\" Mr Trump tweeted at the weekend.\n\nHe also said the agreement would include guidelines for the way China managed its currency. Mr Trump has long accused China of \"weaponising\" the value of the renminbi to hurt the United States.\n\nIn exchange, Washington agreed not to increase tariffs on US$250 billion worth of Chinese products from 25 per cent to 30 per cent on October 15 as scheduled. However, the US has not wound back the threat of a 15 per cent tariff on a new batch of Chinese goods on December 15.\n\nWhile news of the partial deal lifted sentiment on Wall Street, there were few details in the announcement or evidence of any real new concessions from China. Mr Trump made similar overtures after meeting Mr Xi in Japan in June following a breakdown in trade talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed what he said was a \"breakthrough\" in the trade war. \"I have been encouraging both the United States and China to, you know, get on and get this done,\" he told reporters in Fiji.\n\nBut Chinese officials and investors sounded a more cautious tone. The Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, said in an editorial China would safeguard the state's core interest and would not trade on \"any matter of principle\".\n\n\"It is impossible to solve problems by exerting pressure on China,\" it said at the weekend.\n\nOthers were more upbeat, saying \u201csubstantial progress\u201d was made and both sides were working towards a final agreement.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have made substantial progress in agriculture, intellectual property rights protection, exchange rate, financial services, expansion of trade co-operation, technology transfer and dispute settlement,\u201d Xinhua said.\n\nInvestors remain sceptical\n\nInvestors, fatigued by the roller-coaster ride of on-again, off-again trade talks, said they doubted there would be any genuine progress on the thornier issues of intellectual property theft and Chinese government support for state-owned enterprises.\n\n\"While markets would welcome any easing in trade tensions, we are sceptical that the deal outlined above would mark a major breakthrough,\" Capital Economics chief China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A few billion dollars of extra agricultural purchases will make little difference to the US trade deficit with China, which stands at over $US400 billion. And the 'currency deal' seems likely to consist of little more than a pledge by China not to devalue the renminbi.\"\n\nFormer Australian trade minister Andrew Robb, who was part of a delegation visiting Beijing at the weekend, said there were low expectations in China of a permanent ceasefire in the trade war.\n\n\"I think this is with us in some form or the other for a long time. They are like two bulls in the paddock at the moment,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\"They certainly are not anywhere near coming to an accommodation with one another,\" he said.\n\nMr Robb said there was a lot of confidence in Beijing that China could weather the storm and wanted to diversify its business interests to other countries such as Australia.\n\nBoth Mr Trump and Mr Xi face economic challenges in their home markets. There will be further evidence China\u2019s economy is slowing when it posts quarterly GDP this week. Rising food prices, particularly pork where supplies have been decimated by an outbreak of swine flu, are a major gripe for consumers.\n\nMr Trump also needs to limit the damage from any economic fallout from trade tensions ahead of the 2020 presidential election campaign. Farmers have been hurt by falling sales to China of soybeans, pork and corn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trade war erupted in July last year when Mr Trump followed through on threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods for allegedly unfair trade practices.\n\nTariffs have been imposed on a total $US550 billion worth of Chinese products, covering virtually all goods imported into the country. China has either imposed or threatened tariffs on almost $US120 billion of US goods.\n\nNews of the carve-out agreement surprised investors, who had been concerned that escalating diplomatic tensions between the two powers in the lead-up to the talks would complicate the chances of finding any common ground.\n\nWashington announced last week it would effectively blacklist 28 Chinese technology companies this week due to alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, home to millions of Uighur Muslims. Washington also said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese government officials believed to be involved in the mass detention of Muslims.\n\nA ban on hugely popular National Basketball Association (NBA) games on Chinese state television after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong protesters made headlines around the world.", "description": "A ceasefire in Donald Trump's trade war with China has buoyed market sentiment in Australia despite few details being released and warnings that any truce will be temporary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3834%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_502/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3391e63981a171524732522f7df879a38f4fbd94", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
