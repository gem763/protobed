The pound since late July is at its lowest level in three years, and officials in Brussels maintain that they have seen no new plans for a Northern Irish backstop or other fundamental components of an exit deal since Johnson took office.\n\n\"It's quite difficult to understand from external side \u2026 but I really want British politicians to make a little bit of clarity into this,\" Centeno, who since 2015 has served as Portugal's finance minister, said. Businesses in both Europe and the U.K. have struggled to make contingency plans for the latter's departure from the bloc, and the uncertainty has significantly stalled investment decisions.\n\nEuropean officials have expressed their bafflement over Johnson's claims that progress is being made on a deal, with Centeno the latest to affirm that he has not seen any new proposals from Westminster that could move negotiations forward.", "description": "Mario Centeno does not see the Brexit deal 'progress' that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been touting, he told CNBC on Saturday.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105311515-1530772485707gettyimages-908883512.jpg?v=1530772504", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
