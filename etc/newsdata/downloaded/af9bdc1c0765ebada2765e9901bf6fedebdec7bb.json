Bad light affected play on both the first two days.\n\nIndia took an insurmountable lead in the three-match series after winning the first two tests at Visakhapatnam and Pune.\n\n___\n\nMore AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nIndia's Sahbaz Nadeem, right, celebrates with teammates the dismissal of South Africa's Temba Bavuma during the third day of third and last cricket test match between India and South Africa in Ranchi, India, Monday, Oct. 21, 2019.
