We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday refused to turn over documents requested by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House has said it will not cooperate with an investigation it considers unfair and illegitimate, a claim it bases in part on the fact that the House has not formally voted to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nPence's attorney echoed that reasoning in a letter sent Tuesday to the chairmen of the investigating committees.\n\nCounsel Matthew E. Morgan also wrote that some of the documents that Democrats had asked Pence to produce by Tuesday \"are clearly not vice-presidential records.\"\n\n\"Please know that if the Committees wish to return to the regular order of legitimate legislative oversight requests, and the Committees have appropriate requests for information solely in the custody of the Office of the Vice President,\" Morgan wrote, \"we are prepared to work with you in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for the separation of powers.\"\n\nHouse Democrats did not immediately say Tuesday whether they will subpoena Pence for the documents.\n\nRudy Giuliani: President Trump's personal lawyer defies subpoena\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, left, shakes hands with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, in Warsaw, Poland on Sept. 1, 2019.
