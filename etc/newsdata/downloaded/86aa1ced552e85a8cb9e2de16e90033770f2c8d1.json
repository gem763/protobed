According to the 2019 Match report, 8,116 internal medicine positions were offered, the highest number on record and the most positions offered within any specialty, but only 41.5 percent were filled by seniors pursuing their M.D.s from U.S. medical schools. Similar trends were seen this year in family medicine and pediatrics.\n\nIn their final year of medical school, students apply and interview for residency programs in their chosen specialty. The Match, a nonprofit group, then assigns them a residency program based on how the applicant and the program ranked each other.\n\nAD\n\nSince 2011, the percentage of U.S.-trained allopathic, or M.D., physicians who have matched into primary care positions has been on the decline, according to an analysis of historical Match data by Kaiser Health News.\n\nAD\n\nBut over the same period, the percentage of U.S.-trained osteopathic and foreign-trained physicians matching into primary care roles has increased; 2019 marks the first year in which the percentage of osteopathic and foreign-trained doctors surpassed the percentage of U.S. trained medical doctors matching into primary care positions.\n\nMedical colleges granting M.D. degrees graduate nearly three-quarters of U.S. students moving on to become doctors. The rest graduate from osteopathic schools, granting D.O. degrees. The five medical schools with the highest percentage of graduates who chose primary care are all osteopathic institutions, according to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey.\n\nAD\n\nBeyond the standard medical curriculum, osteopathic students receive training in manipulative medicine, a hands-on technique focused on muscles and joints that can be used to diagnose and treat conditions. They are licensed by states and work side by side with medical doctors in physician practices and health systems.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the osteopathic graduates have been able to join the main residency match or go through a separate osteopathic match through this year, in 2020 the two matches will be combined.\n\nPhysicians who are trained at foreign medical schools, including both U.S. and non-U. S. citizens, also take unfilled primary care residency positions. In the 2019 match, 68.9 percent of foreign-trained physicians went into internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics.\n\nAD\n\nDespite osteopathic graduates and foreign-trained medical doctors taking up these primary care spots, a looming primary care physician shortage is still expected.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a shortage of between 21,100 and 55,200 primary care physicians by 2032. More doctors will be needed in the coming years to care for aging baby boomers, many of whom will have multiple chronic conditions. The obesity rate is also increasing, which portends more people with chronic health problems.\n\nAD\n\nStudies have shown that states with a higher ratio of primary care physicians have better health and lower rates of mortality. Patients who regularly see a primary care physician also have lower health costs than those without one.\n\nAD\n\nBut choosing a specialty other than primary care often means a higher paycheck.\n\nAccording to a recently published survey of physicians conducted by Medscape, internal medicine doctors\u2019 salaries average $243,000 annually. That\u2019s a little over half of what the highest earners, orthopedic physicians, make with an average annual salary of $482,000. Family medicine and pediatrics earn even less than internal medicine, at $231,000 and $225,000 per year, respectively.\n\nEric Hsieh, the internal medicine residency program director at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, said another deterrent is the amount of time primary care doctors spend filling out patients\u2019 electronic medical records.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realize how involved electronic medical records are,\u201d Hsieh said. \u201cYou have to synthesize everything and coordinate all of the care. And something that I see with the residents in our program is that the time spent on electronic medical records rather than caring for patients frustrates them.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
