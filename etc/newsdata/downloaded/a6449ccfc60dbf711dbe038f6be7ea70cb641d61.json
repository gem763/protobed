Hinch didn\u2019t intentionally walk anyone this season, making the Astros the first team in MLB history to finish a year with zero intentional walks.\n\nHinch said many factors played into Houston setting this record.\n\n\u201cSome of it is comfort with what I\u2019ve learned on adding runners on base for free,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of it has been pure luck on not having situations that have come up to where I play a National League game and I want to walk the eight-hole hitter to get to the pitcher or call it (Christian) Yelich, Trout and MVP-caliber players being up at the wrong time with a base where I should walk them. But most of it has just been out of the pure education of what that does to run-scoring and run-prevention.\u201d\n\nIntentional walks became a statistic in 1955 and Houston entered the season as the record-holder for fewest intentional walks after Hinch handed out just four last season. Before the Astros set the mark, the Royals had the record for fewest intentional walks issued in a season with eight in 2016.\n\nThe last time an Astros pitcher intentionally walked anyone came last season, on Aug. 17, 2018, when Hector Rondon walked Jed Lowrie in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nRondon doesn\u2019t love that he was the last Astro to intentionally walk anyone, but what he does love is what Hinch\u2019s decision not to do it says about the staff.\n\n\u201cI think all that happens because the way we\u2019ve been pitching this year and the confidence that we get from our manager,\u201d Rondon said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t make that decision because he trusts us and the way we pitch and that\u2019s huge for us.\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Miami led the league with 52 intentional walks this season. But the Marlins actually cut back on them quite a bit this year after also topping the list in 2018 when they issued a whopping 73.\n\nWith the designated hitter, intentional walks in the AL are far less common, and the White Sox led the AL in that category with 30 this season. The Twins had the second-fewest behind the Astros with 10 intentional walks and the Orioles, Rangers and Angels all finished with 11.\n\nNot only did the Astros face Trout multiple times this season, they also played against two of the top four most intentionally walked players in the National League in Yelich and Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Bell, who were intentionally walked a combined 29 times.\n\nHinch hasn\u2019t always shied away from intentional walks. In 2017 the Astros had 17. But even though Houston had a ton that year compared to the last two seasons, they were still tied for second-fewest in the majors with Oakland that year.\n\nAnd although Hinch got through 162 games without intentionally walking anyone this year, he was quick to note that he isn\u2019t ruling it out as the Astros begin the postseason on Friday against the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 1 of the AL Division Series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hold onto some record or be stubborn about it. If it\u2019s the right play, it\u2019s the right play.\u201d\n\nHowever it didn\u2019t sound likely that he was planning to resort to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just rarely the right play,\u201d he said before a long pause, \u201cin my opinion.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Houston Astros share a division with the American League's most intentionally walked player in Angels star Mike Trout.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/alds_astros_baseball_67817_c0-47-5231-3096_s1770x1032.jpg?87291a186e4c6c2c2fe4cf53263b75d1b1ecb73a", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
