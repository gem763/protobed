(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nToo often, there's too little.\n\nDonald Trump is testing whether he can claim immunity from the rule of law. That\u2019s the plain meaning of the announcement that his administration will not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe letter released by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone brands the impeachment inquiry a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and an \u201ceffort to overturn the 2016 election. . . . President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNearly everything in that statement is false. Cipollone now joins a long line of sycophants who have offered up their integrity on Trump\u2019s altar. \u201cUnconstitutional?\u201d It\u2019s hard for something to be unconstitutional when it\u2019s explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Check Article II, Section 4. An effort to undo the 2016 election? Even in the unlikely event that Trump were removed from office, it would be Mike Pence, not Hillary Clinton, who would assume office. Partisan? Half true. Some Republicans have been mouthing Trump talking points, but others have expressed serious concern about Trump\u2019s abuse of office. Besides, impeachments have always featured a heavy dose of partisanship. That neither delegitimizes nor explains them. Forty-three out of 45 presidents have managed to avoid impeachment (Nixon resigned) despite ever-present partisanship.\n\nAs for the proper body to investigate presidential wrongdoing, as the Washington Post\u2019s James Hohmann notes, Trump is arguing that Congress has no authority to investigate him through impeachment, and arguing the exact opposite in another case. The Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns. There, Trump is contending that the court lacks jurisdiction because \u201cthe Framers\u201d had established impeachment as the sole recourse to hold presidents accountable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s consider accountability. We hear constantly that the verdict of the voters should not be lightly overturned. True. But the Founders knew that power was dangerous, and elections were only one way that they devised to prevent its abuse. They divided powers among the branches. They staggered the terms of senators to permit some to be more insulated than others from transitory public passions. They devised an Electoral College to prevent the largest states from exercising all the power in choosing presidents, and \u2014 this is often forgotten \u2014 to buffer the judgments of the populace on selecting the chief executive. (The last function of the EC is no longer in use.) And they authorized the Congress to impeach presidents and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Constitution refers to \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d leading many to ask \u201cWhere\u2019s the crime?\u201d But there need not be a crime. If the president were to announce tomorrow that he planned to submit all major decisions to Recep Erdogan before acting, that would not be a crime, but few constitutional scholars dispute that it would be impeachable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeclining to abide by lawful subpoenas is a direct challenge to the rule of law. It is far from the first. Trump has disfigured the pardon power to reward friends. He has twisted trade law into unrecognizable shape by claiming that \u201cnational security\u201d required tariffs on Canadian steel. He has declared a state of emergency to fund a notional wall at the southern border \u2014 flouting the explicit will of Congress \u2014 while acknowledging on the same day that the emergency was bogus.\n\nHe has expanded the concept of executive privilege to apply to those who never worked in the White House. He has demanded personal loyalty from career civil servants. He has instructed aides to confiscate Americans\u2019 property along the border, promising that if they run into legal trouble, he will pardon them later. He told border agents to turn away all asylum seekers. If an inconvenience, like U.S. law, should arise, he added, they were to say, \u201cSorry judge; we don\u2019t have the room.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has suggested that guns be taken without due process. \u201cTake the guns first,\u201d the Red Queen president said, \u201cgo through due process second\u201d \u2014 which vitiates the whole concept of due process. And he may even think this is legitimate. Speaking to Turning Point USA in July, Trump said, \u201cThen, I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president. But I don\u2019t even talk about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who warned in 2013 about a \u201cdangerous new level of government by decree,\u201d I don\u2019t need lectures about how it didn\u2019t start with Trump. But this level of flagrant norm-shattering and proud lawbreaking demands more than tut-tutting. Along with the shakedown of foreign countries to get dirt on opponents, Trump is demonstrating that he truly believes he is above the law. A nation of laws cannot tolerate that.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Creators.com", "description": "Donald Trump is testing whether he can claim immunity from the rule of law.
