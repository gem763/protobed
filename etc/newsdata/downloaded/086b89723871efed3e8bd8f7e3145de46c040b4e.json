I do not judge a performance only on the result, that is something I won\u2019t accept.\n\n\u201cWe allowed Cagliari very few counter-attacks, hardly any. At the end, we stopped to make a half-hearted protest about a foul on (Napoli striker) Fernando Llorente and we were caught off-guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe created chances, forced their goalkeeper to make saves, hit the post twice, so overall it was a decent performance. Cagliari focused entirely on defence and closing down all the spaces.\u201d\n\nNapoli have finished as runners-up in three of the last four seasons although, in the last campaign, they never really offered a serious threat to Juventus who ran away with an eighth successive title.\n\nOne worry has been the form of defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who scored an last-gasp own goal in the 4-3 defeat to Juventus and was sent off against Cagliari.\n\n\u201cIt was odd that Koulibaly was sent off for saying something to the referee and we had a series of yellow cards, when, if there was a team that was playing rough, it was Cagliari,\u201d he said.", "description": "After dropping three points at home to Cagliari on Wednesday, Napoli know they cannot afford any more slip-ups when they face a similar match at home to Brescia on Sunday as leaders Inter Milan gallop away.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434135712&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P121", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
