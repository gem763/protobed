Maybe you should wear a top that covers the bulge in your stomach.\"\n\nTracy responded brilliantly to the message, with her tweet getting more than 1,000 retweets and 21,000 likes.\n\nShe wrote: \"Dear Mary, yes I do watch my air checks.\n\n\"NO I will not be strapping myself into a girdle because you don\u2019t like my belly.\n\n\"I like pasta, bread and cheese too much to obsess over my weight. I like my body and that\u2019s all that really matters. Tracy.\"\n\nShe signed off with a love heart and the hashtag 'no more fat shaming'.\n\nTracy's reply soon attracted hundreds of messages, with people praising the reporter for standing up to the ridiculous criticism.\n\nOne said: \"Shame on Mary! A fellow woman should know what it's like to be judged for our bodies, as if our minds don't matter.\n\n\"She has fallen in line with a society that thinks every female who is on TV needs to be perfectly fit and cover-girl gorgeous. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.\"\n\nAnother replied: \"You are absolutely stunning and I have no idea how someone can say anything about your weight.\n\n\"I guess Marilyn Monroe and all the actresses and models of the precious age probably needed to 'watch their air checks' too? Sigh. Keep on keeping on!\"\n\nOthers even said she should name and shame the culprit, with one commenting: \"I think when you send hateful tweets, the receiver has every right to make that person's name public. If you can dish it out, you better be ready to take it.\"", "description": "TV meteorologist Tracy Hinson had the perfect reply to a viewer who criticised her appearance", "authors": ["Luke Matthews"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641381.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_171019Slug_6764JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
