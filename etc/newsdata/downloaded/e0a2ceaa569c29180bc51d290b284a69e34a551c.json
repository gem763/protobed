They also dealt the final blow to a doctrine that has been fading for years: the belief that the United States maintains a security umbrella able to protect the oil-rich Persian Gulf states from their enemies \u2014 and, especially, from Iran.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s miscalculations helped get us here. But the current Gulf crisis is not just about this administration and the pitfalls of its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran. The United States has been disengaging from the Middle East since the catastrophe of the 2003 Iraq invasion. Now that shale has made America so much less dependent on the Middle East\u2019s oil, it is hard to imagine any American president risking significant blood and treasure to defend Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor decades, the leaders of the Gulf seemed to believe their close ties with the United States (and the billions of dollars spent on American weapons) made them almost invulnerable. They regularly urged American diplomats and generals to get tougher with their Iranian neighbor or even to \u201ccut off the head of the snake,\u201d as Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah put it in 2008 in encouraging the United States to bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. Saudi confidence was bolstered by memories of the 1991 Gulf war, when an American-led military coalition reversed Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.\n\nBut the faith in American power always blinked away some inconvenient facts. Iran\u2019s population and military strength dwarf those of the Gulf countries, and the United States is nearly 10,000 miles away. In any conceivable war, the Gulf\u2019s cities would be among the first targets. And unlike Iran, those cities are intensely vulnerable: A single bomb could shatter the status of Dubai as a safe hub for trade, transport and tourism.", "description": "Time to face reality: The United States doesn\u2019t want to go to war with Iran to protect its Arab allies.", "authors": ["Robert F.
