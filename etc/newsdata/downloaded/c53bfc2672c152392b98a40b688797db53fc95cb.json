The Ace reference design promises a (relatively) slim and sleek 15-inch laptop with as much power as possible. Naturally, the company has to show off that reference design with the most eye-catching laptop possible \u2014 which is where the new Asus ProArt StudioBook One comes in. This 15-inch laptop has a world-first for laptops. There\u2019s a very powerful and very expensive Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 GPU inside.\n\nThe Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 is from Nvidia\u2019s work-focused line of Quadro processors. GeForce RTX and GTX-line processors are intended for average folks and gamers, while Quadro processors are built for people who work in 3D and video rendering applications. The average person doesn\u2019t need a Quadro GPU, and the desktop versions are priced for professional operations.\n\nThe Quadro RTX 6000 is one of the latest pro GPUs from Nvidia. It launched back in late 2018 and is most comparable to the Nvidia Titan RTX. The desktop version is a performance beast and constantly thirsty for power, drawing 300W.\n\nThe most powerful laptop GPUs up until now have been the mobile versions of the RTX 2080, and the mobile version of the Quadro RTX 5000. Mobile GPUs typically draw a lot less power than their desktop siblings. The mobile version of the Quadro RTX 5000 can draw between 80W and 150W. The desktop version starts at 230W. With more power, you can hit higher clock speeds and better-sustained performance.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear how much power the mobile version of the Quadro RTX 6000 will draw, but Asus made a new super-slim 300w charger, and it put an Intel i9-9980HK processor inside. The charger is about 10cm x 10cm and just 3cm thick. I\u2019m talking about the charger because chargers for big beastly machines like the Asus ProArt StudioBook One are typically big beastly monsters you can use as a flail in case of a zombie emergency. A brick that size is unheard of for something like the ProArt StudioBook One.\n\nThe Quadro RTX 6000 found in the Asus ProArt StudioBook One will have 24GB of RAM dedicated for video, 32GB of traditional RAM, and a 1TB SSD. Three Thunderbolt ports provide plenty of I/O while a 90Whr battery should keep it charged, for a little while at least.\n\nSize-wise the Asus ProArt StudioBook One sounds like it will be on the thinner side for something this powerful. It\u2019s just .94-inches thick and weighs 3kg. Those are, by no means, impressive measurements when you consider the state of gaming laptops. Thanks to Nvidia pushing its Max-Q reference design they\u2019ve gotten much thinner. (Asus\u2019 ROG Zephyrus is .66 inches thick at its thinnest.)\n\nBut there isn\u2019t another laptop quite as powerful as the Asus ProArt StudioBook One right now, and its design sure as heck beats some of the monsters I\u2019ve had to carry around before.\n\nIt sports a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 100 per cent of the Adobe RGB colour gamut, and 97 per cent of DCI-P3 colour gamut. Asus and Nvidia claim it will be calibrated at the factor with a delta E of 1 or less. The delta E is a number that corresponds to the average accuracy of a display. A display with a delta E of 3 or lower is so good that the human eye can\u2019t detect inaccuracy.\n\nOther specs haven\u2019t been disclosed, and pricing isn\u2019t available either. We\u2019ll update once Asus and Nvidia give us more information.", "description": "Building on the success of Max-Q design, its guidelines for slim laptops sporting powerful graphics, Nvidia announced a new reference design today dubbed \u201cAce.\u201d...", "authors": ["Matt Novak", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dwh7p85iitbpmt1lymqp.jpg"}
