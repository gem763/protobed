So then I'll just write something and stick it on the album. That's just really just me having fun.\"\n\nRead more: Ramin Djawadi reveals how the showrunners talked in 'riddles' about Daenerys and Jon's fate years ago\n\nThough some fans might have believed the song was linked to a deleted scene from the eighth season premiere, it was really just written as his final goodbye to the series.\n\n'Stay a Thousand Years' shows the possibility of 'eternal love' for Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow\n\nComposer Ramin Djawadi scored all eight seasons of \"Game of Thrones.\" Helen Sloan/HBO/Getty Images\n\nDjawadi said this isn't the first time music that wasn't intended for a specific scene has appeared on the officially released soundtrack. He wrote the choir-based song \"Dark Wings, Dark Words\" just for the season three soundtrack, though later that melody was heard on season four.\n\n\"I don't think ['Dark Winds, Dark Words'] got as much attention because ['Stay a Thousand Years'] is quite a statement piece,\" Djawadi said. \"It's very traditional choral church piece, but with the Dany and Jon love theme.\"\n\nDany and Jon's \"love theme\" was first heard on the seventh season when they began to bond at Dragonstone.\n\nDjawadi wrote that piece of music in reverse order for the scenes \u2014 meaning he started by crafting the big, romantic, sweeping track called \"Truth\" (which played as the two Targaryens had sex for the first time).\n\nDany and Jon's first romantic encounter took place on the seventh season finale, \"The Dragon and the Wolf.\" HBO\n\nThen Djawadi whittled that melody down to quieter versions that would play in the scenes when Dany and Jon were just getting to know one another.\n\n\"Obviously their relationship with just such a big thing, the way the show ended with her death and everything,\" he said. \"['Stay a Thousand Years'] is just another personal piece of mine that I felt like it would be nice to have out there.\"\n\nThe title for this track comes from the line Daenerys says to Jon after their dragon ride on the eighth season premiere. After flying to a remote swath of land in the North where waterfalls cascaded down to the snowy land, Dany turned to Jon.\n\n\"We could stay a thousand years,\" she said. \"No one would find us.\"\n\nJon and Dany at the waterfall on season eight, episode one, \"Winterfell.\" HBO\n\nBy naming the song after this key scene, Djawadi was making a small statement about all the potential in the tragic relationship between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen.\n\n\"I felt like it made their love eternal,\" he said. \"It makes their relationship forever. Again, it was just personal. I was having fun writing and being emotional about it.\"\n\nDany and Jon's relationship ended in tragedy when he murdered her in the throne room. Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nDjawadi crafted a similar note of possibility for another tragic \"Game of Thrones\" couple: Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister. On the series finale, when Brienne is writing down Jaime's deeds in the Book of Brothers, Djawadi intentionally included the melody associated with Westerosi weddings.\n\nRead more: 'Game of Thrones' composer Ramin Djawadi confirms fan theory about Brienne, Jaime, and the 'wedding' music heard on the series finale\n\n\"There was an opportunity for an emotional piece and I thought, 'Let's put [the wedding music] into it for the imagination of people who were into their relationship,\" Djawadi said. \"They can think about what this could have been.\"\n\nWhen asked if this bonus track was the result of having an extra emotional attachment to the character of Daenerys, Djawadi said the choice of theme wasn't necessarily meant to single out the Mother of Dragons.\n\n\"No, not at all. I try not to favor any characters or anything,\" he said. \"It's really just a coincidence that I [picked Dany and Jon's music]. It was just really quite [an] emotional theme. And obviously her death was a big deal and I was shaken by that just like everybody else watching it.\"\n\nRamin Djawadi is taking his \"Game of Thrones\" music on tour for a third time this fall. Andre\u0301s Jime\u0301nez/BBGun PR\n\n\"Stay a Thousand Years\" didn't appear on the show, and fans won't hear it during the \"Game of Thrones: Live Concert Experience,\" either.\n\n\"I didn't realize that people would pick it up like this,\" Djawadi said. \"And it's not in the live show, but now this makes me think about maybe putting it in one day, because it would be really powerful to perform live with the choir. That would be actually really great [laughing]. Maybe I should have put it in.\"\n\nThe 'Game of Thrones' concert tour has already begun, though Djawadi won't be performing at every show this year\n\nRamin Djawadi performing the \"Game of Thrones: Live Concert Experience\" at The Forum arena in Los Angeles in 2018. Kim Renfro/INSIDER\n\nThis is the third iteration of the \"Game of Thrones: Live Concert Experience\" organized by Djawadi and his team, though it's the first time the touring show is able to tell the complete story now that the final season has aired.\n\n\"We could've done a whole concert just with season eight material, since there was so much new music,\" Djawadi said. \"It was hard. I had to take out or shorten some pieces just to make room for all the [new songs], because obviously we wanted to play 'The Night King' and 'Jenny of Oldstones.'\"\n\nDaniel Portman (who played Podrick) sung the now-famous \"Jenny of Oldstones\" tune on the second episode of season eight, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\n\nRead more: 'Game of Thrones' star Daniel Portman tells Insider about singing 'Jenny of Oldstones' and his emotional final day on set\n\nDaniel Portman as Podrick on \"Game of Thrones\" season eight, episode two. HBO\n\nThe version released on Djawadi's soundtrack is an instrumental, but he says a new arrangement was written especially for the live concert tour. Fans will hear a longer version of the song, and there are vocalists on hand to sing the lyrics.\n\n\"'Jenny of Oldstones' is really incredible live with our vocalist,\" Djawadi said. \"It might be one of my favorites. It's really powerful.\"\n\nUnlike the previous two tours, Djawadi himself will not be there for every stop. The tour kicked off last week in Toronto, Canada, but Djawadi's first appearance on stage will be this coming Saturday in New York City. After that, he'll join the orchestra performers in New Mexico and then twice in California.\n\nDjawadi plays guitar, the organ, and other instruments on the live concert tour. Barry Brecheisen/HBO\n\n\"With my schedule and everything, I wasn't able to do the entire tour, even though I would have loved to,\" Djawadi said. \"All the concerts have been so much fun and connecting with the fans is incredible.\"\n\nThe composer is looking forward to the new open-air setting, too. For the first time, the \"Game of Thrones: Live Concert Experience\" is touring at outdoor amphitheaters. The final show (with Djawadi performing) will be at Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl.\n\n\"Now [the concert] feels like a closure,\" Djawadi said. \"It's nice for people who can relive ['Game of Thrones'] in its entirety now. I was quite emotional about it while preparing for this because, just like many people, I wasn't ready to let go of the show yet.\"\n\nFans who want in on this group-closure can find the \"Game of Thrones: Live Concert Experience\" tour dates and tickets here. The season eight soundtrack is streaming now on Apple Music, Spotify, and more.\n\nRamin Djawadi is once-again nominated for best original dramatic score at the upcoming Emmy Awards, which air on September 22, 2019 (in the middle of the live concert tour).", "description": "The season eight soundtrack released by HBO included a song called \"Stay a Thousand Years,\" which was written just for fun and not for the show.", "authors": ["Kim Renfro"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ac87f21214c7c7c34fa6f-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
