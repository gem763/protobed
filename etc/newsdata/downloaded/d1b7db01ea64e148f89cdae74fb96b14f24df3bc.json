The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u2018Church of Fake News\u2018 on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies.\u201c\n\nPOLITICO was among the news organizations shown as targets of the Trump violence.\n\nBesides journalists, other targets depicted include the late John McCain, California Reps. Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nThe Trump character in the video shoots, stab and beats his victims; at one point, he sets Bernie Sanders\u2019 head on fire. Other past and present election rivals also are depicted.\n\nThe footage seems to have been converted for political use from a 2014 movie, \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d The parallel scene in that movie depicts a massacre inside a church in Kentucky triggered by an evil tycoon portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nAlex Phillips of American Priority, the group organizing the event in Miami, told the Times that the video was produced by an outside organization.\n\nTrump has frequently attacked what he calls \u201cfake news\u201c generated by many news organizations throughout his presidency, sometimes directly attacking a specific news organization or reporter, sometimes attacking the media as a whole. In recent months, he has even attacked his favored news outlet, Fox News. The president also regularly heaps scorn on journalists covering his campaign rallies.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/10/17/2105ce0b47cf973e3a5688952fdd/webp.net-resizeimage%20(15).jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
