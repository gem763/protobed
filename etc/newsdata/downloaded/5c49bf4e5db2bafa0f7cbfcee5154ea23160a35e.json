The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has concurrently assigned CJFH's proposed US dollar senior unsecured bonds a 'BBB+(EXP)' expected rating. CJFH was established as a state-owned limited-liability company in 2008 and is ultimately fully owned by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. CJFH serves as Chengdu's state-owned investment-holding platform to consolidate the municipality's financial assets. The company is the largest shareholder of Bank of Chengdu and Jintai Insurance, and the second-largest shareholder of Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank. It also established the second licensed local asset-management company in the province. The proposed bonds will be issued by CJFH directly and rank pari passu with all its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The proceeds will be used for onshore project financing, refinancing and general corporate purposes. The final rating on the proposed bonds is contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming to information already reviewed. Key Rating Drivers 'Very Strong' Status, Ownership and Control: CJFH is ultimately 100% owned by the Chengdu SASAC on behalf of the municipal government. Under its current legal status, the government supervises, audits and monitors the company's operational and financial performance. Any major decisions such as the appointment of senior management and board members, strategy formulation, change in shareholding structure, financing plans and major investment projects will require approval from the government. 'Strong' Support Track Record and Expectations: CJFH has been provided with substantial government support, including capital injections, tax rebates, debt swaps and asset injections. CJFH received CNY3.4 billion in capital injections, CNY1.1 billion in tax rebates, CNY0.4 billion in debt swaps and CNY0.5 billion from newly issued local government special bonds for infrastructure development during 2013-2018, while the government injected assets worth CNY10 billion in 2017. Fitch expects CJFH to continue to receive strong government support due to its important role in building Chengdu into the financial centre of western China. 'Moderate' Socio-Political Implications of Default: CJFH's key mission is to consolidate financial assets on behalf of the municipality and play a strategically important role to build Chengdu into China's financial centre in the western region. CJFH is also responsible for providing armed-escort services for local financial institutions. In the case of a default, Fitch believes the government is likely to use policy and fiscal measures to ensure the continued operation of its key subsidiaries, and to contain the adverse impact on the region's financial system. 'Very Strong' Financial Implications of Default: CJFH owns and controls a wide range of important financial-service providers as Chengdu's investment-holding platform to consolidate municipal financial assets and is well supported by China's large state-owned banks. Any potential default by CJFH could damage the reputation of the municipal government, and affect the availability of domestic or foreign financing options for other government-related entities (GRE) in Chengdu. 'b' Standalone Credit Profile: CJFH's Standalone Credit Profile is assessed under Fitch's Public Sector, Revenue-Supported Entities Rating Criteria, based on 'Weaker' revenue defensibility, 'Midrange' operating risk, and 'Weaker' financial profile due to high leverage, measured by net debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA, of 18.4x at end-2018. Fitch believes CJFH is likely to maintain a similar profile in the medium term due to continued debt-funded capex, although ongoing financial support by the government will help mitigate its weak credit metrics. Derivation Summary Fitch assesses CJFH under our GRE rating criteria, reflecting the municipality's full ownership, direct control, strong support track record, and the strategic importance of CJFH to the local government. These factors indicate a strong incentive by the government to provide extraordinary support to CJFH, if needed.\n\nCJFH's IDR was derived from the four factors under Fitch's GRE rating criteria and the 'b' Standalone Credit Profile under our Public Sector, Revenue-Supported Entities Rating Criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in Fitch's internal assessment of Chengdu municipality would lead to a revision in the company's ratings. An increase in the incentive for the municipality to provide support to CJFH, including stronger socio-political implications of default by the company, or a stronger support track record and expectations, may trigger positive rating action. The ratings may be downgraded if there is a significant weakening in the socio-political and financial implications of a default by CJFH, a weaker support track record and expectations from the government, or a dilution in the government's shareholding. Rating action on CJFH would lead to similar action on the proposed US dollar bonds.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
