And what an opening episode.\"\n\nThe TV drama, which ran from 2002 to 2006, followed a group of women who were married or coupled up with members of the Earls Park football team, and it kicked off between them every week.\n\nNow, Gary joked that the show is being played out in real life.\n\nIt all started when Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press, after some very clever and elaborate detective work.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nColeen, who is married to Wayne, went on an extraordinary rant where she accused Rebekah, wife of Jamie, of passing information from her private Instagram account on to the papers.\n\nColeen, 33, told her followers she became suspicious when stories were getting published about her that only her select followers could know about.\n\nIt was then that she came up with a plan to catch whoever it was by planting false stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection to see if they got reported.\n\nColeen admitted she blocked all of the accounts that followed her - except the one belonging to Rebekah Vardy - and found that the false stories made it to the press.\n\nColeen then revealed the details of her plan to expose the perpretator.\n\n\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe explained: \"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It\u2019s......... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"\n\nBut Rebekah hit back.\n\nThe pregnant star wrote: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\"I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
