When they grabbed a second-half penalty try a real upset looked possible, but in the end Wales sealed a bonus-point success as Liam Williams added to Adams\u2019 treble.

Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process.

Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match.

Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand.

Getty Images\n\nThe Pacific Islanders kept Wales waiting for kick-off, but started with a bang as lock Leone Nakarawa delivered one superb offload and Gareth and Jonathan Davies produced poor kicks.\n\nWales were penalised for offside following the second of those and Fiji took a scrum, spreading the ball wide to Tuisova who barged off the covering Josh Navidi to produce a sensational corner finish.\n\nNavidi had a Welsh response ruled out for a Hadleigh Parkes knock on while Fiji also had a second chalked off \u2013 rightly \u2013 for a forward pass by Viliame Mata.\n\nAfter giving the ball, No 8 Mata was upended by Wales\u2019 Ken Owens who was yellow carded. Given rugby\u2019s crackdown on dangerous tackles, Owens was fortunate not to see red.\n\nFiji capitalised immediately with a man advantage. The ball was spread right and full-back Murimurivalu crashed over in the same corner as Tuisova.\n\nAdams had missed poor tackles in the run-up to both Fiji tries and when Wales finally got possession, he inexplicably knocked on to cap an atrocious start.\n\nThe breathless action continued. Fiji\u2019s Tevita Cavubati was yellow carded for charging into a ruck with his forearm and Wales duly hit straight back with their first bit of possession.\n\nA series of tight carries laid the platform from where Biggar cross-kicked to Adams who did well to leap high above Ben Volavola \u2013 who had missed both Fiji conversions \u2013 to score.\n\nDan Biggar showed Volavola how it should be done from the tee.\n\nAdams\u2019 whirlwind first half continued as he dived for the corner, but was judged by the TMO to have a foot in touch as Frank Lomani did just enough to prevent the try.\n\nThe cards kept coming, Fiji\u2019s Semi Kunatani the next to go for a breather after his team were penalised for offside. Again, Wales capitalised with their scrum dominant.\n\nWith numbers out wide, quick hands sent Adams over for his second in the corner. Biggar converted.\n\nWales had played too openly and given Fiji early encouragement \u2013 the two things they had said they wouldn\u2019t do in the build-up. Still, they did go to the break 14-10 to the good. The chaotic nature of the game continued in the second period. If there is one thing Fiji thrive on it is chaos.\n\nGatland\u2019s men were certainly playing with fire. Poor Welsh tactical kicking and a refusal to tighten up their game plan gave Fiji further cause for joy and James Davies was yellow carded for not rolling away. Fiji kicked to the corner and drove forward, referee Jerome Garces awarding a penalty try for Wales collapsing the maul worth an automatic seven points.\n\nWilliams poleaxed team-mate Biggar as both men went for a high ball forcing the Wales fly-half off for a second head injury assessment in as many games.\n\nRhys Patchell was his replacement and immediately nailed a monster penalty to tie the scores.\n\nWith his team under the pump, Wales centre Jonathan Davies then stood up to be counted. Davies is a world class centre and he produced a moment of class fitting that description to give Adams his hat-trick. Receiving the ball from Patchell, Jonathan Davies first carried hard and shrugged off Jale Vatubua. Then with the Fiji defence covering, his outrageous offload sent Adams over for his hat-trick. It was far from an easy finish, but Adams did the rest. Patchell missed the conversion.\n\nJonathan Davies and Adams were both forced off with injuries suffered in the try, but Wales now had a lead to defend and a fly-half in Patchell who was controlling the game nicely.\n\nFinally, Gatland\u2019s men put the game to bed. Ross Moriarty crashed forward following some loose play and Gareth Davies combined with Williams to send the full-back over.\n\nPatchell converted and Welsh supporters could at last relax.", "description": "Wales' unbeaten World Cup\u00a0campaign and perfect record rolls on, but this was a significant scare both head coach Warren Gatland and his team\u2019s supporters could have done without.
