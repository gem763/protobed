The pair claimed that the decriminalisation bill current under review in New South Wales, has nothing to do with decriminalisation at all, SBS reports.\n\nSorry, could somebody please remind me why we\u2019re meant to care what a budgie-smuggling yahoo and a man who can\u2019t keep his dick in his pants think about abortion?\n\nBarnaby and Tony were among several thousand people rallying against the decriminalisation bill in Hyde Park on Sunday afternoon. Abbott called the bill \u201cinfanticide on demand\u201d, and Joyce added that it was \u201cthe slavery debate of our time.\u201d\n\nThe first serious bit of legislation the new government puts into this parliament is for the most radical abortion laws in this country,\u201d Abbott said of Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s moves to decriminalise abortion in the state.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, NSW is the only state that is yet to decriminalise abortion, so this legislation should be far from controversial. We\u2019re literally just talking about getting to the same place as every other state in the country. This stuff isn\u2019t new.\n\nIf passed, the legislation will make abortion legal on request before the 22-week mark, while patients will require two doctors to sign off after that point.\n\n\u201cWe elect sensible governments of the centre-right to serve us in practical ways,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cNot to engage in social engineering.\u201d\n\nUmmm\u2026 I thought we elected governments to act in the best interest of the population in which they represent? But hey, maybe I could be wrong.\n\nOnce again, the pair were pulling at straws like the \u201csex selection\u201d and \u201clate-term abortion\u201d cases that represent a minuscule amount of all abortions performed.\n\n\u201cIf you can vote down an amendment [for sex selection] because they\u2019re a boy or girl, then why stop there? Why not vote them down because they\u2019re too dark or too fair or the wrong complexion? When does this animalistic process stop,\u201d Barnaby asked.\n\nAs a woman, there are countless reasons I may need an abortion in my lifetime. Health complications, not being in a stable enough situation to raise a child, mental health issues, or simply just not wanting one are all reasons that come to mind. But you know what has never crossed my mind? Gender selection. To use this as your main reason to stop the decriminalisation of abortion clearly shows that there is no valid reason for this to remain a crime in NSW.\n\nMen like Barnaby Joyce and Tony Abbott, who consistently feel the need to make women feel shit about a decision that is legitimately never easy, should\u2019ve never been able to represent the people of Australia in national parliamentary positions.\n\nNobody WANTS an abortion. They\u2019re invasive and emotional and not an enjoyable experience. But sometimes it\u2019s the choice that women need to make, and to have the former leaders of the country making them feel guilty for that decision is horrible to say the least.\n\nThe bill was passed in the lower house last month 59-31, but Berejiklian has delayed its vote in the upper house amid backlash from fellow MPs. The upper house will evaluate the proposed amendments to the decriminalisation bill next week.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just anti-abortioners that are protesting the bill. Hundreds of people in support of the bill rallied on Saturday to encourage politicians to look into the amendments, which could potentially make the current situation worse for women seeking abortions.\n\n\u201cAmendments are being brought in that have the power to make things worse for women than they currently are.\u201dDee Madigan, the MC or the pro-choice rally said.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the upper house base their decision on what is best for the women of New South Wales, not on the bullshit that Barnaby Joyce and other men who will literally NEVER have to even consider an abortion spew out of their mouths.", "description": "Barnaby Joyce and Tony Abbott attended an anti-abortion rally in Sydney's Hyde Park to voice their conservative opinions on the matter.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/20190915001419668972-minihighres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
