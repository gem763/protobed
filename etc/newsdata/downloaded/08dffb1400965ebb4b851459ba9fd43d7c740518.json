She was also the only woman of color among the producers.\n\n\"They made me, not any of the other producers, fill out a whole form and write an essay about all my contributions as a writer and a producer,\" Kaling said. \"I had to get letters from all the other male, white producers saying that I had contributed, when my actual record stood for itself.\"\n\nThe TV Academy denies that Kaling was singled out, though.\n\n\"There was an increasing concern years ago regarding the number of performers and writers seeking producer credits,\" according to a statement to CNN and other news agencies. \"At the time the Producers Guild worked with the Television Academy to correctly vet producer eligibility. Every performer producer and writer-producer was asked to justify their producer credits.\"\n\nBut Fischer and Kinsey disagree\n\nKaling didn't buy it . And neither do Fischer and Kinsey.\n\nFischer referenced the statement given by the TV Academy and said there were other people on the show with multiple roles.\n\n\"So did B.J. Novak, so did Mike Schur and so did Paul Lieberstein,\" she said, as Kinsey hyped her up. \"They were all writer-producer-performers on the show. So I guess I would say, so why single out Mindy and not those gentlemen?\"", "description": "Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer, who played Angela and Pam on \"The Office,\" defended co-star Mindy Kaling on Friday -- after she spoke up about being singled out by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, which presents the Emmy awards.", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910151643-jenna-fischer-angela-kinsey-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
