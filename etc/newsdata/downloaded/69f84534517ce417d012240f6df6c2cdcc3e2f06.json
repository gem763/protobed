(Eva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMore than 1 in 9 high school seniors report vaping nicotine on a near-daily basis, according to an annual government-funded survey that found a continued rise in teen use of e-cigarettes amid growing concern that products marketed as a more healthful alternative for tobacco smokers are getting young people hooked.\n\nThe share of teens who said they vaped nicotine in the preceding 30 days more than doubled for each age group surveyed, preliminary data published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine shows. About a quarter of 12th-graders said they had vaped the substance within the previous month, up from closer to 1 in 5 the previous year. Roughly 20 percent of 10th-graders and 9 percent of eighth-graders reported vaping during the same period.\n\nThe data could help to strengthen a growing crackdown on e-cigarettes on the heels of bans on sales of flavored vaping products in New York and Michigan. Last week, the Trump administration said it, too, plans to outlaw sales of the flavored liquids that have come under criticism as enticing to teens.\n\nThis year\u2019s rise in vaping rates did not top 2018\u2019s, the largest increase in teen use of any substance the National Institutes of Health-funded survey has tracked in its 44 years of existence. But the latest jumps are still worrying and historically unusual, lead researcher and University of Michigan professor Richard Miech told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt ranks among the top in terms of the increases we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Miech said. \u201cIt seems as if teen nicotine vaping is not going away by itself. Something needs to be done.\u201d\n\nThe researchers behind the study expressed particular alarm at the numbers on daily vaping, a measure that past versions of the survey have not reported and that the researchers defined as e-cigarette usage 20 or more times within 30 days. Such frequent use of e-cigarettes suggests nicotine addiction, they write in the NEJM.\n\n\u201cNew efforts are needed to protect youth from using nicotine during adolescence, when the developing brain is particularly susceptible to permanent changes from nicotine use and when almost all nicotine addiction is established,\u201d they say in a letter to the editor.\n\n[The vaping industry has close ties to Trump. His ban still caught them off guard.]\n\nAbout 35 percent of 12th-graders said they vaped nicotine within the preceding year, according to the letter. Sixteen percent of eighth-graders said the same. Both numbers are roughly five percentage points higher than last year\u2019s.\n\nFindings from the Monitoring the Future Survey, which is supported by NIH\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse, are typically released in December, and more details will come this year. But Miech said the researchers wanted to get their nicotine vaping statistics out early to inform public policy as more officials signal interest in taking significant steps to get e-cigarettes out of underage hands.\n\nA spate of mysterious vaping-linked lung illnesses largely affecting young people has increased scrutiny of e-cigarettes in recent weeks, as federal and state authorities investigate hundreds of cases and seven deaths. But lawmakers announcing new e-cigarette restrictions have focused on the broader issue of underage vaping as officials indicate the lung illnesses are mostly connected to marijuana products, often ones bought off the street.\n\nAlarm over youth vaping spiked after the Monitoring the Future survey\u2019s revelations last December that about 37 percent of high school seniors reported using e-cigarettes within the preceding year. That figure, a 10 percentage-point rise from 2017, prompted renewed hand-wringing that e-cigarettes \u2014 which have yet to gain FDA approval \u2014 were exposing a new generation to unknown health effects.\n\nA recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that e-cigarettes were the most popular product among the nearly 5 million high school and middle school students who had used tobacco products within a 30-day period.\n\nCritics of the recent crackdown on vaping have called flavor bans an overreaction, and they warn of scaring smokers away from a product that experts generally agree poses fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes. The debate over how to combat teen vaping has pitted different public health interests against one another, experts say, as vaping advocates point to the known deadly toll of conventional smoking and research that indicates that most of the millions of adult e-cigarette users in the United States are current or former smokers.\n\n[Watched by millions, \u2018vape influencers\u2019 worry they will become collateral damage in Trump\u2019s new ban]\n\nVaping has boosters not only in industry but also among public health officials: The British government, for example, continues to promote vaping as a tool to quit smoking, and vape shops sit on the grounds of two English hospitals at the recommendation of the country\u2019s public health agency. A 2018 report from Public Health England (PHE) echoed earlier findings that vaping is \u201cat least 95% less harmful\u201d than smoking, as the PHE Director for Health Improvement John Newton put it.\n\n\u201cE-cigarettes have really split the public health community into two camps,\u201d Miech told The Post. \u201cThe people who focus on older adults, they\u2019re really pro-vaping \u2026 because they think it\u2019s a good way to reduce smoking prevalence.\u201d\n\nBut then there are experts focused on adolescents, he added, who worry that vaping\u2019s exploding popularity is ruining decades of progress on youth exposure to nicotine.\n\nMiech sees the proposed bans on sales of flavored e-cigarette products as a good \u201cmiddle ground\u201d that lets adult smokers continue vaping while deterring youths drawn in by tastes such as mango, coffee and chocolate. He thinks the rise in teen vaping calls for national solutions, saying that local and school-level efforts to combat youth smoking largely failed in the 1990s.\n\nSome smokers who love flavors will pay the price of a ban, he said, acknowledging many vaping advocates\u2019 concerns that unflavored and tobacco-flavored liquids are unappealing even to adults.\n\nThe Vapor Technology Association has said the Trump administration\u2019s planned policy would force smokers \u201cto choose between smoking again ... or finding what they want and need on the black market.\u201d\n\nMiech, though, says he prefers that \u201cit\u2019s the smokers that are paying the price rather than our youth.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAnti-vaping bills would close 19 of 22 vape shops in Maryland\u2019s largest jurisdiction\n\nWhat we know about the mysterious vaping-linked illness and deaths\n\nCalifornia man is seventh person to die of suspected vape-related illness", "description": "The share of teens who said they vaped nicotine in the preceding 30 days more than doubled for each age group surveyed, preliminary data published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine shows.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
