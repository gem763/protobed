Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has described detention centers as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d and has accused officials of forcing migrants to drink water from toilets.\n\nWhen he recalled those remarks, Morgan became visibly angry at what he called the \"lies\" being aimed at agents on the frontlines of the crisis -- and didn't hold back in his criticism of those responsible for spreading the claims.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t just been a false narrative, it\u2019s a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean when someone says we\u2019re running concentration camps, it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s not just a false narrative, it\u2019s a lie. When someone says Border Patrol agents are forcing people to drink from a toilet, it\u2019s not a false narrative -- it\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\nHe noted that CBP has conducted more than 4,000 rescues this year -- something he says isn\u2019t publicized by the media enough -- as agents risk their lives in treacherous waters and blistering 110+ degree heat to save the lives of migrants trying to enter the U.S. He gave one harrowing story of cartel smugglers who, seeing CBP agents approaching, threw a paraplegic man into the river so they wouldn\u2019t be apprehended. Agents quickly dove into the water and saved the man\u2019s life.\n\n\"You never hear about that, instead you hear these lies that they\u2019re running concentration camps or they call them Nazis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let me ask you this -- If we\u2019re an organization full of Nazis, how do you explain 4,000 rescues? How do you explain the countless individuals that come to our custody sick or with pre-existing life-threatening conditions and we do everything we can to save their lives -- and that's what gets me so frustrated about our own elected officials,\u201d he said.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION SIGNS ASYLUM AGREEMENT WITH EL SALVADOR\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t like it, change the laws. But instead, because they can\u2019t do their job, because they can\u2019t get their act together to do what they need to safeguard and secure this country, they vilify the men and women of Customs and Border Protection, and that\u2019s outrageous, it\u2019s reckless and it\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMorgan\u2019s remarks came after The New York Times published a story outlining Border Patrol\u2019s \u201cmorale crisis\u201d that detailed how morale has plummeted amid the myriad of attacks against them, including how agents have to pick their restaurants carefully when in uniform in case someone spits in their food.\n\nAgents interviewed by the Times spoke about how their job had also gone from stopping drug smugglers to taking care of children and giving them formula as the nature of the crisis at the border has changed. Morgan told Fox that agents know that when they are pulled off the frontlines, it is making the U.S. less secure.\n\n\u201cThey know every minute they\u2019re pulled away to take care of a child, to order baby formula, to change diapers, to act as a quasi-social worker in an environment for the kids and families, they\u2019re pulled off the frontline and they know bad people and bad things are getting through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they would still do that and do that with pride, what really gets them at the end of the day its that vitriol, that rhetoric that's coming from Congress that's attacking who they are and their character, that's what really gets morale down.\u201d\n\nMorgan was one of a number of administration officials who was in Laredo this week to meet with officials and visit the Migrant Protection Protocol (MPP) courtrooms that allows asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their cases are processed.\n\nIt\u2019s one of a number of measures taken by the Trump administration that officials are crediting for a sharp drop in border apprehensions. In August 64,004 migrants were apprehended at the border, a number that officials say is still too high but marks a 56 percent drop from the highs of May.\n\nAdditionally, efforts to build more miles of wall on the southern border, something that many agents say is a top priority in places such as Laredo, are underway. The administration is promising that the pace of construction is increasing and that as much as 500 miles of new wall will be built by the end of 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut with those measures taking effect, officials are keeping their attention on Congress, saying that laws to close loopholes in the law are needed in order to stop the pull factors that are still enticing migrants to make the dangerous, and often deadly, journey north.\n\nWhen asked what he wanted Congress to do specifically, Morgan didn\u2019t need a moment to think, quickly rattling off a series of measures he says are needed at the frontline: a permanent fix to the Flores court settlement that limits how long children can be detained, changes to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) that prevents the U.S. from returning some children to their home countries, a fix to the \u201ccredible fear\u201d barrier for asylum claims, and for enforcement agencies to be given more funding to do their jobs.\n\nBut given the sharp partisan divide in Washington, Morgan isn\u2019t hopeful that agents will get any help from the halls of Congress any time soon.\n\n\u201cThey could do that in 15 minutes on one page if they would actually get together and do their job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t. I\u2019ve spoken to many of them and they\u2019re telling me its not going to happen and that's what's so frustrating.\u201d", "description": "Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan, in an interview with Fox News this week, accused members of Congress of lying in their attacks on agents on the ground doing their job of enforcing U.S. immigration law --telling them that it is hurting morale and that instead they should do their own jobs and", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Morgan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
