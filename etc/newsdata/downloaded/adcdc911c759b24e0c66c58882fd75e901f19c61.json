He warned that nothing \u2013 including Western pressure \u2013 can stop Turkey\u2019s operation.\n\nTurkish forces will advance 30 to 35km into Syrian territory as part of Operation \u2018Peace Spring\u2019, Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed in a televised speech on Sunday. The army and allied Syrian rebels have also taken under its control a 68-kilometer stretch of Syria\u2019s border, pushing back against the Kurdish resistance, he added.\n\nHe spoke shortly after Ankara proclaimed seizure of an important border town, Ras al-Ain, along with another settlement, Tal Abyad. Both towns had been held by Syrian Kurdish militias.\n\n\u201cWe focused first on the 120-km (75-mile) area between Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad. Thus, we will divide the 480 km terrorist corridor down the middle,\u201d Erdogan was quoted by Reuters as saying.\n\n\u201cThen we will take control of Hasaka on the one side and Ain al Arab [Kobani] on the other, and complete the operation,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s operation kicked off this week on the back of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to order US troops out of the area. Turkey protests that it\u2019s merely seeking to safeguard its border and to create a buffer zone for Syrian displaced persons and refugees. But the Kurdish-dominated People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) suspect the Turkish offensive targets their enclaves and claim that it may yet take the shape of an ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe operation was met with little praise among Ankara\u2019s allies in NATO. Some members \u2013 so far, France, Norway and Germany \u2013 have suspended their arms sales to Turkey in response. The US and the European Union also urged consideration of imposing sanctions on Turkey, but Erdogan believes it will not have any impact on his country\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cAfter we launched our operation, we have faced threats like economic sanctions and embargoes on weapons sales,\u201d he stated on Sunday. \u201cThose who think they can make Turkey turn back with these threats are gravely mistaken,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nAlso on rt.com Erdogan says Turkey \u2018won\u2019t stop\u2019 operation in northern Syria despite \u2018threats\u2019 as US warns it can \u2018shut down\u2019 Ankara\u2019s economy\n\nLike this story?
