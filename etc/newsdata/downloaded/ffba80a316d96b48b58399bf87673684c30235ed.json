Social media data can improve risk assessment in the insurance industry, assisting fraud detection capabilities. Insurers can look at their customers\u2019 social media activities and compare it with their claim records, looking for any differences. Banks use social media in much the same way.\n\n\u201cUsing social media as an indicator on somebody's risk or their propensity to default is a very grey area,\u201d said Zoe Willis, KPMG Partner Data and RegTech.\n\n\u201cShould you use social media analytics, or the data that people post about themselves online, to drive that? There are a lot of very deep conversations being had on that.\u201d\n\nPotential discrimination and data privacy are emerging risks in many industries. Retail, for example, has come under scrutiny for the use of facial tracking technology, which can capture the faces of shoppers, and cross-reference biometric data potentially to identify known shoplifters, with the ability - in a \u201csmart\u201d, or inter-connected shopping centre - to alert tenants as the tracked person moves around the mall.\n\nThe abilities that technology can give businesses can often \u201cover-excite\u201d them, said Scott Guse, partner, audit, assurance and risk consulting, at KPMG.\n\n\u201cThat is a situation where the technology's wonderful, and it has great application for stopping leakage in a retail business, so the retailers love it, but those ethical elements are very difficult,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf people get too excited about the technology and its capability, you could argue that they can lose sight of the bigger ethical picture.\u201d\n\nThe use of data, and of any technology, should always be considered in terms of the social licence to do so, said Ms Willis.\n\n\u201cFor example, that (facial recognition) technology can be used to spot vulnerable people that may need help, as well as people likely to offend,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhere we can, I think we have to focus on the positives that can come from the use of this technology, as well as the negatives. If we\u2019re keeping the social licence front-of-mind we can keep the focus on the benefits to society as a whole.\u201d\n\nSurveillance is a \u201cparticular minefield\u201d for the insurance industry, said Ms O\u2019Driscoll.\n\n\u201cThe justification for surveillance is the extent to which people actually try to defraud insurance, and fraudulent claims drive up the cost of insurance for everyone,'' she said. ''But on the other hand, the industry better understands ... the interaction of injury, and claims for injury, with mental health.\n\n\u201cSo instead of the focus of surveillance being on potential fraud, the industry is changing that to a focus on the fact that, where possible, people will be better off getting back to work.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jason Smith, board director at the Risk Management Institute of Australasia, it ultimately comes back to the human element.\n\n\u201cWhatever technology you're using, for whatever role, you need to maintain human oversight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThings like AI and machine learning can do a lot by themselves in the background, but ultimately you need to have a governance structure that drives human oversight.\n\n\u201cYou need to have governance in place that ensures that the data that you're collecting is actually fit for purpose, and you need to make sure that you've got absolute transparency - not only with what you're doing internally with the data, but also externally - so that what you\u2019re doing with the data is actually delivering a benefit to your customer, and to society.\u201d", "description": "In the race to harness emerging technologies, leverage data and innovate, it is easy to forget about associated digital governance and the new and emerging risks this information explosion brings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5597%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_483%2C$y_321/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0b44f31d367a1cde5bd5d73ac36c35bdfa7038fb", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
