Come in from the piazza, put down your panini, pause your shoemaking for just a second, and please imagine hearing this news from someone gesticulating wildly: A new Elena Ferrante novel is coming. To quote the emoji in the text I sent my mother: Siren / Italian flag / ladies with bunny ears / doll / high heel / pizza / broken heart.\n\nAccording to a new announcement, the English translation of the book is set to be published on June 9, 2020, under the title The Lying Life of Adults. (It will be published in Italy on November 7, 2019, so if you don\u2019t feel like waiting seven months, you can always try to very quickly learn Italian.) Last month, Ferrante\u2019s English-language publisher, Europa Editions, tweeted the first two paragraphs, giving us a brief glimpse of what\u2019s to come:\n\nTwo years before leaving home my father told my mother that I was very ugly.
