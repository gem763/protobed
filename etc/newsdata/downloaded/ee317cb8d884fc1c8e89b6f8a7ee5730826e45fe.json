According to Jordan, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified in front of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees earlier in the day, is not the first person who has provided details to Congress about the call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"There are four fundamental facts that have never changed, never changed: Mr. Vindman is not the first one we've talked to who has been on the call. We've heard from President Trump and President Zelensky. We've got the transcript,\" Jordan said. \"Both President Trump and President Zelensky have said no conditions, no pressure, no pushing, no quid pro quo. We've got the transcript that shows that. We know that the Ukrainians did not know at the time of the call that aid had been withheld and, tell me, what actions the Ukrainians or President Zelensky took to get the aid turned back on.\"\n\nZelensky never issued a statement or held a press conference saying he was going to conduct an investigation into Hunter Biden, who was paid $50,000 a month for sitting on the board of a gas company, despite having no natural energy experience. The only connection: Vice President Joe Biden was handling international relations with Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration\n\n\"Did he say he was going to investigate and do certain things?\" Jordan asked. \"None of that happened. Those four facts have never changed.\"\n\nAccording to Jordan, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) wants to continually talk about various Congressional testimonies that have been leaked even though the main facts behind the call have never changed.", "description": "Boom.10/29/2019 19:53:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/268/9b33d6f7-4a1d-40d6-b333-e239bfa694d2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
