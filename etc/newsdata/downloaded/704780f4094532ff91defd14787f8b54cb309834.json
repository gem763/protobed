The bloc\u2019s decision will be formalised \u201cthrough a written procedure,\u201d Tusk said, meaning that there will be no leaders\u2019 summit.\n\nThe EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK's request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020. The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 28, 2019\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters the diplomats\u2019 meeting was \u201cvery short, effective and constructive\u201d as he left the room.\n\nWhat Envoys Will Discuss in Brussels (9 a.m.)\n\nEnvoys from the remaining 27 EU members states debate the wording of two separate documents this morning - a six-page legal decision granting an extension, and a two-page declaration explaining the reasoning. The main points of the documents, drafts of which were obtained by Bloomberg on Sunday, are as follows:\n\nBrexit will take place on the first day of the month following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, \u201cor on 1 February 2020, whichever is the earliest\u201d.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement isn\u2019t up for renegotiation during the extension period. Note that EU leaders took a similar decision when they granted the previous extension in April, but broke their rule after Johnson\u2019s government, with different red lines, took office.\n\nThe UK must nominate a candidate for EU Commissioner after the extension is granted. However, the wording of the documents suggests that the confirmation process of the British candidate may not be finalized before the end of January, meaning the UK won\u2019t actually get to have a commissioner.\n\nThe EU reminds the UK that it still has the right to revoke Brexit.\n\nFinally, EU governments warn that the UK should do nothing which is seen as sabotaging the bloc during the extension period.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Different Routes to an Election (8:50 a.m.)\n\nThe European Union\u2019s apparent intention to extend the Brexit deadline to January 31 could yet have an impact on Monday\u2019s vote in the House of Commons. Yet Boris Johnson still looks likely to fall short of the two-thirds majority he needs to secure an early general election. That\u2019s because an extension on its own doesn\u2019t satisfy the opposition Labour Party\u2019s position that it won\u2019t support a snap poll until the risk of a no-deal Brexit is completely removed.\n\nBut over the weekend, another option emerged via a proposal from the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party. They suggested amending the Fixed-term Parliament Act to set the next election for December 9, which crucially would require only a simply majority to pass. The risk for the government lies in MPs trying to attach amendments to the bill, but a UK official later indicated such a move could be considered if it loses Monday\u2019s vote.\n\nThere\u2019s a final way Johnson could get his election - though it\u2019s a longer and untested process, with significant risks. The opposition or Johnson himself could trigger a no-confidence vote in the government, which requires a simply majority to succeed. Party leaders then would have 14 days to form a new government that can win a confidence vote, with Parliament dissolved - and a general election scheduled - if all efforts fail.\n\nMacron Backs Brexit Delay (7:48 a.m.)\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will agree to a Brexit extension, easing the risk of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal on October 31, according to a French government official.\n\nMacron has agreed a delay until January 31, said the official, who asked not to be identified. With other member states already supporting the move, France\u2019s backing paves the way for EU diplomats to sign off on an extension during talks in Brussels on Monday.", "description": "The European Union agreed to grant the UK a three-month Brexit delay to January 31, removing the risk of a damaging no-deal split.", "authors": ["Alex Morales", "Helene Fouquet", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4133/bd9548c8c146436e91edf45fe97615da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
