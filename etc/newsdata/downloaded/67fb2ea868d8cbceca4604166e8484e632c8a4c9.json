The US had to \u201cdeconflict\u201d with Russia and Turkey, which both operate in the crowded skies above Syria.\n\nThe compound was deep within territory controlled by al-Qaeda-aligned rebels. The officials said the mission was called off at least twice at the last minute.\n\nAn aerial shot taken of the site that was hit by helicopter gunfire during a raid on Baghdadi's location near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha in the Idlib province Credit: AFP More\n\nThe plan was coming together just as the US\u2019s 1,000 troops were being pulled out of the country and sat waiting for instructions in neighbouring Iraq. Mr Trump's decision to pull out left the US's main partner against Isil, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to fight alone.\n\nRealising belatedly that the decision had forfeited all US leverage, Mr Trump then ordered several hundred of them to return last week.\n\nAccording to war monitor, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights 500 have crossed back over the border in recent days.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former presidential envoy to the anti-Isil coalition who resigned in December over Mr Trump\u2019s decision to drawdown troops, said the operation \u201cspoke to what we have forfeited with the sudden US retreat across its northeast this month.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt order to withdraw US troops from Syria disrupted the planning of the raid on Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound, it has emerged.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HXRVgVYtUIhdpw7Fhu0A3Q--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/d2faa594f8fb29e9e3133c0ca1b9abae", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
