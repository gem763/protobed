thousands demonstrate again as Lebanon\u2019s government frays", "language": "en", "text": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets for a fourth day Sunday to protest political stasis and corruption, as the government was rocked by the resignation of a coalition partner.\n\nDemonstrations began spontaneously on Thursday in response to a proposed tax on calls via WhatsApp and other messaging services.\n\nWhile the government quickly dropped the plans, the protests morphed into demands for a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon\u2019s political system, with grievances ranging from austerity measures to poor infrastructure.\n\nMore than a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, according to the World Bank, while the country\u2019s political class has remained relatively unchanged since the end of a devastating 15-year civil war in 1990.\n\nSunday saw street rallies swell again, with thousands streaming into central Beirut and other locations throughout the country, many chanting \u201crevolution\u201d or \u201cthe people demand the fall of the regime\u201d \u2014 a common refrain of demonstrations in other parts of the Arab world.\n\n\u201cI am demonstrating here to bring down the president\u2019s men and his corrupt government,\u201d Sanaa Mallah, 40, said in downtown Beirut. \u201cI have a lot of hope in this movement.\u201d\n\nBeleaguered Prime Minister Saad Hariri set a Monday night deadline for coalition partners to back reforms, but the four ministers of the Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party resigned Saturday evening.\n\nLebanon ranked 138 out of 180 in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption index, while citizens suffer chronic electricity and water shortages.\n\n\u2013 Deadline under fire \u2013\n\nLebanon\u2019s political system was set up to balance power between the country\u2019s religious sects, including Christians, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims and Druze.\n\nWhat some have dubbed the \u201cWhatsApp revolution\u201d has support from wide swathes of Lebanese society.\n\nThe protests have been mostly good-natured, with people singing or launching into traditional dabke dances, while others play cards and smoke shisha.\n\nIn Tripoli, Lebanon\u2019s traditionally conservative second city, the protests at points looked like a music festival Saturday evening, with a DJ pumping out dance music from loudspeakers.\n\nBut while the demonstrators are largely united on what they oppose \u2014 with many condemning the entire political class as thieves and criminals \u2014 they so far lack a clear set of demands.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Hariri did not say what would happen if the government did not back key reforms by Monday night, with the 72-hour deadline widely mocked among protestors and on social media.\n\nScuppering Hariri\u2019s unity call, Lebanese Forces head Samir Geagea, announced late Saturday that the party\u2019s four ministers were quitting the government.\n\n\u201cWe are now convinced that the government is unable to take the necessary steps to save the situation,\u201d Geagea said.\n\nOther members of the government, including Shiite movement Hezbollah, oppose the government\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Thieves\u2019 \u2013\n\nDemonstrators hailed Geagea\u2019s announcement but demanded more wholesale change.\n\nZalfa Aboukais, 27, was hanging signs bearing the names of lawmakers and ministers on barbed wire near parliament and the seat of government, saying they were all \u201cthieves\u201d.\n\nOriginally from south Lebanon, she said she was protesting \u201cagainst the hooligans who have been in power for 30 years\u201d.\n\nDani Mourtada said the country was waking up to reject entrenched sectarian divisions.\n\n\u201cWe no longer want people to beg for legitimate rights and services that the state is supposed to provide,\u201d the 26-year-old protester said.\n\nLebanon is one of the world\u2019s most indebted countries, with a deficit of around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.\n\nPublic anger surged after parliament passed an austerity budget in July as part of efforts to make reforms that are essential if Lebanon is to unlock over $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.",
