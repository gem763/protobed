The VC firms that would not respond to requests for information about Epstein are: Felicis Ventures, Floodgate, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, IVP, Softbank, and Venrock.\n\nNot a single VC firms that Business Insider reached out to has said that Epstein was a limited partner.\n\nBut there's a big asterisk\n\nHowever, even for those VC firms that disavowed any direct involvement with Epstein, it's not yet possible to rule out the possibility that he was invested in the firms. That's because many of the limited partners in VC firms are not specific named people, but rather a family office, a \"fund of funds,\" and other types of wealth funds not legally required to disclose whose money they manage.\n\nSo, unless someone working at a VC firm had reason to be cautious of one of those investors and had asked for more details, it is unlikely they would know if any of the money in their funds came from Epstein.\n\nEpstein was charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. He was found dead by suicide on August 10 in his prison cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan after being refused bail.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Epstein?
