Here's an overview of the three biggest hardware announcements from the event: Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe highlight of the event was Apple's unveiling of its new media services, which the company appears to be using to restore demand for its hardware products as revenue slips. The tech giant's new ad-free subscription gaming offering, Apple Arcade, and its streaming video service, Apple TV+, each start at $4.99 per month for a family subscription (up to 6 members), undercutting existing services on the market.\n\nFor instance, Netflix starts at $12.99, Amazon Prime $8.99, and Hulu $7.99. However, Apple's low prices to incentivize adoption isn't the biggest highlight \u2014 the company is also offering its media services for free for one year with a new hardware purchase.\n\nThe low price points and one-year promotion for Apple's new media services highlight how the company is positioning content as a marketing vehicle, deepening the overall appeal of the Apple brand to not only keep customers in the iOS ecosystem, but also entice new ones. Should it be successful, it will be able to earn even more revenue from its services.", "description": "Apple's new media services will cost less than Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu \u2013 and will be offered for free for one year.", "authors": ["Rayna Hollander"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78ecd52e22af2e61325058-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
