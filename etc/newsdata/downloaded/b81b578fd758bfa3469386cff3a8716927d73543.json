I spoke to her last night and again twice this morning. As I\u2019ve said before, I believe she is handling this appropriately and she has my support,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday.\n\nSchumer on Wednesday said the transcript released by the White House earlier in the day \u201cwas far more damaging to the president\u2019s case than any of us anticipated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this telephone conversation, the president of the United States made an extraordinary request to the president of Ukraine, to investigate Trump\u2019s political opponent and aid President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cDoes anyone think this conversation was in the national interest? Or was it in the president\u2019s personal political interest?\u201d\n\nIn the call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate whether Biden, who served as vice president under former President Obama, used his influence to shut down a Ukrainian corruption investigation that might have touched his son, who was a paid board member to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nTrump said he would have Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiSenate Democrats hesitant to go all-in on impeachment probe Trump defiant in face of impeachment inquiry Democratic senators request probe into whistleblower complaint MORE, the former mayor of New York and his personal lawyer, and Barr get in touch with Zelensky to pursue the matter further.\n\nOther Democrats on Wednesday said Trump\u2019s effort to set up a follow-up conversation with Giuliani was evidence that he was motivated by personal political gain.\n\n\u201cIn some ways it\u2019s even more damning to say to the leader of this foreign country, \u2018Meet with my personal lawyer and help him out.\u2019 That shows that Trump was trying to use the office for personal gain, because Giuliani is not a U.S. official,\u201d said Sen.

Kaine: No reason for US to 'engage in military action to protect Saudi oil' MORE (D-Va.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nA second Democratic senator who requested anonymity to discuss the political dynamics of the impeachment debate expressed surprise that the White House thought releasing the transcript somehow exonerated Trump from wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI think they don\u2019t know what\u2019s improper,\u201d said the Democratic lawmaker. \u201cThis is probably the least bad thing they could release. There\u2019s probably more.\u201d\n\nThe senator speculated the White House released the transcript to lessen pressure to release a complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general against Trump.\n\n\u201cI think the complaint itself is going to be extensive and exhaustive and damaging,\u201d the Democratic senator said.", "description": "Senate\u00a0Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who for months has resisted pressure from the left to impeach President Trump, on Wednesday offered a full-throated endorsement of starting impeachment proceedings in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schumercharles_transcript_092519gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
