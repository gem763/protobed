While it\u2019s been fun to discover things for myself, it has also been confusing. Here are some changes I\u2019ve noticed or seen players talking about so far.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go back to the lobby after a match\n\nThere\u2019s a new option to queue up for the next match from the after-death spectating screen, sparing you a return to the lobby. It\u2019s a nice feature, and in my experience, I haven\u2019t had to wait terribly long between matches either.\n\nThe water at Slurpy Swamp gives you shields\n\nThere are 13 new locations on the new map; they\u2019re listed as question marks until you visit them for the first time, which also helps you make progress in an XP-granting mission. The water pouring from some pipes at a spot called Slurpy Swamp looks an awful lot like slurp juice. Turns out it works like slurp juice, too: standing in the glowing water gives you shields.\n\nThe pickaxe key has changed\n\nThe pickaxe has a dedicated key now. On PC, you used to equip your pickaxe by pressing 1. Now, the key is F. Please do not be me, who goes for their pickaxe only to throw a grenade at themselves instead. (I lived.)\n\nYou can upgrade weapons\n\nWeapons can be upgraded at an upgrade bench, which are scattered around the map. VG24/7 has a rundown of where some of them are. I found one in a garage at Weeping Woods; giving the bench 150 wood, brick, and metal upgraded my green tactical shotgun to a blue one, with higher-level upgrades presumably costing more. That\u2019s a lot of materials, and I\u2019m not sure it was worth it in my case. But it\u2019s a cool option if you happen to find yourself with enough materials to spare, or if you can tweak an already-powerful weapon into a game-changer.\n\nYou can hide in dumpsters and haystacks\n\nApproaching certain dumpsters and haystacks will give you the option to hide inside them. It\u2019s no substitute for the bush, and it hasn\u2019t figured hugely into any of my matches yet, but it\u2019s fun. According to a few players, you can dive into haystacks and dumpsters and not take fall damage, or at the very least recreate Assassin\u2019s Creed.\n\nYou can carry downed teammates \u2014 and enemies\n\nIf you approach a downed teammate or enemy, you\u2019ll get a prompt to carry them. You can hoist them over your shoulders and run around with them. In one of my matches, a teammate picked me up and carried me to a safe place so they could revive me. Helpful! In another match, I downed an enemy, picked them up, and ran them over to the rest of my companions so they could watch me finish them off. Mean!\n\nIt seems you can also finish downed enemies off by carrying them someplace high and dropping them, which is overkill, but hilarious.\n\nYou can heal yourself with the Bandage Bazooka\n\nChapter 2 has a new weapon, the Bandage Bazooka, which heals teammates when you fire it at them. It takes up two inventory slots, but it\u2019s worth lugging around. You can heal yourself with it by firing it at your feet.\n\nYou can fish for health\n\nThere are new findable fishing poles. To fish, equip the pole and use your primary fire to cast it. If you\u2019re near some fish and wait long enough, the bobber will dip; if you press fire again at the right time, you\u2019ll catch something. I caught a fish called a Flopper, which gave me health when I ate it. According to Gamespot, you can also catch fish that give you shields, or come up with weapons or materials. I wouldn\u2019t start playing Stardew Valley in the middle of a Fortnite match, but I can see having a lot of fun with this in playground mode.\n\nAchievements\n\nFortnite has achievements now. You can view the achievements you\u2019ve gotten under the \u201ccareer\u201d tab. So far, I\u2019ve gotten some for using a bandage in the storm, healing inside a specific location, and landing on the new island. Achievement reporting seems to be a little wonky \u2014 some people are seeing the wrong achievements, and my \u201cI\u2019m Trash\u201d achievement does not appear in my career screen. Gamesradar has a list of achievements, but I kind of like the surprise.\n\nBattle stars have been replaced with XP\n\nBattle stars, which used to level up your battle pass, seem to be out \u2014 now, missions reward XP, and XP levels up your pass. It feels like I\u2019m getting rewarded with XP a lot more now too, including for doing things like searching chests and ammo boxes, surviving storm circles, and gathering materials. The game notifies you of your XP gain, and it also keeps track of it in a bar at the bottom of the screen. Epic wrote that this season would feature \u201cmore fun, less grind,\u201d and so far I feel like I\u2019m making progress faster.\n\nThere are medals\n\nAt the left side of your lobby you\u2019ll see a \u201cmedal punchcard.\u201d There are 10 medals on the card, which refreshes once a day. The fifth and tenth medal reward 4,000 XP, while the others reward 2,000. You get medals for routine stuff you do during play, such as scavenging and surviving. As far as I understand it, you upgrade the medal by doing the thing it rewards you for more \u2014 search enough chests in a match to get a bronze medal, for instance, and, if you keep searching chests, you\u2019ll get a silver one. Once you get 10 medals, you have completed your punchcard and earned all the bonus XP it provides. Once you complete the punchcard you can still earn medals, but you won\u2019t get the big XP bonus.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s me, but matches feel easier\n\nEpic said last season that computer-controlled opponents would be coming this season, and changes to matchmaking were implemented last season. There\u2019s no official word on bots, but I\u2019ve definitely eliminated some opponents who behaved unlike human players: standing still too long, not shooting back, and not reviving their downed companions. While it\u2019s been nice to feel like I\u2019m doing well in a match, it\u2019s definitely lulled me into a false sense of security \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve assumed an opponent is a bot and let down my guard, only to have them do something unexpected and surprise me. As you level up, you should see fewer bots and face off against more humans.\n\nDo you know any tricks or changes I missed? Have some bot-spotting tips?
