USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 They were born just 61 days apart, and while their baseball fates have been intertwined for the past five years, Ryan Zimmerman and Max Scherzer occupy different corners in the fresh landscape of the Washington Nationals franchise.\n\nZimmerman was the OG star, their first draft pick in 2005 and instant franchise face who gave fans hope in grim years and 30-plus homers in his best years. Scherzer is the undisputed king these days, providing a holiday for a subset of D.C. every fifth day when he snarls around the mound at Nationals Park.\n\nMonday night, though, the 35-year-old stalwarts joined forces to send a powerful message that their franchise, their teammates and fans can easily appreciate:\n\nWe\u2019re not done, yet.\n\nFacing elimination and a 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers team that had every advantage coming into this National League Division Series, Zimmerman provided desperately needed cover for Scherzer with a three-run home run that gave the three-time Cy Young Award winner a five-run lead.\n\nFrom there, Scherzer tapped into every ounce of his reserves to bull through seven innings and give the bullpen-deficient Nationals a season-saving, 6-1 victory.\n\nFor the fourth time in franchise history, the Nationals will attempt to win a decisive Game 5 and their first playoff series ever. They can sleep in Tuesday before an afternoon flight to Los Angeles ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Game 5.\n\nSome will need the rest more than others.\n\n\u201cWe're a bunch of viejos,\u201d Scherzer said of he, Zimmerman and the 16 Nationals on the wrong side of 30. \u201cWe\u2019re old guys. Old guys can still do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Zimmerman mused, \u201cnice way to say, \u2018Veterans.\u2019\u201d\n\nMax Scherzer reacts after the last out of the top of the seventh inning. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMaking his second elimination-game start in seven days and pitching just two days after a dominant and series-shifting one-inning relief outing in a Game 2 win, Scherzer summoned every bit of his physical and emotional reservoirs to navigate a Dodgers lineup that led the major leagues in on-base and slugging percentage.\n\nThat challenge was complicated by the knowledge Nationals manager Dave Martinez knew there were just three men he wanted pitching in this game: Scherzer and the two most reliable parts of the club\u2019s 29th-ranked bullpen, Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson.\n\nGAME 4: Zimmerman, Scherzer lead Nationals to win against Dodgers\n\nNLDS: Cardinals force Game 5 with walk-off win vs. Braves\n\nSo Scherzer tried to dial back his Mad Max persona and garner more efficient outs. Not until the fourth inning did he notch a strikeout of a position player. His fastball sat in the mid-90s, rather than the upper 90s he touched during a lackluster start in the Oct. 1 wild card game against Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s smart, man. He knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d says his catcher, Kurt Suzuki. \u201cI think he knew we needed a big game out of him, a longer game out of him, so he kind of paced himself a little bit.\u201d\n\nJustin Turner tagged him for a first-inning home run but Scherzer allowed nothing else, stranding two runners in the second before finding a higher gear after Cody Bellinger\u2019s leadoff single and stolen base in the fifth.\n\nScherzer would strike out five of the next six Dodgers and retire 10 in a row overall, bringing the Nationals within seven outs of victory.\n\nAnd then, he hit the wall.\n\nWith one out in the seventh, pinch-hitter David Freese rapped a single. Dodgers rookies Gavin Lux and Will Smith followed by working a pair of walks, Lux extending Scherzer through eight pitches before reaching.\n\nThe bases were loaded. Scherzer\u2019s pitch count was at 99. Pitching coach Paul Menhart paid a mound visit to stem the tide.\n\nScherzer, who\u2019d probably refuse a bandage if you wounded his flesh, knew he was reeling, his arm slot dropping from fatigue.\n\n\u201cI was just gassed. I was out,\u201d he said. \u201cI was emptying the tank, giving everything I got. It becomes a mental grind that you have to, in that moment, collect yourself and try to execute pitches.\u201d\n\nPinch hitter Chris Taylor looked like he\u2019d follow in Lux and Smith\u2019s footsteps, falling into a two-strike hole only to work a full count. Scherzer finally finished him on a slider.\n\nLeadoff man Joc Pederson was next, and Scherzer and the 36,847 on hand could be forgiven if the young franchise\u2019s ugly October past was on their minds. Pederson tagged Scherzer for a game-tying home run in Game 5 of the 2016 NLDS, and the Dodgers eliminated the Nationals in an epic.\n\nA year later, Scherzer took the loss in relief in a Game 5 against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nNow, with Doolittle stirring but knowing this was Scherzer\u2019s game, the tying run lurked on deck.\n\nFinally, a break.\n\nPederson laced a ball down the right field line that, with two outs, would have cleared the bases and made it a 6-4 game.\n\nIt hooked foul by the thinnest of margins.\n\n\u201cThat ball's an inch foul,\u201d says Scherzer, \u201cand it could have been an inch fair.\u201d\n\nFinally, on his 109th pitch, Scherzer got Pederson on a roller to second. The needle on his proverbial tank tilted hard toward E.\n\n\u201cAnd there were 33, 34 guys pushing the car behind him,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI mean, he was at his wits end right there. Veteran guy, big moment, comes through.\u201d\n\nIt was Zimmerman who filled that bill earlier, slamming a three-run home run off Pedro Baez to stretch a 2-1 lead to 5-1, and ensure him another couple days in a Nationals uniform.\n\nIt has been a weird month for the ballclub. MVP candidate Anthony Rendon \u2013 who drove in the go-ahead run with a single two batters before Zimmerman\u2019s blast \u2013 is a free agent once this season ends.\n\nZimmerman, too, could be a goner once this ride ends.\n\n\u201cThere's been a lot of people,\u201d he says, \u201cthat think these are my last games.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals hold an $18 million option on Zimmerman for 2020, which they almost certainly won\u2019t exercise. But the possibility exists that the two sides bump up a $2 million buyout owed Zimmerman into a pact both sides can stomach for a part-time first base gig\u2013 say, $5 million a year \u2013 and he remains a National.\n\nIf not, he\u2019ll try to play elsewhere, but not at any cost; Zimmerman, wife Heather and their two children have settled in Northern Virginia. A million bucks and a part-time DH gig in Seattle probably won\u2019t pry him away.\n\n\u201cThe situation that I've had here has been a special one,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, my family's close, my wife is from here, so I'm lucky, I get to see my kids for 81 games. A lot of guys are on the road. I think a lot of guys would love to have this situation, but don't really have the opportunity that I've had.\n\n\u201cSo, I think I feel more lucky than anything.\u201d\n\nIt was skill that prevailed Monday night, along with a burning desire to play on, contracts and aging curves be damned.\n\n\u201cI mean, this is why you play the game,\u201d Zimmerman said, pondering one more Game 5, Stephen Strasburg vs. Walker Buehler and a chance to make franchise history in L.A.\n\n\u201cThis is what we live for.\u201d", "description": "Facing elimination, elder statesmen Ryan Zimmerman and Max Scherzer gave the Nationals another Game 5 shot.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
