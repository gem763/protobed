(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty)\n\nIt\u2019s honestly impressive how much a small change can derail our routine, especially when we\u2019re used to muscle memory taking the wheel for those million and one itty bitty tasks each day no one has time to think about.\n\nLike, say, replying to an email. It\u2019s important, sure, but practically second nature at this point. So, perhaps to keep us all on our toes, make sure its users haven\u2019t been zombified by the glare of their phones yet, Apple decided it\u2019d be a good idea to switch things up with the iPhone email app\u2019s design with this latest OS. Now I\u2019m no designer, but I would think that putting the trash button anywhere near where people are already used to clicking would be one of the first things they teach you not to do.\n\nThen again, we are talking about Apple; a company that prides itself on innovation and bucking conventional wisdom. So maybe we sheeple are simply missing how game-changing this UI update really is.\n\nIn the meantime, though, it\u2019s causing a hell of a lot of frustration. Since iOS 13 rolled out last month, the iPhone\u2019s email app now has both the trash and reply buttons housed in the screen\u2019s bottom right corner where only the latter was before. So when people go to send a quick reply to an email, many are accidentally deleting it instead. While it\u2019s not exactly a critical issue\u2014users will undoubtedly burn this new muscle memory into their synapses eventually\u2014it seems like such an obvious problem to crop up that you can\u2019t help but wonder how this got the OK from Apple\u2019s design team.\n\nNBC News first reported on the story Thursday and shared some of the complaints users have posted to Twitter, including one from Fox News\u2019 chief White House correspondent John Roberts who asked, \u201cWho @Apple thought this was the best positioning for the trash icon in emails??\u201d\n\nWHY did @Apple think it was a good idea to put the trash icon in the mail app where the reply button was in the old iOS? I have been deleting all my important emails. \u2014 Jenna Rosenstein (@JennaRosenstein) October 1, 2019\n\nThank you @Apple for putting the trash icon exactly where the reply button used to be in iOS 13 Mail. Wow that\u2019s silly. \u2014 Stretch Armstrong (@StretchArmy) October 10, 2019\n\nThanks @Apple for the new email app redesign\u2014 for putting the Trash can icon where the Reply icon used to be. I\u2019ve only archived roughly every email since. ????#musclememory \u2014 Brittany Ward (@BrittanyWard) October 10, 2019\n\n@Apple please rethink the placement of the trash icon.... I\u2019ve deleted so many emails in the last few weeks lol. #Apple #MoveTrashIcon pic.twitter.com/ffYpyaSxSb \u2014 Marcus Smith (@MarcusSmithKTLA) October 19, 2019\n\nWord\u2019s out on whether Apple simply didn\u2019t catch this or was trying to streamline the app\u2019s toolbar\u2014I suppose it does look a bit cleaner?\u2014or improve it in some other way. The company did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: This is definitely a first-world problem. As NBC News points out in its coverage, users can avoid this entire mix-up by enabling the app\u2019s \u201cask before deleting\u201d feature in settings. There are much, much more pressing issues going on in the world in the year of our lord 2019.\n\nBut man is it annoying.", "description": "It\u2019s honestly impressive how much a small change can derail our routine, especially when we\u2019re used to muscle memory taking the wheel for those million and one itty bitty tasks each day no one has time to think about....", "authors": ["Alyse Stanley", "Matt Hopkins"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/d6qjebxmziylcihpxn15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
