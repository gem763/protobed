Whitaker, Trump\u2019s former acting attorney general, taking to the airwaves of Fox News to declare that a president abusing power not only isn\u2019t a crime, but also isn\u2019t even impeachable.\n\n\u201cAbuse of power is not a crime,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cLet\u2019s fundamentally boil it down. The Constitution\u2019s very clear that this has to be some pretty egregious behavior.\u201d\n\nMatthew Whitaker: Abuse of power is not a crime pic.twitter.com/IJsEwRTs8N \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) October 23, 2019\n\nEven for a team of supporters accustomed to moving the goal posts for Trump, taking \u201cabuse of power\u201d and suggesting it would not clear the bar was something.\n\nThen came Wednesday morning, when a throng of Republican congressmen, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), decided to storm the proceedings of the House impeachment inquiry to highlight concerns about its process. They effectively shut it down for five hours and caused the testimony of Defense Department aide Laura Cooper to be delayed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe situation harked back to 2016, when House Democrats \u2014 who were then in the minority \u2014 staged a sit-in protest on the House floor over gun control. At the time, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) declared that Democrats had \u201creplaced rule of law with the rules of the mob.\u201d Another House Republican shouted, \u201cRule of law means order!\u201d Another stickler for the rules at the time was then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who is now acting White House chief of staff. \u201cWhen somebody violates all the rules that they, you know, said they would adhere to and sets bad precedent for the future,\u201d Mulvaney said, \u201cit simply shows that if you act badly, you can get what you want.\u201d\n\nBeyond the issue of the rules in this protest was the matter of security. The impeachment inquiry depositions are held in a secure room, but some Republicans brought in their cellphones, which is against the rules, raising concerns about whether the room had been compromised.\n\nThe last development on the rule-of-law front Wednesday was in an actual courtroom. While defending Trump from having to turn over his private financial records, his private attorney William S. Consovoy made an extremely broad assertion of presidential immunity. He said that basically no jurisdiction \u2014 whether local or federal \u2014 can investigate a sitting president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd when a judge asked him whether that would also be the case if Trump, as he so famously intoned, shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City, Consovoy responded in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cLocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate? They couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d U.S. Appeals Court Judge Denny Chin asked. \u201cNothing could be done? That is your position?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Consovoy said, noting that any crimes could be handled once the president was out of office.\n\nIt is understood that a president can\u2019t be indicted while in office; this is the policy of the Justice Department and has been dating to Richard Nixon. What is much more controversial is the idea that jurisdictions cannot even investigate Trump. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero recently called the Trump team\u2019s assertion of immunity \u201cvirtually limitless\u201d and deemed the claim \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s fundamental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe claim is merely the latest bold one from the Trump legal team and from Consovoy. Earlier this year, both the White House counsel and Consovoy maintained that Congress also had no right to investigate the president for the sake of oversight.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta asked Consovoy that if \u201ca president was involved in some corrupt enterprise, you mean to tell me, because he is the president of the United States, Congress would not have power to investigate?\u201d Consovoy answered that was his argument, because it would not be \u201cpursuant to its legislative agenda.\u201d\n\nCongress has since launched impeachment proceedings, which is a power expressly granted in the Constitution and would seem to mitigate questions about whether its members have the authority to do what they are doing. But Republicans are making all kinds of other process arguments to attack the legitimacy of the investigation and decline to cooperate \u2014 even as there is little in the law to guide what impeachment proceedings must look like. They are complaining about the lack of a due process, even though this isn\u2019t a trial (yet). They cry foul over the lack of a vote to launch the inquiry, which has been held in the past but is not required by law.\n\nAnd as that situation and Trump\u2019s standing as president become more embattled, it looks as though the \u201crule of law\u201d party is going to continue making arguments about why Trump holds a unique place in relation to that law \u2014 and why perhaps it\u2019s worth breaking the rules on his behalf.\n\nAD", "description": "Several examples highlight a remarkable day when it comes to the Republican Party and the rule of law.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xG0oiBZPANvyYhtrgBhV1StPcBQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQK46CDBJAI6TPZE3NFZ7NRKUI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
