The firm claimed the agency was unconstitutional. But a district court rejected that argument and the appeals court also ruled in favor of the agency against Seila Law.\n\nSeila Law has since asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, but the high court did not add it to the docket for its upcoming October term.\n\nEven so, the House is looking to kill the request after the Trump administration announced last month it would not defend the CFPB's structure before the Supreme Court. I explain why here.\n\nThe background: CFPB critics argued that by making the bureau's director fireable by the president only \"for cause,\" which is generally considered to be severe incompetence or misconduct, Dodd-Frank illegally restricted the president's control over the executive branch.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in 2016 that the CFPB's structure was unconstitutional. But that decision, authored by eventual Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Warren judicial ethics plan would allow new investigations into Kavanaugh The Hill's Morning Report - Trump's impeachment woes mount MORE, was overturned by the full court in 2018.\n\nThe House's rebuttal: The House brief asked the Supreme Court to abide by the D.C. Circuit ruling to protect the CFPB, arguing that the president has ample authority to fire the bureau's director if she or he is not enforcing the law.\n\nThe brief also noted that because the CFPB is controlled by a single director, the president wields significant power over the agency by choosing who leads it.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nNew IMF head: Trade disputes contributing to 'synchronized global slowdown' New International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva cautioned on Tuesday that reports to be released next week will show the lowest global economic growth numbers this decade.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the Bulgarian economist said in her first speech as head of the IMF that 90 percent of world economies will experience a decrease in growth amid what Georgieva described as a \"synchronized global slowdown.\"\n\nGeorgieva, who succeeded former IMF leader Christine Lagarde last month, attributed the \"slowdown\" to increased trade conflicts, namely the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. These conflicts, she said, could lead to a loss of $700 billion in world trade output, or 0.8 percent of the world's gross domestic product.\n\n\"Everyone loses in a trade war,\" Georgieva said in her speech.\n\nFederal deficit estimated at $984B, highest in seven years: The federal budget deficit for 2019 is estimated at $984 billion, a hefty 4.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and the highest since 2012, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said on Monday.\n\nThe difference between federal spending and revenue has only ever exceeded $1 trillion four times, in the period immediately following the global financial crisis.\n\nThe deficit, which has grown every year since 2015, is $205 billion higher than it was in 2018, a jump of 26 percent.\n\nThe CBO has warned that the nation's debt is on an unsustainable path. Higher levels of debt increase borrowing costs, make it harder for the government to battle economic downturns and increase the share of future spending devoted to paying off interest costs.

I hope the @NBA can learn from that courage and not abandon those values for the sake of their bottom line,\" McConnell tweeted.\n\nMcConnell is only the latest lawmaker to criticize the league for attempting to quash Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet urging support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Hill's Alex Bolton has more on McConnell weighing in on the controversy.\n\nNBA commish shifts message: Earlier Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a new statement as the league battled accusations from lawmakers in both parties that it had bowed to pressure from China in expressing regret over an executive's tweet of support for demonstrators in Hong Kong.\n\nSilver said he recognized that the league's initial statement had left people \"angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for,\" and then insisted it would continue to offer support for free expression by players and executives. At the same time, Silver made it clear the NBA would not be taking sides in the political dispute over civil rights in Hong Kong.\n\n\"It is inevitable that people around the world -- including from America and China -- will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,\" Silver said in the statement. \"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nMore from The Hill's Marty Johnson here.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Tuesday and welcome back to On The Money.
