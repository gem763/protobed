Many observers acknowledge that deepening polarization in American politics can lead to abuses of power. Less understood is how the current crisis has been fueled by a failed Russia policy spanning several administrations.\n\nSince the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, a series of U.S. presidents were misled by wishful thinking and strategic naivet\u00e9 about the long-term ambitions of Russian leaders, who now threaten the American homeland. Three fallacies stand out.\n\nFirst, the death of Soviet communism was not synonymous with the end of Russian imperialism. Leninism was simply the 20th century veneer for Russia\u2019s expansionism. In previous centuries, Russia\u2019s rulers had deployed Christian Orthodoxy and pan-Slavdom to conquer their neighbors and claim a global role, and they would invent new justifications in the 21st century.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSecond, the surrender of Moscow\u2019s colonies, such as Ukraine and Georgia, happened at a time of weakness from which the Kremlin would sooner or later recover. Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinTo get rid of Maduro in Venezuela, US must challenge his enablers Greta Thunberg updates Twitter bio to include Putin criticism Putin says he doesn't share 'excitement' about Greta Thunberg's UN speech MORE became the embodiment of a resurgent Russia determined to regain its global stature and lost territories.\n\nAnd third, an imperialist Russian government cannot be a genuine partner for Washington; rather, it is a constant adversary intent on weakening America\u2019s international influence. According to Russia\u2019s military doctrine, NATO led by the U.S. remains Russia\u2019s main enemy on the global stage.\n\nThe George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations were fortunate to deal with a Russia preoccupied with internal crises during the 1990s. Even the George W. Bush administration pushed forward with NATO enlargement without significant resistance from Moscow. But the shortcomings of U.S. policy were most clearly displayed during the Obama and Trump terms.\n\nUnder President Obama, the notion prevailed that Russia could become a genuine partner in resolving regional crises and nuclear proliferation. Moscow\u2019s former dominions in Central-Eastern Europe looked on in dismay as the Obama-Hilary Clinton \u201creset\u201d was supposed to place relations on an even keel. For the Kremlin, the \u201creset\u201d signaled a green light to restore its empire, especially as Washington was ready to overlook that just a year before, in August 2008, Russian forces had invaded and carved up a pro-Western Georgia.\n\nAs a result of the \u201creset,\u201d Obama surrendered the initiative to Putin by cancelling the missile defense system that was supposed to defend NATO\u2019s new allies in Central Europe and halting further NATO enlargement \u2014 the one sure protection against Kremlin revisionism. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, it became clear that the Obama administration had gravely miscalculated Kremlin intentions and strategies. Although some analysts posited that Moscow had invented some new form of \u201chybrid warfare,\u201d in reality the use of disinformation, proxies and fraudulent elections to seize territory had been standard operational practice in the Soviet arsenal for decades.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Obama response to the invasion of Ukraine was ineffective in rolling back Russia\u2019s gains, even denying Kyiv the most vital weapons for self\u2013defense. And many policy makers still failed to grasp that it was precisely the weak political and military reaction to Russia\u2019s partition of Georgia that encouraged attacks on other neighbors.\n\nWhile Republicans claim that they are tougher toward Russia, Putin calculated that a Trump presidency would be even more beneficial. And Washington\u2019s response to Moscow\u2019s campaign to destabilize Western democracies has been inadequate. Instead of stifling the assault by turning the tables on Russia in the cyber, informational, economic, financial, and domestic domains, Putin\u2019s multi-pronged attacks have actually intensified since Trump took office.\n\nThe mixed messages by the White House toward Russia has enticed Moscow into probing for further weaknesses and divisions among U.S. policymakers. While the Pentagon and Congress have been consistently supportive of Ukraine in its self-defense against Russia\u2019s invasion, as U.S. elections approach the White House may increasingly favor a revision of history that whitewashes Russia and pushes Kyiv to surrender territory in order to achieve a \u201cpeace settlement.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin will exploit political vendettas in Washington and will feed the revisionist notion that it was Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections to assist a favored candidate. Indeed, some gullible voters may even believe that Russian forces tried to help America by attacking Ukraine in order to find Clinton\u2019s Emails.\n\nUntil now, Trump\u2019s national security team has supported the victims of Moscow\u2019s aggression and has delivered effective military equipment to Kyiv. But if Congress proves that the White House was willing to deprive Ukrainians of weapons over a domestic political struggle, the lesson for Moscow will be obvious. By assisting selected presidential candidates and feeding disinformation to the American public, the Kremlin can not only exacerbate the political conflicts in Washington but also manipulate U.S. policy to weaken Ukraine and other targeted states.\n\nJanusz Bugajski is a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) in Washington, D.C.
