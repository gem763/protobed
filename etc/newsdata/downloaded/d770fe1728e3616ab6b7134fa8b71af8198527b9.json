I got a tip that she was in Christchurch. This is the moment that I've been waiting for for six years,' Guy said in a video, which was shared via the Jono and Ben YouTube channel on October 2019.\n\nIn a sit-down interview with Karen, Guy asked her to take him back to the day she made the abusive phone call.\n\n'Why did Rachel owe you $20?' Guy asked.\n\nLaughing at his question, Karen responded: 'This is self-incriminating. It was for some marijuana. So I don't buy it to sell it, I buy it to smoke it.'\n\nGuy asked her whether she feels embarrassed now after listening back to her voicemail, to which she replied: 'Sometimes, because it was never my intention for the rest of the world to listen to it.\n\n'I was very surprised [when the voicemail blew up on YouTube] because I didn't understand technology - and just how great and fast it is,' she added.\n\nDuring the interview, Guy said her laugh was 'terrifying' but he admitted: 'Karen was the opposite to what I expected, she was kind and oddly charming.'\n\nShe became an internet sensation in 2013 after leaving an angry voicemail threatening to get her $20 back\n\nFast forward, comedian Guy Williams (left) has finally tracked down Karen (right) after he embarked on a six-year mission to get to the bottom of the money dilemma\n\nKaren (pictured) had accused Rachel of deliberately ignoring her to avoid paying her back $20 after she won $600 on the pokies\n\nIn the video, Guy told Karen there was an opening in the market to start her own debt collecting agency because people would actually pay her to leave messages.\n\n'I think you're born with a talent that not many people have...
