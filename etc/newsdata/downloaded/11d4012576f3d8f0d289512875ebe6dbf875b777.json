He declared a caliphate in 2014, establishing a brutal system of theocratic rule.\n\nISIS gradually lost control over its territory in recent years and as the caliphate crumbled, al-Baghdadi had largely disappeared. Details of his location emerged after Iraqi intelligence officials captured one of his wives and a trusted courier, according to reports.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nWhile there\u2019s broad consensus that al-Baghdadi\u2019s death is a positive development in the war on terror, there\u2019s disagreement as to just how much it will affect ISIS operations. Some experts argue that he held a unique position in the group\u2019s mythology that can\u2019t be easily replaced. Al-Baghdadi\u2019s death comes at a time when ISIS is splintered and has lost territory, which could hinder the group\u2019s ability to unify behind a new ideological mission.\n\nOthers argue that his death won\u2019t have a significant impact on ISIS\u2019s operations. The group has become decentralized since losing its caliphate and no longer relied on al-Baghdadi\u2019s leadership, experts say. His death could even \u201cgalvanize\u201d these loosely associated cells, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned. There are also fears that ISIS could see a resurgence, even without its leader, because of instability in the region driven by Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from northeast Syria and political unrest in Iraq.\n\nPerspectives\n\nMajor impact\n\nHis death robs ISIS of its figurehead\n\n\u201cAl-Baghdadi was charismatic and competent, and whoever is named as his successor \u2014 like some of Baghdadi\u2019s predecessors \u2014 may prove inept, unable to lead the caliphate\u2019s remnants or inspire the new generation. And whatever the successor\u2019s abilities, if he doesn\u2019t want to share al-Baghdadi\u2019s fate, he will need to hide and avoid communicating, and, thus, will face difficulties rebuilding his organization.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Byman, Lawfare\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s symbolic power may mean he\u2019s irreplaceable\n\n\u201cBaghdadi is significant because he declared himself the caliph and the head of a caliphate that was a rallying cry for tens of thousands of extremists around the world. That will be hard to replace.\u201d \u2014 Former U.S. antiterrorism envoy Brett McGurk to New Yorker\n\nHis death undermines the group\u2019s recruitment pitch\n\n\u201cHis death is another strike against ISIS\u2019s purported legitimacy, leaving it less able to claim to be any different from other violent extremist groups.\u201d \u2014 Michael Safi, the Guardian\n\nA series of major defeats may mean ISIS is too weak to recover\n\n\u201cThat the Islamic State can easily survive the loss of its top leader is not as straightforward a proposition as seems to be widely believed. Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, almost exactly seven months after the obliteration of the physical caliphate he built, comes at an exceptionally bad time. The organization is still struggling to recover from the collapse of its caliphate and the deaths of many top leaders. It is fragile, caught somewhere between being a proto-state and a full-fledged insurgency.\u201d \u2014 Hassan Hassan, New York Times\n\nLimited impact\n\nISIS is strong enough to endure al-Baghdadi\u2019s death\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a time when killing Baghdadi could\u2019ve stopped ISIS\u2019s rise. ... But I do think that the organization has moved well past Baghdadi in the same way that al-Qaeda moved past Osama bin Laden, to some extent. At this point \u2014 seven-plus years after the rise of ISIS \u2014 his death is far from a fatal strike against the organization.\u201d \u2014 Former U.S. National Counterterrorism Center director Michael Leiter to Vox\n\n\u201cYet, despite what seems like good news, there are many indicators that Trump\u2019s war on terror is short-sighted, un-strategic, and will \u2014 ultimately \u2014 increase threats from terrorism.\u201d \u2014 Peter R.
