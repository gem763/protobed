They, and not President Donald Trump, are winning the hearts and minds of the public at the moment. In the end, that\u2019s all that will matter when it comes to how the impeachment drama turns out.\n\nThe poll found that 51% now think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That is a stunning turnaround in just a few weeks. The same poll taken in July found that only 42% wanted to see Trump removed from office.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible to read too much into this and the other polls showing the public increasingly backing Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nAfter all, Trump\u2019s approval rating has barely budged since the latest impeachment frenzy took off. As a matter of fact, his favorability rating today is essentially identical to President Barack Obama\u2019s at the same point in his first term in office in the Gallup tracking poll \u2013 40% for Trump compared with 41% for Obama.\n\nThe Real Clear Politics average has Trump\u2019s job approval at 43.2%. That\u2019s down from 45% in late September, but still better than it\u2019s been for most of his presidency. At the start of this year, for example, his RCP average approval rating was only 41%.\n\nBut dismissing this latest poll as insignificant is foolhardy.\n\nThe Fox poll found, for example, that 13% of Republicans say they support Trump\u2019s removal from office, which is up by five points since July. Unless the poll\u2019s methodology is off, that is a deeply troubling number.\n\nTrump and his defenders seem to believe that the Democrats\u2019 rush to impeachment will unquestionably backfire on them. It won\u2019t drive Trump from office. It will make them look desperate to oust him at any cost. And it will dramatically energize the GOP base. Just look at the money pouring into his campaign coffers right now.\n\nMaybe so. But this is based on one huge assumption: namely, that the Senate would never vote to remove Trump based on whatever articles of impeachment the House sends over.\n\nWhat happens if support for Trump\u2019s removal continues to build, particularly among independents and especially among Republican voters? Anyone who thinks Republicans won\u2019t cave to that pressure hasn\u2019t been paying attention to the spinelessness of GOP Senators for the past, oh, ever. (It was Senate Republicans, remember, who saved Obamacare from the ax when they thought public support for that misbegotten law had solidified.)\n\nThankfully, the Founders set the impeachment bar extremely high. In this case, 19 Republicans would have to vote to remove Trump for it to succeed. But even if Trump isn\u2019t ousted, there\u2019s the possibility that impeachment so thoroughly taints his presidency that the voters decides it\u2019s their turn to remove him from office at the ballot box.\n\nThe real danger for Trump isn\u2019t that he overreacts to the impeachment proceedings, but that he doesn\u2019t take the process seriously enough to try to convince more than his hard-core base that the charges are completely meritless.\n\nRight now, Trump is losing that public relations battle. If he doesn\u2019t come to grips with this fact, he might lose the war as well.\n\n\u2014 Written by the I&I Editorial Board\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
