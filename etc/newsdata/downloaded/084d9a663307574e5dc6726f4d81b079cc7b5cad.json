The pair was charged with paying out $500,000 to get their daughters into the University of Southern California. Now, they are among the 11 parents hit with new bribery charges by a Boston grand jury after refusing to plead guilty.\n\nNBC News: Federal prosecutors have hit Lori Loughlin, Massimo Gianulli, and 9 other parents with a superseding indictment.\n\n\n\nThe indictment adds the charge of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery by allegedly sending bribes to employees of USC. \u2014 Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) October 22, 2019\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli rejected a plea deal earlier this year and maintained their innocence.\n\nBy contrast, \"Desperate Housewives\" star Felicity Huffman pleaded guilty to trying to fix her daughter's SAT test in 2017.\n\n\u201cI have inflicted more damage than I could\u2019ve ever imagined,\u201d she said in her apology.\n\nHuffman's tearful apology may have played a role in her rather lenient sentence. She faces just 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine, and 250 hours of community service.\n\nA prosecutor recently warned Loughlin that she can expect a much harsher sentence.\n\n\u201cIf she is convicted, we would probably ask for a higher sentence for her than we did for Felicity Huffman,\" Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said. \"I can\u2019t tell you what that would be.\"\n\nLoughlin's daughters are no longer enrolled at USC, media reported today.", "description": "\"Fuller House\" actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, .10/22/2019 16:46:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/295/ef2f8306-62f5-47e1-981a-c760825954a3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
