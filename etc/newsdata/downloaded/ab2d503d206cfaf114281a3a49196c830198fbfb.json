By Monday if not earlier, someone will be apologizing for this, even if it looks more like a very badly bungled attempt to joke about Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump tried to explain why he and Melania have a personal concern as a parent about vaping, but ended up mangling his syntax, as Trump does more than occasionally:\n\nVaping has become a very big business, as I understand it. Like a giant business in a very short period of time. But we can\u2019t allow people to get sick, and we can\u2019t have our youth be so affected. And I\u2019m hearing it. And that\u2019s how the First Lady got involved. I mean, she\u2019s got a son \u2014 together \u2014 that is a beautiful, young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it. She\u2019s seen it. We\u2019re both reading it. A lot of people are reading it. But people are dying with vaping.\n\nBoth Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert riffed on the clip, but they riffed on Trump \u2014 not Barron or Melania. \u201cHow on Earth does Trump forget that he has a son?\u201d Noah wondered. \u201cAt least Darth Vader claimed his son.\u201d Colbert went the impression route, imagining how Trump might have expanded on those thoughts:\n\n\u201cThe first lady has got a son \u2014 together. It\u2019s a mutual son. Of course, I\u2019m very involved with the doings of it, and so is the first lady, who is a lovely mother, together, who I love and know her name. So well that I won\u2019t waste your time saying it out loud.\u201d\n\nFunny? YMMV, but at least it took aim at the correct target. Trump\u2019s totally fair game, and that kind of mangled syntax is the kind of thing over which comics have skewered presidents since the dawn of the television age. When Mika Brzezinski attempted to inject that into a discussion about Joe Biden\u2019s weird answer on inequality in last night\u2019s debate, however, she targeted Melania and their son instead. Just how sure are we that Trump is Barron\u2019s father at all, Mika wondered aloud \u2014 until Joe Scarborough finally shut her down:\n\n\u201cMaybe it is Melania\u2019s son,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cIt is Melania\u2019s son,\u201d Scarborough replied. \u201cThat\u2019s what he was saying, it was just her son. That\u2019s not \u2014 that\u2019s just what he said,\u201d Brzezinski said, with a smile. After an awkward pause, Scarborough said \u201cLet me get back to Biden because I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d \u201cWell, it seems like he didn\u2019t remember Barron\u2019s name or\u2026\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cJust stop,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the tape play itself, okay?\u201d\n\nOver at Mediaite at the above link, my old friend Tommy Christopher \u2014 hardly a Trumpian apologist \u2014 wrote that Brzezinski \u201cseemed to make the shocking suggestion that President Donald Trump isn\u2019t really First Son Barron Trump\u2019s father.\u201d Tommy also zinged Trump himself by noting that no one has demanded to see Barron\u2019s birth certificate \u201cso far,\u201d but Tommy certainly grasped exactly what Mika meant. And so, apparently, did Joe, who shut it down just as soon as he realized what Mika was saying.\n\nThat\u2019s the risk of comedy, of course, especially when practiced by amateurs. You don\u2019t target the non-combatants, especially children, when you take aim at politicians. Poking fun at Trump\u2019s verbal gymnastics on Wednesday is no problem, but suggesting on national television that the president\u2019s teenage son is illegitimate and that his mother had an affair is decidedly not funny. It\u2019s apology time at Morning Joe.", "description": "\u201cJust stop.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mj-barron.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
