That is a rare event, compared with the number I book on British Airways and Ryanair.\n\nAll are excellent airlines. But I fly less frequently with easyJet because of the absurd \u201cadministration fee\u201d that the airline introduced in 2012.\n\nAt the time, budget carriers employed a range of tricks to bolster their revenue \u2013 principally charging extra for paying by any means other than a fairly arcane prepaid money card.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nUsing your regular credit or debit card might cost an extra \u00a35. The airlines knew that the vast majority of passengers didn\u2019t want the extra hassle, and would just pay the fee.\n\nThe authorities eventually outlawed this practice. To compensate, quoted fares on Ryanair went up a bit. But easyJet did something different. It opted to introduce an \u201cadministration fee\u201d of \u00a39 per booking, regardless of the number of passengers and flights.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Everyone has to administrate, but for a budget airline booking the cost is measured in pence rather than pounds.\n\nThe \u00a316 fee became a penalty for those of us who often travel alone.\n\nFor a family of four flying a return journey, the charge represents a modest \u00a32 per person per flight. But on a one-person, one-way trip it adds a full \u00a316, making single fares for solo travellers relatively expensive.\n\nAdvertising rules meant that easyJet had to include the fee in quoted fares, which it wanted to look as low as possible. So the airline cited examples based on multiple travellers; on the airline\u2019s ads prices were published as, say, \u00a324.99*, where the asterisk meant \u201cbased on on two people travelling together\u201d.\n\nThe majority of flights I buy are one-way sectors for solo travel. So on fare-comparison sites such as Skyscanner, easyJet was rarely cheapest. On Monday, the airline got my business because it had a particular late evening departure to Spain; any earlier, and I would have saved by booking on BA or Norwegian.\n\n\u201cSo long as the fares are clearly expressed, easyJet can price its flights however it wishes,\u201d I recently wrote on the subject of the admin fee.\n\n\u201cBut I imagine one day soon the airline will realise it is losing out by sending travellers like me to other carriers, and abolish the charge while raising its fares slightly.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, easyJet finally dropped the idea after seven years, saying: \u201cThe admin fee has been removed now as part of an ongoing review of our fees and charges.\n\n\u201cThis improves price transparency for our customers and reduces complexity.\u201d\n\nThe abolition does not apply retrospectively. Even though I was presumably one of the last travellers to pay the anti-singles charge, I am glad the airline has changed its policy \u2013 and I look forward to flying more frequently on easyJet now that it is fee-free.\n\nOther organisations have fees on their minds. The \u201cOperation Matterhorn\u201d rescue for Thomas Cook passengers who were on holiday when the travel giant went bust will be underwritten by the UK taxpayer by \u00a340m. The public finances took a rather smaller hit two years ago when Monarch failed. On both occasions, the government decided to fly everyone home for free, regardless of whether or not they had paid for Atol protection.\n\nAfter the Monarch failure, the Department for Transport (DfT) set up the Airline Insolvency Review. Five months ago, it recommended a \u201cFlight Protection Scheme\u201d to foot the bill in future collapses.\n\nThe idea: everyone pays a 50p levy on each flight from the UK, to build up a fund that pays for future airlifts.\n\nI imagine that pressure for the DfT to introduce such a fee will increase when the cost per passenger of the Matterhorn manoeuvres becomes apparent; my betting is that it will be close to \u00a31,000 each.\n\nBut I hope that the idea is ditched. The vast majority of flights bought by UK travellers are with rock-solid airlines, such as British Airways, easyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair. It is preposterous that the 60 million-plus UK passengers who book on these carriers each year should contribute to a fund to bail out customers of carriers that are less well run.\n\nInstead the government should specify that Air Passenger Duty, which starts at \u00a313 for economy passengers on European flights, includes an element to help travellers who would otherwise be stranded. And the Civil Aviation Authority should look more closely at the finances of UK travel firms that end up owing billions.\n\nOperation Matterhorn, which is now ending, has been a success; but it is far better to prevent failure.\n\nSimon Calder has been named Features Journalist of the Year \u2013 Ground Transportation at the 2019 Business Travel Journalism Awards for an article about split ticketing on the railways.
