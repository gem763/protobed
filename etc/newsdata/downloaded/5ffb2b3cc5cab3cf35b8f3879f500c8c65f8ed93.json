This should not be here. This belongs to Ethiopia.\"\n\nThe gilded copper crown features depictions of the Holy Trinity and Christ\u2019s disciples. Jacopo Gnisci, an Oxford University researcher, told AFP the piece was likely gifted to an Ethiopian church in the northern region of the country by a warlord named Welde Sellase. While an inscription on the crown says 1633-34, Gnisci said it is more probable it was created a hundred years later. He told AFP, the crown is \"of priceless symbolic value.\"\n\nJan Hennop/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched an investigation into the disappearance of the crown after it went missing in the early 1990s from a church in Cheleqot, a village 75 miles from the border of Eritrea.\n\nThe last time it was seen publicly was in a 1993 photograph, on the head of a priest.\n\nRealizing the crown\u2019s enormous worth, Afsaw decided to hold onto it until he knew it could be returned unscathed to Ethiopia.\n\n\"I knew if I gave it back, it would just disappear again\" he said.\n\nAfsaw said he felt conflicted when it came to holding onto the crown.\n\nGuarding it in his home, Afsaw told the BBC, \"you end up in such a suffocating situation, not knowing who to tell or what to do or to hand over.\"\n\nJan Hennop/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"I had fire alarms all over my house, eight or something like that,\" he said.\n\nWith the election of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in 2018 and Brand's influence, Afsaw felt enough had changed in his home country that the piece could safely return home.\n\n\"I explained to him, look, either the crown will disappear or you [will], if you continue like this,\" Brand told the BBC.\n\nThe pair contacted the Dutch police, who placed the piece in a secure facility. After art experts confirmed the crown\u2019s authenticity, Afsaw and Brand decided to publicly announce its existence.\n\nThe crown will continue to stay under heavy security until the Dutch and Ethiopian governments figure out how to return it safely to Addis Ababa.", "description": "A priceless 18th century crown will be returned to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia after more than two decades in a Rotterdam, Netherlands apartment.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/ethiopian-crown-gty-ml-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
