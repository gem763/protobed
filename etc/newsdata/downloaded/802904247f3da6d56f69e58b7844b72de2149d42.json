And much of it had to do with the Trump administration\u2019s failed attempts to clean up its multiple calamities on the Sunday shows over the weekend.\n\nThe Late Night host began with Trump\u2019s \u201cacting\u201d Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who went on Fox News Sunday to explain why the president announced that he would be holding the G7 conference at his Miami Doral resort in Florida and then reversed his decision after loud protests from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Just Ronan Farrow: NBC News Killed My Rape-Allegation Story Too\n\nStephen Colbert Mocks Mitt Romney\u2019s \u2018Embarrassing\u2019 Secret Twitter Account\n\n\u201cHe was honestly surprised at the level of pushback,\u201d Mulvaney said, adding, \u201cAt the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, first of all, he\u2019s not in the hospitality business, he\u2019s the president,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAnd second, Trump was never in the hospitality business.
