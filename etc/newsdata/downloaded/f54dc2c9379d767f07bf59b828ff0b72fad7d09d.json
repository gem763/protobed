The report focused on a technique, called stratospheric aerosol injection, that mimics the effects of a volcano.\n\nResearchers looking into this area are the black sheep of climate science.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There are a lot of deep-green environmentalists who feel that way,\u201d he says.\n\nDr Hugh Hunt, an engineer from the University of Cambridge\u2019s department of engineering, says: \u201cIt\u2019s like talking about contraception in a Catholic school. It doesn\u2019t mean you are pro casual sex.\u201d\n\nDr Watson and Dr Hunt researched solar radiation management (SRM) as part of the government-funded Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering collaboration which finished in 2015.\n\nSRM is a broad term used to describe ways scientists could block sunlight and cool the planet. It is one of the most controversial ways of reducing the effects of climate change.\n\nOne idea is to mimic a volcanic eruption by injecting thousands of tons of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, which would (in theory) reflect solar radiation back into space.\n\nHistory is peppered with examples of volcanic winters following massive eruptions. In 1883 the explosion of Krakatoa caused four unusually cold years, and in 1915 the eruption of Mount Tambora caused a \u201cyear without a summer\u201d. More recently, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a dip in global temperatures.\n\nIdeas about how to get sulphur dioxide in the stratosphere sound like they could have been lifted out of a JG Ballard novel \u2013 these include using a fleet of spy planes, a giant hosepipe, rockets or sprayers attached to hydrogen balloons.\n\nAircraft that fly into the stratosphere and then dump a cargo of sulphur are often touted as the best option. These specially designed planes would need to fly at twice the altitude of commercial aircraft.\n\nThis could be technologically possible but it would involve thousands of planes flying up every day to deposit enough material, according to Dr Hunt. This in itself would emit vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nHe believes tethered balloons might be a better option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically a big hosepipe going up 20km, held up by a hydrogen balloon. The good thing about that is that you might only need 10, 20 or 100 of these balloons and they would sit there just like a hose watering a garden,\u201d says Dr Hunt.\n\nA report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that, in theory, SRM is technically feasible but the problem is global field experiments have not been done so knowledge is based on theoretical climate simulations.\n\nThere is no consensus on what could work, and little funding (or political will) available for people to test potential options in the real world.\n\n\u201cI suspect you will find it easier to get an objective view of Marmite than the sulphur process from one person,\u201d comments Emeritus Professor Julian Evans from UCL.\n\nBy most estimations, getting sulphur into the stratosphere is not the biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not trivial but it\u2019s not beyond our capabilities. It\u2019s what happens, the impacts and the socio-political challenges of doing it, which are the real challenge,\u201d says Dr Watson.\n\nMany say we should not even consider SRM due to a worrying list of potential side-effects, including acid rain, ozone depletion and drastic changes to monsoon rain over India and China.\n\nSome just think it won\u2019t work.\n\nProfessor Piers Forster from Leeds University says the rate of CO2-induced global warming is so rapid (currently 0.2C per decade) it would wipe out any benefit of injecting sulphur in the stratosphere, even if millions of tons of sulphur was injected every year.\n\n\u201cIf any billionaires out there are considering SRM please come and talk to me first and I\u2019ll give them thousands of better ways of spending their money,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother common objection to it is \u201ctermination shock\u201d, which refers to what would happen if society lost the will or means to continue.\n\nSRM masks global warming by shielding light from the sun rather than reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That means stopping it could cause sudden and catastrophic warming that could be considerably more dangerous than current levels of warming.\n\nIt is a geopolitical minefield. Who would have their hand on the thermostat? Perhaps the US military? Or a big multinational corporation? Or even Boris Johnson?\n\nMr Watson says that if we did end up using SRM it would be \u201cabsolutely the clearest indication we have failed miserably as a species\u201d.\n\nMany feel even researching SRM as a potential option provides an escape route for governments to avoid the critical job of cutting emissions.\n\nDr Hunt says: \u201cThe public perception at the moment is that climate change is really important. But are people going to say let\u2019s pump aerosols into the atmosphere? I don\u2019t think they will because essentially it\u2019s letting fossil fuel companies off the hook.\n\n\u201cClimate scientists can\u2019t be seen to be in favour of geoengineering whereas for us engineers, our job isn\u2019t on the line. We can say things that climate scientists can\u2019t say. We might sound as if we\u2019re in favour of climate engineering but that\u2019s just not the case at all.\u201d\n\nDr Hunt says it is imperative the technique is researched so if it does need to be used it can be done as safely as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated picture and I\u2019m not in any way pro geoengineering. I\u2019m very much pro research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like chemotherapy. If you\u2019re going to have chemotherapy, you would like to have thought the research would have been done so it\u2019s safe.\u201d", "description": "Climate change is the greatest test humanity has ever faced \u2013 and so far indications are we\u2019re failing dismally.
