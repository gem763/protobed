Deal with it\",' Lech told the Post. 'What happened to us should never happen in this country, ever.'\n\nThe standoff unfolded on June 3, 2015, after police and SWAT officers tried to capture Robert Jonathan Seacat, 33, who allegedly fired upon officers when they went to arrest him for shoplifting at a Walmart in neighboring Aurora.\n\nSeacat randomly ran into Lech's home in Greenwood, setting off a 19-hour standoff with police, that included the massive assault on the property.\n\nDuring the shootout, a nine-year-old boy was inside. Police dispatchers and the child's mother, who is engaged to Lech's son, quickly got the child safely out of the house.\n\nLech was livid by the destruction of the home, which he had purchased for his son, John, two years earlier.\n\nSurveying the damages, Lech at the time gazed in disgust at gaping holes where there was once windows and walls.\n\nA SWAT team fired gas munition and 40-millimeter rounds through the windows of Leo Lech's home in the June 2015 standoff with an armed shoplifter who had barricaded himself inside\n\nThe insides of the house (pictured) had been exposed, even showing artwork on the walls of a bedroom\n\n'There was one gunman with a handgun and they chose to turn this house into something that resembles Osama Bin Laden's compound', he said then, branding the cops 'thugs' for what they had done to the home.\n\n'They methodically fired explosives into every room in this house in order to extract one person. Granted, he had a handgun, but against 100 officers?\n\n'You know, the proper thing to do would be to evacuate these homes around here, ensure the safety of the homeowners around here, fire some tear gas through the windows.\n\n'If that didn't work, you have 50 SWAT officers with body armor break down the door'.\n\nThe insides of the house had been exposed, even showing artwork on the walls of the nine-year-old boy's bedroom.\n\nLech had always expected his insurance would pay for repairs. Greenwood had even given him $5000 towards the deductible and to help cover moving costs.\n\nBut his son didn't have rental insurance and possessions inside were damaged beyond saving or repair, Lech said. Among the items destroyed was his son's great-great grandmother's wedding ring.\n\n'It survived two World Wars, OK, but it didn't survive the American police paramilitary operation', Lech quipped after the standoff's end.\n\nThree years later, Lech said his out-of-pocket expenses to rebuild the house had cost him nearly $400000. 'This has ruined our lives,' he told the Post. The homeowner said he may still take his case to the US Supreme Court.\n\nGreenwood municipal and police officials did not immediately respond when DailyMail.com reached out Wednesday.\n\nPolice previously commented on the standoff.\n\n'My mission is to get that individual out unharmed and make sure my team and everyone else around including the community goes home unharmed', Greenwood Village Police Commander Dustin Varney said in 2015, KUSA reported.\n\n'Sometimes that means property gets damaged, and I am sorry for that'.", "description": "A federal appeals court decided that Leo Lech was owed nothing after SWAT teams blasted away at his Colorado home during a 19-hour stand-off with an armed shoplifter and left the property a total loss.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
