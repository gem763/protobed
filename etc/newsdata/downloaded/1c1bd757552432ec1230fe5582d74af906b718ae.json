REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nKhan, due to take up leadership of UBS\u2019s (UBSG.S) wealth management unit next month just three months after leaving Credit Suisse, filed a criminal complaint alleging threats and coercion in the Sept. 17 confrontation.\n\nSwiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung, without citing its sources, reported that Credit Suisse had hired three detectives to investigate whether Khan was seeking to lure its employees to UBS.\n\nThe situation escalated when one of the men sought to take Khan\u2019s phone after he tried to take a photograph of the detectives\u2019 car, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cAs a result of a criminal complaint (by Khan)...the Zurich District Attorney has opened a criminal investigation into coercion/threat,\u201d a prosecutors office spokesman said in an email. \u201cWe cannot give further details because this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse did not respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nKhan, via a spokesman, denied trying to poach Credit Suisse workers for his new employer.\n\n\u201cSuspicions that he was trying to hire people away from Credit Suisse are absurd,\u201d the spokesman said on Monday.\n\nKhan is a rising star in Swiss finance, the son of Pakistani immigrants who came to Switzerland when he was just 12 and who grew up in the Zurich suburbs to become one of the nation\u2019s top bankers.\n\nHe has been mooted as a candidate to eventually lead one of the country\u2019s big banks, including Sergio Ermotti-led UBS.\n\nSwiss media, including financial industry website Inside Paradeplatz, reported that the incident last week began when the 43-year-old Khan and his wife were tailed in their automobile by another vehicle.\n\nNear the Swiss National Bank building in the heart of Zurich\u2019s financial district, Khan stepped from his car and attempted to photograph the other vehicle with his cell phone.\n\nThe occupants fled after passers-by noticed the altercation, the SonntagsZeitung reported, adding the three men were eventually located and detained for questioning.\n\nFinancial institutions including in Switzerland are covetous of their client-employee relationships, and sometimes place employees or ex-employees under intense scrutiny to ensure they do not violate non-compete clauses or other contractual obligations.\n\n\u201cMostly, such practices never meet the light of day,\u201d Swiss reputation consultant Bernhard Bauhofer told Swiss tabloid Blick.\n\nStill, other experts said the tactics described in Khan\u2019s situation were \u201cmafia methods\u201d that had no place in the industry. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anything similar in my long career,\u201d former UBS and Credit Suisse CEO Oswald Gruebel told the newspaper.\n\nKhan announced his resignation from Credit Suisse in July \u201cto pursue other opportunities\u201d.\n\nIn late August, Credit Suisse\u2019s arch rival UBS said Khan would co-head its flagship wealth management business starting on Oct. 1 as part of a broader shake-up of its executive board.\n\nUBS declined comment on the incident involving its new employee, as did Swiss financial system supervisor FINMA.", "description": "Zurich prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into an incident last week in which private detectives allegedly shadowed ex-Credit Suisse banker Iqbal Khan and his wife, the district attorney's office said on Monday", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432931036&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0UV", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
