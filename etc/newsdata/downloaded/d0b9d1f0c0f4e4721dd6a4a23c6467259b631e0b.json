On a year-on-year basis, Singapore's economy grew 0.1% in the third quarter.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected Singapore's gross domestic product from July to September to increase by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter and 0.3% year-on-year.\n\nA technical recession happens when there are two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. Talks of a global recession have heightened in recent months as the U.S.-China trade war continued to drag on.\n\nIn a separate announcement on Monday, Singapore's central bank said it has eased monetary policy by reducing the slope of the Singapore dollar policy band \u2014 referred to as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate, or S$NEER.\n\nThe central bank adjusts monetary policy by managing the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar against a basket of currencies of its major trading partners. The policy band's slope, width and center, as well as the currencies that the Singapore dollar is measured against, are not disclosed.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore announced Monday there's no change to the width and center of the Singapore dollar's trading band. That means the central bank has moderated the pace at which the local currency would appreciate against the basket of currencies.\n\nSingapore, a tiny country in Southeast Asia, has one of the highest trade-to-GDP ratios in the world. That makes its economy highly sensitive to global trade flows and business cycles.\n\nThe country's small domestic market \u2014 with a total population of 5.7 million \u2014 means Singapore \"will never be able to offset external demand slack,\" Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB Private Banking, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday.\n\n\"All we can really do is try to protect jobs here,\" said Song, adding that it can be done by accelerating infrastructure and social spending.", "description": "A technical recession occurs when there are two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106114844-1567733217611gettyimages-1155342721.jpeg?v=1567733260", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
