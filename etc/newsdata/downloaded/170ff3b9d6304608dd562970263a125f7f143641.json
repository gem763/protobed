With the Browns facing 3rd-and-8 coming out of the two-minute warning, he had quarterback Baker Mayfield line up in shotgun for a pass play at New York\u2019s 33-yard line.\n\nMayfield takes scary hit late in game\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMayfield took the snap and quickly found himself surrounded by Jets defenders. He was hit high and low, with his knees tangled up in a pile of defenders and offensive linemen before he was dragged to the ground for a sack.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nMayfield quickly got up from the play with no issue.\n\nHis Jets counterpart Trevor Siemian couldn\u2019t say the same earlier in the game after a hit from Browns pass rusher Miles Garrett resulted in a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nMayfield is fortunate he didn\u2019t meet a similar fate.\n\nFreddie Kitchens explained his reasoning for exposing Baker Mayfield to injury risk in meaningless game time. (Reuters)\n\nWhy did Kitchens leave Mayfield exposed?\n\nThe decision by Kitchens to keep Mayfield in the game in vulnerable pass situations led to the Browns head coach answering questions on Tuesday.\n\nKitchens, a rookie head coach apparently intent on proving his old-school, grind-it-out bonafides, told reporters that he never considered taking his prized quarterback out of the game.\n\n\u201cNo. He\u2019s our quarterback,\u2019\u2019 Kitchens said, via Cleveland.com. \u201cI wanted to make that last third down. Not to say that (backup) Garrett (Gilbert) couldn\u2019t, but I wanted Baker to do it.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re going to finish the game\u2019\n\nHe chalked the call up to a philosophy of pushing through until the clock reads zero.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to finish the game,\u2019\u2019 Kitchens said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we preach is finish the game, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. We were trying to get a first down.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something to be said for not wanting to give the ball up in those moments and putting defenders at risk if the opposition decides to put its foot on the gas.\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said about not risking the health of the franchise quarterback in a zero-leverage situation. It\u2019s the exact time for Gilbert to be in the game, whether the call is to run or pass.\n\nIf the opposition is intent on stopping the clock and getting the ball back, then so be it. You control what you can control in the name of player safety in meaningless game situations.\n\nBut make no mistake. Player safety is the No. 1 priority in these moments.\n\nKitchens blames Mayfield\n\nKitchens had the temerity to place the burden of that safety on Mayfield, suggesting that he should have protected himself better on the play.\n\n\u201cIn that situation, you\u2019re either going to hand the ball off and get hit in the backfield three or four yards or you take advantage of what they\u2019re giving you,\u2019\u2019 Kitchens continued. \u201cWhen they cover it, you just protect yourself. I don\u2019t need (Mayfield) out there taking unnecessary shots.\u201d\n\nIf Kitchens is worried about Mayfield taking unnecessary shots, he shouldn\u2019t expose him in the first place.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Freddie Kitchens explained his reasoning for exposing Baker Mayfield to injury risk in meaningless game time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FI5.2JoXp6Le.5durVgdTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTguOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V5Hy05mCjuRvMtH_k4MlRg--~B/aD0xODI2O3c9MjkyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bdd8c490-d9c7-11e9-afff-8009c4445e2a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
