It has two \u2014 or rather, it is caught between two very different conceptions of free speech, each of which has significant shortcomings and each of which is rooted in our inability to close the chasm that remains between eastern and western Germany, 30 years after reunification.\n\nSimply put, the division pits one part of the country that believes freedom of speech is on the decline against another that believes freedom of speech is going way too far. These aren\u2019t just different concepts, rooted in two different formative national experiences \u2014 the Nazi era and the East German Communist regime. They are also at fundamental odds with each other, meaning that the day in, day out debate over what counts as acceptable speech is driving Germans further apart.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Germans who believe that freedom of speech is endangered. Concentrated in eastern Germany, many of them experienced communism and its \u201cbetter say nothing\u201d atmosphere firsthand, only to be freed with the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nFor many eastern Germans, the revolution of 1989 held the promise that in a free country you would be able to utter any opinion, without suffering consequences. Instead, they complain, when they express conservative views on hot topics like immigration or multiculturalism, they are quickly labeled Nazis.", "description": "Yes, but there\u2019s broad disagreement over what that freedom means.", "authors": ["Jochen Bittner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/opinion/01bittner/01bittner-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
