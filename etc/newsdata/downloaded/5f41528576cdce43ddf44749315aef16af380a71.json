Since then, upside momentum has waned -- as it ought to when we get overbought.\n\nThen heading into Friday, it felt like we would never get off the 3000 mark on the S&P 500, with such a narrow trading range over the course of a week or so. It didn't change much on Friday, but it sure felt like we were giving way on the downside.\n\nSo, when will we get back to oversold?\n\nMy own Overbought/Oversold Oscillator is based on the 10-day moving average of the advance/decline line. I look for periods of time where the moving average is set to drop a string of red numbers, making us oversold, or black/green numbers, making us overbought. Since breadth has not been red very often in the last few weeks, it will be difficult to determine when we might get oversold again.\n\nWhat has happened, though, is that up/down volume has been particularly weak the last four trading days. The TRIN (Trading Index) is based on the relationship between the advance/decline line and the up/down volume. That means the TRIN has been high for the last four trading days.\n\nA week ago, I showed you the 10-day moving average of the TRIN (Trading Index), noting how low it was, as it ticked just under .80. I said I thought that indicated we were overbought. You can see, thanks to the high TRIN so many days last week, the 10-day moving average line has scooted up to 1.10.\n\nWhile there is no specific level on my Oscillator that gets us overbought/oversold, it's more useful as a timing mechanism, to show a loss of up or down momentum, there is a level many use for TRIN. Once this indicator gets up and over 1.20 it is generally considered oversold.\n\nYou can see that it took a reading of 1.55 to get a \"maximum\" oversold in August, so it's not a steadfast rule, but my point is that if we see this get up and over 1.20, we would say it has stepped a toe into oversold territory.\n\nThe same way the resistance lines I showed here last week were so obvious, I think the gaps on the major indexes are obvious as well. I suspect many are eyeing that 2940 area on the S&P, should it get down there.\n\nI don't know if we'll get down there, but if we get down there as we're getting back to an oversold condition, then that would be a good place for a rally. As someone who prefers when the market does not do the obvious, I'd clearly prefer a different scenario.", "description": "Let's look at the Trading Index for clues as to when the market will turn.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "When Will We Get Back To Oversold", "Let'S Look At The Trading Index For Clues As To When The Market Will Turn.", "Dave Butler", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Ciura", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/7e9c784e-ccd3-11e9-848d-2b058edb8c1a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
