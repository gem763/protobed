He is contesting the findings but last year, at a showcase tournament for aspiring professionals, six boys failed tests and were banned.\n\nWhen asked if South African rugby had a doping issue, especially at junior level, Proudfoot said: \u201cIt is not my role to answer that question and I would not have the information.\u201d But he insisted: \u201cThe image of South African rugby is what you see on the field. We are a competitive nation and that shows in every team.\u201d\n\nMike Earl, World Rugby\u2019s anti-doping manager, said the average fail rate at elite level since the last World Cup was 0.4%. \u201cIn the last year, all the teams in the tournament have been visited in and out of competition by us and by other organisations.\n\n\u201cIt is when we consider there to be the highest risk of doping, although that does not mean there could not be a case during the tournament. We do not think there is a significant problem but we are not complacent. The testing will reflect that. It will involve two players from each team after every match and there will be visits to teams in between games, although we cannot say how regular they will be.\u201d\n\nEngland itching to get going but Maro Itoje wary of Tonga\u2019s physical threat Read more\n\nProudfoot preferred to talk about the match on Saturday against New Zealand in Yokohama, a meeting between the sides who between them have won the past three tournaments and a potential rehearsal for the final.\n\n\u201cThe forecast is rain, but the conditions will be the same for both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been here for two weeks and have had the full spectrum of weather. Our mindset this year has been to generate a lot of momentum, and it would be good to keep it going.\n\n\u201cIt is not ideal to start a competition on the back foot and both teams understand that. The nature of the contest between the two teams has been so close for the last 18 months. It is all about the result rather than what the rest of the tournament will look like win or lose and I expect another tight game between two rivals that will be won and lost on small executions. I do not think the loser will be derailed. It does not make a difference who you play in the quarter-finals because so many teams are well prepared and can beat each other.\n\nProudfoot said he would not be surprised if New Zealand started with the second-row Brodie Retallick, who was all but ruled out of the first three group matches through injury. \u201cThey will have a little trick up their sleeve. We enjoy playing against the All Blacks and we understand each other. It is two different styles and I am sure they will bring something different to the game in their attack, a new arrow in their quiver. They are too good a side not to keep evolving.\u201d", "description": "Springbok forwards coach, Matt Proudfoot, says six to eight players a week will be tested out of competition in Japan after being questioned over recent failed tests in South Africa", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/466a532c2cab103f5e31b59cc8a0c6c9daf194c9/0_134_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=267f841d03b01c8e727b087939886037", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
