The Kincade Fire has burned more than 75,000 acres\u2014roughly five times the size of Manhattan\u2014in rural areas and the WUI north of Santa Rosa. Last year\u2019s Camp Fire killed 85 people and eliminated more than 10,000 homes in Paradise, a town situated in the WUI. The year before that, the Tubbs Fire killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,000 structures, some in Santa Rosa proper and some in the WUI around it.\n\nAlthough much of the WUI is naturally vulnerable to fire, human behavior is primarily to blame for the destruction. People start more than nine in 10 fires, according to reliable estimates. Dry trees and dry brush in the WUI might act as natural kindling, but built structures\u2014houses, cars, hospitals, utility poles, barns\u2014act as the most potent fuel, researchers have found. A house burns a lot hotter than a bush does; a propane tank is far more combustible than a patch of grass.\n\nIf building in the WUI is so dangerous, why do it? In part because building new housing is so very difficult in many urban regions in California, due to opposition from existing homeowners and strict building codes. The number of people living on the streets in San Francisco and Los Angeles is related to the extreme cost of rent in those cities is related to the statewide housing shortage is related to the pressure to sprawl into the periphery.\n\nSo housing sprawls into the periphery. And each time major fires happen\u2014in the WUI, as well as in unpopulated regions and urban areas\u2014the state\u2019s housing crisis gets a little worse. Rental prices surge. Families struggle with displacement and homelessness. Vacancy rates fall to near zero. The cost of homebuilding goes up. And resources for families without stable housing get stretched even thinner.\n\nRead: The worst is yet to come for California\u2019s wildfires\n\nOne solution to the state\u2019s twin problems is to build more dense housing in urban areas: An aggressive infill-building push would lower rental prices and shift the state\u2019s population to less fire-prone areas, as well as help reduce carbon emissions. California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a number of measures to boost construction and hold down housing costs, and legislators are pushing many more ambitious policies. But the state is far, far away from satisfying the demand for housing, and the climate is only getting hotter.\n\nIn the meantime, California isn\u2019t doing enough to discourage building in fire-prone areas. \u201cI cannot recall any development project that was denied, or where the density was substantially reduced, because of known wildfire hazards,\u201d one now-retired planning director for Sonoma County noted. Even if the state reins in future development, millions of Californians already live in the WUI, at risk of having their homes destroyed and their lives endangered by fire\u2014and at risk of being unable to insure their homes, or of seeing their housing values fall and their economic security imperiled.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s housing crisis has exacerbated its wildfire crisis, and its wildfire crisis has exacerbated its housing crisis. That vicious cycle is nowhere near ending.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
