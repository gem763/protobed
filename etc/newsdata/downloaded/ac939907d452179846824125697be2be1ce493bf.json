I've found three more half-sisters and a half-brother who's [sic] parents also used the donor at the same clinic.\"\n\nMaia and her sister confronted their parents who admitted they sought help as their father had fertility problems after going through testicular cancer.\n\nThe sisters say they discovered shared DNA with at least eight strangers - people born between 1976 and 1997.\n\nThe family said when they challenged Dr Jones he refused to answer calling the question \"impertinent\".\n\nMaia told KUSA-TV : \u201c[Jones] needs to own up to what he did.\n\n\u201cI would like to ask him, \u2018Why? Why did you do this?\u2019\"\n\nDr Jones told KUSA: \"I don\u2019t deny it. I don\u2019t admit it.\u201d\n\nCheryl said Dr Jones helped deliver both of the girls and even took pictures of the family in the delivery room.\n\nShe said: \"I really thought he was doing a good thing for me and my sweet husband.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is suing for negligence, fraud and other causes of action and seeks damages in a civil trial.\n\nMost US states, including Colorado, do not have laws banning fertility doctors from inseminating patients without their consent.\n\nHowever Texas, California and Indiana do have so-called \u201cfertility fraud\u201d laws.", "description": "Cheryl Emmons has launched a lawsuit against Dr Paul Jones after her two daughters were contacted by a half-sibling through two ancestry websites", "authors": ["Lorraine King"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757704.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_301019SLUG_7327JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
