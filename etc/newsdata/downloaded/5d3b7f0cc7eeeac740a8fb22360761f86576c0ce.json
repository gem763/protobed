I miss his voice. He will never get to see my three sons grow up.\n\n\"We sat in that trial for four weeks where we listened to evidence which included traumatic videos and audio recordings for nothing.\"\n\nAs well as Yousef's last photo, Jade has also shared never-before-seen family videos from his childhood.\n\n(Image: Jade Akoum)\n\nHis sister said: \"We will not give up the fight and if it means we have to take civil action we will raise enough money to do so.\"\n\nThe burden of proof needed to win a civil case is less than that required in a criminal prosecution.\n\nYousef was a scholarship student at Manchester Grammar School while Molnar had formerly attended the prestigious \u00a312,000-a-year Cheadle Hume School.\n\nMolnar is currently serving a 16-month sentence and training order at a young offenders' institution.\n\n(Image: Jade Akoum)\n\nBut his wealthy parents, Mark Molnar and Stephanie Molnar, have recently sparked anger by hiring Manchester PR agency MC2 Communications to tell their story - a move Yousef's mum Debbie called \"shameless\".\n\nYousef's family had appealed against Molnar's sentence but a judge ruled it was not unduly lenient.\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard claims from Molnar that Yousef had taken a knife out, forcing him to stab him in self-defence.\n\nProsecutors and Yousef's family claimed there was no independent evidence Yousef wielded a knife, but the jury accepted Molnar's account and he was cleared of murder.\n\n(Image: Jade Akoum)\n\nJade said: \"We have really been let down by the judicial system and then to hear his family have paid a PR company so they can have their say is sickening.\n\n\"Money really talks.\"\n\nRecalling the moment the family were told Yousef had been stabbed, the mum-of three said they thought the police were mistaken.\n\n(Image: Jade Akoum)\n\nShe said: \"We couldn't believe it. We thought it can't be Yousef.\n\n\"He was stabbed in a very wealthy area that is not associated with knife crime.\n\n\"In fact a heart surgeon lived nearby and he tried to perform open heart surgery on my brother but it was too late - the knife had gone in too deep.\n\n\"I have since met the surgeon and thanked him for trying to save my brother's life.\"\n\n(Image: Jade Akoum)\n\nAdding that their local community had given the family their full support, Jade said: \"They have been amazing.\n\n\"We are talking about people from all backgrounds, races and religions.\n\n\"They have all unite to help us and we are truly grateful.\n\n\"The support we've had has been overwhelming and I thank everyone who has reached put to our family.\"\n\nThe crowd-fundraising page was launched by a local mother, who wishes to be anonymous.\n\nShe told Mirror Online: \"The Makkis are a lovely, humble family.\n\n\"Members of the public from all diverse backgrounds have been appalled by what happened to Yousef.\n\n\"Yousef Makki could have been anyone's son. So in this young man's memory please donate whatever you can.\"\n\nFor more information visit the Justice for Yousef Makki fundraising page.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The sister of Yousef Makki, 17, who was stabbed at party in Hale Barns, Cheshire, says: \"I miss him, I miss his voice\"", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Jade Akoum"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538138.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_081019Slug_10523JPGjpgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
