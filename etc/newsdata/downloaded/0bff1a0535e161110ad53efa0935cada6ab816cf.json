(AP) - Mark Dantonio\u2019s name will soon stand alone atop the list of all-time winningest football coaches at Michigan State.\n\nOn the cusp of breaking Duffy Daugherty\u2019s record, Dantonio said he is thankful for all the people on the field, sideline and behind the scenes that have played a huge part in his success.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to this point without the help and support of donors, administration, people who hired me, people who helped me along the way administratively, our players,\u201d Dantonio said Tuesday following his weekly news conference. \u201cI think of all the players who have come through here: the coaches, the continuity we\u2019ve had as coaches, as teachers, not just as our coaches, but our staff, our trainers, our equipment people.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who make up a program of this size that I hope everybody takes a minute to sit down and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve all done this together.\u2019\u201d\n\nDantonio matched Daugherty\u2019s record of 109 wins while helping the 18th-ranked Spartans open the season with a 51-17 win over Western Michigan and a 28-7 victory against Tulsa.\n\nHis first shot to break the mark set in 1972 will come at home Saturday against Arizona State (2-0).\n\nThe 63-year-old coach will likely have a chance to win many more games this season and in the years to come, ending with a retirement he doesn\u2019t expect anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI keep telling my players, \u2018As long as you don\u2019t give me too many problems - and the bar is high - I\u2019m going to continue to do what I enjoy doing as long as I feel like I can be successful and impact people,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cI think we can do that.\u201d\n\nSince 2007, he has turned a mediocre program into one good enough to claim three Big Ten championships, win a Rose Bowl and earn a spot in the College Football Playoff. He is one of just four coaches in Big Ten history to win 11 games in at least five seasons to join a group that includes the late Joe Paterno, Jim Tressel and Urban Meyer.\n\nDantonio has also hit some lows, plummeting to a 3-9 record after being ranked No. 8 early in the 2016 season. An ESPN report also questioned how Dantonio dealt with allegations against his players and he publicly and privately defended how he handled all complaints in the wake of a campus crisis regarding the school\u2019s handling of allegations against former sports doctor and convicted molester Larry Nassar.\n\nShortly after beating Notre Dame in 2010, he had a mild heart attack.\n\n\u201cIn 13 years, there\u2019s going to be challenges,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cI say all the time to my players and coaches, \u2018Everybody is going through some type of challenge.\u2019\u201d\n\nDantonio challenged his players last week at his news conference, lashing out at them for lacking effort and toughness in the season-opening win over Tulsa.\n\n\u201cWell, if you feel that was fire last week, you should have been at the team meeting,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cSometimes you just have to deal with the brutal reality of things, and you have to call them as you see them and that\u2019s the way I called it.\u201d\n\nDantonio, though, was quick to say at his players are the ones who deserve credit for bouncing back with a confidence-boosting blowout against Western Michigan.\n\nDantonio is 109-51 since he left Cincinnati and returned to Michigan State, where he was an assistant for Nick Saban and Bobby Williams. He heaped praise on the administrators who hired him, and were still supportive when the program has dipped, the support staff in and around the football program along with donors who finance the school\u2019s quest to keep up with college football\u2019s top programs.\n\nDantonio draws from all kinds of sources to inspire himself, and those around him, including Lao Tzu.\n\n\u201cGo to the people,\u2019\u201d Dantonio said, starting his favorite quote attributed to the Chinese philosopher. \u201cIf you just read that one and look at it, you\u2019ll know what I mean because there\u2019s so many people involved.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage at https://twitter.com/larrylage\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mark Dantonio's name will soon stand alone atop the list of all-time winningest football coaches at Michigan State.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/michigan_st_dantonio_record_football_68320_c0-148-3536-2209_s1770x1032.jpg?0b7aa9db7f6999e4f13eb3c3edeefe1335f66a40", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
