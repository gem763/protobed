Reuters\n\nJohn Pilger, the journalist and documentary filmmaker, and former mayor of London Ken Livingstone were among supporters seated in a packed public gallery as others protested outside court.\n\nMr Assange\u2019s barrister, Mark Summers, described the extradition bid as \u201ca political attempt\u201d by Donald Trump\u2019s administration to \u201csignal to journalists the consequences of publishing information\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is legally unprecedented,\u201d he told the court.\n\nMr Sumner said there was a \u201cdirect link\u201d between Mr Trump\u2019s election and the \u201creinvigoration\u201d of the investigation, which had concluded under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency without any charges against Mr Assange.\n\nThe barrister also claimed the US \u201chas been actively engaged in intruding into privileged discussions between Assange and his lawyers\u201d in the Ecuadorian embassy, where the WikiLeaks founder was holed up for nearly seven years after claiming asylum.\n\nThe intrusions included the \u201cunlawful copying of their telephones and computers\u201d and \u201chooded men breaking into offices,\u201d Mr Sumner alleged.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She told Assange his next case management hearing would take place on 19 December and the full hearing would proceed as planned in February.\n\nAs court adjourned, Assange claimed he had not understood proceedings and complained: \u201cThis is not equitable.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI can\u2019t research anything, I can\u2019t access any of my writing. It\u2019s very difficult where I am.\u201d\n\nAssange, who is being held in high-security Belmarsh prison, told the judge he was up against a \u201csuperpower\u201d with \u201cunlimited resources\u201d and appeared to be fighting back tears as he added: \u201cI can\u2019t think properly.\u201d\n\nHe was jailed for 50 weeks in May for breaching his bail conditions by taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations.\n\nAssange was arrested when police raided the embassy after the South American nation withdrew its offer of asylum.\n\nHe was due to be released from Belmarsh last month, but a judge remanded him in custody because there were \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d for believing he would abscond.\n\nFormer home secretary Sajid Javid signed an order in June allowing the US extradition request to be heard in court.\n\nIn May, WikiLeaks claimed there were \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Assange\u2019s health after he was moved to a medical ward in prison. When he did not appear for a scheduled court hearing, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said the Australian was \u201cnot very well\u201d.\n\nWikiLeaks said at the time: \u201cDuring the seven weeks in Belmarsh his health has continued to deteriorate and he has dramatically lost weight. The decision of the prison authorities to move him into the health ward speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nIn a statement before the latest hearing on Monday, Amnesty International urged the UK to reject the extradition request.\n\nMassimo Moratti, the human rights group\u2019s deputy director for Europe, said: \u201cThe British authorities must acknowledge the real risks of serious human rights violations Julian Assange would face if sent to the USA.\n\n\u201cThe UK must comply with the commitment it\u2019s already made that he would not be sent anywhere he could face torture or other ill-treatment.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Julian Assange appeared to fight back tears and said \u201cI can\u2019t think properly\u201d as he faced court to fight extradition to the US.
