Existing creditors are expecting to be approached for the bridge loan.\n\nEvercore Inc., the company hired to explore an asset sale, previously approached McDermott\u2019s creditors about providing new money through second-lien debt issuance, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s bonds and term loan have plunged since news of its adviser hires began to leak. Existing creditors said the declines make it less likely that they would lend more money to the company without being at the top of the capital structure, such as in a bankruptcy or super-priority loan.\n\nA representative for McDermott said the company declined to comment. A representative for Evercore didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\n\nMcDermott has large working capital needs and cash requirements due to the nature of its business, which requires upfront investments in projects. Those needs have been compounded by higher-than-expected costs on its Cameron and Freeport liquefied natural gas projects, which it purchased from Chicago Bridge & Iron Co., Michael Corelli, a senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, said. The ratings company downgraded McDermott one notch to B3 last week.\n\nMcDermott has struggled since Chief Executive Officer David Dickson agreed to purchase assets from CB&I as part of a $3.5 billion deal last year. In addition to the working capital deficit, it reported a net loss of $146 million and negative free cash flow of $220 million for the three months ended June 30, according to the company. It\u2019s also been hurt by a general slowdown in the oil and gas industry amid depressed commodity prices. Last year, the company had a net loss of $2.7 billion.\n\nAsset Sales\n\nThe company confirmed it was working with Evercore to explore unsolicited interest in its Lummus Technology business, with a valuation exceeding $2.5 billion. That amount combined with its $1.5 billion in boats, equipment and buildings, as well as $500 million in storage assets, could be enough to cover its debt and preferred stock, Citi research analysts wrote in a Sept. 18 note.\n\nMcDermott said it had about $3.8 billion of gross debt at the end of the second quarter and $1 billion of cash available.\n\nIf it were to sell the technology business for more than $500 million, McDermott\u2019s bond rules stipulate that it must use the net proceeds to repay debt, according to a Covenant Review report.\n\nThe company is also getting advice from Kirkland & Ellis LLP and AlixPartners LLP, and a group of its bondholders have tapped Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP and Houlihan Lokey Inc., people with knowledge of the matter previously said. Representatives for AlixPartners and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment; Kirkland & Ellis and Paul Weiss didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n--With assistance from Eliza Ronalds-Hannon and Rick Green.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Allison McNeely in New York at amcneely@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Nicole Bullock, Boris Korby\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- McDermott International Inc. is seeking a bridge loan to help it cover a working-capital deficit of about $1.7 billion until it can sell an asset such as its Lummus Technology unit, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The Houston-based company, which provides construction", "authors": ["Allison Mcneely"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/922dGBZLQPMm6D1qgFo1UQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b92a65e0a1474e0ac2ff582ec59c98a2", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
