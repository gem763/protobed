Both were members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s Advisory Council on Economic Growth, and Barton was recently appointed Canada\u2019s ambassador to China.\n\nThe Century Initiative says the measures are needed to prevent an economic slowdown caused by labour shortages, an aging population and technological change. \u201cScale matters,\u201d said Jasmine Gill, the group\u2019s director of policy and programs. But public support for increased immigration levels is low, and finding enough people to meet the organization\u2019s targets is set to get more difficult as the countries that are currently the source of many of Canada\u2019s newcomers offer more domestic opportunities as their economies grow.\n\nWith a population of 100 million, Canada would have potential annual economic growth of 2.6 per cent in 2100, \u201ca full percentage point higher than if we maintain our current course,\u201d the report claims.\n\nThe organization recommends the federal government continue to increase the number of new immigrants it admits each year, from the 2019 target of 330,800 to 475,000 in 2025. It wants Ottawa to then peg the rate to 1.25 per cent of the population.\n\nThe organization\u2019s recommended numbers aren\u2019t historically high \u2014 Canada brought in over 400,000 immigrants in 1913, more than five per cent of the existing citizenry, according to the report.\n\nThe Century Initiative\u2019s recommendations\n\n1. Set targets to begin increasing immigration immediately: Bring in 400,000 permanent residents in 2022, rising to 475,000 in 2025. From 2026 onward, admit permanent residents equivalent to 1.25 per cent of the population each year.\n\n2. Increase early childhood support for Canadians who want bigger families: Expand parental leave benefits as well as access to child care.\n\n3. Leverage under-represented talent in the labour force: Increase the participation rates of Indigenous Peoples and those with disabilities to the national average via employment equity practices. Increase the participation rate for women to that of men via more flexible jobs and a national child-care strategy. Increase the participation rate for older workers via employment matching programs and financial incentives that preserve their pensions.\n\n4. Build the infrastructure to accommodate a bigger Canada: Create a 50-year national plan and reconsider the roles of the different levels of government in funding and building projects.\n\n5. Develop greater density in mega-regions: Encourage population density via land use, infrastructure and economic development policies.\n\n6. Look to expand in the near and far North: Conduct a national conversation including Indigenous nations about increasing population in the North.\n\n7. Invest in a globally ranked education system that can be a magnet for top talent: Develop post-secondary institutions into \u201ccentres of excellence.\u201d Create a \u201cclear and easy path to citizenship\u201d for international students.\n\n8. Attract and develop talent with the skills for the digital age: Fund training, make broader work experience opportunities available and clearly communicate the skills necessary for specific jobs.\n\n9. Scale innovation and entrepreneurship: Maintain a talent pool and access to capital. Develop \u201cworld-class Canadian superclusters.\u201d Revise regulations to \u201cfavour Canadian economic success.\u201d\n\n10. Educate Canadians about the economic case for immigration: Create a national advisory body to give recommendations on immigration reform, economic growth, development and infrastructure.\n\nSource: The Century Initiative\n\n\u201cA higher population is likely to lead to higher underlying potential in the economy,\u201d said Brett House, Scotiabank\u2019s deputy chief economist, although he did not endorse the Century Initiative\u2019s specific figures. How fully Canada realizes that potential would depend on how well the country integrates the new arrivals, he said, noting that non-native-born Canadians do better on health, education and home ownership measures than immigrants in other OECD countries.\n\nA dramatic increase in population across the country would put pressure on governments to make sure people have access to social supports, including health care, schools and housing\u2014particularly in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where most immigrants settle. \u201cEnsuring that more people lead to higher underlying potential growth really starts becoming contingent \u2026 on putting into place the infrastructure and services [for] a much bigger population,\u201d House said.\n\nNot every government is likely to be on board. In December 2018, Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u2019s government enacted plans to reduce the province\u2019s immigration intake by as much as 20 per cent for this year. The Century Initiative report addresses Quebec\u2019s situation specifically, acknowledging the province has the right to set its own targets, but arguing it \u201cwill need to take in far more immigrants if it wishes to maintain its historic share of the population.\u201d\n\nThe report recommends governments and industry make it a priority to educate the public on the value of immigration. That may prove an uphill battle: in an October Angus Reid Institute poll, 39 per cent of respondents thought Canada\u2019s current immigration levels were about right, while only 13 per cent thought the number should be higher.\n\nThe Century Initiative report anticipates that a 100-million-person Canada would be more heavily urbanized than today, using the term \u201cmega-regions\u201d to describe areas with multiple city centres that encompass at least five million people and $100 billion in annual GDP. It estimates the Toronto mega-region would include more than a third of the national population, up from about a quarter in 2016. The Vancouver area would also grow significantly, from 3.3 million to 11.9 million, while the Calgary-Edmonton corridor would jump the most, from 2.8 million to 15.5 million.\n\nDense mega-regions like these could create \u201cinnovation clusters that would facilitate job growth,\u201d Gill said.\n\nA larger domestic consumer market could help more Canadian businesses scale up and compete internationally, according to the report. Continued immigration\u2014along with the new emphasis on digital skills training the Century Initiative recommends\u2014will also create a larger workforce for those firms. \u201cIn order to really grow these innovative and entrepreneurial companies, they need access to talent,\u201d said Gill, adding that a large workforce also helps firms \u201cattract the investment to enable access to global markets.\u201d\n\nHowever, House pointed out that while consumer-oriented companies benefit from large local markets, plenty of big firms come from small markets. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me the tech sector requires a large local market,\u201d House said, adding that the quality of the labour pool is more important.\n\nEven if governments and the public support the Century Initiative\u2019s proposals, finding enough immigrants to hit its targets is set to get more challenging. Population growth in Canada\u2019s principal sources of immigrants\u2014India, the Philippines and China were top in 2017\u2014is slowing, and economic growth is creating more domestic opportunities for skilled workers, according to House. He also does not expect the U.S. to remain permanently unwelcoming to newcomers.\n\nThose trends mean that if Canada hopes to continue to benefit from the arrival of newcomers, it needs to \u201cstart pressing the gas on immigration sooner rather than later,\u201d said House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become a tougher and tougher marketplace for immigrants.\u201d", "description": "The Century Initiative envisions \u2018mega-regions\u2019 encompassing at least five million people and $100 billion in annual GDP", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canada-should-triple-its-population-by-2100-says-group-foun.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
