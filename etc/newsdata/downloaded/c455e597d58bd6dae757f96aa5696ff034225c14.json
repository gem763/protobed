His 7-6, 6-7, 6-1 win over fellow Briton Cameron Norrie carried him into his first ATP quarter-final of the year, while also earning him a valuable day off to rest a weary body.\n\nAs far as Murray\u2019s ball-striking is concerned, there was plenty to admire \u2013 particularly when he came forward to finish points at the net. But putting matches back-to-back remains new territory, at least since he underwent the insertion of a metal hip joint in January. This match came only 24 hours after his demanding 7-6, 7-6 victory over world No 8 Matteo Berrettini, and there were moments when he looked completely puffed.\n\n\u201cI tried to shorten the points a lot at the end of the second set and in the third set,\u201d Murray admitted in his on-court interview. \u201cBecause when we were playing the long rallies, he was getting the better of them and making me run a lot. I was getting tired so I had to change the way the match was going and managed to shorten enough points at the end.\u201d", "description": "Andy Murray scored another encouraging victory in Beijing on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000211707838-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvnKsovPwIW3dQr5uH-4CFTGD3F2lrV7TYVJlMyV4KTQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
