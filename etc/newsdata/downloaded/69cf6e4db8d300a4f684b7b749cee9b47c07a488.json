Mr. Barber, age 59, is retiring at the end of the year, the company said, opening up the CEO succession race.\n\nMr. Barber, a 35-year UPS veteran, returned to the U.S. from a long stint working internationally to help improve performance in domestic operations. His promotion to COO made him a CEO-in-waiting, as Mr. Abney previously held that position briefly before becoming CEO in 2014.\n\nCiti analyst Christian Wetherbee said Mr. Barber was \"well-liked by the investment community\" and that losing an executive \"seen as an operational catalyst likely will weigh on shares.\"\n\nShares fell 4.8% in recent premarket trading to $113.86.\n\nUPS said the high demand for next-day shipping, with volume up 24% in the U.S., and strong cost management helped the company boost profit in the period. Overall U.S. volume rose 9%.\n\nOverseas, FedEx's international business posted a decline in revenue amid a drop in shipments between the U.S. and Asia. Other shipments inside Europe and in other Asia trade lanes grew.\n\nFor the period, the Atlanta-based shipper posted quarterly earnings of $1.75 billion, or $2.01 a share, up from $1.51 billion, or $1.73 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain transformation costs, per-share earnings were $2.07, slightly topping the estimate of analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nRevenue increased 5% from the year prior to $18.32 billion, slightly under the consensus estimate.\n\nThe company backed its earnings guidance for the year.\n\nMicah Maidenberg contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 22, 2019 09:21 ET (13:21 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
