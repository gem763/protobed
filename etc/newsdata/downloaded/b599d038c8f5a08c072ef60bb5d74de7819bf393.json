The annual deficit, which adds to the nation's overall debt burden, was $587 billion in the last full fiscal year before Trump took office.\n\n\u201cAmerica remains on the fast track to trillion-dollar deficits, rising rapidly as far as the eye can see,\" said Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation, which advocates for debt reduction.\n\n\"With all of the important investments we need to make in our future, we find ourselves in a situation where interest costs are the fastest growing program in the federal budget. That\u2019s not where we want growth,\" he said.\n\nNet interest, the amount the government pays to service the debt, reached $376 billion, larger than the combined cost of veterans benefits and services and education, and more than half as much as the cost of defense.\n\nThe main drivers of the deficit are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but recent legislation has contributed to it as well.\n\nThe GOP tax law added substantially to the deficit by scaling back revenues, while two bipartisan spending deals added financial resources for both defense and domestic priorities.\n\nCBO has warned that the nation is on an \"unsustainable\" fiscal path. Treasury projected that the 2020 deficit would amount to $1.045 trillion.\n\nThe rise in the deficit during a booming economy is particularly worrying to economists and budget watchers.\n\nA deficit of this size following the longest span of economic growth in history shows just how reckless our leaders have become,\" said former Obama Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a co-chairman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n\"This is exactly the time when deficits should be contracting, not expanding,\" he added.\n\nUpdated at 2:48 p.m.", "description": "The federal deficit for\u00a0fiscal 2019 reached close to $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, according to final Treasury Department figures released Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/treasurydepartment.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
