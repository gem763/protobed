Montali agreed to let bondholders including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Elliott Management Corp. pitch their own restructuring plan alongside PG&E\u2019s, so they can both come up with ways the utility could deal with an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities. Some of PG&E\u2019s bonds jumped to their highest levels in almost two years.\n\nThe damages, tied to blazes that its equipment ignited, forced the utility to file for Chapter 11 in January. PG&E is simultaneously trying to manage an unprecedented blackout it engineered to prevent new fires.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity is the latest twist in a massive bankruptcy case that has already attracted some of the biggest names in the financial world. A group led by Pimco and Elliott has devised a plan that would all but obliterate the stake of current shareholders in the utility.\n\n\u201cIn the worst case, the competing plan could win and completely wipe out current shareholders,\u201d Greg Gordon, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a research note. \u201cIn other words, zero is possible.\u201d\n\nImmediately after Montali issued his ruling Wednesday, PG&E shares plunged by as much as 25%. It hit just as PG&E was cutting power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in Northern California in the first phase of an orchestrated shutoff designed to keep its power lines from igniting blazes.\n\nThe creditors, including the fire victims, have \u201cspoken loudly and clearly that they want their\u201d proposal to be considered, Montali said in his ruling. While PG&E\u2019s plan is \u201con track as well as can be expected,\u201d he wrote, so is the competing version from creditors.\n\nThe court denied requests by other parties to let them offer recovery plans, too.\n\nDual Track\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the Bankruptcy Court has opened the door to consideration of a plan designed to unjustly enrich Elliott and the other ad hoc bondholders and seize control of PG&E at a substantial discount,\u201d PG&E said in a statement.\n\nUnder bankruptcy law, a company has a limited amount of time to develop a reorganization plan and persuade creditors to vote in favor of it. Initially, no other competing proposals are allowed, so the bondholders needed permission from Montali before they could proceed. It\u2019s unusual for a bankruptcy judge to grant such a request.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal, because now the shape of the reorganization is no longer in existing management\u2019s hands,\u201d said Stephen Lubben of the Seton Hall University School of Law. \u201cWhoever can persuade a critical mass of creditors, along with the regulators, that they have a good way forward will win. That could result in a very different plan than management envisioned when they went into Chapter 11.\u201d\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 29 to address liabilities resulting from a series of devastating fires that tore through Northern California in 2017 and 2018. The effects have been rippling through millions of ratepayers, hundreds of creditors, thousands of workers and the state\u2019s political system.\n\nTwo Paths\n\nThe company has argued that ending its exclusive control before the company figures out its exact wildfire liabilities would \u201clead to further distraction, costs and waste\u201d and would jeopardize the company\u2019s chances of exiting bankruptcy by June 2020, a deadline set by the state.\n\nWhether shareholders will actually suffer a total wipeout is open to question, because Montali\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t shut down PG&E\u2019s effort or necessarily favor its rivals.\n\n\u201cOne plan emerging as confirmable is a very acceptable outcome,\u201d Montali wrote. \u201cAnd if both plans pass muster, the voters will make their choice or leave the court with the task of picking one of them.\u201d He directed the noteholders to file their plan by Oct. 17.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the company faced such a dilemma. PG&E\u2019s utility unit filed for bankruptcy in 2001, and in that case, creditors were paid in full and shareholders kept considerable value.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. shares plunged as it grappled with a court ruling that threatens to put the fate of the bankrupt power giant in the hands of outsiders and perhaps wipe out the stock.The shares dropped as much as 32% Thursday after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali stripped PG&E the previous", "authors": ["Steven Church", "Mark Chediak"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B735texeXtKX9Q..8G3ZUw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/59fd216dbb65356b737c9665bc487b21", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
