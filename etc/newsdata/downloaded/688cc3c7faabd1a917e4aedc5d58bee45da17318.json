She noticed it was swollen, a condition he had suffered a year earlier.\n\nExaminations last year found he had a small hole in his oesophagus which had been causing liquid to build up in his abdomen.\n\nBut Miss Driver said that when they arrived at Coventry\u2019s University Hospital on October 13, it took two hours for paramedics to hand him over to hospital staff in the corridor. Then, nurses \u2018would not listen\u2019 to her as her father lay in a queue of up to 40 trolleys, she added.\n\n\u2018It seemed to be a case of, \u201cWe know best\u201d,\u2019 Miss Driver said yesterday. The former nurse, from Tile Hill, Coventry, added: \u2018I have lost my father due to the NHS failing and there is nothing that can bring him back. I showed one nurse a picture of Dad\u2019s stomach when he had the episode last year. I must have spoken to six of them in total. I knew he needed to be seen but they weren\u2019t listening. Nobody looked at him, no pain relief was given. It was horrific.\u2019 Miss Driver spent 12 years in the profession, working as a nurse at the rehabilitation hospital in Leamington Spa. She gave up that job two years ago to spend more time caring for her father, who spent his working life looking after street lights in Coventry.\n\nEmma Driver, pictured with her father Donald, said she lost her father due to the failing NHS\n\nMs Driver said her father spent two hours stuck in an ambulance, pictured while waiting to get into the hospital's accident and emergency unit on Sunday October 13. He was pronounced dead at 1am the following morning\n\nMiss Driver said the first time her father was seen by medics was after she screamed for help when he slid off the trolley vomiting.\n\n\u2018The nurses helped get him back on the trolley but as he lay down and I saw his face, I knew he was gone,\u2019 Miss Driver said.\n\n\u2018The nurses shouted \u201cresus\u201d [resuscitation] and he was taken away, but after three attempts to revive him I asked them to stop.\u2019\n\nHer father was pronounced dead at 1am on Monday, October 14.\n\n\u2018My dad was my world,\u2019 she said. \u2018Although he was elderly, he wasn\u2019t dying. I believe had my father been prioritised, or I had been listened to and taken seriously, then my father would still be here.\u2019\n\nIn a statement, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire Trust offered \u2018sincere and heartfelt sympathies to Mr Driver\u2019s family and friends\u2019.\n\nMr Driver, a father and grandfather of one, leaves behind \u2018devastated\u2019 wife Andrea, 72.\n\nThe hospital trust had previously said that weekend had been \u2018abnormally busy\u2019.", "description": "Donald Driver, 84, had spent six hours on a trolley at Coventry University Hospital when he slid off and fell on the floor and died in the early hours of October 14.", "authors": ["Andy Dolan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/21/20094542-0-image-a-9_1571862156077.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
