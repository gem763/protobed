I want to feel that when I am on the court I am not getting smashed by guys\u2019.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking, \u2018I am going to win tournaments\u2019 or \u2018I am going to beat guys like Stan and (Matteo) Berrettini\u2019.

I need to get on the road so we don\u2019t get out of control. I\u2019m excited for the third kid. My wife\u2019s been a huge support for getting me back on the court and making me fight to keep playing.\u201d", "description": "Andy Murray was looking to the future with unabashed optimism after one of the most remarkable achievements of his career.
