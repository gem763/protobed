The campaign aims to reverse the prorogation of parliament, to stop Johnson driving our country off a cliff economically and politically, and to make sure the country has the time and space to deliberate and consider its political options.\n\nEveryone wants an end to this national crisis no matter how they voted in 2016, but the current leadership of the country cannot be trusted to put the people first, nor respect the sovereignty of parliament or the standards of British democracy. This new emergency demands a different approach.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

First, the majority of speakers who said they were \u201cjust\u201d citizens, and the quality of their spontaneous speeches were among the best I have ever heard at rallies. The MC Laura Parker set the tone for the night by putting the main focus on getting people in the crowd to speak out, and putting the spotlight on ordinary citizens whose stories were anything but.\n\nThere was Lana from Chechnya, a woman whose family died in the Holocaust, a guy on his way home from work who had \u201cnever been to anything like this\u201d before, and a Leave voter queueing up for his say.\n\nAnother speaker, Jacob, opened with: \u201cYou don\u2019t know that my middle name is William. I never met my Great Uncle Bill. His Lancaster bomber was taken down and they never found his body. There is a gap in our family tree. And I am sure in many of yours. I am here to defend the democracy he gave his life for.\u201d\n\nStories were told in less than two minutes that conveyed more heart and soul than the thousands of prepared speeches from Boris Johnson and his cronies.\n\nSecond, it was about all political parties and none at the same time, and went way beyond Brexit. People from across the political spectrum are united in their outrage at the blatant contempt Johnson has shown for the mother of parliaments and the British history he claims to be so inspired by. Johnson is using his power to stifle debate, and leave parliament with the same kind of non-choice Theresa May put before MPs three times.\n\nJohnson is banking on MPs either being bullied into accepting whatever deal he fancies in order to avoid no deal, or Europe caving in because of the lack of parliamentary protest, thanks to his convenient shut-down.\n\nHe is also counting on the people flocking to him in an election, after they are fooled by his lies on the NHS, the money he will elicit from his magic tree and the impossible trade deals he will concoct. Our citizens are not daft, and he is unwise to underestimate them so deeply.\n\nThirdly, this matters on a whole new level. There are many who denounce marches and demos as pointless expressions of virtue signalling. But when demos are organised with four hours\u2019 notice, attract thousands, including many who come as first-timers to public protest, we know the stakes have risen even higher.\n\nThere is an energy to be harnessed and a movement to be built. Whatever our views on Brexit, no one voted to provide cover for crushing British democracy. But now we see that\u2019s exactly what Johnson, Rees-Mogg and friends have planned: an Eton mess on a national scale with deadly consequences and a terrifying political agenda.\n\nParliament was not consulted. Most members of the prime minister\u2019s cabinet were not consulted. Boris Johnson thinks he can trample over the little people in the country like he\u2019s falling out of an Oxford Union bar trussed up in full Bullingdon gear, giddy with the power he has always expected to wield.\n\nWith the help of endless cash from corporate and vested interests, Boris Johnson has put together a team of extremists to hold British democracy to ransom and seize power for their own benefit. But we have something money can\u2019t buy \u2013 people power.\n\nIt\u2019s time to show him that he has underestimated the citizens of the UK and that our democracy, our values and our standards are not for sale. We will not be bullied and threatened into submission, we will not see our rights snatched away by louts in pinstripes. We will stand up and we will fight. Take a stand, sign up, give what you can. The stakes have never been higher.\n\nEloise Todd is a campaigner and activist", "description": "There are moments in politics when the national mood fundamentally shifts.
