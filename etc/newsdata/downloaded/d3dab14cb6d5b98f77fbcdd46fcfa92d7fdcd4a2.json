When I look back, I could see the lifestyle I was leading wasn't too healthy at times.\n\n\"I was in my late 20s and early 30s, earning a lot of money and living the lifestyle that came with it, including taking recreational drugs.\n\n\"Then when my business went under I stopped playing that game and chasing a false dream.\n\n\"It's not the money and the car that's going to bring happiness. All you need are your family and loved ones.\"\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk/)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAfter his business Quay Financial, based in the Albert Dock , failed, Paul emigrated to Perth in western Australia with his wife Mel and their two children Louis, now 17, and Elyse, 14.\n\nHe has now become a \"wellness pioneer\", forming The Human Excellence Project with his business partner Michael Henderson to challenge people from all walks of life.\n\nPaul set up the project as a way of coping with the grief of losing his dad to cancer.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe 45-year-old said: \"Having travelled for five years in my early 20s, I had always had a desire to come to Australia and so we took the opportunity to move out. It turned out to be a huge blessing.\"\n\nPaul and Michael now come together each morning to swim in the sea and have been joined by a growing number of people, immediately seeing the health and wellbeing benefits of the Swim Rise.\n\nPaul added: \"Once we have been in the sea we get out, grab a coffee and a chat, warm up and some amazing conversations happen. I believe this will change the world.\"\n\nTo date over 6,000 people have jumped into the sea at sunrise as part of the project.\n\nTo find out more visit The Human Excellence Project on Facebook and Instagram .", "description": "The high-living Liverpool family moved to Australia after losing almost everything in the global financial crisis", "authors": ["Alan Weston", "Image", "Liverpoolecho.Co.Uk", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20730513.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11188JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
