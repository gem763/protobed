It claimed to tap into a database of more than 160 million Arabic numbers. One of the permissions it required was access to a user\u2019s call history and contacts. Despite the sensitivity of that data, those permissions were understandable, given the the app\u2019s focus on phone numbers. It had about 5,000 installations before Google removed it from Play in August. Check Point doesn\u2019t know when IndexY first became available in Play.\n\nBehind the scenes, IndexY logged whether each call was incoming, outgoing, or missed as well as its date and duration. Publicly accessible files left on indexy[.]org, a domain hardcoded into the app, showed not only that the data was collected but that the developers actively analyzed and inspected that information. Analysis included the number of users per country, call-log details, and lists of calls made from one country to another.\n\nIndexY was one piece of a broad and far-ranging surveillance campaign that was first documented in March by Amnesty International. It targeted people who played adversarial roles to Egypt\u2019s government and prompted warnings from Google to some of those targeted that \u201cgovernment-backed attackers are trying to steal your password.\u201d Check Point found that, at the same time, Google was playing a key supporting role in the campaign.\n\nEvading Google Play vetting... again\n\nThe attackers \u201cwere able to evade Google\u2019s protections,\u201d Lotem Finkelshtein, Check Point\u2019s threat intelligence group manager, told Ars. \u201cGetting into Google Play is something that gives the attacking infrastructure credibility.\n\nFinkelshtein said that one of the ways the attackers evaded Google vetting of the app was that the analysis and inspection of the data happened on the attacker-designated server and not on an infected phone itself.\n\n\u201cGoogle couldn\u2019t see the info that was collected,\u201d he said.\n\nBypassing 2FA\n\nMalicious and unwanted apps on Google Play have emerged as one of the most vexing security problems for the Android operating system. Discoveries such as this this , and this , sometimes infecting hundreds of millions of devices , are a regular occurrence. Last month, Google Play had unwanted apps with nearly 336 million installs, according to security researcher Lukas Stefanko, although most of those apps were considered adware, as opposed to outright malware.\n\nIndexY was one of at least three pieces of Android malware that Check Point tied to the campaign. A different app purported to increase the volume of devices, even though it had no such capability. Called iLoud 200%, it collected location data as soon as it was started. In the event it stopped running, iLoud was able to restart itself. Finkelshtein said that that app was distributed on third-party sites and was installed an unknown number of times.\n\nYet another app, called v1.apk, was submitted to Google\u2019s VirusTotal malware detection service in February. It communicated with the domain drivebackup[.]co and appeared to be in an early testing phase.\n\nAs previously documented by Amnesty International, the campaign also used third-party apps that connected to Gmail and Outlook accounts using the OAuth standard. Finkelshtein said the apps had the ability to steal messages even when the targeted accounts were protected by two-factor authentication, which in addition to a password requires a physical security key or one-time password produced by a device in the target\u2019s possession. The third-party apps were distributed in links sent in phishing and malicious spam messages.\n\nThe takeaway is that the attackers need not be sophisticated to succeed at surveilling their targets.\n\nCheck Point\u2019s report concluded:", "description": "Google removes app that logged detailed information about users' calls.", "authors": ["Dan Goodin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/indexy-760x380.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
