Which I might add is no reason to drop the investigation. To my mind it merely means, as Congressman Adam Schiff has emphasized, the process should be expeditious.\n\nWhat this also means, however, is that America is falling behind.\n\nWhile we argue over whether or not we should rid ourselves of the most unPresidential President in history, our friends, foes and frenemies are racing ahead.\n\nEvents this week in China and the Asia Pacific region make that oh-so clear. The biggie of course was China\u2019s massive 70th anniversary parade on Tuesday, with tens of thousands of troops and a plethora of new weaponry on display including new Dongfeng-41 (DF-41) ICBM nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. in 30 minutes, other missiles that can fly at five times the speed of sound, supersonic drones, and new J-20 stealth fighter jets. Lovely.\n\nThis was China\u2019s biggest military display ever and state media reported that 40% of the hardware was on display for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s a military parade that is political shock and awe,\u201d said Richard McGregor, China analyst at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based independent think tank. (Oh yeah, and later some scientists, athletes and artists marched too.)\n\nPentagon analysts must have been riveted watching the footage. Did they have an opportunity to brief President Trump, or was he too busy huddling with Rudy Giuliani or berating reporters?\n\nStill the president can\u2019t have been surprised. It\u2019s almost as if Chinese President Xi Jinping was taking direction from Trump\u2019s speech at the U.N. the week prior. \u201c...take pride in your country,\u201d Trump told the General Assembly. \u201c...love your nation. The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.\u201d\n\nXi and Trump are very much on the same page there.\n\nIt all begs the question: Is there enough bandwidth in the White House to assess and strategize when it comes to China\u2019s ever increasing military prowess?\n\nAnd you might have missed a few days earlier when Beijing opened its new mega, $17 billion airport, bigger than 98 football fields, featuring the world\u2019s largest terminal which is in the shape of a starfish. Within a few years, Beijing Daxing International Airport will be one of the world\u2019s biggest, (this in addition to Beijing Capital Airport, already a colossus.)\n\nIs there enough bandwidth in Washington right now to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects?\n\nThe departure lobby is seen at the new Daxing International Airport ahead of the 70th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, China Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019.(Naohiko Hatta/Kyodo News via AP) More\n\nChina\u2019s South Pacific ambitions\n\nWho knows how far China\u2019s ambitions extend. Having just come back from the South Pacific I saw firsthand the long arm of Beijing. In Australia, where over 30% of exports go to China, ads in the Sydney Airport welcome and hawk services to Chinese travelers in Mandarin. Ditto for real estate billboards. \u201cWhat does our country do anymore,\u201d asked Matt Barrie, CEO of Freelancer.com at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in Sydney. \u201cWe dig up dirt, iron ore that is, and we send it to China. We dig up coal and we send to China.\u201d\n\nIn Fiji, 2,000 miles to the northeast, the papers were celebrating a $30 million jetty project paid for by the Chinese, plus Chinese help for the local sugar industry, plus a new $5 million sports stadium, paid for mostly by, guess who, the Chinese. \u201cTrade flows between Fiji and China have been flourishing in recent years,\u201d Fiji\u2019s Minister for Trade Premila Devi Kumar said recently. Must be. Walking into a tiny dusty rural store on the island of Viti Levu\u20145,600 miles from Beijing (Los Angeles is 100 miles closer)\u2014you are greeted by an automated recording: \u201cNi hao!\u201d", "description": "It's almost impossible for Congress to get anything done amid the impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Andy Serwer", "Editor In Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sOqObCb6DcLFuaT1gJVh2w--~B/aD0yNzYwO3c9NDE0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a0f9ecb0-e759-11e9-974d-4a2086a8e72e", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
