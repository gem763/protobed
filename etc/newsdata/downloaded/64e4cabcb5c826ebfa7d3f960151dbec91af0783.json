It briefly climbed above its July 26 closing record of 3025.86 in midday trading, but pared some of those gains to close an inch from the summer high.\n\nStocks rallied and Treasury yields jumped higher after reports that the U.S. and China made progress in trade discussions, edging closer to finalizing portions of a \"phase one deal.\"\n\n\"That just goes to show that trade is still really dominating market movements,\" said John Zaller, chief investment officer of MAI Capital Management.\n\nTo some, Friday's move showed how sensitive investors have been to headlines about trade talks. Despite sitting near records, major indexes have been relatively rangebound in recent weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average haven't notched a 1% move up or down in more than a week. A mixed bag of corporate earnings results in the busiest week of the reporting period drove only modest moves in the broader market, despite dramatic swings in shares of individual companies.\n\nNext week, Google-parent Alphabet, General Motors, Mastercard and other companies release earnings results.\n\nAdditionally, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's meeting, with many girding for an interest-rate cut. The meeting, which concludes Wednesday, has the potential to spur volatility and drive markets out of the calm stretch, analysts said.\n\n\"It seems like the market is acting like another cut is a foregone conclusion,\" Mr. Zaller said. \"We actually think it's a little bit more of a toss-up.\"\n\nIn Friday's session, the Dow industrials gained 152.53 points, or 0.6%, to 26958.06. The blue-chip gauge was led higher by shares of Caterpillar and 3M, but continued to lag behind the S&P 500 this week. The 30-stock index ended the week up 0.7% and 1.5% from its July high.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite reversed an early loss to add 57.32 points, or 0.7%, to 8243.12, clinching its fourth straight week of gains. The tech-heavy index added 1.9% for the week and is 1% from its last record.\n\nEnthusiasm surrounding trade lifted shares of tech and industrials giants, making them some of Friday's biggest winners. Caterpillar, a bellwether stock for trade, jumped $5.88, or 4.4%, to $139.73.\n\nThe manufacturing company earlier this week slashed its profit forecast for the year, saying global economic uncertainty is prompting customers to delay big purchases. It was one of several high-profile earnings disappointments of the week.\n\nInvestors have been analyzing earnings reports for signs of the trade war's effects on the domestic economy. The word \"tariff\" has been mentioned more frequently on earnings calls in recent months, a sign that trade remains a headwind for companies and stock investors.\n\nThe University of Michigan issued the final results Friday of its October consumer sentiment survey, showing that Americans' feelings about the economy worsened slightly at the end of the month. Earlier in October, retail sales figures showed that consumers pulled back on spending in September.\n\n\"The market, I think, is desperately hoping for something good to happen, \" said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer at Adams Funds. \"People would like to have it behind us,\" he said of the trade matter.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 1.805% after the trade reports Friday, from 1.768% Thursday.\n\nAmong the other big moves under the surface Friday, shares of Intel climbed $4.23, or 8.1%, to $56.46 after the chip maker raised its outlook for the year Thursday.\n\nCharter Communications stock jumped $27.12, or 6.2%, to $462.19 after the cable company's third-quarter profit fell less than expected and revenue beat forecasts.\n\nShares of Amazon.com dropped $19.45, or 1.1%, to $1761.33 after the tech giant reported a 26% fall in profit as it invested heavily to speed up shipping times.\n\nIn Europe, fresh economic data and corporate earnings continued to paint a mixed picture of how the biggest businesses in the region are doing.\n\nThe outlook for growth and inflation in the eurozone over the coming years was lowered by forecasters surveyed by the European Central Bank. Adding to the subdued economic outlook, market-research group GfK said German consumer sentiment is set to worsen in November, while business expectations in the country improved slightly, according to the Ifo Institute.\n\n\"We are still waiting for a proper rebound\" in economic growth in Germany, said Inga Fechner, an economist at ING. Business sentiment remains weak amid worrying signs from the country's services sector, she added.\n\nThe British pound dropped 0.3% against the U.S. dollar , after earlier having recovered from an even sharper drop Thursday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a snap general election on Dec. 12 in an effort to pressure his political opponents to back his Brexit deal.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 17:12 ET (21:12 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
