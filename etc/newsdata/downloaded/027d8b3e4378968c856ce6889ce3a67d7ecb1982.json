The AMWU's alliance with John Setka's Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union branch in Victoria also poses a hurdle given AWU-CFMEU rivalry in construction.\n\nOne Labor source said the factional rivalry made any merger a \"pipe dream\" but a source close to the discussions argued the ideological obstacles were overstated.\n\nBoth unions are eyeing the recent decision by the ideologically opposed United Voice and National Union of Workers to join forces to create the country's biggest blue-collar union with more than 150,000 workers.\n\nAs a result of the merger, the Right-aligned NUW will be deregistered and is expected to switch to the Left with United Voice in a move that has angered the Labor Right.\n\nThe merger was cited as the reason for NUW national secretary Tim Kennedy losing his spot on the ALP national executive last year.\n\nHowever, sources said blue-collar unions had to amalgamate to survive in the face of low membership and declining industries.\n\nThe re-election of the Morrison government was also cited as a key impetus for the merger talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AWU is the country's oldest union and was involved in the founding of the Labor Party.\n\nHowever, the union's membership has declined dramatically since the days of Mr Shorten as its national secretary from 2001 to 2007.\n\nMembership has fallen every year for the past seven years and was just 72,971 workers in 2018, almost half the 139,329 members in 2012 under Shorten's successor Paul Howes.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018 alone, membership declined by almost 15 per cent in part, sources say, to an internal audit that uncovered membership numbers had been inflated.\n\nHowever, union sources insisted membership had now \"bottomed out\" and was starting to grow again.\n\nThe AMWU has had a similar decline after losing the bulk of its membership with the end of the automotive industry in 2016.\n\nThe union has lost about 6000 members a year for the past five years and by 2018 had just 64,016, down from 100,176 in 2012.\n\nThe Labor-Right aligned Transport Workers Union is ideologically a better fit for the AWU but is understood to also be considering a merger with the Rail Tram and Bus Union.\n\nThe unions declined to comment.", "description": "Bill Shorten's old union is under pressure to find a blue-collar union to merge with in the face of huge membership losses and a hostile political landscape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8563%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f3c09be866679e64941b3f36cc881b05ff944bf3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
