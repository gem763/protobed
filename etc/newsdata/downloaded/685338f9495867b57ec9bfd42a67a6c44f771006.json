This year alone, they added collaborations with Ariana Grande and the Jonas Brothers on their respective chart-topping albums to their ever-diversifying r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nTranter, who was previously the lead singer of the Semi-Precious Weapons, is certainly on a professional roll. Musical accolades and achievements aside, the Illinois native has a deep concern for the U.S. political climate and, specifically, the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling very, very hopeful [ahead of the 2020 presidential race], but also prepared for a fight like we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Tranter, who is gender nonconforming and uses the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d told HuffPost. \u201cThese people want us erased \u2015 and it might be worse than verbally erased. They might want us physically erased.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hope comes in many ways,\u201d they said. \u201cThe hope comes in Lil Nas X. The hope comes in LGBTQ songwriters behind the scenes who are able to kick ass openly. The hope comes in the whistleblowers.\u201d\n\nTranter\u2019s optimism is also what fuels their advocacy work. On Wednesday, they teamed up with GLAAD to stage their third BEYOND Spirit Day concert in support of LGBTQ youth at the Sunset Room in Los Angeles. The concert, which took place on the eve of Spirit Day (Oct. 17), featured appearances by Bebe Rexha and Idina Menzel, plus guests including Shea Diamond, Troye Sivan and Emily Hampshire of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek.\u201d\n\nDays before the show, Tranter spoke to HuffPost about their latest milestones, what they see as the biggest challenges facing LGBTQ pop artists and why they\u2019re inspired by Lil Nas X and Sam Smith.\n\nWhat\u2019s your mindset going into this year\u2019s Spirit Day concert specifically?\n\nThis is the first year I\u2019m not in a total panic. I don\u2019t perform anymore except at a couple of charity events each year, and this is the big one. It\u2019s been an amazing year for LGBTQ songwriters. We have Jesse Saint John, who co-wrote \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d by Lizzo. We have Jozzy, who co-wrote \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d\n\nMichael Pollack co-wrote the new Maroon 5 song, \u201cMemories,\u201d as well as a bunch of other really important songs this year. Teddy Geiger \u2014 she\u2019s the queen of the Shawn Mendes world. There\u2019s a lot of us out here in LA just kicking ass, and it\u2019s beyond inspiring. It\u2019s going to be a celebratory night.\n\nJerod Harris via Getty Images From left: Justin Tranter, Idina Menzel, Bebe Rexha, Jesse Saint John and Jozzy take the stage at BEYOND Spirit Day concert 2019.\n\nYou mention Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d which has been such a milestone for queer representation in music. What did it mean to you personally?\n\nI\u2019m blown away by it. I can\u2019t believe that the biggest song of all time is co-written and performed by a queer person of color, and another one of its co-writers is a queer woman of color. That will mean so much for kids who are born right now. It means so much for kids who are 15, and it means so much for me \u2014 and I\u2019m almost 40! (laughs) The joy that it brings me and the hope that it brings me is something I can\u2019t even really put into words.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenges facing queer artists in the music industry at this point?\n\nThe stakes are higher for any marginalized artist. You have executives who are trying to keep their job, and they\u2019re afraid. They just want to sign the easiest things possible. They\u2019re like, \u201cWell, how does a straight, white, cisgender family in the middle of the country relate to this person?\u201d\n\nBut we have so many examples of marginalized people who have valid, mainstream, moneymaking stories to tell, whether it\u2019s Lil Nas X, Sam Smith \u2014 the list goes on and on. You need to make sure the executives realize that not only is diversity the right thing to do for culture, it\u2019s the right thing to do for business.\n\nChristopher Patey \"The stakes are higher for any marginalized artist,\" Tranter said.\n\nYou and your business partner, Katie Vinten, recently launched a new label, Facet Records. Given the ways that music consumption has shifted in recent years, did that ever feel like a gamble?\n\nI don\u2019t ever want to make an album for myself again. I don\u2019t want to go on tour again, but I do miss having conversations about the process. So it felt like a natural step to take, to help other people have a platform they deserve. We want to tell stories that other labels are too scared to tell. Every single person we\u2019ve signed is racially diverse. There\u2019s lots of LGBTQ people.\n\nWhat facets of the queer experience would you like to see reflected in pop music that you haven\u2019t already?\n\nMore racial diversity is always needed in every single aspect of entertainment. Lil Nas X is unbelievable, but let\u2019s have 10 more queer people of color who take over the pop charts.\n\nWe\u2019re also still scared of femme people being [seen as] three-dimensional human beings. I think that\u2019s a big part of the queer experience we\u2019re missing. The steps Sam Smith is taking right now in living their truth internally and externally is inspiring to me. Every time they make a new statement, whether it\u2019s on Instagram or in an interview, I text them: \u201cSam, you are literally changing the world.\u201d That\u2019s the beauty of giving people a platform who deserve one.\n\nJerod Harris via Getty Images Last year, Tranter teamed up with business partner Katie Vinten to launch a new record label, Facet Records. \"We want to tell stories that other labels are too scared to tell,\" they said.\n\nWhat are some projects you\u2019re working on now that you\u2019re excited about?\n\nI recently worked with Isabela Merced, and her talent is shocking. It\u2019s pop and alternative pop woven into traditional Peruvian music. Diana Gordon, who co-wrote some of my favorite songs on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade,\u201d has an EP of her own out. And Shawn Wasabi, who was already signed to my company as a producer \u2014 we\u2019re moving forward on his artist project. His vision is absolutely amazing.\n\nWhat are the songs from 2019 that you wish you\u2019d written?\n\n\u201cDance Money\u201d by Tones and I, for sure. That song is life-changing. Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLover\u201d is fucking amazing. And I wish I was part of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d because it\u2019s such an iconic moment \u2014 not only for the LGBTQ community, but for the whole planet.\n\nJerod Harris via Getty Images Justin Tranter (left) performs with Idina Menzel at the 2019 Spirit Day concert in Los Angeles.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.", "description": "Ariana Grande and the Jonas Brothers' trusted collaborator marked Spirit Day with their third benefit concert for GLAAD.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da7fc2b210000751134a2f0.png?cache=79ixaeikmt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
