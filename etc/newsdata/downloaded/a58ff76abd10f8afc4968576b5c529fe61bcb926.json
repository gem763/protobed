Hasenstab Flips to Safe-Haven Currencies After $3 Billion Loss\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Franklin Templeton star bond investor Michael Hasenstab is loading up on safe-haven currencies and winding down massive holdings in emerging markets after two of his biggest investments flopped in August.\n\nThe fund manager doubled exposure to the yen to 40% in the $30 billion Templeton Global Bond Fund in the third quarter, according to a recent filing. He\u2019s also added long positions in the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona and is increasing liquidity by boosting cash across his funds, he said in an October note.\n\nTotal net assets in the global bond fund dropped by $3 billion in the three months through September as a massive holding in Argentina was pummeled by the country\u2019s default. The fund was also holding a huge short position in U.S. Treasuries as yields sank to a three-year low.\n\n\u201cA number of global risk factors have increased, raising the need to hedge some of our foreign exchange risk exposures and counterbalance our U.S. rate hedge,\u201d said Hasenstab, who oversees more than $100 billion. \u201cThe potential for a geopolitical event appears higher than it has been in decades, given ongoing tensions among major world powers.\u201d\n\nTempleton\u2019s Global Bond Fund has underperformed more than 80% of peers this year, losing 1.3% compared with a return of about 7% from Treasuries. The fund has returned 2.3% in the past three years, Bloomberg data show.\n\nThe fund is holding on to its Treasury short, but shifting the focus to those with longer maturities, according to the report. Hasenstab argues that markets continue to overvalue long bonds given rising deficit spending and rising debt.\n\nAverage duration in the Global Bond Fund, a measure of sensitivity to shifts in rates, increased to minus 1.39 years as of the end of September, the filings show. At the end of June it was a record low of minus 2.82 years.\n\nWhile Hasenstab continues to see value in emerging markets, he says he is now \u201csizing and hedging\u201d positions for individual risks. A 14% holding in Brazilian bonds, for example, is being offset by a net-negative position in the Australian dollar, according to the report.\n\n\u201cInvestment strategies that may have worked well over the last decade are not as likely to be effective in the next one,\u201d Hasenstab said. \u201cInvestors need to prepare for today\u2019s challenges by building portfolios that can provide true diversification against highly correlated risks present across many asset classes.\u201d", "description": "Hasenstab Flips to Safe-Haven Currencies After $3 Billion Loss", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE4M041_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
