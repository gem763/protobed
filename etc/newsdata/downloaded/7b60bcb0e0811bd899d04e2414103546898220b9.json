The 75-year-old actor was then seen in full makeup and fake teeth doing his surprisingly adept impression of the president\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\n'SNL' MOCKS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS IN SEASON PREMIERE\n\n\u201cMr. Mayor, how do you respond to critics who say that you were traveling the world pushing debunked conspiracies as part of a scheme to help the president\u2019s re-election?\u201d Colbert asked amid \u201cshushes\u201d from Lithgow's Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, Stephen!\u201d the Giuliani character replied. \u201cI was simply bringing the American people the truth about the Bidens! And that\u2019s not all. I now have reason to believe that the 2016 election was not hacked by the Russians, it was hacked by Hunter Biden, who is actually a 'Men in Black'-style alien, being operated by a tiny Hillary Clinton in his neck.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he has proof for his claims, he added, \u201cNot yet! Or ever. I\u2019m not falling into the proof trap!\u201d\n\nLithgow then began to chug red wine on camera, calling it a \u201cRudy snack.\u201d\n\nPAUL MCCARTNEY REVEALS HE 'DREAMS' ABOUT THE LATE JOHN LENNON: 'THEY'RE ALWAYS GOOD'\n\nColbert then mentioned former National Security Adviser John Bolton calling Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d that could blow up Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cStephen, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Lithgow\u2019s Giuliani retorted. \u201cGrenades are used by highly-trained soldiers. I\u2019m more like a can of hairspray someone turns into a flamethrower during a prison riot. That\u2019s also what happened to my teeth.\u201d\n\nHe then made the outrageous claim that Hunter Biden was behind a plot to steal Mozart\u2019s bones.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t alone. Everyone was in on it. The deep state, Podesta, George Soros\u2026 uh\u2026 hold on, let me consult my research department,\u201d he said, taking a big sip of wine. \u201cThe lizard people, Bigfoot, the Chupacabra.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe late-night bit concluded with Lithgow\u2019s character announcing his \u201ccounter-counter\u201d investigation into the counterintelligence probe into him.", "description": "Emmy- and Tony-winning actor John Lithgow debuted his outrageous impression of Rudy Giuliani on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/JohnLithgow1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
