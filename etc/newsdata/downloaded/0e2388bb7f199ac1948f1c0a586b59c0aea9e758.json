Mr. Zucker didn\u2019t say, but his comments raised questions about whether CNN plans to treat anyone who challenges the impeachment push as a liar.\n\nBREAKING: \u201cWe are at an incredibly important time in history and in this country\u2026this is the story(Impeachment) okay\u2026I want to be fully committed to it\u2026I don\u2019t want to be afraid to call out those who are covering it up\u2026They\u2019re lying\u201d - CNN President Jeff Zucker#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/vtFtAX3z9e \u2014 James O\u2019Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 16, 2019\n\nVirtually all national news outlets have covered heavily the Democratic impeachment inquiry, including CNN, which positioned itself as a leading source for impeachment news with a digital ad Wednesday touting its \u201cup to the minute breaking news and analysis\u201d and a dedicated web link.\n\n\u201cFinally, look, we are at an incredibly important time in history and in this country,\u201d said Mr. Zucker on the recording. \u201cAnd this is the story, okay? And I don\u2019t want to be distracted by other things. This is it. And I want to be fully committed to it and not take our eyes off this ball.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost like\u2026CNN wants impeachment. This is one of the most bizarre ads I have seen in a while. https://t.co/ysWnhxTgw0 \u2014 Erielle Davidson (@politicalelle) October 16, 2019\n\nProject Veritas said the undercover recordings, part of its #ExposeCNN series, were made by \u201cCNN insider\u201d Cary Poarch, a contract satellite technician who left the network this week after the first videos were posted.\n\nCNN has dismissed the investigation, noting that the media coordinators featured in the hidden-camera videos are not reporters. The network has been accused of harboring a left-tilting, anti-Trump bias, while Mr. Zucker said in December that CNN was not \u201canti-Trump\u201d but \u201cpro-truth.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe account for Mr. Poarch had raised $95,500 of its $100,000 goal as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMr. Trump weighed in Tuesday on the undercover investigation, tweeting, \u201cNow that we have found out that @CNN is a virtual fraud, rumor has it that Jeff Zucker will be resigning momentarily?\u201d\n\nCNN spokesman Matt Dornic responded by tweeting, \u201clol,\u201d which stands for \u201claugh out loud.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
