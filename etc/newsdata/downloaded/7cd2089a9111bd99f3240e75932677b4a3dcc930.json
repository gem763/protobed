In 2017 he also announced the US will drop out of the Paris Agreement and its commitment to reduce emissions.\n\nSince taking office, Mr Trump has lifted restrictions on coal plants emissions and approved permits for the huge Keystone XL oil pipeline.\n\nHe has rolled back the Obama administration\u2019s pollution standards for vehicles, even taking on California for wanting to impose their own separate \u2013 tougher \u2013 ones.\n\nThe last two heads of the Environmental Protection Agency that have carried these changes. Andrew Wheeler, the current boss, was a former coal lobbyist. Scott Pruitt, his predecessor, opposed environmental regulations.\n\nCanada\n\nJustin Trudeau is a vocal proponent for fighting climate change, celebrating the introduction of a carbon tax in 2018 with the tweet: \u201cStarting next spring, it\u2019ll no longer be free to pollute in Canada.\u201d\n\nHowever, he has faced criticism for another commitment: breathing life into Canada\u2018s oil industry. As he once put it: \u201cNo country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the day after the government declared a climate emergency this summer, it approved a multibillion dollar oil pipeline expansion.\n\nHowever, Mr Trudeau vowed that profits from the Trans Mountain pipeline would be funnelled into green projects.\n\nThe EU\n\nIf all EU\u2019s environmental policies were fully enacted, Climate Action Tracker (CAT) estimates it would exceed the current target, which aims to reduce emissions by 40 per cent by 2020.\n\nNew targets bind countries to work towards 32 per cent of its overall energy coming from renewable sources by 2030 (although individual targets of countries differ).\n\nOther schemes reduce CO2 emissions for new cars and emissions from factories and power plants, for example, through the largest greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world.\n\nHowever, according to National Georgraphic, despite all these positive steps, and perhaps because of its size and scope, the EU remains the third largest emitter of CO2 in the world.\n\nRussia\n\nThe fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the world has seemingly had a change of heart recently when it comes to climate change.\n\nHaving previously signed but not ratified the Paris Agreement, the final step may finally come by the end of 2019.\n\nIn addition to this, Russia is moving to regulate its emissions for the first time and to impose a carbon tax.\n\nPreviously, Vladimir Putin did not seem very concerned about climate change, even suggesting parts of Russia might benefit from rising temperatures and that Russians would save money on fur coats, as The Economist reported.\n\nHe recently expressed a dislike of wind turbines, which harm birds and, apparently, worms according to the Russian leader. \u201cThey shake, causing worms to come out of the soil,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a joke.\u201d\n\nChina\n\nSimilarly, China\u2019s attitude to climate change has drastically altered over the last decade, before which it viewed environmental policies as a western conspiracy plotting to curb its growth, as the Financial Times pointed out.\n\nSince 2015, there have been strict environmental regulations for power plants and a drive to reduce air pollution.\n\nChina has also given its growing electric car manufacturing industry a boost with large subsidies. In turn, Chinese people bought 1.1 million electric cars in 2018 \u2013 more than the entire world combined.\n\nHowever, largely due to heavy coal consumption and electricity production, emissions have been rising for the past two years, whereas they were previously stagnant or falling, according to a report by Carbon Brief.\n\nOne bright note, China\u2019s capital of Beijing is on track to drop out from the list of the world\u2019s top 200 most-polluted cities this year, with hazardous smog concentrations falling to their lowest on record in August, data compiled by IQAir AirVisual.\n\nThe UK\n\nThis year, the UK declared a climate emergency after protesters made themselves heard by flooding London\u2019s streets.\n\nJust before she left office former prime minister Theresa May set a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, although this has been called highly optimistic given the lack of follow-up action.\n\nBritain\u2019s biggest environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, urged chancellor Sajid Javid to invest at least \u00a342bn to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 which is far off the current \u00a317bn a year spent.\n\nA report by the Commons Science and Technology Committee found the current practices of fracking, reducing subsidies on renewable energy and opposing wind farms are also restricting Britain\u2019s ability to fulfil its pledge.\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro recently endured the wrath of France\u2019s leader, Emmanuel Macron, for having allegedly \u201clied\u201d to him about his commitment to tackling climate change.\n\nIn fact, the country\u2019s failure to protect its Amazon rainforest, which is hugely important for capturing emissions, was impossible to miss as it was engulfed by recent forest fires.\n\nMr Bolsonaro defunded agencies protecting it from deforestation and his government even planned to fund construction projects across the world largest rainforest, leaked documents show.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, he blamed environmental regulations for holding back Brazil.\n\nAnd, with the Ministry of Environment\u2019s budget for tackling climate change slashed by 95 per cent, according to CAT, Brazil does not look likely to lead the fight against the global crisis anytime soon.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
