Pictured is the exterior of the school as it appeared on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme\n\nIn September, Miss Ali and her father, Arshad, 73, were found guilty of 'wilfully neglecting' safeguarding and of running an unregistered school, and were given community service and a fine.\n\nBut yesterday, a brazen Miss Ali told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she wanted to continue operating and would apply for registration.\n\n'I've been teaching for 15 years and I've seen how children need a different approach and that what we're trying to do at Ambassadors,' she said.\n\n'This is why I believe in what we're trying to do because we've seen a lot of results within our children. They're happy learners.'\n\nMiss Ali claimed her school, which charges \u00a32,500 per year, was not breaking the law because it was now open for just 18 hours a week only.\n\nIt applied for an Ofsted registration but failed an inspection because of safeguarding concerns. Despite this Miss Ali kept it open, leading to an Ofsted raid and her eventual prosecution.\n\nInspectors found she had, 'wilfully neglected to meet some basic, crucial, safeguarding responsibilities'.\n\nBrazen headteacher Nadia Ali said she wanted to continue operating and would apply for registration.\n\nSix out of 11 teachers had not had criminal record checks, nor did they have the skills to help pupils progress, the inspection found.\n\nThey also found there was 'no plan in place to actively promote fundamental British values', such as tolerance of gay people and equality for women.\n\nThere was no evidence that the disturbing books had been read by pupils, Ofsted said, but they still had no place in a place of learning.\n\nMiss Ali said the books had been donated by a mosque, and added: 'I don't believe that just by finding some books or a paragraph from a book like that makes us go against the fundamental British values... because our children and us, we've grown in British society.'", "description": "Nadia Ali, 38, defended Ambassadors High in Streatham, South London, for its 'unique' approach to learning after Ofsted inspectors identified a damning series of failings.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19846860-0-image-a-18_1571328826671.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
