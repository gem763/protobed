The celebrations will come after we come away with the trophy.\"\n\nFrance were on top at 19-10 in Oita on Sunday when Vahaamahina's moment of madness left Les Bleus a man down with more than half an hour to play.\n\nWales still left it late, taking until six minutes from the finish to edge ahead for the only time in the match when replacement forward Ross Moriarty's converted try gave them a one-point lead.\n\nRecalling the incident that eventually saw experienced South African referee Jaco Peyper show Vahaamahina a red card, Wainwright said: \"It was a maul, and he had me by the neck to start with.\n\n\"I was trying to get the referee's attention, and then the elbow came in.\n\n\"I was a bit surprised the referee didn't see it to start off with, but thankfully the television match official pulled it up and it was dealt with. We put the pressure on afterwards and saw the game through.\n\n\"I am fine at the moment. It wasn't that nice at the time.\"\n\nAs for his try, the 22-year-old said: \"The ball popped up and I can't really remember what happened apart from sprinting towards the line.\n\n\"It is a massive achievement for the team. It's great to come away with the win and look forward to the semi-final and eyes on the final as well.\"\n\nWainwright, who cuts a distinctive figure on the field thanks to a moustache, marked his try with an unusual stag impression and explained the gesture to reporters.\n\n\"I've got a sevens team back home called The Stags, so that was what the celebration was about.\n\n\"With the moustache, all my mates went to Prague on a boys' holiday and said they were going to grow moustaches.\"\n\nWainwright added: \"They said if I grew one they would crop me into the photographs just so I didn't feel like I was missing out.\n\n\"I certainly don't feel like I am missing out now, being here.\"", "description": "Wales won't be celebrating anything until they win the Rugby World Cup, rising star Aaron Wainwright says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7957/f8cd0109deb9451e9f4e65f786e8a3ec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
