Think of that vintage telephone at the General Store on Petticoat Junction. Put it next to your iPhone. That\u2019s the difference between computers and \u201cquantum computers.\u201d\n\nEvery day, it seems like there is news of yet another breakthrough in computing. Technology experts debate exactly when we will all have quantum computers instead of Echo Dots, but the day is coming.\n\nWhen they get here, they could change everything\u2014including how we defend the country. Tech guru Klon Kitchen warns, \u201cThis science is advancing sufficiently to warrant our leaders\u2019 deliberate engagement to assure that the United States will thrive in the emerging quantum future.\u201d\n\nWashington isn\u2019t ready, and it needs to be.\n\nMaybe Hollywood can\u2019t solve this problem, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to look at how movies have dealt with out-of-control computational power. At least, maybe the Capitol Hill crowd could learn what not to do.\n\nSome movies feature quantum computers as plot characters. They are uniformly awful, but Transcendence (2014) stands out. In this transcendently lame film, Johnny Depp\u2019s brain gets uploaded into a quantum computer. Who could have thought that was a good idea?\n\nHollywood does better when it takes it computers less seriously. Here is a list of films that can help us think deeply about the dark side of the new machine age.\n\nDer Golem (1915). Granted, this film came from masters of early German silent films, not Tinseltown. Also granted, there is no technology in the film. Still, this story of a rabbi who molds a terminator out of clay is one of the first and most powerful films about what happens when men and women create forces they can\u2019t control.\n\nEdison told a similar story in the first screen version of Frankenstein (1910). This theme is further explored in another early silent masterpiece, Metropolis (1927), a cautionary tale of what happens when a city gets smarter than its citizens.\n\nDesk Set (1957). This may be the first big-budget Hollywood production where a computer gets top billing. Katherine Hepburn finds herself being replaced by Spencer Tracy\u2019s mainframe. Comedy and high-jinks ensue. In the end, man, woman and machine learn to work side-by-side in the workplace.\n\nIf that was a bold prediction, it was a quarter of a century before the first Commodore 64 Computer debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Even back in the \u201850s people were saying computers would replace all of us. Today, some still think they will.\n\nOthers, however, think Desk Set got it right\u2014that rather than people being pushed aside, humans and advanced computers will complement each other. Calculators didn\u2019t replace mathematicians, they note. So Quantum won\u2019t supplant California\u2014or the rest of the country.\n\nThe Forbin Project (1970). Before there was the psycho computer \u201cHAL\u201d; before there was Sky Net; there was Charles A. Forbin. Forbin foolishly designs \u201cColossus\u201d to automate the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Unfortunately, Colossus speed dates with the Soviet system, \u201cGuardian,\u201d and together they decide to manage humanity. Please, humans, watch this movie\u2014and never, never, leave the smart computer unsupervised.\n\nTHK1128 (1971) . A director nobody ever heard of (George Lucas, who later made some other movies) and an actor nobody ever heard (Robert Duvall, who also went on to make some okay films) got together to present a frightening picture of the future: a time when technology turns society into a police state.\n\nOf course, today this is no longer science fiction. It\u2019s China, where the regime is essentially automating totalitarianism.\n\nTechnology is neutral. It doesn\u2019t have a conscience. Humans do. Human society flourishes when it fosters freedom, security, and prosperity in equal measures. Build your quantum computers to do that. Don\u2019t be China\u2014or the NBA, apparently.\n\nStar Trek (1979). This was the Enterprise crew\u2019s debut on the silver screen. The plot\u2014a computer gone mad\u2014was a rehash of a television episode. Some Star Trek movies are better than others, but they all have one thing in common with the TV series: the computers are uniformly stupid.\n\nIn Star Trek, the \u201ctreknology\u201d moves the plot along, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. After all, who would really want a faster-than-light computer without even a password to protect it? It\u2019s an open invitation to spread malware faster than light.\n\nAnd, if the Enterprise\u2019s computer is so smart, why does the captain have to give inane commands like \u201cfire the phasers.\u201d We already have weapons that can shoot by themselves. Let\u2019s be honest. Star Trek is the future of stupid.\n\nWashington would do well to pause the science fiction and turn to more serious cinema.\n\nTaming the Quantum World (2013) is a really well-done documentary explaining the development of quantum computers. It\u2019s as good a place as any to learn about the technology that will change our world.", "description": "How do you explain quantum computing?
