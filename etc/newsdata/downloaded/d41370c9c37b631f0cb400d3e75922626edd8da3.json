China has the advantage in Iraq that the northern part of the country \u2013 the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan \u2013 is already under the control of its increasingly close ally, Russia, with its corporate proxy Rosneft having secured control over Kurdistan\u2019s oil and gas infrastructure in a deal in November 2017.\n\nBridging this gap beautifully is the new development that in the long-running dispute between the south and the north regarding budget disbursements from Baghdad to Erbil in exchange for oil supplies from Erbil to Baghdad, China is to be appointed by Baghdad as its mediator in negotiations, a senior source who works closely with Iraq\u2019s Oil Ministry told OilPrice.com last week.\n\nAs it was, the negotiations between Baghdad and Erbil over the budget-for-oil deal have been going nowhere and have been in a constant state of flux ever since the original deal was struck back in 2014. This deal involved the government of the Kurdistan region of Iraq (the KRG) agreeing to export up to 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from its own fields and those in and around Kirkuk via Baghdad\u2019s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO). In return, Baghdad would send 17 percent of the federal budget after sovereign expenses per month in budget payments to the KRG. This agreement was superseded by another in October 2018 that required Baghdad to transfer sufficient funds from the budget to pay the salaries of KRG employees in exchange for the KRG handing over the export of at least 250,000 bpd of crude oil to SOMO. Since the beginning of this year, Baghdad has purportedly delivered on its side but the KRG has not.\n\nRelated: Iraq's Return To Oil's Top Table\n\nThe sticking point from the KRG side has been the changing metric that Baghdad sought to impose for determining the budget disbursement levels following the independence referendum held in Kurdistan in September 2017. Although from the legal perspective the vote was not mandatory, the overwhelming support for independence \u2013 well over 90 percent of the Kurdish population in the north \u2013 catalyzed popular support against Baghdad until it was quelled, with the help of Iran. At that point, Baghdad took back on-the-ground control over the Kirkuk and surrounding fields and only held off from further expanding its military footprint across the KRG area because the U.S. signaled that this would not be a welcome development.\n\nThe U.S. did this because it had promised that the Kurds in Iraq would be given their independence within the next two to three years as a reward for their being the West\u2019s boots on the ground in the fight against Islamic State: that was the deal. Events in the last week, however, with Trump opening the way for the annihilation of various Kurdish populations by the Turkish Army \u2013 which regards them as terrorists \u2013 have allowed Baghdad as well to take a less conciliatory tone in its dealings with Erbil.\n\nConsequently, Baghdad has withdrawn even the much worse offer that was on the table \u2013 that had already been rejected by Erbil \u2013 in favor of allowing the Chinese government, through its own corporate proxy, China National Petroleum Corporation \u2013 to act as its intermediary in these budget-for-oil deal negotiations with the KRG. The previous deal on offer was that rather than the previous 17 percent share of Baghdad\u2019s budget in exchange for a full quota of oil coming from the KRG, Baghdad would offer 12.67 percent. Baghdad said this figure was more in line with the percentage population of the KRG area in Iraq as a whole. \u201cBasically, this deal will involve the Chinese doing a deal with the Russians and bribing the Barzanis to accept whatever deal is agreed between Beijing and Moscow,\u201d said the Iraq source.\n\nFor China, given that it has temporarily had to shelve its plans for Iran due to a backlash in Tehran over various media revelations about the devil in the details \u2013 many of them exclusively appearing on OilPrice.com before they were further syndicated \u2013 regards Iraq as a worthy stand-in for the time being, both in terms of its massive oil and gas reserves and its geographical position. \u201cA deal would have had to have been done with Iraq anyway in order for China to put into place the planned Middle East section of its \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 strategy, so this problem with Iran has just meant that Beijing has had to change the order of the deals,\u201d the Iraq source told OilPrice.com.\n\nStory continues", "description": "China has refocused its attention on Iraq for its One Belt, One Road project, looking to take advantage of the Kurds weakened positioned and Russia\u2019s strength in the region", "authors": ["Simon Watkins"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
