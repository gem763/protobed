Guyger said she entered the apartment by mistake, thinking it was hers, and took Jean for an intruder.\n\nGuyger is white. Jean was black. Guyger will serve 10 years for his murder.\n\nThe witness, Joshua Brown, 28, was killed on Friday. He lived in the same apartment complex as Guyger and Jean but authorities said he was shot in a different one. Police chief U Renee Hall said on Sunday her department had no suspects.\n\nMayor Eric Johnson said on Twitter on Sunday he trusts police will conduct a thorough investigation into the killing of Brown and that people should \u201crefrain from speculation\u201d in the meantime.\n\nA Jean family attorney, Lee Merritt, posted a statement on Twitter that said he had spoken with Brown\u2019s mother and \u201cshe is devastated\u201d.\n\nBrown was a key witness at Guyger\u2019s trial. He testified that on the night of the killing, he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived, and that he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nAt times during his testimony, Brown became emotional and used his T-shirt and tissue to wipe away tears. He said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nBrown testified that he was from Jacksonville, Florida, and moved to Texas in 2008 before he left to attend the University of South Florida, where he played football from 2012 to 2013, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\n\u201cJoshua was a much loved and valued member of our football program and athletic family and his loss is felt by many whose lives he positively touched,\u201d USF said in a statement. \u201cOur hearts go out to Joshua\u2019s family, friends and loved ones during this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nLast year, Brown was shot in the foot and a 25-year-old man was killed in a shooting outside of a nightclub, the newspaper reported. Merritt told CBS News that after that shooting, Brown was concerned that someone was after him.\n\n\u201cHe was reluctant to testify in this case because he had been shot at and he thought some people might want to do harm to him,\u201d Merritt said.", "description": "Mayor says police will conduct thorough investigation into death of Joshua Brown, a key witness in Amber Guyger\u2019s murder trial", "authors": ["Associated Press In Dallas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76061854ca80c07a12f094ba286acd21704f3aae/0_213_6519_3910/master/6519.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=800dcf0b394a272fe97c972ee8effc71", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
