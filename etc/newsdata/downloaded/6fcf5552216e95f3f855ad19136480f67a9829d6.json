As we passed, the window rolled down and out came a banana peel.\n\nWithout giving it a thought, I turned toward the driver.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he said, clearly startled.\n\n\u201cYou just threw a banana peel into my living room,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt was my brother from another mother,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cPick it up,\u201d I said.\n\nHe opened the car door and stepped out. I saw that he was maybe 6-foot-3. He came around the car, bent down, picked up the peel and put it in the trash can.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and went off down Second Avenue.\n\n\u2014 Arlene Diesenhouse\n\nImage\n\nA Long Deli Line\n\nDear Diary:\n\nI lived in Brooklyn during the 1970s when I was going to college.
