And there are so many small dings on the van that if someone accidentally hits me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if it\u2019s a new dent.\n\nIn the past year or so, I\u2019ve had to fix the air conditioner and repair other parts. Now there\u2019s a grinding noise when I turn the wheel. Could be something with the power steering, my trusted mechanic told me when I called recently to describe the sound. I\u2019ll be dropping the van off soon to get that issue repaired.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the past two years, I\u2019ve spent about $3,000 on repairs. But I\u2019m okay with that. I think the van has got some more spunk and miles to go. My husband wants to replace it. I want to keep repairing it. This is the debate every time we drive the van.\n\nSo, when is the right time to break up with your old car?\n\nThis was the question brought up by a reader recently during my weekly online discussion: \u201cIs there a sweet spot that tells you when it\u2019s time to stop putting money into an old car and when to purchase a new or used one?\"\n\nHere\u2019s the backstory on this reader\u2019s clunker: \u201cMy last car payment was 16 months ago. Since then I\u2019ve only had to put in $500 in repairs (about a one-month car payment). Now the vehicle is having new issues, and repairs will cost approximately $2,500. That would be six months of payments in repairs. I\u2019m wondering if there is a point where the math finally says it\u2019s time to stop pumping money into the old car \u2014 like once I\u2019ve invested X dollars over X time this means I would be better off getting a new or used car.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is no consensus on when is the right time to cut your losses because the answer depends on so many things.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t really a \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to determine when to stop fixing your old car, because in most cases, it will usually be less expensive to repair it and keep driving it,\u201d says Ronald Montoya, senior consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com, one of my go-to websites for car reviews and pricing information.\n\nMontoya says that before you give up on your older car, consider the total cost if you decide to buy another vehicle.\n\nIn this reader\u2019s case, $2,500 in repairs is expensive. But signing up for another six years of car payments will cost even more. And, that is the average length of an auto loan these days. An increasing percentage of car buyers are opting to stretch their monthly car payments far longer than the traditional four-year auto loan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you\u2019re buying new car and taking out a loan you\u2019ll incur interest charges, taxes and perhaps a higher insurance rate. If you\u2019re borrowing for a used car the same costs applies.\n\nThe annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.8 percent as of late summer, according to data from Edmunds.\n\nIf you can nab a zero-percent-interest deal that will lower your cost of new ownership. But take heed, Edmunds\u2019s latest data shows just 6.1 percent of finance deals were zero percent.\n\nThe average loan was $32,590, financed over about six years with a monthly payment of $556 after a down payment of $3,991, according to Edmunds. The average used car loan was $22,252 after a down payment of $2,655 with an annual percentage rate of 8.5 percent. The monthly payment was $412\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou might opt to purchase a low-priced used car outright, but you still may face costly repairs. There is something to be said about the devil you know.\n\nLots of folks will make the decision to get rid of an older car just by looking at the market value of their current vehicle. For example, if the car is worth about $1,500 and a repair will cost $2,000, they\u2019re off to the dealership.\n\nAgain, as Montoya points out, replacing that car is likely to cost you significantly more than repairs on an annual basis. Besides, if you\u2019re keeping the car, its market value doesn\u2019t matter. The goal is to have a functioning car, which you can have if you repair it.\n\nAD\n\nThere are of course other reasons besides constant repairs that may have you wanting to trade up to a new or newer/used car. Maybe you want or need newer safety features.\n\nAD\n\nBut if you\u2019re not in the financial position to upgrade just yet, you need a sweet-spot rule, right?\n\nHere\u2019s my rule for when it\u2019s time to let go of a car. I call it my \u201cthree-strike rule.\u201d\n\nThe vehicle has to strand me three times in a situation that I feel unsafe or highly inconvenient \u2014 breaking down on the highway, on the way to work or to an important appointment.\n\nStrand me three times without any warning of an issue, and I\u2019m kicking the car to the curb. That\u2019s my sweet spot. I can\u2019t handle the stress of repeatedly being stranded or wondering if the car will start as I\u2019m heading somewhere.\n\nAD\n\nThe key to this rule is being able to plan repairs. When I detect a problem, I call my mechanic and get the repair taken care of as soon as possible. This of course means having a car repair cash cushion, which I do and so should you. And here\u2019s how.\n\nAD\n\nOnce you finish paying off your auto loan, don\u2019t incorporate that money back into your budget. Take that monthly payment and stash it into a savings account. You can then use that money for repairs or eventually to pay cash for your next car \u2014 in 10 or 15 years.\n\nIf you\u2019re keeping an older car be sure to have a mechanic check it out regularly, which you can do when getting an oil change. You\u2019ll save more money by catching mechanical problems early. Don\u2019t ignore warning lights.\n\nAD\n\nSo far, my van has stranded me only once, although it was a most inopportune time. It was last year, and I was moving my youngest child into her freshman dorm about 50 miles from our home. Thank goodness, my nephew had driven along to help unload her things. I had a ride home. I just had the van towed to my mechanic.\n\nBut, that\u2019s strike one. Two to go.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the repairs start to become more frequent and the costs are hard to keep up with, or if the car leaves you stranded often, making you late to work or putting you in a potentially dangerous situation, you might want to consider another vehicle,\u201d Montoya said.\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nWhat\u2019s your rule for when it\u2019s time to replace your old car?

The sale of a product is typically involved but is merely secondary to the recruitment of new participants.\n\nRead:\n\nLast week, I asked: What\u2019s been your experience with a multilevel marketing business?\n\nKelli Denard of Chicago wrote, \u201cI was part of a MLM. It wasn\u2019t expensive to get in, but they pressured you to attend \u2018conventions,\u2019 which were nothing more than the top earners parading onstage. They pushed variable life insurance as a way to invest, using high-fee investment products. Most appalling to me was the push for people to persuade their friends and family to convert their existing mortgages to an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) or for new home buyers to get an ARM instead of a fixed rate to use the \u2018extra\u2019 money for investing. I went to the training, listened to the sales pitch and concluded that there was no way I would even consider pitching that bad idea to anyone. That was in the 2000s and then the housing crisis came so my instincts were right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am involved in an MLM company,\u201d wrote Ken Sparks of Jasper, Ind. \u201cIt has been some work, but it also has been a way to make some extra cash. Our products are fantastic, they do actually sell themselves.\u201d\n\nJoanna Allison from Newberg, Ore., was involved in network marketing. It didn\u2019t go well for her. \u201cI had signed up at one point only to find out there is a $40 a month fee just to keep my \u2018business website\u2019 up and running which I did not know about. MLMs have left a sour taste in my mouth and all seem like pyramid schemes because the more people you recruit, the more you make! At least this is what they say. They also want you to buy and sell their product as well as recruit, recruit, recruit.\u201d\n\nSharon from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve been part of network marketing for about three years and quite honestly I wonder what kept me from doing it for so long. The people on my team are some of the most genuine and supportive that I\u2019ve ever met. To be honest, I\u2019m not even any good at it but my business is still profitable. Some companies are probably unscrupulous but for the company I\u2019m with I\u2019ve NEVER felt pressured to spend money when I don\u2019t want to. My company doesn\u2019t promise fortune and fame either.\u201d\n\nColor of Money Columns This Week\n\nKnowledge isn\u2019t power.\n\nThe right knowledge is power.
