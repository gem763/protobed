Being a proud plant parent is very much in, and I'm very much here for it (except I could use a little help with my bird's nest fern, tbh).\n\n\n\nWhether your BFF is botany-obsessed or mom is already gearing up for spring gardening, odds are, you have at least one green thumber in your life. And when their windowsills are already stocked with succulents, choosing the perfect present for a plant lover can feel a little thorny.\n\nBut that's no reason to stop beleafin' (sorry, had to!).
