Slider Is The Most Influential Musician Of Our Generation", "language": "en", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9? Radiohead? Taylor Swift? Daft Punk? All great musicians, yes, but not quite the single greatest musician of our generation. That honour is reserved for someone so great he verges on fictitious: K.K. Slider.\n\nIn a way, it feels blasphemous to claim that the greatest musician of our generation is someone who doesn\u2019t even hail from a music-focused game. It\u2019s not Celes in Final Fantasy VI. It\u2019s not Junebug in Kentucky Route Zero. It\u2019s not the beanie-clad title character from PaRappa the Rapper. It\u2019s certainly not The Beatles in Rock Band, because that would just be cheating, not to mention a misreading of \u201cour generation\u201d as r/lewronggeneration.\n\nAnd yet, declaring K.K. Slider \u2014 the roaming black-and-white dog who\u2019s always playing guitar in Animal Crossing \u2014 as the standout artist among a sea of video game icons only seems natural. After all, it\u2019s K.K. whose talent and influence continue to increase over the years, all without an air of pretension or presumption.\n\nEven in the non-video game world, a title like \u201cThe Most Influential Musician\u201d comes with constant debate. Is popularity based on the size of a fanbase, or the longevity of a following? Is talent decided by album streams or records sold? Is it determined by the number of instruments played or an expansive vocal range? Often times, the most logical way to measure a musician\u2019s status is by examining their musical skills and their influence on a fanbase. K.K. Slider just happens to excel at both of these.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, K.K. Slider is a large-headed dog with white fur, floppy ears, and massively large eyebrows that pre-date the ongoing thick brow trend. He plays a six-string acoustic guitar, the model of which certainly looks like a Gibson. Many believe he\u2019s a Jack Russell.\n\nNo matter which of the four main Animal Crossing games you play, K.K. is there, ready to play music for passersby and fans alike. In the original Animal Crossing, he can be found by the train station after 8pm on Saturday nights, sitting on top of a suitcase with his guitar in hand.\n\nLater, in Wild World and City Folk, he\u2019s onstage at The Roost cafe, chilling on a tiny wooden stool. In New Leaf, he works at Club LOL as a DJ each night except for Saturdays, when he performs onstage atop a miniature chair beneath disco ball lights. Even in spinoff game Pocket Camp, K.K. can easily be lured to your campsite if you build his modest chair. The reward? He\u2019ll play you his music, and oh what a reward that is.\n\nWhen approached, K.K. Slider will ask if you want to hear anything. Now\u2019s your chance to request a song if you\u2019re already familiar with his catalogue. If not, let him choose, as he usually can\u2019t steer you wrong. Do take the time to hear him out, though. K.K. talks like a hippie, all positive sayings and mellow wording, and some of his quotes are as comical as they are, dare we say, profound. As a wise pup once told me, \u201cNothing shredded, nothing gained.\u201d\n\nBest of all, he offers you a copy of his songs to keep, free of charge, after you listen. It\u2019s not a social commentary on supporting music piracy, as some players hoped, but it is an anti-capitalist act that K.K. insists upon for the first three games. A beloved artist giving away their music for free? Hey, that sounds like what famous bands do in the real world.\n\nNo matter which era of Animal Crossing introduced you to K.K. Slider, he\u2019s the musician who taught you about a new genre of music. There\u2019s no denying the dog\u2019s got range. He goes beyond the usual crowd-pleasers of rock, folk, rap, jazz, and country \u2014 though he does play all five of those.\n\nIn addition, K.K. whips out songs in the style of bossa nova, metal, flamenco, reggae, and bubblegum pop. He\u2019s done ragtime, disco, and soul. Are you feeling a lullaby or waltz? He\u2019s got you covered. Trying to dance to something more upbeat? Let him hit you with a ska or calypso jam.\n\nFrom the first Animal Crossing game to New Leaf, K.K. Slider\u2019s body of original work has grown from 55 songs to 91 songs. That\u2019s about nine albums\u2019 worth of material. You name it, K.K. has probably written a song in that subgenre. He\u2019s a man of the people, learning every genre for every person \u2014 or at least it feels that way. And to top it off, his delivery is continually charming, using vowel-heavy sounds to get across his thoughts, occasionally adding a hiccup-like grunt or a high-pitched howl.\n\nThe background music of Animal Crossing became popular on its own for its relaxing effect, and there\u2019s even a Google Chrome browser extension to cue up its hourly songs for that reason. But where the game\u2019s score became a cue to help players focus, K.K. Slider\u2019s music became an opportunity to both have fun and discover new musical styles. An artist with genre range like him is easy to fall in love with.\n\nThat explains why fans have taken it upon themselves to archive every aspect of K.K.\u2019s work. After all, he\u2019s a vagabond of sorts and doesn\u2019t have time to do it himself. The Animal Crossing Wikipedia catalogues every original song he\u2019s recorded.\n\nSongs that never made it into gameplay, like \u201cK.K. House,\u201d a dance club bonus track on the official City Folk soundtrack CD, have been uploaded by fans to YouTube. Someone even created a K.K. Slider concert, stringing together an hour\u2019s worth of material and turning up the reverb to give the songs the effect of bouncing around an open venue.\n\nThe discreetness with which K.K. discusses his private life, if indeed he discusses it at all, only increases his allure. Like other celebrities who avoid the spotlight, like Beyonc\u00e9 or Frank Ocean, K.K. knows it\u2019s more important to push boundaries with his music than to flaunt his social life on the regular, or to even be spotted at all.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why K.K. can\u2019t be found at just any time of day in Animal Crossing, or why so little is known about him. He\u2019s comfortable keeping the attention off of himself, going so far as to eventually acknowledge his birthday but never actually celebrate it. (Classic Virgo.)\n\nBy now, it\u2019s time to zoom out of the game itself to refocus on Kazumi Totaka, the human behind K.K.\u2019s magic. Totaka is the real-life composer who has penned countless Nintendo tunes, from Mario Paint to Wii Sports, and is the sound director of Animal Crossing. When it came time to name K.K. Slider in the original Japanese version, the game\u2019s designers riffed off Totaka\u2019s name and dubbed the dog Totakeke.\n\nThere\u2019s no easily accessible footage of Totaka playing K.K. songs live, save for that middle-of-the-woods moment announcing Pocket Camp.\n\nHe did lean into the idea that K.K. is an animal caricature of himself at the 2003 Mario & Zelda Big Band Live concert, though. When the host picked up a guitar for Totaka to play, fans in the audience yelled out, \u201cTotakeke!\u201d Laughing, Totaka sat on a chair, crossed his legs in the style of K.K., and briefly posed.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why K.K. Slider was based off Totaka. At his best, K.K. Slider is a true virtuoso without the usual ego that comes with the title. At his worst, K.K. Slider is the everyman musician, a guy who will happily play you a song on acoustic guitar but is content playing to nobody all the same. Perhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy for players to see themselves in K.K.\u2019s shoes\u2026 er, paws. If he can try out different music genres with ease, then why can\u2019t you?\n\nThis leads us to the nonstop influence K.K. has had over serious musicians and wannabe students. It begins the way most music lessons do: playing cover songs, furthering your understanding of an instrument by learning to play another musician\u2019s work. Pull up YouTube and it\u2019s easy to find various fans covering Slider\u2019s repertoire with solos.\n\nSome attempts are genuinely impressive. Others struggle. No matter what, they\u2019re having fun \u2014 and likely trying their hand at an instrument they wouldn\u2019t otherwise play, at least not often.\n\nThen come the full-on jazz band covers. Instead of looking up tabs for guitar, you have to transpose the original song and arrange a version that works for each instrument in the band. Every time I stumble across one of these, I can\u2019t help but think about how many strangers would ask the name of the song if they heard it at a jazz club.\n\nFrom there, K.K. Slider\u2019s influence quadruples in size by way of cover songs in the style of K.K. Slider. For over a decade, fans have been studying K.K.\u2019s catalogue and expanding it to include every corner of the popular canon. Using the tones of his iconic instrumentation and his individualistic singing style, a slew of musicians have turned K.K. Slider into an artist who\u2019s cataloguing every hit, good or bad, from this century.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s hard to pick a favourite because of how many artists he\u2019s covered: Daft Punk, A-Ha, Outkast, Smash Mouth, Nine Inch Nails, Drake, Mac DeMarco, Lady Gaga, Animal Collective, Radiohead, Ice Cube, Anamanaguchi, Gorillaz, Coldplay, ABBA, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Dragonforce, Toto, The Killers, and, of course, Rick Astley.\n\nOne fan has gone full video game inception specifically, covering the Buck Bumble theme, Undertale hit \u201cMegalovania,\u201d Castlevania jam \u201cCastle Killer,\u201d that haunting Doki Doki Literature Club song, Portal\u2019s \u201cStill Alive,\u201d and the Super Mario Bros. 2 theme. It\u2019s all perfectly replicated in K.K. made-up language, too, even though it\u2019s often hard to decipher. (Now\u2019s the time to slam that closed captioning button, folks.)\n\nWhen one K.K. Slider cover song appears, requests flood in for more. From there, some users find themselves essentially ghostwriting songs for K.K. on the regular, like Clay Kramer, the creator behind those Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish covers. Kramer grew up playing piano and guitar as a kid, and now he regularly creates K.K. cover songs as a way to have fun while keeping his skills sharp. He told Kotaku it takes between two and eight hours to create a cover from scratch.\n\n\u201cK.K. Slider\u2019s limited ability to express in tone forced the developers to experiment with pitch to make interesting enough music, and in turn it made him a fun character,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cHis vocal samples can be found pretty easily online because someone ripped them from the GameCube Animal Crossing a long time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis voice samples are easy to use,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cI like to take it a step further though by minimising sample delay, utilising pitch bends and vibrato like a real voice, and even mimicking vocal effects you hear in the original song.\u201d Kramer said that the positive feedback he gets from Animal Crossing fans is the \u201cmost rewarding part\u201d of creating K.K. Slider-style music. \u201cIt\u2019s just endless positivity and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nFor others, an offhand creation can blow up to the point of becoming a profitable piece of work. Nic Silvestri, the lo-fi beatmaker behind Soundcloud account Overspace, found fame this January when he uploaded a short snippet of a cover of Travis Scott\u2019s massive hit \u201cSicko Mode,\u201d with K.K. singing the part of both Scott and Drake, including the latter\u2019s apathetic grunts.\n\nAfter it blew up, garnering over 90,000 retweets, Silvestri decided to cover the song in its entirety, which took a whole day to complete \u2014 in addition to the original day it took him to make the first version. Shortly afterward, DJ Cutman of the record label Gamechops reached out to see if he was interested in signing the cover to his label. Silvestri said yes. They uploaded the full version to YouTube, and it quickly racked up over a million views.\n\nSilvestri later went on to create a K.K. Slider cover of \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d which even got original artist Lil Nas X\u2019s approval in the comments. The process is so intense, though, that he\u2019s currently taking a break. \u201cThe recreation of the instrumental using only Animal Crossing sounds is always an extremely fun yet challenging process, but the vocals are a bit less enjoyable,\u201d he told Kotaku.\n\n\u201cSince each of K.K. Slider\u2019s phrases sit in a different sampler, the process of laying out vocals for an entire song is very intricate and time consuming,\u201d he said. \u201cThere definitely is a different skill requirement, but I think that anyone familiar with music software and the Animal Crossing franchise would be able to do a fine job making their own cover.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think that breaking down a popular song in any way helps you to understand songwriting better,\u201d Silvestri said. \u201cIt really helps you pick up on the little things, and can also make you realise that sometimes simplicity does the job best.\u201d\n\nWhen people who grew up playing musical instruments acknowledge the difficulty of perfectly mirroring popular songs in the style of K.K. Slider, it relieves some of the pressure from those who didn\u2019t.\n\nIt serves as a reminder that making music is fun, but it\u2019s time consuming, and finding the needed patience can feel stressful. That\u2019s why Silvestri and others have extended a helping hand by making tutorials. It\u2019s a way to keep the creative community growing, and to act as a mentor when you can\u2019t be there in person to help.\n\nIf a musician\u2019s goal is to make music that gets stuck in your head, then K.K. Slider already won. But the Animal Crossing icon takes his role a step further by exploring overlooked music genres, giving his music away for free, putting on regular concerts, and influencing fans to further (or even begin) their songwriting education. He\u2019s a cartoon dog that has done it all, and, with some fan assistance, continues to conquer every corner of the music industry.\n\nHe won\u2019t brag about it. Neither will Kazumi Totaka. It takes a swarm of fans, armed with Animal Crossing samples and Garageband or Pro Tools, to break down K.K.\u2019s talent and put his influence on prominent display online. He\u2019s truly the artist that best soundtracks and represents our generation.\n\nEven without all of this evidence, his status as a musical icon is already cemented in trophy form anyway in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Look closely at his trophy and you will find an inscription intended to go down in history. \u201cHis music is so ingrained in the villagers,\u201d it reads, \u201cthat it\u2019s impossible to imagine them living without it.\u201d\n\nWe stan a legend, and so do they.\n\nNina Corcoran is the music editor of Boston\u2019s alt-weekly.
