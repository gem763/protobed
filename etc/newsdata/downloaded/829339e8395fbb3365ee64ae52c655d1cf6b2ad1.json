Inside, it is marked with Tecchler\u2019s name. Morris reported it to lost luggage and police, but no one had handed it in.\n\nHe said British Transport Police told him they would look through CCTV footage from the journey to see if they could spot anyone leaving the train with the violin.\n\nMorris has led a number of UK orchestras and performed as a soloist alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and as guest soloist director with the Scottish Ensemble and Locrian Ensemble.\n\nAs a session musician, he has recorded with James Brown, Stevie Wonder, David Gilmour and U2. Losing the violin \u201cis like having my arm cut off\u201d, he told BBC News.", "description": "Stephen Morris forgot to pick up \u00a3250,000 Tecchler violin when he got off train in London", "authors": ["Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d2ae1c487cd56144d4df80ca9b4d713cd91f9a8/0_444_4721_2832/master/4721.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89b2725b7ef3cf57ed61a052dab807bd", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
