He underwent surgery to treat a blocked artery, having two stents inserted to prop open the artery.\n\nWithin hours, his campaign said Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, was conversing and in good spirits, and on Thursday his wife said he would participate in the fourth Democratic debate on Oct. 15.\n\nBut on Friday after Sanders left the hospital, his treating physicians cast the events in a more serious light.\n\n\u201cAfter presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction,\u201d Arturo Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj said in a statement, using a medical term for a heart attack.\n\nThe two doctors said \u201call other arteries\u201d were normal for Sanders, and that he was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.\n\nTheir statement, circulated by Sanders\u2019 campaign, could raise new questions about Sanders\u2019 age and health as he seeks the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSanders has been among the top contenders in a crowded Democratic presidential race and on Friday he said was ready to return to work.\n\n\u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great,\u201d Sanders said in a statement that his campaign circulated together with the comments from his doctors. \u201cAfter taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work.\u201d\n\nSanders is the oldest candidate in a race featuring a generational divide between older contenders such as Sanders and front-runner Joe Biden, 76, and younger ones such as Pete Buttigieg, 37, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
