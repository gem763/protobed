Of these, almost a quarter (24 per cent) were from black, Asian and minority ethnic BAME) backgrounds.\n\nMinisters have now launched a \u00a3650,000 adoption recruitment drive aimed specifically at encouraging BAME families to adopt children.\n\nGavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: \u201cIn recent years, the trend that concerns us all is the disparity between numbers of children awaiting adoption and adoptive families ready to take them. This is a trend that must change and I want to do everything I can to help you do that.\n\n\u201cOur adoption support fund which was set up in 2015, has provided a range of therapeutic support for nearly 50,000 children who have been through traumatic times before adoption.\u201d\n\nHe also pledged to continue funding the Adoption Support Fund, which gives families therapeutic support for overcoming past trauma, until 2021.\n\nResearch published earlier this year by the charity Adoption UK found that around half of parents adopt because of fertility issues as increasing numbers of people want to support children who have \u201chad a tough start\u201d.\n\nThousands of parents were asked what motivated them to adopt, and increasing numbers were \u201cstrongly motivated to support a child who has had a tough start\u201d.\n\nAround three-quarters of children who are adopted from care in the UK will have been removed from their parents because of abuse or neglect.", "description": "Adoption agencies are to target black churches and mosques in a bid to find homes for hard to place children, the Government has announced.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Philip Johnston"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000212393739-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
