The company has more than a dozen bonds outstanding and about $1.65 billion changed hands Monday.\n\nThe utility's stock dropped another 24% Monday, bringing its total decline to about 50% over the past week.\n\nThe larger the damage claims against the company, the less value will be available to distribute between bondholders and shareholders when the company comes out of bankruptcy court protection.\n\nA trio of hedge funds -- Abrams Capital Management LP, Knighthead Capital Management LLC and Redwood Capital Management LLC -- own a large stake in PG&E stock. Funds that own PG&E bonds include Elliott Management Corp., Apollo Global Management LLC and Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\nInvestors are concerned because PG&E would be mostly responsible for wildfire claims that arise before it emerges from bankruptcy. Payment for postbankruptcy claims could be shared through a statewide wildfire fund that is being set up to help shore up the finances of Californian utilities.\n\nWrite to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
