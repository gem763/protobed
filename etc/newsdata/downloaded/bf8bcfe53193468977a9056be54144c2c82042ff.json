A Wong Tai Sin MTR exit was flooded with water from a damaged fire hydrant.\n\nRampaging protesters also threw petrol bombs at the gate of the New Territories South regional police headquarters in Tai Wo Hau.\n\nThe chaos prompted the MTR to shut down Po Lam and Hang Hau stations at 11.30pm to ensure the safety of passengers and staff. At midnight, Tai Wai, Che Kung Temple and City One stations were closed early.\n\nAnti-government anthem Glory to Hong Kong removed from Spotify\n\nIn the vicinity of Tai Wai MTR station, police raised a black flag twice \u2013 on either side of midnight \u2013 warning of the use of tear gas following a confrontation. The crowd, mostly locals, had objected to the presence of about 100 riot police. A man was arrested in the chaos.\n\nAs police began making their exit in several vehicles at 12.15am, some in the crowd threw large objects including rubbish bins at them. Officers jumped out and fired two sponge grenades at the crowd, without raising a warning flag. They left soon after.\n\nThree fire services officers\u2019 associations issued a joint statement to condemn protesters\u2019 recent criminal actions, which they complained had slowed down emergency operations and jeopardised public safety.\n\nProtestors throw petrol bombs at New Territories south regional police headquarters.

The remaining two live rounds were fired \u2013 but aimed skywards \u2013 in Yau Ma Tei.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung insisted that the officer who shot Tsang had made the right decision as his own life as well as those of his colleagues were threatened.\n\nTsang\u2019s lawyer, Ng Gene-bond, said: \u201cMy client has undergone surgery and is now still receiving treatment in the intensive care unit. At the moment his life is not in danger in hospital.\u201d", "description": "MTR stations and mainland Chinese-linked businesses were targeted during another night of violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/881ca9da-e524-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires082704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
