Thousands of women in Washington, D.C., and in cities across the U.S. and world, used the day to advocate for human rights and women's issues, which protesters argued would face adversity under the new administration.", "description": "The Women's March is trying to rid itself of what critics have called an anti-Semitism problem.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
