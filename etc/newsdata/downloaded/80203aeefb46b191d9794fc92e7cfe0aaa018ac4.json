Matt Gaetz: Trump crackdown on illegal immigration succeeding \u2013 America benefits", "language": "en", "text": "The Border Patrol arrest numbers for August show that while the illegal immigration crisis persists, there can be no dispute that the strategy of President Trump and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is working.\n\nAugust at America\u2019s southern border is usually hot and dry, with two notable exceptions: hurricanes and a flood of people entering America illegally. Now the flood has finally begun to recede.\n\nUnder McAleenan\u2019s watch, Border Patrol officers carried out 64,000 apprehensions in August \u2013 a whopping 56 percent decline from May\u2019s 133,000 apprehensions, and down from July\u2019s 72,000. Equally notable is the fact that this is the first time in five years that border apprehensions have decreased during summer months.\n\nBRANDON JUDD: TRUMP KEEPS WINNING ON IMMIGRATION \u2013 AGAINST ALL ODDS. SUPREME COURT DECISION IS VICTORY FOR ALL\n\nIt is comforting to see the Trump administration animated with a bold plan to secure our border and protect our nation.\n\nFirst, more than 60 miles of wall have been built on the most vulnerable parts of our border, with 500 more miles projected for construction by the end of 2020. The number of apprehensions has dropped because every mile of wall makes it harder and harder to get into America illegally.\n\nSecond, thanks to President Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs, Mexico has converted from a turnstile for human traffickers into a security partner. Mexico has agreed to expand migrant protection laws, which allow asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their cases progress.\n\nThanks to President Trump\u2019s leadership \u2013 and despite Democrats\u2019 absolute unwillingness to help \u2013 the crisis at our border is slowly lessening.\n\nOver 40,000 asylum seekers are now waiting in Mexico, which means they haven\u2019t been released into our country. Mexico has made nearly 134,000 apprehensions of illegal immigrants in its own country since agreeing to work with the United States, and this has helped reduce stress on our own border facilities. Mexico has listened to the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and is even building a wall.\n\nThird, the Trump administration has led unprecedented engagement with the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. McAleenan personally secured commitments from these nations to do more and do better. They are finally making clear to their citizens that entering America is not the guaranteed \u201cgolden ticket\u201d that it was only a few short years ago.\n\nFourth, McAleenan announced last month a new rule on the Flores Settlement Agreement. His rule will help to keep families together, and increase the standards of care for unaccompanied minors. Most importantly, the new rule will end the decades-old policy of \u201ccatch and release,\u201d which has allowed countless illegal entrants to stay in the United States permanently, and which makes a mockery of our immigration laws.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen heartbreaking pictures of children in squalid, overcrowded conditions \u2013 especially during the Obama administration. Thanks to the Trump-McAleenan strategy, conditions at border facilities are rapidly improving.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFinally, more than 1,000 Border Patrol officers have been hired and they are stationed at America\u2019s legal ports of entry. The brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection have answered the call to protect our great nation and uphold our country\u2019s laws.\n\nWhen I went to the border in April the scene was sobering. Our detention facilities were overcrowded and our Border Patrol agents were overworked to the point of exhaustion.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has taken significant steps to keep families together, to reduce the wait time in holding centers to an average of 19 hours, and to deploy cutting-edge technology to monitor the most vulnerable sections of our border.\n\nThanks to President Trump\u2019s leadership \u2013 and despite Democrats\u2019 absolute unwillingness to help \u2013 the crisis at our border is slowly lessening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCongress isn\u2019t off the hook. We must reform asylum laws, pass E-verify, ban sanctuary cities and build more border wall. America deserves bipartisan cooperation to get it done.\n\nPast administrations neglected their constitutional duty, refusing to uphold and enforce our nation\u2019s laws. President Trump is different. He is taking bold, decisive actions to keep America safe and secure \u2013 and the numbers prove that his strategy is working!\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.
