Units in the building are selling from $1.7 million up to a combo unit in contract for $20 million, a record-breaking price for Brooklyn.\n\nFaster, stronger and more efficient elevator systems are a critical prerequisite to the ongoing boom in sky-high luxury residential towers from New York to Dubai.\n\nIn only a few years, top elevator speeds in Manhattan\u2019s tallest condominiums have doubled from around 16 feet per second at supertall 432 Park Avenue to around 33 feet per second at the 1,550-foot-tall Central Park Tower, according to data from the Chicago-based Center for Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. (For context, the elevators that lug hoards of tourists up to the top of the Empire State Building each day top out at around 16 feet per second.)\n\nSuch innovations allow residents at the 60-story Porsche Design Tower in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, to bypass human interaction altogether. Condo owners drive directly into an elevator that delivers them to their condo-side garage in a matter of seconds -- no small talk necessary.\n\nA similar car lift system is on track at a lavish 30-story apartment tower in Dubai\u2019s new Aykon City mega development, which plans to deliver the luxury riverfront units by 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s no need to hold the lift for neighbors at 56 Leonard Street, otherwise known as the Jenga tower, in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood. A destination-dispatch system, more common in bustling office buildings, must assign passengers to one of seven elevators before they get in, giving residents efficient and more private service, said a spokeswoman for the building.\n\nAffluent apartment owners have long tried to control the inevitable nuisance of shared elevators. One of New York City\u2019s most exclusive buildings, 15 Central Park West, reportedly relegates tenants carrying things like bulky suitcases, bicycles and skateboards to a specified elevator, according to a tenant lease The Real Deal saw in 2013.\n\nThough the desire for a quick and quiet ride is not new, there are far more options today than a decade ago for those for whom privacy is a priority. In New York City, the number of homes for sale that mentioned private elevator access nearly doubled from 608 in all of 2010 to 1,050 in 2018, according to data provided by listing site StreetEasy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the space that you wind up waiting in, and if you\u2019re not a very forward individual, you could feel very uncomfortable,\u201d said architect John Cetra, whose firm CetraRuddy has designed a number of luxury condo projects in Manhattan, including One Madison and Walker Tower. \u201cAs architects, we think a lot about it.\u201d\n\nDesigners have traditionally helped mitigate the discomfort with soft lighting, warm finishes and even placing air vents to shephard cool and warm air by the elevator bank, Mr. Cetra said. But some of the most exclusive buildings go a step further.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nResidents at celebrity-magnet 443 Greenwich Street, a converted factory in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood where the likes of Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lawrence and Rebel Wilson own homes, ride peacefully in elevators that open directly into all of the 53 units and are programmed to travel nonstop.\n\nMost residents there share an elevator with only five other condos - -a far cry from the old rule of thumb to install one elevator for every 100 units, said Mr. Cetra, whose firm designed the building\u2019s condo conversion. The high elevator-to-unit ratio is part of what makes 443 Greenwich so attractive to the papparazzi-prone.\n\n\u201cPart of the appeal was this exclusive use of an elevator or very limited use,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re very security conscious, you could drive into the garage and take an elevator straight to your condo without anybody seeing you or having to use the sidewalk.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MANSION GLOBAL", "description": "Whether it\u2019s a car lift that hoists a resident (in her Porsche) directly to the penthouse or non-stop technology that bypasses other units, buildings are giving the ultra-wealthy more ways to ride in privacy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/im-99379.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
