Andrew Smith, from Campaign Against the Arms Trade, said \u201cDSEI simply could not happen on this scale without the political support from ministers.\n\n\u201cEstimates we have seen suggest 50,000 UK jobs are dependent on arms exports, representing about 0.2% of the British workforce\u201d. Last year, British arms sales rose to a record \u00a314bn \u2013 with 80% of exports going to the Middle East, the Gulf nations who represent the most important buyers at the event.\n\nA British Royal Navy frigate, the HMS Argyll, will dock by the Excel centre, where a demonstration of \u201cautonomous naval drones\u201d is planned on Tuesday, while the Royal Air Force intends to showcase the latest prototype Tempest stealth aircraft, part of a \u00a32bn development programme for an aircraft not expected to enter service before 2035.\n\nWallace may also make a long awaited announcement as to who has won the \u00a31.25bn contract to build the Type 31e frigates, with a consortium led by one British firm Babcock, owner of the Rosyth dockyard, the favourite to see off rival bids from BAE Systems and Germany\u2019s Atlas Elektronik.\n\nDSEI weapons fair: authoritarian regimes descend on London Read more\n\nA total of 32 Israeli companies are amongst the international exhibitors, including Elbit Systems, whose portfolio includes systems for military aircraft, drones, armed remote control boats, and land vehicles.\n\nThe event\u2019s promotion brochure describes Elbit\u2019s technology as \u201cbattle-proven\u201d; also on sale are its Skylark and Hermes drone systems, which it has previously described as \u201cthe backbone of the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF\u2019s) UAS [Unmanned Aerial Systems] force.\u201d\n\nEight of the military delegations invited are from what the UK Foreign Officeclassifies as \u201chuman rights priority countries\u201d. They include Saudi Arabia and Israel, but also Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Earlier this week it emerged a Hong Kong delegation was no longer planning to attend.\n\nOrganisers Clarion Events have been restricting access of human rights groups \u2013 and some journalists. Amnesty International was refused permission to visit on Friday, following a meeting with Clarion, although the company said it ensured all goods exhibited complied with UK law.\n\nStaffers at human rights groups had hoped to monitor the exhibition stands to see if they complied with international humanitarian law. Two companies were thrown out in 2013 after it emerged they were illegally marketing shackles and electric shock weapons, and following the intervention of Green MP Caroline Lucas.\n\nAmnesty also released a report to coincide with the event, accusing the buoyant arms industry of \u201coutsourcing responsibility\u201d for human rights violations, by allowing governments to decide for them whether to permit arms sales.\n\nThe campaign group had asked 22 major international arms exporters what human rights due diligence they independently conducted, but only eight replied.\n\nOne of those that did was BAE Systems, Britain\u2019s biggest arms maker and a major supplier of military aircraft to Saudi Arabia, which is embroiled in the Yemen civil war. Scores of civilians have been killed in air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition \u2013 and UK arms exports to the country were ruled illegal by the court of appeal in June because the British government had not properly assessed if military targeting was compliant with international law.\n\nWhen BAE was asked by Amnesty whether it had conducted any human rights due diligence of its own relating to the Saudi Arabia, the company said its activities there were \u201csubject to UK government approval and oversight\u201d.\n\nPatrick Wilcken, Arms Control Researcher at Amnesty International, said: \u201cDefence giants are washing their hands of their responsibilities by arguing that, once their goods are shipped, they no longer have any control over how they are used. This argument doesn\u2019t stand up, legally or ethically.\u201d", "description": "At least 116 demonstrators have been arrested ahead of controversial trade show", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d572bb6c77bda9be31727e20aa72274cfc0f8a75/0_2_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dec8ce8afe5172ee7fef5b100300ddb3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
