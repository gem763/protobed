REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n\nThe International Monetary Fund approved a $6 billion loan package for Pakistan in July but warned that it would require ambitious fiscal measures and a sustained commitment to mobilise tax revenue to ensure funds for development while reducing debt.\n\nThe two-day strike is the second since July called by business groups after negotiations with government on efforts to enforce the paying of sales tax and catching tax dodgers.\n\n\u201cThis taxation system ... will bring death,\u201d Atiq Mir, president of the All Karachi Traders Alliance, which represents markets in Pakistan\u2019s biggest city, told Reuters.\n\nAll major wholesale markets in the commercial hub were closed along with most shopping centres.\n\nTraders holding banners and chanting slogans against the government held protests in cities across the country.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Imran Khan has made getting the economy back on track its main priority.\n\nThe fiscal deficit has ballooned to about 7 percent of gross domestic product and a balance of payments crisis is looming.\n\nPakistan has long suffered from a weak tax base, with only about 1 percent of its 208 million population filing income tax returns and major industrial sectors dominated by powerful lobbies paying little or no tax.\n\nThe agricultural sector, for example, dominated by politically powerful landowners, makes up about 20% of the economy but accounts for only 0.22% of direct taxes, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe general secretary of the All Pakistan Association of Traders, based in the eastern city of Lahore, said the government risked enraging voters.\n\n\u201cThis government has increased inflation, it has raised discount rates ... it has made the life of the common man miserable because of its economic policies,\u201d Naeem Mir said.\n\nAmong new measures angering traders is a rule requiring anyone buying items worth 50,000 rupees ($315) or more to produce identity papers, a measure aimed at helping authorities track tax evaders.\n\nNaeem Mir said traders had called for the amount to be raised to 100,000 rupees but the government has not responded.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t they listen to us? We\u2019ll protest, protest and protest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe future of the trading community and their children is at stake.\u201d", "description": "Markets and many businesses closed across Pakistan on Tuesday for a strike to protest against government measures aimed at meeting IMF demands to boost tax revenues to bolster depleted public finances.", "authors": ["Syed Raza Hassan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446185496&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S105", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
