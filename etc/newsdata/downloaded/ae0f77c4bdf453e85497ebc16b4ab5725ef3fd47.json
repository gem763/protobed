Poop?\n\nIn Japan , a new pop-up museum is encouraging travelers to get over their self-consciousness about \"unko\" (that would be \"poop\" in English).\n\nThe Unko Museum is located in Yokohama, in Kanagawa prefecture, about 40 km (25 miles) south of Tokyo\n\nDrowned baby mice, bull penis and maggot cheese are just a few of the treats at Sweden's new Disgusting Food Museum ... and there's tasting involved!\n\n\"We believe that setting poo as entertainment, not a museum, is the first in the world,\" a representative for the Unko Museum tells CNN Travel.\n\n\"There is no dirty brown poop in Unko Museum. It's all colorful, cute and pop design poop.\"\n\nVisitors to the museum, which will be open through early August, can sit on brightly colored fake toilets, draw artistic representations of what their bowel movements look like, yell the word \"unko\" into a microphone, play in a ball pit full of stuffed poops and take selfies in front of pastel-colored stuffed excrement toys.\n\nThey are, of course, encouraged to share their experience on social media.\n\nSo far, nearly 10,000 people have visited the museum in its first week alone. And that's no load of crap.\n\nTickets cost \u00a51,760 (about $16) for adults and \u00a5990 (about $9) for children.\n\nVisitors to the Unko Museum can learn how to say \"poop\" in a variety of languages. Kim Kyung-hoon/Reuters\n\nPop-up museums with major social media appeal have become a huge trend in the last few years, dovetailing with the rise of Instagram.\n\nThe Disgusting Food Museum , which began as a pop-up in Sweden in 2018, has since gone on the road to Los Angeles. The combination of gross-out appeal and the opportunity to learn about other cultures via an unorthodox experience has proven a winning mix.\n\nMuch less gross was Candytopia , a sweets-themed \"immersive experience\" that was a huge hit with Instagrammers around the United States.", "description": "It's admittedly a surprising subject, to say the least.
