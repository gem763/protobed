'I was Eddie Redmayne's double in Fantastic Beasts and I did Last Christmas and I was Jafar in Aladdin.\n\nHidden skills: The latest casualty of The Apprentice boardroom Riyonn Farsad has revealed his secret Hollywood past\n\n'My dream is to present This Morning! Always shoot for the stars!'\n\nGlitz and glamour aside, Riyonn was serious about his participation on The Apprentice.\n\n'I have always had a business mind. I was asked to be on Dragons' Den but said no - I wanted to hold out for The Apprentice.'\n\nBut the hunky contestant insists he's not bitter to be fired - despite believing that 'the right person got fired each week, except me'.\n\nHe said: 'I'm not angry about it. I am gutted \u2013 but cool with it. I shouldn't have gone, it was an nnfair firing.'\n\nHe has no qualms about revealing who should have, in his opinion, be axed instead.\n\n'Ryan Mark [Parsons]! He hasn't done much, he just sits in the background. He does barely anything and comes out with one-liners. You have to be true to yourself!\n\n'So yeah, I am gutted to be gone. I had it in me to go all the way or at least to get to the final five. There were others that were weaker than me!'\n\nOf controversial candidate Lottie Lion - who has been caught up in many a scandal, including reportedly bragging about her dad knowing Lord Sugar and calling fellow participant Lubna Farhan 'Gandhi' - Riyonn admitted he had no beef with her.\n\n'I am not going to go into all that but Lottie and I got on,' he said.\n\nRiyonn was set to pitch a range of Middle Eastern cooking sauces to Lord Sugar - having already launched a successful parlor game in the past.\n\n'I feel sad for Lord Sugar,' Riyonn said wryly. 'I think Thomas [Skinner] could win it. I think Lord Sugar sees a young Lord Sugar in him.'\n\nThe Apprentice airs on Wednedays at 9PM on BBC One.", "description": "The latest casualty of The Apprentice boardroom\u00a0Riyonn Farsad has revealed his secret Hollywood past.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20387266-0-image-a-84_1572454292822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
