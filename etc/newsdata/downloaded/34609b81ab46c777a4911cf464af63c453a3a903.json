Another 15 were missing and 177 injured by Typhoon Hagibis, which paralyzed Tokyo on Saturday and dumped record levels of rain around Japan. About 100,000 homes were left without power.\n\nRescue efforts were hindered after more than 20 rivers in central and northeastern Japan burst their banks and dozens more overflowed although their banks were still in tact, NHK said, adding that flooding rivers could cause more damage.\n\nEvacuation centers filled with residents, while some people perished as they sought shelter, NHK said, adding a 77-year-old woman fell about 40 meters to her death during an airlift.\n\nSome of the worst damage hit the central Japanese city of Nagano, where the Chikuma River inundated swaths of land and forced military helicopters to airlift people from homes.\n\nRelated Coverage Cargo ship found sunk in waters near Tokyo after typhoon - ministry\n\nKiyokazu Shimokawa, 71, speaking at an evacuation center, said he had waited all night with his wife and mother until they were finally rescued around 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI made the mistake of figuring that as long as we were on the second floor of the house, we\u2019d be fine,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWhen we realized that maybe we should evacuate, it was too late \u2013 the water rose very quickly.\u201d\n\nRie Hasegawa, a woman in her 30s, said she never imagined her landlocked town would be inundated. \u201cThe force of the water was incredible. It was dark, frightening, and I thought this might be the end,\u201d she said.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening and headed out to sea early on Sunday.\n\nLocal residents are rescued by Japapnese Defence-Force soldiers from a flooded area caused by Typhoon Hagibis in Kakuda, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, October 13, 2019, in this photo taken by Kyodo.

A newspaper reported that at least five of the 12 crew were dead and three were missing.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency ministerial meeting and sent the minister in charge of disaster management to affected areas. The government also set up a task force to deal with the damage.\n\n\u201cThe government will do everything in its power to cooperate with relevant agencies and operators working to restore services as soon as possible,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nNHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels.\n\nWith thousands of homes without power, Japanese feared a repeat of the weeks-long power outages after last month\u2019s typhoon that hit east of Tokyo.\n\nIn Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nLanding restrictions at Tokyo\u2019s Narita and Haneda airports were lifted but more than 800 flights were canceled for the day, NHK said. Some Shinkansen bullet train services to the worst-hit areas were also disrupted.\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi, northeastern Japan, was canceled, but the Japan-Scotland match in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, went ahead.
