And it\u2019s right that he should do so. We have no known basis of the wife of the king not being crowned queen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how that goal is achieved, which is crucially important,\u201d Penny writes.\n\nCamilla\u2019s family have also voiced their concern about the 72-year-old receiving that monumental title.\n\n\u201cBetween Diana and the queen is a hard place to be. How is she going to be judged? It\u2019s going to be such shake-up,\u201d a family member told the author.\n\n\u201cI think it would be better for her if she became princess consort.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, Camilla will be given the title HRH The Princess Consort when Charles is given the throne, according to Town & Country.\n\nSources: Daily Express, New Idea, Town and Country", "description": "Camilla isn\u2019t that keen on becoming the next queen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9538/73038be6dc9d4fc6a8dea8f5f2bfdd6c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
