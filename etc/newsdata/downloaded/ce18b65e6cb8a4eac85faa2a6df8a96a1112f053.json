The New York Times reported late Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are looking into whether Trump\u2019s personal attorney violated lobbying laws as part of his Ukraine endeavors. While Giuliani has denied wrongdoing, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two associates of his arrested earlier this week for campaign finance violations, are believed to have worked closely with him in investigating the widely debunked corruption allegations against Biden that Giuliani and Trump have sought to revive ahead of 2020.\n\nSeveral law enforcement sources confirmed to The Daily Beast that Giuliani\u2019s dealings are under scrutiny in connection with Parnas and Fruman\u2019s arrest. \u201cIt's common sense,\u201d one person with knowledge of the inquiry into Giuliani told The Daily Beast. \u201cIf people didn't look into this, they wouldn't be doing their jobs.\u201d A second Justice Department source echoed that sentiment, along with a federal law enforcement official who said the matter is part of an ongoing investigation.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine has previously raised questions about his lobbying status, with several Democratic senators appealing to the Department of Justice last year for information on his Foreign Agents Registration Act filings, a legal requirement for any U.S. citizen making contact with the government or media at the request of foreign politicians or officials.\n\nGiuliani said last year he\u2019d never filed a FARA registration, a claim which raised eyebrows in light of media reports that he\u2019d performed lobbying work for clients in Ukraine. Ukrainian-Russian developer Pavel Fuks told The New York Times earlier this year that Giuliani had been employed as a \u201clobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine\u201d in 2017, though Giuliani denied that claim.\n\n-- Pervaiz Shallwani and Noah Shachtman contributed reporting", "description": "Law enforcement sources told The Daily Beast scrutiny of Giuliani is just \u201ccommon sense\u201d after the arrest of his associates.", "authors": ["Harry Siegel", "Allison Quinn", "Senior Editor", "News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2532,w_4503,x_0,y_262/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570854974/GettyImages-1170749646_sqgo5v", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
