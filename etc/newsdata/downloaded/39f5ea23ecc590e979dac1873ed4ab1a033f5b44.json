The goal: bring their platforms to the televisions of international customers eager to take advantage of a slew of new streaming services.\n\n\"We are starting to look a lot harder at international, as our growth continues into the U.S.,\" Roku CEO Anthony Wood said in a CNBC interview from the conference.\n\nTo do this, both companies are investing in partnerships with already-strong European brands. Roku announced its first licensing agreement in Europe on Saturday, saying Chinese television manufacturer Hisense will start selling Roku TV models in the U.K. starting in the fourth quarter of this year. That means Roku's operating system, which provides access to thousands of streaming channels, will come built-in to the new smart televisions.\n\n\"My goal would be to be over 50% of all TVs around the world,\" Wood said.", "description": "Amazon's Fire TV and Roku are expanding into key European markets like the U.K. and Germany.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Schulze"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106121218-1568112061856hisenserokutv.jpg?v=1568112228", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
