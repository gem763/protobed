I\u2019m not going to pre-empt what it is or wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nUnder new rules introduced this year, the digital chequered flag supersedes the actual physical flag, as the official signal indicating the end of the race.\n\nVettel and Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc said the chequered flag signal had not come up on their steering wheel displays.\n\nMasi added that teams had been told to race on to the full distance of the race.\n\nAsked if the glitch could have developed as a result of the systems being reconnected after being dismantled in preparation for Typhoon Hagibis, Masi said the FIA was still looking into the causes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to speculate on what it is,\u201d said the Australian who took over after the death in March of former Formula One race director Charlie Whiting.\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on doing things perfectly but it\u2019s one of those that hasn\u2019t happened before with the chequered flag board and we\u2019ve got to investigate why.\u201d\n\nFormula One is no stranger to chequered flag mix-ups.\n\nModel Winnie Harlow accidentally waved the flag early at last year\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix, leading to the introduction of the rule that gives the digital flag precedence.\n\nIn 2006 Brazilian football hero Pele waved the flag too late, missing race winner Felipe Massa\u2019s Ferrari as it crossed the line.", "description": "Formula One\u2019s governing body said it suspected a systems glitch was to blame for Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix ending a lap early, with Mexican Sergio Perez officially finishing ninth and in the points despite crashing out.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
