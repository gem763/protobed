And despite including a highly opinionated discussion of the text exchange in their book, the authors never admitted that Pogrebin was a key player in the exchanges.\n\nPogrebin made a bizarre and unsupported claim this week that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh had told her to lie. It turned out Pogrebin had mischaracterized discussions with the Supreme Court\u2019s public information officer, not Kavanaugh, who had merely explained the terms of an off-the-record interview that was being sought and never obtained. Despite the many errors and false claims Pogrebin and her co-author Kate Kelly made, corporate media picked up on this false statement as if it were true.\n\nA 2018 text exchange between Karen Yarasavage and Kerry Berchem shows them discussing Deborah Ramirez\u2019s claim against Kavanaugh. Yarasavage was extremely close to Ramirez \u2014 having asked Ramirez to be a godmother to one of her children \u2014 and knew Kavanaugh well, too. Berchem was younger and not at Yale when the alleged incident was said to have taken place. While in reality, the text exchanges show Berchem trying to get Yarasavage to say something supportive of Ramirez\u2019s claim, even though Yarasavage said she\u2019d never even heard of any such incident and felt confident she would have if it had happened, the media characterized the discussions as evidence of Kavanaugh\u2019s guilt.\n\nIn their book, Pogrebin and Kelly continue the media narrative that the exchanges were the opposite of what they were. They write that discussions of media inquiries to find anti-Kavanaugh dirt in the summer instead \u201craised questions as to whether Kavanaugh and his friends or representatives had been trying to influence events as far back as July.\u201d The exchanges \u201chad started with seemingly innocent social contacts, but \u2014 in the context of the Ford and Ramirez allegations \u2014 they had taken on importance as potentially relevant material to show the FBI.\u201d\n\nBerchem\u2019s repeated efforts to get Yarasavage not to defend Kavanaugh, sprinkled with Berchem\u2019s political opposition to all things Trump-related, were instead portrayed as Yarasavage and other Kavanaugh friends trying to shape the narrative. The truth of the exchange is explained in \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,\u201d co-authored by this writer.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly quote many snippets of the texts without revealing what the women said about Pogrebin herself. Pogrebin briefly discloses that she went to Yale University with Kavanaugh and Ramirez. She used those connections to call up old classmates and sell a book, although she and her co-author now are trying to present themselves as objective reporters.\n\nWhat Yarasavage, in particular, said was quite relevant. Yarasavage noted that Pogrebin had called her up as an old Yale friend, failing to note that the culture reporter at the New York Times was actually trying to write a hit piece on Kavanaugh.\n\nThen, she writes, Pogrebin tried to get her to say a specific quote that would suggest the fiercely independent Yarasavage was politically motivated to defend Kavanaugh.\n\nRobin wanted me to go on record saying \u201cshe became a different person, a lot more liberal\u201d I said no, I have no idea if that is true, truly speculation. I told her I don\u2019t want to be included at all in any way. Mind you, this \u201cquote\u201d came from her asking me why we aren\u2019t in touch. I explained my last conversation with her was political and I\u2019m not a very political person. I don\u2019t want to read any of the articles because everything is taken apart and put together to sensationalize and may not even read true in the end. I actually can\u2019t believe the New Yorker story ran. It really doesn\u2019t read well\n\nPogrebin didn\u2019t mention her own role in these text exchanges. Neither did she mention that she\u2019d spread gossip about Ramirez and then asked Pogrebin and Berchem if they\u2019d heard about it. At least in Yarasavage\u2019s case, she\u2019d heard it \u2014 from Pogrebin herself.\n\n\u201cShe just asked me if Debbi transferred to Pierson? Do u know?\u201d Berchem asked. \u201cHa, she asked me too!\u201d Yarasavage responded. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who told ME that Debbie transferred from Stiles to Pierson\u201d\n\nEzra Stiles is the college at Yale University that Kavanaugh was in. Pogrebin was extremely close to one of the central anti-Kavanaugh activists, Kathy Charlton, during the confirmation fight. Charlton was one of the major players in the anti-Kavanaugh effort \u2014 Monica McLean being another \u2014 whose role Pogrebin and Kelly strategically downplayed.\n\nImages of portions of the text exchanges are below.", "description": "Texts show NYT reporter Robin Pogrebin engaged in questionable journalistic tactics to shape a false narrative against Kavanaugh.", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-20-at-4.15.27-PM-e1569010582359.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
