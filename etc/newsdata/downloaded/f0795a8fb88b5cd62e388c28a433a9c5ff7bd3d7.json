REUTERS/Ting Shen/File Photo\n\nLast month the Trump administration escalated its fight with California with a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom accusing the state of violating clean water laws by failing to properly prevent human waste from homeless people from entering waterways.\n\n\u201cNo evidence supports targeting the homeless for Clean Water Act enforcement, given the much greater damage done by the huge volume of waste discharged from industrial plants, factory farms, and sewage treatment plants and many other sources,\u201d wrote the former EPA employees, including Elizabeth Southerland, a former agency director of science and technology.\n\n\u201cConsidering its enthusiasm for de-regulation and reluctance to enforce the laws still on the books, President Trump\u2019s threat to wield EPA\u2019s authority against the most vulnerable members of our society is shameless and morally repugnant,\u201d they said.\n\nThe letter followed a call on Sept. 27 by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, for the EPA\u2019s inspector general to probe whether politics instead of pollution was behind the Trump administration\u2019s threat to withhold more than $4 billion in federal transportation funding from California over claims of poor air quality.\n\nThe letter, signed by nearly 600 EPA former employees, to U.S. House of Representatives oversight and energy committees also came as a response to Trump\u2019s claim last month that homeless people are responsible for \u201ctremendous\u201d amounts of ocean pollution in California.\n\nSpearheaded by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, the letter noted that six states have had more large pollution sources in noncompliance with federal environmental laws over the last three years than California: Ohio, New York, Iowa, Missouri, Texas and Indiana. The letter cited agency records.\n\nCalifornia has waged numerous policy battles and legal challenges with the Republican president\u2019s administration over environmental protection, immigration, housing and the state\u2019s right to set stricter standards on carbon emissions from vehicles than federal rules.\n\nMichael Abboud, an EPA spokesman, said there was no abuse of authority. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s inability to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act has been an ongoing challenge, and the failure to properly operate and maintain the City\u2019s sewage collection and treatment facilities creates public health risks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHighlighting that California has the worst air quality in the nation along with other serious environmental problems is not a political issue,\u201d Abboud added.", "description": "Hundreds of former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency employees on Thursday urged a congressional probe into whether the agency's feud with California represented retaliation for the state's failure to support President Donald Trump's political agenda.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439365597&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991WB", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
