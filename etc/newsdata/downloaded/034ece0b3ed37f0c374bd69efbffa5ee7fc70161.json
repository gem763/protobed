REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how if they (the ECB) do more easing, which means - deeper negative rates - I don\u2019t know how that transmission (works) in the economy,\u201d Fink told Reuters in a telephone interview, following BlackRock\u2019s earnings results.\n\nBlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and Fink is widely followed by investors, traders and economists for his views on financial markets and the global economy.\n\n\u201cEuropean equities trade at multiple points below the U.S. because they don\u2019t have an equity culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a big believer that Europe needs to find ways to have the Europeans focusing on investing for the long term through equities.\u201d\n\nGerman news magazine Der Spiegel cited central bank sources on Friday as saying ECB President Mario Draghi planned to restart purchases of government bonds by November to support the fragile euro zone economy.\n\nThe magazine also said Draghi hoped the move would encourage companies to invest more and consumers to spend more.\n\nFink said loose monetary policy has been most effective in the United States because of Americans\u2019 longstanding embrace of equities and their exposure to that market.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense in the U.S. economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes much less sense in economies where most of the pool of assets of individuals are sitting in a bank account. I see negative impact. That is why I\u2019ve always questioned monetary policy without a large, I would say, equity culture. That\u2019s really what\u2019s happened in Japan and in Europe.\u201d\n\nFink said the monetization of financial assets in Europe, especially now with over 50% of its debt yielding below zero, \u201cactually harms the psychology of savers. So this is why I believe Europe has not grown to the extent of the U.S.\u201d\n\nHe also said Europe has been \u201cso reliant on monetary policy and so little fiscal policy. That will be one of the long-term mistakes of Europe.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the only name in town is the ECB,\u201d Fink said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do whatever they can do to do it. I think now with all the negative rates, and with 82% of savings in a bank account, I just don\u2019t see how that transmission works as well as lowering rates in the United States.\u201d", "description": "BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Friday the European Central Bank will need to purchase equities to stimulate Europe's economy, and that leaders should find ways to have investors embrace an \"equity culture\" there.", "authors": ["Jennifer Ablan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190719&t=2&i=1409808212&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF6I1GG", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
