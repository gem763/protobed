(https://on.wsj.com/2m1v1s1)\n\nThe report added that it couldn't be learned how exactly this deal would work and it is far from guaranteed it will happen.\n\nIf it does, it could involve the firms buying Symantec and proceeding with the sale to Broadcom or waiting for the enterprise deal to close and then acquiring the consumer unit, the Journal reported.\n\nSymantec's consumer unit includes its Norton antivirus and LifeLock identity-theft-protection products.\n\nIn August, Broadcom said it would buy Symantec's enterprise security unit for $10.7 billion in cash to scale up its software business through deals.\n\nSources had told Reuters in July that Symantec walked away from negotiations to sell the entire company to Broadcom over price disagreements.\n\nThe WSJ on Friday reported that Permira and Advent had also considered a deal for all of Symantec and were close to inking one before the talks fell apart.\n\nUp to Thursday's close, Symantec had a market capitalization of $14.51 billion.\n\nSymantec and Permira did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. An Advent spokesman declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)", "description": "Shares of Symantec rose as much as 10% after the report.
