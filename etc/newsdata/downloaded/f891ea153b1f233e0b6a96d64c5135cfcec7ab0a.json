We don\u2019t do abuse,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cFeeding them is a challenge\u2026 but we don\u2019t have anything to hide. We are helping humanity.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the camp have a long history. Three years ago, the UN children\u2019s agency UNICEF sent an assessment team to the site, who filed a report with damning conclusions.\n\n\u201cPastor Solomon runs this camp as if it is his \u2018kingdom\u2019. He controls the movement and actions of every person in the camp through a group of ministers and specially selected children,\u201d the team wrote in the confidential report, seen by AFP.\n\nThe UNICEF investigators said what they saw, coupled with interviews with children, caregivers and NGO workers, prompted \u201cstrong concerns regarding the possibility that Pastor Solomon may be engaged in sexual activities, or at a minimum, displaying grooming behaviours with girls in the camp\u201d.\n\nWitnesses also told AFP that around a dozen young girls work for the pastor as his personal servants and receive preferential treatment.\n\n\u201cA girl who refused to work for him was punished and starved. When he beat you, he wouldn\u2019t stop until you bled seriously,\u201d said Rahila, a 16-year-old girl who left the camp several months ago.\n\n\u201cHe had names that he called different girls\u2026 He would comment on the size of my butt, and he would say our chests looked like pineapples or stuff like that,\u201d she said.\n\nAll the witnesses\u2019 names have been changed to protect their identities.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We got beaten\u2019 \u2013\n\nOther children and adults said that those who upset the preacher were treated brutally.\n\n\u201cI was always hungry, there was never enough food or water. When we complained we got beaten with anything he could lay his hands on,\u201d said 12-year-old Hauwa.\n\n\u201cNo one leaves Pastor Solomon without a scar \u2014 whether it is psychological or physical,\u201d a former follower told AFP after hesitating at first to talk about his ordeal.\n\nConvincing people to talk about their experiences with Pastor Solomon is a painstaking task. Some have refused to speak out for 20 years.\n\n\u201cMost of the girls were coming from poor homes. They would sleep with him and in exchange he would pay for their school fees,\u201d said a former female follower who was at the church in the late 1990s.\n\nShe said her going to the authorities about the abuse she experienced and witnessed was out of the question in a country where powerful men are rarely brought to justice.\n\nShe was also scared of juju, the traditional black magic widely feared by people in the region.\n\n\u201cI was scared to talk. He uses juju, people told me I would die.\u201d\n\nEvangelical preachers draw fanatical followings across the deeply Christian south of Nigeria. Pastor Solomon\u2019s power stems greatly from his beliefs.\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s sent by God. To confront him is like confronting God himself,\u201d a former church worker said.\n\nThose who have served under him and lived in the camp say the pastor uses the fear of devil to keep people in line.\n\nOn the church\u2019s website, in a short biography entitled \u201cI Saw Jesus\u201d \u2014 translated into six languages including Russian and Chinese \u2014 he claimed that he was saved from Satan by God himself.\n\n\u2013 Foreign evangelical support \u2013\n\nPastor Solomon\u2019s International Christian Centre for Missions has expanded hugely since he founded it in 1990 with just a dozen young female followers.\n\nIn 1992, he set up the first \u201cHome for the Needy\u201d, taking in poor children whose parents entrusted them to his care on the promise of an education.\n\nA former missionary said the pastor would sometimes misrepresent the children as orphans to raise sponsorship in Europe or the United States.\n\nTen years later, the church had grown to more than 200 branches, with missionaries and preachers working across southern Nigeria and funds coming from evangelical churches abroad.\n\n\u201cHe was always browsing the internet to look for church organisations all over the world\u201d to target for donations, the missionary said.\n\n\u201cHe would send pictures of us or of the children, asking us to look sad. He was saying that white people are so emotional.\u201d\n\nBut it was the Boko Haram jihadist insurgency more than 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) to the north of Benin City that caused a surge in the numbers at the camp.\n\nAs the violence displaced millions of people and grabbed global attention in 2013, Pastor Solomon\u2019s group turned its attention to children in the conflict zone of northeastern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe pastor\u2019s people came (to Maiduguri) and convinced parents to send their children to Benin City where they would have a good education, with free food,\u201d said Rakiya, who allowed five of her six children to go.\n\n\u201cAt the camp, parents would be given bags of rice, bus fare, jerrycans of palm oil and the like. So when they returned to Maiduguri they would tell other parents \u2018Benin is good\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 No records \u2013\n\nNo records are publicly available about how many children were brought from northern Nigeria to the camp.\n\nPastor Solomon told AFP that the Nigerian army and the intelligence service \u201chave a copy of the register\u201d, but this could not be verified.\n\nUNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) wanted to set up a programme to reunite children from the camp with their families, but were denied access to their identities.\n\n\u201cAt this time, camp management has been unable/unwilling to provide this information,\u201d UNICEF said in its report.\n\nUNICEF maintains that it passed on the report to local authorities in 2016 to make them aware of the \u201cconcerns\u201d.\n\nBut nothing appears to have been done.\n\nOn the contrary, Pastor Solomon had full support from the then regional governor, Adams Oshiomhole, now head of Nigeria\u2019s ruling party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cWith the former governor, we once had a good relationship,\u201d Pastor Solomon told AFP. \u201cWhen parents wanted to get their children back, he would give them money, he would give them a gift.\u201d\n\nToday, while denying any accusations of maltreatment, the pastor admits that the huge influx of children placed a major strain on the camp and that the church struggles for money.\n\nCamp workers have told local media that to feed the estimated 4,000 children and 500 adults at the camp costs hundreds of dollars a day \u2014 and that does not include medicine, water, education and clothing.\n\n\u201cWe also have a problem with hepatitis, measles, chickenpox and scabies; we don\u2019t have enough accommodation for them, this is a big challenge,\u201d the pastor acknowledged.\n\nWitnesses said that children sleep on mats on the ground in huge hangars without adult supervision, relieving themselves in the forest, complaining of hunger and thirst and not washing, and that many have died in the disease-ridden conditions.\n\n\u2013 \u2018It\u2019s our responsibility\u2019 \u2013\n\nWhile conditions keep deteriorating at the camp, some European and US evangelical groups still send donations and materials to Nigeria.\n\nThe congregation of German pastor Gunther Geipel \u2014 who describes Pastor Solomon as a \u201cfriend and brother\u201d \u2014 is one of them.\n\nGeipel dismisses the allegations against the pastor as \u201ctales\u201d from \u201cjealous people\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine that this is true,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nAFP put the allegations against Pastor Solomon and his camp to Edo State minister for social affairs Maria Edeko, who took up her duties several months ago.\n\nShe said she had never heard of the UN report or accusations of abuse and poor conditions at the camp but insisted they would be investigated.\n\nShe confirmed the authorities did not have access to the camp registry.\n\n\u201cFrom now on, I can assure you that my ministry will be on top of the situation. We need monitoring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d", "description": "Benin City (Nigeria) (AFP) \u2013 Deep in the tropical forest in southern Nigeria, an evangelical pastor runs a sprawling camp billed as a refuge for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/5552ca_displaced-12-year-old-girl-who-fled-boko-haram-insurgency-in-northeast-nigeria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
