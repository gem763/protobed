We take lessons from those games and we need to be a lot better than what we were.\"\n\nCross-code star Sonny Bill Williams will start on the bench and fellow centre Ryan Crotty misses out altogether as coach Steve Hansen named in-form Anton Lienert-Brown and Jack Goodhue in midfield. Two-time World Rugby player of the year Beauden Barrett starts at full-back.\n\n\"Ireland are in a situation where they haven't gone past the quarter-final. They know what it's like to go home so they'll try their darndest not to and we'll be the same,\" said Hansen.\n\nSchmidt admitted that Hansen and his backroom staff were \"good guys to have a drink with afterwards\", but stressed there would be little conviviality in the lead-up to what he said would be a challenging game for the Irish.\n\n\"We're certainly not going to sneak up on them anymore, we're not going to surprise them. They are well aware of how we play and what they are going to do to combat that,\" said the Kiwi who, like Hansen, will step down after the World Cup.\n\n\"I've no doubt they've got a few things cooked up that we haven't seen before that we're going to find really challenging.\"\n\nSchmidt drafted in Robbie Henshaw to replace Bundee Aki, banned for three matches for a high tackle in their final pool game against Samoa, at inside centre.\n\nVeteran Rory Best will skipper the team from hooker, with the experienced duo of Conor Murray and World Player of the Year Johnny Sexton named at half-back.\n\n\"We're in a reasonably good spot,\" said Best. \"Ultimately, it's all about Saturday -- it's all about which team can turn up and implement their game plan best and deal with the pressure of knockout rugby.\"\n\nHansen echoed Best's words, saying he had primed his All Blacks team to be \"excited, full of energy and ready to rumble\" as they seek a third consecutive title.\n\nTeams:\n\nNew Zealand\n\n15 Beauden Barrett, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Jack Goodhue, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 George Bridge, 10 Richie Mo'unga, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Sam Cane, 6 Ardie Savea, 5 Sam Whitelock, 4 Brodie Retallick, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Codie Taylor, 1 Joe Moody\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Dane Coles, 17 Ofa Tuungafasi, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Scott Barrett, 20 Matt Todd, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Sonny Bill Williams, 23 Jordie Barrett\n\nIreland\n\n15 Rob Kearney, 14 Keith Earls, 13 Garry Ringrose, 12 Robbie Henshaw, 11 Jacob Stockdale, 10 Johnny Sexton, 9 Conor Murray, 8 CJ Stander, 7 Josh van der Flier, 6 Peter O'Mahony, 5 James Ryan, 4 Iain Henderson, 3 Tadhg Furlong, 2 Rory Best (captain), 1 Cian Healy\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Niall Scannell, 17 Dave Kilcoyne, 18 Andrew Porter, 19 Tadgh Beirne, 20 Rhys Ruddock, 21 Joey Carbery, 22 Chris Farrell, 23 Jordan Larmour", "description": "Defending world champions New Zealand are ready to conquer their quarter-final nerves and seize the slightest opportunity against Ireland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2463/17128c3c3934453caeffd8542b129678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
