goals for later life, by giving them a clearer idea of how much cash they might need, has been launched.\n\nThe standards, launched by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), are designed to try and give people a picture of the kind of lifestyle they may have on a minimum, moderate or comfortable retirement income.\n\nIt is hoped the standards will resonate with pension savers in the same way that being told to eat \u201cfive a day\u201d has encouraged fruit and vegetable consumption.\n\nThe minimum standard assumes a single person would have an annual income of around \u00a310,000 or \u00a315,000 for couples.\n\nSomeone with a moderate retirement income would have in the region of \u00a320,000 as a single person or \u00a330,000 as a couple to live on.\n\nAnd the benchmark for a comfortable retirement income is \u00a330,000 per year for individuals and \u00a345,000 for couples.\n\nThe new `retirement living standards\u00b4 were launched by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\nThe PLSA, which represents over 1,300 pension schemes, was launching the standards at its annual conference in Manchester.\n\nIt said someone on a minimum standard may typically expect to afford a \u00a338 weekly food shop, rising to \u00a346 for someone on a moderate income and \u00a356 on a comfortable income.\n\nSomeone living a comfortable retirement may be able to replace their car every five years, while someone on a moderate retirement may have an older car which they can afford to replace every 10 years.\n\nOn a minimum retirement income, it may be hard to afford to run a car at all.\n\nThe standards are based on research by Loughborough University.\n\nThe PLSA said that even the minimum retirement income standards allowed enough money for some \u201cfun\u201d, including a budget for social occasions.\n\nIt said the good news was that through a combination of the full state pension of \u00a38,767.20 per year, and auto-enrolment in a workplace pension, this level should be achievable for most people.\n\nNigel Peaple, director of policy and research at PLSA, said: \u201cGoal-setting can help people plan, and a series of simple standards could transform pensions engagement.\n\n\u201cNearly three-quarters (76%) of people believe that retirement living standards would help them to know if they were on track for the lifestyle they want in retirement.\u201d\n\nHe said he hoped the standards might transform the way people think about retirement saving in the same way \u201cfive-a-day\u201d messages have changed perceptions about healthy eating.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe want the pensions industry and government to use these standards to help people save for their future.\n\n\u201cFor example, some parts of industry plan to provide the information to their scheme members, some are building tools for savers to track their saving, and others are developing calculators to help support savers to build a personalised target based on the standards.\u201d\n\nGuy Opperman, minister for pensions and financial inclusion, said: \u201cWe have transformed saving for retirement for millions of people and the next challenge is to make it easier for them to engage more with their pensions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see what the PLSA has developed which has the potential to help savers think about the future and plan for the retirement they want.\u201d\n\nJackie Spencer, senior policy and propositions manager at the Money and Pensions Service, said: \u201cSaving for something is easier to do when you can visualise what you\u2019re working towards, which is why people are often more motivated to save for short-term goals like holidays and new cars than they are for their retirement.\n\n\u201cThe new retirement living standards are a great way of offering savers some practical examples of what they can expect from their lives when they stop working.\n\n\u201cThe Money and Pensions Service has agreed to be an early adopter of the new standards and will be looking to incorporate them into pension guidance and our online pension calculator.\u201d\n\nPensions giant Aviva welcomed the standards.\n\nSteve Jackson, workplace pension proposition manager at Aviva, said: \u201cThe retirement living standards (RLS) do a fantastic job of making pension-saving feel tangible.\n\n\u201cSince defined contribution (DC) pensions were created, the best the industry has really been able to do is tell people to \u2018save as much as you can, for as long as you can\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not bad guidance, but it\u2019s not very compelling either.\n\n\u201cOur own customer research found one of the key questions people want answered is \u2018am I saving enough?\u2019 The RLS can now go some way to answering that, giving people a real target to aim for.\u201d\n\nGregg McClymont, director of policy at the People\u2019s Pension, said: \u201cWith so much uncertainty for savers, the new PLSA standards offer members a welcome rule of thumb starting point for complex retirement conversations.\u201d", "description": "The Pensions and Lifetime Savings
