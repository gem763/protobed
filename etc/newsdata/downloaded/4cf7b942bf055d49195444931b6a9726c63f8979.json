Each episode will then air on Logo the following Friday. So U.S. viewers waiting to watch via Logo, consider this your spoiler warning, henny!\n\nHow many predictable English cultural references will we have to endure at the hands of RuPaul? Judging by this week\u2019s main challenge, as many as she can fit into eight episodes! It\u2019s the first acting challenge, and as if it could be anything else, the queens will be acting in properly British Downton Abbey parodies. I just hope Maggie Smith skipped her watch party this week.\n\nWhen the queens return from the lip-sync, they\u2019re shook by the first elimination. \u201cIt\u2019s just so weird that someone\u2019s already gone home,\u201d Scaredy says in a confessional. Has she never seen an episode of Drag Race, either? But we quickly move on from mourning Gothy (as quickly as she\u2019s gotten over the show) to learn that the Vivienne has something against Cheryl. She\u2019s from Essex, right? I don\u2019t know how these queens have had the time to form opinions about each other when I\u2019m still pairing names with faces, but let\u2019s go with it, because this episode needs a narrative. At least we get commentary on the situation from Baga, clad in her iconic yellow Big Bird coat \u2014 consider this her audition tape to be this season\u2019s narrator.\n\nThis mini-challenge, in which the Vivienne lines up the girls from strongest to weakest, is fairly pointless, except for that her bottom, Scaredy Kat, becomes the other team captain for the maxi. Then everyone\u2019s gym class nightmares flash before their eyes because we\u2019re picking teams! The Vivienne gets Vinegar and Baga, whom she ranked No. 2 and No. 3, along with Sum Ting, while Scaredy goes for the twinks and veteran actor Divina. It\u2019s an arrangement that looks lopsided to me, but at the same time, let he who hasn\u2019t gone for the twinks throw the first stone.\n\nAnd finally, we see these girls work it in the werkroom! Although it feels fairly uneventful \u2014 there\u2019s none of the usual drama over role assignments or an unwanted teammate. (To paraphrase the words of Scaredy: \u201cI picked my role [as a Drag Race U.K. recapper] because I felt like it would be quite easy to be a whiny bitch.\u201d) I just want to know where these queens picked up their assumptions about who\u2019s under the radar and who\u2019s a threat. We\u2019ve had one challenge, girls! Counting is what? (Fundamental!)\n\nThe girls walk on set, and there\u2019s Michelle, looking intimidating in her director\u2019s chair, ready to be snubbed of yet another Emmy for her star directing on these acting challenges. (Did you see her Cabaret quickstep on Strictly? Nines, nines, nines, almost across the board!) The Vivienne is back in her old-woman makeup, serving Maggie Smith realness, and I could watch her use this in every challenge and never get tired of it. Baga, meanwhile, is forgetting her lines right and left, but she\u2019s also channelling Miss Vanjie herself as the Cookie Monster dad in Good God Girl, Get Out and making me cackle. In fact, half the queens on both teams are forgetting their lines, and/or royally botching their accents. Sum Ting Wong cycles through five different American accents, while Canadian Crystal, a U.K. resident, can\u2019t do a British accent to save her life. At least we get to watch Divina slap Scaredy multiple times. It\u2019s honestly cinematic.\n\nEmotions are high as we get ready for the runway: Blu and Sum Ting worry about their performances (as they should), Cheryl talks about Blu, the Vivienne talks about Cheryl, Vinegar asks Scaredy if she\u2019s out to her family as bi \u2014 what, wait, let\u2019s rewind! Did the queens know Scaredy was bi all along, or did that clarification come off camera? No matter now, it\u2019s out there! Scaredy says her family doesn\u2019t know, and as Vinegar bonds with her about the difficulties of coming out, their sweet mother-daughter relationship starts to blossom. Sum Ting shares that she\u2019s not out to her first-generation Chinese-British family either, and although we go through this conversation every season, it\u2019s still honest.\n\nBut wipe away your tears, because Graham Norton and Maisie Williams are here! This week\u2019s runway is \u201cBond Girl Glamorama,\u201d but if you gave me those nine looks and told me to pick a theme, I\u2019d say it was a free week. Not everything has to be about the U.K., Ru! Sum Ting Wong stands out for playing it sexy, Baga delivers an on-point \u201cLaser Minelli\u201d look, and Scaredy continues to give us the most story out of any of the queens on the runway as Kitty Rouge, a cheeky pilot with a French accent who loves \u201cto partake in long, hard sexual intercourse.\u201d Noted!\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Team Vivienne has won the challenge once we\u2019ve seen both the clips \u2014 the Vivienne and Vinegar\u2019s natural chemistry, along with Baga being Baga, is more than enough to make up for all the notes Sum Ting can\u2019t hit as Lady Carey. (When\u2019s that singing challenge?) Ru confirms that, and Baga Chipz, in the top for the second time, is the winner! Enjoy your badge \u2014 wear it with pride! (And by that I mean sell it, like The Vivienne joked that she would do after the show. Get your coin!)\n\nOn Team Scaredy, there are three queens who have to worry. Crystal ekes by on the strength of her self-made leather dominatrix look (with a whip that scared poor Maisie Williams, and probably would\u2019ve scared me too) and upward turn in the middle of the clip, and Divina clearly stole every scene she was in because every scene was just sitting there, unprotected, like the rest of the team wouldn\u2019t miss it if it got stolen. That leaves Cheryl, who didn\u2019t take her dowager countess role anywhere, Scaredy, whose whining felt like one droning note and who Michelle reads for continuing to paint her face like a cat, and Blu, who you probably forgot was on this team because she faded so deeply into the background.\n\nThis all makes for some untucking drama! It\u2019s classic dramatic irony when Cheryl walks in as Sum Ting is saying she\u2019s in the bottom, and after Cheryl is informed, it quickly turns into a pile-on. The queens don\u2019t feel like Cheryl is being herself, not even Mama Vinegar, who knows Cheryl from some drag scene between East London and Essex. In the confessional, Cheryl reassures herself that everyone is \u201cswitching it on\u201d for the cameras, but honestly, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Of all the queens, Cheryl feels like one of the least defined to me \u2014 had she not been from Essex, I couldn\u2019t tell you a single thing about her. Not to mention, Blu is crying because she feels alone among the girls and Scaredy is threatening to shit herself again. Do you remember why you watch this show?\n\nI\u2019m a bit shocked that Ru pits Scaredy against Blu in the lip-sync; after all, it\u2019s Cheryl\u2019s second week in the bottom. But once that match is set, and Scaredy reminds us that it\u2019s her first-ever drag performance, I\u2019m shitting myself too. She doesn\u2019t do too terribly, and Blu doesn\u2019t particularly shine either (it\u2019s largely a waste of \u201cVenus\u201d by Bananarama), but by the end it\u2019s clear \u2014 baby, Scaredy doesn\u2019t got it. It\u2019s a choice I disagree with, primarily based on the sheer fun of her look, but I guess this is what happens when you come on Drag Race having never performed. But I\u2019m proud of Scaredy! I hope she keeps doing drag for a long time, and I\u2019m so glad she showed these queens that, as she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be gay to do drag.\u201d So much for my hopes of a Kitty Rouge reappearance, though!\n\nAcross the Pond\n\n\u2022 It almost happens too soon: In that thing that I guess we\u2019re calling a mini-challenge, Ru asks the girls what a tuppence is. Thank God she asked, or else I would\u2019ve had to keep pretending to know for the sake of writing a credible recap! \u201cA tuppence is an old two-pence,\u201d one of the girls informs her. Or, alternately, \u201cA tuppence is your vagina!\u201d\n\n\u2022 When the Vivienne is shading Cheryl as she paints, she mentions that Cheryl says things like \u201cyaaass,\u201d which U.K. queens apparently don\u2019t do. Is it more like an \u201coi, guv\u2019nah!\u201d? (I had to.)\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
