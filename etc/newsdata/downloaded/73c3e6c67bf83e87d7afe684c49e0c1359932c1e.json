Four years later, Klopfer passed away, but he\u2019s still making news. His grieving family made a grisly discovery at a property owned by Klopfer this week \u2014 more than 2200 \u201cfetal remains\u201d that the abortionist kept.\n\nNo one is quite sure why:\n\nPolice say 2,246 medically preserved fetal remains were found on the property of Ulrich George Klopfer, a late abortion doctor who used to operate a South Bend clinic. Klopfer died on Sept. 3. On Sept. 12, the Will County (Illinois) Coroner\u2019s Office received a call from an attorney representing his family. They reported finding fetal remains among Klopfer\u2019s personal property and requested proper removal. Will County sheriff\u2019s detectives, crime scene investigators and representatives from the coroner\u2019s office went to the address and were directed to an area of the property where 2,246 medically preserved fetal remains were located.\n\nThe case reminds one of Kermit Gosnell, the convicted murderer in Philadelphia whose disgusting clinic contained hundreds of preserved fetal parts. Gosnell later claimed he kept them for scientific purposes, but never provided a scientific purpose for which they could be used. The implication in Gosnell\u2019s case was that he was keeping trophies in the same manner as a serial killer.\n\nThis looks to be a similar case, at least at first blush. Klopfer had been barred from practicing medicine since the 2015 licensing case, but it\u2019s possible that he could still have conducted research. If so, though, why do it at a remote property without any research or laboratory infrastructure? Why would it have been hidden from his family?\n\nThat\u2019s not the only similarity between Klopfer and Gosnell. Here are the list of particulars found by investigators that looked into Klopfer\u2019s operations, as noted by the group Right to Life of St. Joseph County:\n\nAfter 43 years of performing abortions and numerous complaints filed against Klopfer by consumers, the Department of Health, and advocacy groups, Attorney General Greg Zoeller\u2019s office filed complaints with the Indiana Medical Licensing Board, recommending that disciplinary action be taken against Klopfer\u2019s medical license. At the final hearing regarding this complaint on Thursday, the Board found Klopfer to be guilty of 5 out of the 9 allegations brought before them by the Attorney General\u2019s Office. Among these, Klopfer was accused of the following:\n\n\u2022 Failing to timely report\u2013within three days as required by law\u2013 abortions performed on 13-year old girls\n\n\u2022 Failing to keep up with proper professional and medical competency standards\n\n\u2022 Failing to obtain informed and voluntary consent for seven patients at least 18 hours prior to the abortion procedure\n\n\u2022 Not having qualified staff on hand to monitor anesthesia\n\n\u2022 Submitting over 1,800 Termination of Pregnancy Reports with omissions or errors\n\nAlthough Klopfer\u2019s ACLU attorney Mary Watts attempted to spin the argument as a trivial matter of semantics on paperwork and documentation, Deputy Attorney General Renee Gallagher led the way for the State in arguing that Klopfer\u2019s incompetencies and neglectful standards of care make him unfit to practice as a physician.\n\nIt\u2019s not as bad as Gosnell\u2019s horrors, but it demonstrates the same scofflaw attitude. Now with his trophies far outnumbering those of Gosnell\u2019s, the question now becomes what didn\u2019t investigators discover at that time.\n\nWhile considering that, spare a kind thought and a prayer for his family. What they must be going through after making this discovery is unimaginable. After that, though, spare a few thoughts and prayers for Klopfer\u2019s many victims, both alive and not.", "description": "\"Likely Indiana's most prolific abortion doctor.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/klopfer-cbs.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
