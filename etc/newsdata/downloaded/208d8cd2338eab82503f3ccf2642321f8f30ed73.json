It is also home to the namesake Komodo dragons, the world's largest species of lizard.\n\nCalls for greater wildlife protection has been underway for months, after concerns that the constant stream of visitors have damaged ecosystems and threatened the lives of the giant lizards.\n\nIn April, Indonesian authorities announced plans to make the popular island completely off limits to tourists for a year starting in January 2020. The ban was intended to allow for environmental rehabilitation, and allow the island to develop into an exclusive conservation area with a small number of tourists each year.\n\nThe reversal of the ban was announced on October 1, after local residents voiced concerns that the ban could significantly undermine their livelihood.\n\nCNN has reached out to Indonesia Tourism for comment.\n\nHere there be dragons\n\nThe giant lizards, officially known as Varanus komodoensis, are classified as vulnerable species .
