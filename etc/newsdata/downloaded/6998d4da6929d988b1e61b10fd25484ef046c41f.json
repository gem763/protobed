You are right, it is very important to look after our health.\n\nIn a busy city like Hong Kong, people often don\u2019t pay enough attention to health and exercise. We\u2019re too busy with our studies or work.\n\nApart from a balanced diet and exercise, there\u2019s another aspect that we tend to ignore. Most of us spend hours in front of the computer every day. Remember to sit up straight in front of the computer, instead of leaning towards it. In addition, we should take regular breaks when using the computer to give our eyes a rest, and do some stretching exercises.\n\nWe could also lead by example. If we can show our peers that exercising is not only good for our health but also fun, I\u2019m sure that we will convince others to join us.\n\nThe good news is that even if you\u2019re not feeling especially happy or healthy at the moment, you can turn things around by starting to act on it. Do it now!\n\nM. J. Premaratne, Sub-editor", "description": "Hong Kong students face a heavy workload, including homework, revision and extracurricular activities.
