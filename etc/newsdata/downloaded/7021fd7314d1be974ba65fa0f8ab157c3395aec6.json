(TruPlace)\n\nSometimes a little imagination is required to become a first-time home buyer, especially when your budget is capped at $400,000. In Montgomery County, Md., the median sales price in July was $466,000, according to Bright MLS. But if you want to buy a single-family home, the sales price is likely to be considerably higher, depending on the location. Still, a single-family home isn\u2019t necessarily out of reach.\n\nFor example, the home at 10604 Inwood Ave. in Silver Spring, priced at $385,000, doesn\u2019t require homeowner association dues and has an annual property tax bill of $3,705. The price was first listed at $395,000.\n\n[One-bedroom, one-bathroom condo in Silver Spring is listed for $269,000]\n\nBuilt in 1950, this 1,800-square-foot house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a quirky layout.

It also has a library with built-in bookcases, a study, a mudroom, a bedroom and the home\u2019s only full bathroom. This level also has a laundry room.\n\nA \u201cship\u2019s ladder\u201d staircase with alternating height treads leads to the second level, which has a family room, two bedrooms and a half bathroom. The 350-square-foot unfinished lower level has high ceilings and space for a workroom and a wine cellar.\n\nTwo additions have been built onto the back of the house and include spaces that could be repurposed as another bedroom or an exercise room, such as the library, study or mudroom. In addition, the kitchen needs updating.\n\nThe property has off-street parking for four cars, central air conditioning on the main level and window units upstairs.
