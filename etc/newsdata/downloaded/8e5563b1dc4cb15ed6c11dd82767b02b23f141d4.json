What it was like on the other side, what they were thinking. Lampard was just loving recalling it all. A manager-player work meeting had turned into a breezy talk about old times, between two old opponents.\n\nRelatively stern in his job so far, Lampard softening up for such a nostalgia trip is natural. Pedro played for Barcelona in their epic elimination to Chelsea in 2011-12, a tie that really got started when Lampard started the move for Didier Drogba\u2019s goal by dispossessing Leo Messi. It was a landmark night for the midfielder, on the way to that first Champions League for the club, and \u201cthe best footballing night of my life\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust. AFP/Getty Images 15/33 19. Zenit St Petersburg Ever a tricky trip, Zenit have a sneakily fun squad. Malcom will look to rebound from his torrid time at Barcelona. Getty Images 16/33 18. Valencia Europa League semi-finalists after dropping down last season, the squad is a coherent one with experience. Round of 16 likely if they get a friendly group draw.

Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nHe\u2019s impressed that upon his current Chelsea squad in the last few days, stressing the competition\u2019s importance to them; telling them they\u2019re back where the club belongs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about how crucial it is to be back here, what it means for Chelsea,\u201d Pedro tells The Independent. \u201cFor the prestige, for what the club is, for the history.\u201d\n\nChelsea are in many ways the archetypal modern Champions League club. And even if that history is relatively recent, and borne of the first of the super-club resources, they have gone through one of the competition\u2019s classically compelling journeys. They\u2019ve suffered a lot of long nights of the soul, that so many of the European Cup\u2019s greats did.\n\nRoman Abramovich made them a super-club just at the point it was evolving into a financially tiered super-club competition, and they embarked on one of those holy grail quests. Lampard was there at the centre of it all. His relationship with the Champions League is pretty much their relationship with the Champions League.\n\nThey had only one season in it before he got there, and haven\u2019t been beyond the last 16 since he left.\n\nIt is similarly fitting that it was very Champions League qualification that saw Abramovich arrive, but goes even further. Without the Champions League, the club may not even exist.\n\nThat was the perilous state of the club\u2019s finances on the last day of the 2002-03 season. Those were the stakes of that match against Liverpool.\n\nIt was win or genuinely go bust, as chief executive Trevor Birch stressed in a surprising team talk.\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure that Chelsea FC will still exist next season, you have to make the Champions League,\u201d Birch said. \u201cIn short, if you fail to beat Liverpool then the club will go out of business.\u201d\n\nThe team didn\u2019t come up short. They won, and it meant more than Champions League qualification. It meant Abramovich was willing to buy the club.\n\nThat era\u2019s first great night - and what many see as the ignition of the new era - came in the Champions League, when they finally claimed a big win over Arsene Wenger\u2019s Arsenal. With the score at 2-2 on aggregate and headed for extra-time as it headed into the 87th minute of the second leg, Lampard surged into the box hoping for a cut-back from Wayne Bridge. The left-back just powered the ball into the net.\n\nThat was the explosion they needed, but not yet the experience. Claudio Ranieri made some tactical decisions for the semi-finals against Monaco that surprised the players but - unlike, say, in 2007-08 or 2011-12 - the Chelsea squad didn\u2019t yet have that battle-hardened nous to almost self-manage such games and navigate their own path.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years at Chelsea we encountered the same thing,\u201d Lampard wrote in his autobiography. \u201cEuropean teams can be very \u2018cute\u2019 in the manner in which they draw you in and then punish you.\u201d\n\nThe midfielder felt he himself was caught out once too often, because he didn\u2019t yet have that canniness.\n\nSome figures who have faced Chelsea this season do wonder whether there is a similar naivety to his tactical management right now, that could especially cost them in Europe. The better Champions League sides will relish the vast open spaces behind that midfield, that puts such a burden on N\u2019Golo Kante.\n\nIn that sense, it was maybe even more fortunate they have a more forgiving group. It seems right now like it could still be the tightest of groups, and exacting in so many ways.\n\nThe encouraging element for Chelsea is that the Champions League has offered such proof of Lampard\u2019s ability to learn and evolve. It was what so many opposition players respected. It was what so many teammates lionised: that game intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started playing Champions League regularly that I felt comfortable and able to really read and react with confidence in that situation,\u201d Lampard added.\n\nIt was the utter assurance of a Champions League winner like Jose Mourinho that really bolstered that confidence. Lampard credits the Portuguese with transforming him into an elite player, and transforming Chelsea into a truly elite team; a semi-final team.\n\nBut that became the curious problem, and great frustration. Chelsea were by then clearly good enough to be the European champions - and were probably the continent\u2019s best team in 2005 - but the issue was not quality, or even mentality. It was actually that they were so close that they encountered one of the Champions League\u2019s great contradictions. The better you were, and further you went, the greater the danger of the most innocuous of moments. The quicker it could all go up.\n\nConsider some of the ways Chelsea were knocked out between 2004 and 2011, some of the margins. There was: a \u201cghost goal\u201d and a shot that may not have crossed the line; there were two penalty shoot-outs, one of which saw the captain literally slip at the decisive moment; there was a spectacular injury-time goal after so many decisions went against them; there was a defeat to a former manager and - through all that - four eliminations to English clubs they often got the better of doemstically.\n\nNames like Luis Garcia, Dirk Kuyt and Andres Iniesta will forever be imprinted onto Chelsea\u2019s Champions legacy, all important parts of the journey that eventually ensured its completion by honing the team.\n\nBut the competition itself is also imprinted onto Lampard\u2019s consciousness in a deeper way, a more important way beyond the trivialities of football.\n\nIt was in the middle of all this, and the middle of a semi-final tie against Liverpool in 2008, that he lost his mother Pat.\n\nDevastated, Lampard still told Avram Grant he was determined to play, if as much for her memory. The manager\u2019s sensitive approach meant the player was forever appreciative.\n\nAnd it afforded a moment they\u2019ll forever remember. The Champions League brought that first emotional tribute to his mother, as he scored a decisive penalty against Liverpool.\n\nIt meant so much to him, and was thereby fitting it meant so much as a moment: it was the goal that got Chelsea into a first ever final.\n\nLampard naturally reflected on much of this before that long-awaited victory in Munich in 2012.\n\nHis mother was foremost in his mind, but so were so many of the trials in the competition over the previous nine years.\n\n\u201cEvery year we get asked the same questions: 'Is this the year? How inspired are you by the failures of years before?' And every year we have failed obviously because we haven't done it. Every year that goes past without winning makes it even more\u2026 we\u2019ve been so close so many times. Just desperate to win it.\u201d\n\nThey of course won it against the odds, against Bayern Munich in the German club\u2019s own stadium, when they never looked further away. They were even a goal down going into stoppage time.\n\nThe smallest margins, the greatest outpouring, so much inverted and released.\n\n\u201cI've never been so emotional in a game,\u201d Lampard said afterwards.\n\nThere have rarely been players as conscious of the Champions League as Lampard. He\u2019s ready to form a new legacy in it as a manager.", "description": "In the midst of his individual office meetings with the Chelsea squad through pre-season, and at the end of his talk with Pedro Rodriguez, Frank Lampard just couldn\u2019t help himself.
