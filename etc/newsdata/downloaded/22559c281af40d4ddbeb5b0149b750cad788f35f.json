Prices turned south in August and have struggled to find support around $46 the past few weeks. The moving averages are mixed with the 50-day moving average line in a declining mode or bearish slope, and the 200-day moving average line is still in an uptrend.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been in a downtrend from June and reminds us that sellers of CSCO have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator in in a bearish configuration below the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of CSCO, below, we can see that prices are below the still rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nTrading volume looks like it has diminished a bit over the past three months but the OBV line has declined from April and looks like it has made a new low for the move down. A declining OBV line tells us that sellers are more aggressive.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is in a sell mode below the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of CSCO, below, we can see that the program is projecting a possible downside price target of $42 for CSCO. Not all that terrible but it would mean that the $46 support area was broken and that the $46-$49 area would become new chart resistance.\n\nBottom line strategy: The chart of CSCO needs a strong rally above $50 to improve and strengthen the chart. Until that happens it may be better to avoid the long side.", "description": "Let's check the latest charts and indicators of this network technology company to see what they suggest for the weeks ahead....CSCO", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Avoid The Long Side Of Cisco Until It Can Get Back Above", "Let'S Check The Latest Charts", "Indicators Of This Network Technology Company To See What They Suggest For The Weeks Ahead.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Mark Sebastian", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Helene Meisler"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bfb849e0-a163-11e8-9bb0-8b8b780e464c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
