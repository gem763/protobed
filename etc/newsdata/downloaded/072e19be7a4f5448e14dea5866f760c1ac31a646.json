(Photo: Rich Polk, Getty Images for Nights of the J)\n\nTori Spelling is not here for being mom shamed.\n\nThe \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" alum said \"screw the shamers\" after some critics left negative comments on an Instagram post about her daughters' dyed hair and makeup.\n\nThe mom of five attended a L.O.L. Surprise! Winter Disco launch party with three of her kids and husband Dean McDermott and shared photos to her social media page. Her daughters, Stella, 11, and Hattie, 7, were pictured wearing reddish hair dye and pink makeup on their eyelids.\n\nWhile it appeared that most comments were positive,, one said that the girls were too young to be wearing makeup and dyeing their hair.\n\n\"What is with all the makeup and dying those girls hair? Too young for that Tori!!!!\" the commenter wrote.\n\nIn an interview with US Weekly, Spelling said her family was at a costume party where everyone was encouraged to come dressed as their favorite L.O.L. doll.\n\n\"First of all, it was Halloween costumes in pink, and it washes out the next day,\u201d the mom told Us Weekly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dye at all. The party, was like, come dressed as your favorite L.O.L. It was a costume dress party where girls can be anything they want to be and screw the shamers.\"\n\nSpelling isn't the first celebrity mom to get dissed for dyeing her daughter's hair \u2014 whether permanently or temporarily.\n\nJessica Simpson recently faced backlash for letting her 7-year-old daughter Maxwell Drew add purple highlights to her long blonde locks. The look was inspired by Disney Channel's \"Descendants\" film franchise.\n\n\"So sad to see a child this young getting her hair dyed. She looked so much prettier with her natural golden locks. She still should be a child in every sense,\" one commented.\n\nSimpson did not respond to the critics, but singer Pink did.\n\nThe fellow mom, who's faced her own battles with the parenting police, took to Instagram to defend Simpson by sharing a photo of herself dyeing her 8-year-old daughter Willow's hair blue.\n\nShe added several hashtags like \"blue hair don't care,\" \"get your own kids\" and \"parent police are actually just lonely sad people.\"\n\nContributing Cydney Henderson\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/03/tori-spelling-criticized-over-daughters-dyed-hair-claps-back/3855369002/", "description": "\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" alum Tori Spelling was criticized for letting her daughters dye their hair for a costume party.
