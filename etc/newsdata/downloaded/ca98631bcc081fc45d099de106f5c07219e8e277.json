The official Hurricane Dorian death toll is rising more slowly.", "language": "en", "text": "Rescuers from Gainesville, Fla., recover a body from rubble in the Bahamas\u2019 Peas neighborhood (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the rubble that was once the most densely populated neighborhood on Great Abaco Island, the only sound Monday morning was the groan of the newly arrived bulldozer, crushing glass and wood as it inched closer to the bodies.\n\n\u201cWe found five under the debris,\u201d reported Joseph Hillhouse, an assistant fire chief from Gainesville, Fla. \u201cNow we\u2019re waiting for help to get them out.\u201d\n\nIt was a week after Hurricane Dorian made landfall here, and efforts to rescue survivors had given way to the slow, grim work of rooting through the wreckage for the dead.\n\nThe reports came in from family members and neighbors. The body of one man was found clutching his son. Another was entangled on a fence. Another was halfway through a door, frozen in a futile attempt at escaping the most powerful storm ever to assault this island nation.\n\nWith each new lead, American and Bahamian recovery workers lumbered forward into the debris, wearing white hazmat suits and masks. There were a few dozen workers, not nearly enough to conduct an effective search of the comprehensive destruction.\n\nThe Mudd and Peas, among the poorest neighborhoods on Great Abaco, were flattened last week by the Category 5 hurricane. A search of less than one-tenth of the area on Sunday yielded five bodies.\n\n\u201cBased on our experience so far,\u201d Hillhouse said, \u201cI\u2019d say there are a lot more.\u201d\n\n[In Dorian\u2019s wake, a shattered town haunted by its missing]\n\nThe Bahamian government has been slow to raise its official death toll, which stood Monday evening at 50. The count did not include the bodies the teams on Great Abaco found during the day.\n\nMuch larger numbers have been circulating. The Punch, a Nassau tabloid, ran a front-page headline Monday suggesting a final count in the thousands. Other local media have run similar stories.\n\nThat bothers Wendell Dean. He was working in the local morgue, which has been overwhelmed with bodies. Workers have resorted to storing the surplus bodies in a refrigerated container.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unfair to throw these numbers all over the place,\u201d Dean said. \u201cIt only adds to the anxiety.\u201d\n\nBahamian officials have declined to speculate about how many deaths remain uncounted. They say they expect the number to rise dramatically.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know and have been reluctant to put a range of expected deaths out there,\u201d said Duane Sands, the country\u2019s health minister. \u201cBut I will say it\u2019s likely to be a significant and unimaginable toll.\u201d\n\nThe priority now, he said, is on the living.\n\n\u201cTeams are focused on fundamental issues of getting food, water, shelter, clothing and comfort to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it is critically important to find everybody who perished, it is more important right now to find those that have survived and make sure nobody else perishes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s standard in natural disasters, according to Trevor Rhodes, the domestic emergency response manager for the International Medical Corps.\n\n\u201cUntil first responders have gone through and identified individuals with life-threatening conditions that they can save, the main focus won\u2019t be on counting the number of fatalities,\u201d he said.\n\nDean stood outside the container Monday morning, waiting for the next body to arrive.\n\nThere was a Bahamian team out looking, the Florida firefighters, and another team from Fairfax, Va., contracted through the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nWhen the bulldozer arrived in the early afternoon, the Bahamian and Florida teams followed it through the wreckage.\n\n\u201cAdult male,\u201d they wrote in black marker on a white sheet before wrapping a body in it.\n\nWorkers found the body of a man face down near a clothesline, the T-shirts somehow still blowing in the wind. Six workers carried it away.\n\nTrucks lay upside down and boats on their sides. Flat-screen televisions were strewn alongside underwear and a Haitian woman\u2019s photo ID.\n\nOne Bahamian worker shook her head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why some things survived and some didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\n[In the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, waiting for relief amid the bodies]\n\nNo one knows how many people remain missing after the storm. The website DorianPeopleSearch.com, where people may enter the names of lost loved ones, contained thousands of names on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to now hone this thing down,\u201d Sands said. \u201cThere must also be many more missing, since lots of people don\u2019t have power to charge their cellphones or communicate.\u201d\n\nAs Bahamians desperate for information grew angry, the country\u2019s emergency management agency explained its search plans late Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe island has been put into a grid system and the recovery team will check each section for persons who are still alive [and] any bodies that need to be recovered,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nBut in Abaco\u2019s hardest-hit neighborhoods, the task was more haphazard than the statement suggested. Because so little debris had been cleared, the Florida team set up a system of ropes to get closer to bodies. There were no stretchers, so team members used blankets they found on the ground to lift bodies.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand the emotional and mental toll it takes on us,\u201d Dean said.\n\nSands described a \u201claborious, painstaking, meticulous process,\u201d made more challenging by impassable roads and damaged bridges.\n\nOn Monday, the discovery of one body led to the discovery of another.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re hearing that there are four more,\u201d one of the Bahamian workers said about 3 p.m.\n\nThe team members took off their protective gear and rested in the shade, everyone covered in sweat. They were coming to terms with what many experts already suspected \u2014 given the nature of the storm, many bodies would probably never be recovered.\n\n\u201cGiven the storm surge and significant flooding from the hurricane, it is likely that some bodies may have washed out to sea,\u201d said Esther Mary de Gourville, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative to the Bahamas. \u201cThe exact death count may never be known.\u201d\n\nKrygier reported from Miami.\n\nRead more\n\nFirst, 40 hours of terror.
