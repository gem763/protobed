I get it. You\u2019re not the first person to spin the right-wing victim narrative in front of me. Why don\u2019t we focus on impeachment? On rule of law.\n\nF.M.: Fine. Bottom line: I would be open to impeachment if you cared about my problems. I\u2019d be open if all those silent Republican dissenters in the Senate had given me some G.O.P. alternative candidate who speaks our language and addresses our issues. I\u2019d be open if there was a moderate Democratic Party that I thought deserved a shot. But I only see Democrats who\u2019d make everything worse: Open the border! Socialism! More power to Washington! You could have paid attention to the forces driving Trumpism, but you ignored us.\n\nSo please don\u2019t ask us to sign up for our own obliteration or support your impeachment. This is about identity and pride.\n\nHere\u2019s a confession. I used to think Trump was a jerk. Now, after three years of battle, I see him as my captain. He deserves my loyalty, thick and thin.\n\nSee ya\u2019 in hell, brother.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Brooks", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Voters.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
