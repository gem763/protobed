Well that says it all doesn\u2019t it,\u2019 said the world champion, dismissively.\n\n\u2018The first time you go somewhere you never know, but if you\u2019re entering the tournament a second time you can\u2019t pick faults after you play for the second time.\n\n\u2018I want to play in every event that I can, last year was a bit disappointing here, it wasn\u2019t quite up to scratch, but they\u2019ve made a few changes.\n\n\u2018Anyone that\u2019s entered it this year can\u2019t really moan about conditions, they knew what they were like last year.\u2019\n\nThere have been some logistical changes to the venue since last year, with the practice room being moved, but the Rocket remains unconvinced by the West Sussex leisure centre.\n\n\u2018It hasn\u2019t changed as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u2019 said the five-time world champion. \u2018You\u2019d have to do a lot to change this place, wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019d have to do an overall refurb on this place, but I\u2019m not surprised, it is what I expected it to be.\u2019\n\nTrump hammered O\u2019Sullivan 10-4 in the Masters final (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nTrump and O\u2019Sullivan have not met on the table yet this season, but many snooker fans will be hoping they come through their parts of the draw in Crawley to set up a huge semi-final this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair played three classic matches last season, with Trump winning in the finals of the Northern Ireland Open and Masters, before O\u2019Sullivan gained a measure of revenge by edging the Bristolian 10-9 in the Tour Championship semi-finals.\n\nTrump will face Sam Baird or Daniel Wells in the second round this week, with the Rocket taking on Yuan Sijun or Igor Figueiredo.\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan says he could still have 15 years left at the top of snooker\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan reignites attack on English Open: \u2018Every day in Crawley is a day lost in my life\u2019", "description": "Judd Trump is not impressed with Ronnie O'Sullivan's criticism of the English Open in Crawley and suggests the Rocket should stop moaning.
