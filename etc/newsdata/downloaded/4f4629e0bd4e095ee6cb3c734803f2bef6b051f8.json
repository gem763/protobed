But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility,\u201d the letter sent to Warner Bros. said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\u201d\n\nThe family members described the Aurora shooter was a \u201csocially isolated individual\u201d, drawing a line to the Joker as he\u2019s portrayed in the new movie, which serves as the comic villain\u2019s origin story. The character \u2014 played by Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 is presented as someone whose run of bad luck, tough breaks and ostracization from mainstream society leads to him becoming increasingly angry and radicalized.\n\nWriting for TIME, Stephanie Zacharek described the Joker as \u201cthe world\u2019s saddest punching bag.\u201d Listing a litany of woes the plot rains down on him, she continues:\n\nAs you can probably guess, all of Arthur\u2019s travails are leading up to a series of \u201cSee what you made me do?\u201d brutalities, most of which happen while he\u2019s dressed up in his clown suit. Violence makes him feel more in control, less pathetic. Killing \u2014 usually with a gun, but scissors or a good old-fashioned suffocation will do just fine \u2014 empowers him.\n\nIn this context, the letter expresses concern that the film \u201cpresents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story.\u201d\n\nThe letter then asks for Warner Bros. to take specific actions: ending political contributions to candidates who take money from the NRA, use their political leverage in Congress to lobby for gun reform and help fund survivor funds and gun control intervention programs.\n\nAmong the signatures are Sandy and Lonnie Phillips, whose daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of the 12 people killed, and Theresa Hoover, who lost her 18-year-old son Alexander J. Boik. Other signees include Heather Dearman, whose cousin, Ashley Moser, lost a 6-year-old daughter and an unborn child, and Tiina Coon, whose son witnessed the shooting.\n\n\u201cSince the federal government has failed to pass reforms that raise the standard for gun ownership in America, large companies like Warner Brothers have a responsibility to act. We certainly hope that you do,\u201d the letter says.\n\nThe new Joker film will not play at the site of the shooting, the now renamed Century Aurora and XD, an employee at the movie theater confirmed to TIME on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement sent to TIME, Warner Bros. acknowledged that \u201cgun violence in our society is a critical issue\u201d and says that the company has a long history of donating to victims of violence. \u201cIn recent weeks, our parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic,\u201d the statement notes.\n\nThe company also argues that job as cinematic storytellers is in part to incite tough conversations on complex issues, but that they are not in anyway supporting violence or violent rhetoric.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "Family members who lost relatives in the Aurora mass shooting are asking for Warner Bros. to get involved with the gun control fight.", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/the-joker-review.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
