I hear a lot of heartbreaking, hard-luck stories about promising lives derailed.\n\nBut scratch the surface and almost all of the homeless I meet have one big problem: addiction.\n\nSo it was no surprise to me to learn that the dealer who attacked me is a drug user himself, a rough-sleeper caught up in a vicious cycle of selling drugs to fund his own habit.\n\nI was quite literally standing in his way, which made me an obvious target.\n\nOthers will doubtless not be so lucky.\n\nI have huge sympathy for people living on the streets.\n\nBy profession, I'm a lecturer and writer on social housing.\n\nI was a volunteer at this soup kitchen for 12 years and now I run the place.\n\nI've often heard that austerity is to blame for the very obvious rise in homelessness and rough-sleeping in our towns and cities over the past few years.\n\nBut cuts in Government spending rarely make people live on the streets \u2013 in my day-to-day, hands-on experience, drink and drug abuse does.\n\nI work with many drug users and their lives are in chaos.\n\nAusterity is not the problem: The charity boss said the only way to curb homeless is to tackle the issue at its root cause - stopping the \u00a31 billion getting to drugs gangs on the streets\n\nOften their health \u2013 physical and mental \u2013 is poor.\n\nTheir life expectancy is drastically diminished.\n\nI have seen nothing sadder than the grieving parents I meet whose children have died because of drugs.\n\nThe waste, the tragedy and the misery makes me angry.\n\nBut the targets of my fury are not the street-sleepers but the smugly fashionable middle-class drug users who are fuelling this evil trade.\n\nIf there was no demand for a few lines of cocaine at well-to-do supper parties or on nights out after work, children would not be getting stabbed and shot pretty much every day in London and around the country.\n\nPeople prefer to keep quiet about middle-class drug use but this is what drives the trade \u2013 the scale is staggering.\n\nOnly last week, it was revealed that London is the \u00a31 billion-a-year cocaine capital of Europe.\n\nPeople in the capital snort more of the drug than the populations of Barcelona, Berlin and Amsterdam combined.\n\nSmall wonder that there has been a surge in gang-related shootings and stabbings, and the recruitment of schoolchildren to be 'county lines' couriers from the cities to the shires.\n\nStabbed: Mr Stone revealed how he was attacked by a drug dealer sleeping rough on London's streets\n\nIt is all funded by middle-class cash, which means that those who blithely dismiss recreational drugs as a harmless bit of fun are either wilfully ignorant of the damage they cause or else they are unspeakable hypocrites.\n\nEither way, they have the blood of children on their hands.\n\nIt is the elephant in the middle-class dining room. If you take away the well-heeled buyer and their easy money, the street violence will disappear in a flash.\n\nThat's why it's time we exposed the fashionable lie that cocaine and other drugs are glamorous.\n\nDrugs aren't harmless \u2013 they are highly destructive and it's only by accepting this that we can start to build a culture where buying or using illegal drugs becomes socially unacceptable, as with drink-driving and smoking in public.\n\nPublic opinion can be changed. We need to create a sense of moral outrage at the terrible price paid by the poorest and weakest among us.\n\nIs the reason that so few fashionable or powerful people speak out about drugs is that many have used them or know people who do?\n\nI know one man who moved to Surrey because of the increasing number of shootings in his smart London street.\n\nYet that same wealthy individual, who works in the music business, would offer lines of cocaine at parties.\n\nHomeless by choice: The soup kitchen manager said they could sleep in hostels but their spiral into drugs led them to remain on the streets\n\nI'm sure he never made the connection between his drug use and rising gun crime, or link it to the sight of people begging on the streets, which has become the new norm in towns and cities over the past decade.\n\nDon't blame austerity when you see these people.\n\nThey are homeless by choice. There are hostels and beds available to help them, but most street-sleepers will have been banned because of their lifestyle: drug use, selling drugs or anti-social behaviour.\n\nAnd they often die on the streets \u2013 the latest official statistics show the biggest increase in deaths among rough-sleepers last year was from drug-related causes.\n\nI'm not finger-pointing because drug addicts have an obvious susceptibility. But sometimes people need to be protected from themselves, as well as other people.\n\nThat is why John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, was correct when he called for people to donate to homelessness and drugs charities rather than give money to street beggars who will probably use the cash to fund their drug habits.\n\nDeath toll: Drugs have led to a raise in deaths in rough sleepers, according to Mr Stone\n\nWe must get people off the streets, off drugs and into the many centres that can help them.\n\nTwo years ago, I helped create a website, Next Meal, which uses GPS-location software to direct rough-sleepers to their nearest soup kitchen, hostel or shelter run by organisations such as Centrepoint, Crisis, St Mungo's and the Salvation Army.\n\nThese places do fantastic jobs for thousands of people, including one man I know whose life was completely turned around by the brilliant Westminster drug outreach unit.\n\nThe website was recognised with a Prime Minister's Points Of Light award last year for making a contribution to reducing homelessness.\n\nBut helping from the bottom up can only go so far.\n\nReal change will be made by cutting off the supply of the money to drugs gangs \u2013 the \u00a31 billion a year that is spent to keep wealthy Londoners supplied with cocaine.\n\nIt is shameful.\n\nFor more information, visit nextmeal.co.uk\n\n\n\n", "description": "Soup kitchen manager Martin Stone reveals he has to wear a stab vest as he dishes out food in leafy Muswell Hill to the homeless and blames middle-class drug use for the current crime crisis.", "authors": ["Martin Stone For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/20/19634724-0-image-a-4_1570909991582.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
