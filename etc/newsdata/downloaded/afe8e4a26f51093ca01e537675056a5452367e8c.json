People\u2019s focus has been shifted onto those complex and fundamental issues at the heart of Hong Kong\u2019s identity.\n\nFrom a local perspective, a militant and reluctant government revealed the inconvenient truth of Hong Kong society since the handover \u2013 the lack of democracy. It explains the perpetual struggle of Hong Kongers every weekend since Carrie Lam repeatedly decreed the death and solemn retreat of the extradition bill over the last two months.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

All the issues derived from the anti-extradition bill movement are the consequences of an absence of democracy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A Hong Kong man accused of murder in Taiwan served to highlight the tense arrangements between the three territories. China maintains an offer to Taiwan of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d that has applied to Hong Kong since 1997, but President Tsai has noted that such an arrangement had left Hong Kong \u201con the edge of disorder\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s status, de-facto sovereignty and jurisdiction are more in play than they were.\n\nFrom the international perspective, we can observe that China\u2019s handling of the Hong Kong issues is exactly the same as in the extradition disputes around Huawei\u2019s CFO Sabrina Meng, arrested in Canada and now facing extradition to the US.\n\nIn Meng\u2019s case, two Canadians were detained as hostages in response. And it is widely believed that the detention of a British civil servant (since released) and two US citizens came as retribution for both countries\u2019 stance on Hong Kong\u2019s affairs. In our view, the international community is becoming disillusioned by countless examples of Chinese interference in Hong Kong and has realised that \u201cone country, two systems\u201d is far more fragile an idea than they hoped. In fact, it has been revealed as a menace to their business interests in Hong Kong.\n\nThis delayed official withdrawal of the extradition bill is not going to resolve Hong Kong\u2019s problems All it ever did was unwrap the rotten essence at the core of Hong Kong politics. Fortunately, at the same time, we believe the international community has woken up to the idea that the spectre of Chinese involvement in the running of Hong Kong calls into question the trust needed to support their business or political interests in the city.\n\nIn the US, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is moving through the legislative procedure. If passed, it will enable the US to impose individual sanctions against Hong Kong officials who openly violate the universal values of human rights and democracy. The freezing of assets and bans on US entry will become possible and, crucially, it means no one can jeopardise human rights and democracy without the risk of consequences.\n\nNow, we are trying to initiate similar acts in other sympathetic countries through active lobbying. We want to optimise such international coordination against the autocratic and inhuman Hong Kong government.\n\nThe UK, as a responsible member of the international community and our former metropole, could do far more. Britain could include human rights clauses in future trade deals with Hong Kong and China after Brexit, which would certainly strengthen British leverage in monitoring the implementation of Sino-British Joint Declaration which established Hong Kong\u2019s status.\n\nFurthermore, legalising an official mechanism that enables the UK to impose individual sanctions and to revoke the citizenship of those Hong Kong officials who prove to be inconsistent with core British values would serve to forestall the worsening Hong Kong business and political environment.\n\nLet us stand for human rights and democracy with solidarity.\n\nJoshua Wong is secretary-general of Demosisto; Billy Fung is former president of Hong Kong University Student Union", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council may have finally, officially withdrawn the extradition bill, but it cannot pretend it can heal Hong Kong\u2019s society \u2013\u00a0or wipe away the memory of this year\u2019s protests\u00a0 The bill itself revealed score of deep-rooted problems which are intertwined with local and international factors that cannot be resolved by a single legislative act.
