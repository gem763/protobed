After all, such noise is known to interrupt whales\u2019 foraging and interfere with their vocal interactions. But although some whales do adapt, in limited ways, to artificial sounds in the ocean\u2014by pausing their calls to avoid competing with the passage of cargo ships, for example\u2014scientists don\u2019t believe that the deepening whale calls are a response to sonic pollution. They have identified lowered pitches even across populations of whales that live in seas without major shipping routes, where mechanical noise is negligible.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the change in whale calls is the achievements of global conservation efforts. At the start of the 20th century, an estimated 239,000 Antarctic blue whales occupied the Southern Ocean. By the early 1970s, decades of commercial whaling\u2014initially by Norwegian and British whalers, and later by illegal Soviet fleets\u2014had decreased the blue-whale population in the region to a mere 360. But since protection of the subspecies began in 1966, that number has begun to rebound. Scientists have speculated that the whale\u2019s anatomy determines that the louder it gets, the higher the pitch of its calls. As populations have grown, then, the whales may have decreased their volume because they are more likely to be communicating over short distances. In other words, Antarctic blue whales may be lower-toned today than in previous decades simply because they no longer need to shout.\n\nFrom September 2018: Giants of the deep\n\nLast year\u2019s study of whale calls also suggests a more ominous reason for the drop in pitch, however: Perhaps whales don\u2019t need to be so loud because sound waves travel farther in oceans made acidic by the absorption of carbon dioxide.\n\nCarbon dioxide in the atmosphere, meanwhile, may indirectly influence whale voices in other ways. Recent monitoring of Antarctic blue whales shows that, during the austral summer, their pitch rises. Researchers have hypothesized that in warmer months, the whales must use their forte volume to be heard amid the cracking ice\u2014a natural sound amplified by unnatural processes, as rising temperatures exacerbate ice-melt. So the impacts of a warming planet may modulate animal sounds even in remote places with barely any humans, and where the most thunderous notes come not from ships, but from the clatter of breaking ice.\n\nWe may not yet know what the sounds of blue whales mean. But whether through our intent to preserve these creatures, or as a result of refashioning their environment, our deeds echo in their voices.\n\nThis article appears in the October 2019 print edition with the headline \u201cGoing Deep.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
