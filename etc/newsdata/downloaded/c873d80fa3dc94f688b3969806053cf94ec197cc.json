Be skeptical about that \u2014 unless you are convinced the U.S. economy is heading into a recession.\n\nGrowth has been king over the past 15 years, and if you still want to adopt that strategy for some of your portfolio, the $5.2 billion T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund PRWAX, +0.64% has beaten its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index RLG, +0.60%, for most of those periods. Justin White, the fund\u2019s portfolio manager, explained the fund\u2019s strategy and his stock-picking method in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nWhen considering the recent mixed economic news, White was upbeat: \u201cConsumers have been rock-solid. Consumers are two-thirds of the [U.S.] economy and [their spending is] growing 4%. It is really hard to get GDP to go negative if the consumer is healthy.\u201d\n\nPerformance\n\nHere\u2019s a 15-year chart comparing the total returns of the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund, its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index RLG, +0.60% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.69% :\n\nFactSet\n\nHere\u2019s a chart comparing the average annual performance of the fund, the Russell 1000 Growth Index and the S&P 500:\n\nAvg. return - 3 years Avg. return - 5 years Avg. return - 10 years Avg. return - 15 years Avg. return - 20 years T. Rowe Price New America Fund 18.9% 15.0% 14.5% 11.1% 7.9% Russell 1000 Growth Index 17.8% 14.6% 14.7% 10.5% 6.0% S&P 500 14.0% 11.9% 13.0% 9.0% 6.5% Source: FactSet\n\nThe fund\u2019s returns are net of annual expenses, which come to 0.79% of assets under management, which Morningstar considers \u201caverage\u201d for its \u201cU.S. Fund Large Growth\u201d category. It rates the fund four stars out of five. Two low-cost ways to invest in the entire Russell 1000 Growth Index are the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF, +0.59%, which has an annual expense ratio of 0.19%, and the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF VONG, +0.60%, with a 0.12% expense ratio.\n\nStrategy\n\nWhite has been managing the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund since April 2016, after working for eight years as an analyst for the firm. You can see on the table above that the fund has been outperforming its benchmark during his tenure as portfolio manager.\n\nThe fund\u2019s strategy is to outperform its benchmark by identifying U.S. stocks with the best growth potential.\n\nWhite said he developed \u201cfour pillars\u201d of criteria to select stocks:\n\n\u2022 Quality: This includes assessments of the health of the industry, whether the company is gaining market share and the quality of management.\n\n\u2022 Expectations: This will include a comparison of T. Rowe Price\u2019s estimates for whatever drives the stock (sales growth, earnings growth, subscriber growth, etc.) to consensus estimates. \u201cHow much confidence do we have? Is the magnitude we are above meaningful for the type of business we are considering?\u201d White said. He provided an example: Being 3% ahead of consensus for Tesla TSLA, -1.34% would be far less meaningful than being 3% ahead for Comcast CMCSA, +1.12%.\n\n\u2022 Acceleration/deceleration: This is a set of quantitative assessments of whether revenue \u201cis on the cusp of growing rapidly,\u201d or if profit margins or returns on capital are \u201cpoised to expand,\u201d White said.\n\n\u2022 Valuation: White said he focuses more on cash flow and discounted cash flow than he does on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which \u201cdoes not always correlate the same way to value creation.\u201d He will on occasion look at EBITDA if it is appropriate for a company.\n\nT. Rowe Price Justin White, manager of the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund.\n\nWhite also said he manages risk by applying a \u201ctop-down screen\u201d to the portfolio to make sure it is not overly concentrated in industries or sectors. He generally avoids making concentrated sector bets, but said: \u201cRight now I cannot find good ideas in [consumer] staples, but I have found them in utilities, so I am 300 basis points overweight on utilities [compared with the Russell 1000 Growth Index] and 300 under in staples. I am a bit ahead in tech and a bit below in industrials, but this results from individual picks.\u201d\n\nAbbVie and HCA\n\nWhite named two examples of companies held by the fund that fit his \u201cfour pillars\u201d:\n\nWhite said he began purchasing shares of AbbVie ABBV, +1.10% several months ago when the stock was trading in the $60s and its dividend yield was bout 6.5%. The shares closed on Oct. 18 at $73.63, with a dividend yield of 6.33%. The shares were trading for 7.2 times the consensus earnings estimate for the next 12 months, among analysts polled by FactSet. That compares to a forward P/E valuation of 17 for the S&P 500.\n\nThere are two reasons for AbbVie\u2019s low P/E valuation: Humira, the company\u2019s autoimmune medication, comes off patent in 2023. The company also agreed in June to acquire Allergan AGN, +0.63% in a stock and cash deal that valued the target at $63 billion.\n\nAllergan\u2019s shares are \u201cway too cheap,\u201d White said, because \u201cpeople are assuming too extreme of an erosion\u201d of its business when Humira goes generic, especially with two major product launches coming: Skyrizi, a psoriasis treatment, and Rinvoq, to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nEven if the AbbVie/Allergan merger is not completed, \u201cAbbVie looks moderately undervalued to us even on a stand-alone basis,\u201d White said.\n\nHCA Healthcare HCA, -0.02% is the largest hospital operator in the U.S. The shares trade at a forward P/E of 13.6. It\u2019s interesting to see to \u201cvalue plays\u201d in a growth portfolio. White said: \u201cA lot of growth stocks have gotten really expensive. I go where I see opportunities.\u201d\n\nWhite said HCA operates, acquires and improves hospitals in areas \u201cwith favorable demographics.\u201d He sees a long runway for earnings growth and is enthusiastic about the company\u2019s habit of buying back \u201cabout 6% of shares every year,\u201d which boosts earnings per share.\n\nTrimming Netflix\n\nNetflix NFLX, +1.00% made up 0.43% of White\u2019s portfolio as of Sept. 30, and he said he had been reducing the position because he is concerned about the company\u2019s ability to generate enough cash.\n\n\u201cRight now the Street projects positive free cash flow in 2022, approaching $4 billion in 2023. When I look at the math, that just does not look possible because it would mean they would have to slow down content spending dramatically,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Netflix\u2019s estimated negative cash flow is $3.5 billion for 2019, White sees a swing of over $7 billion to be a tall order.\n\n\u201cBy my math, if the Street\u2019s revenue growth numbers are correct, and if content spending at Netflix on a cash basis grows 15% a year, then the only way you can hit the Street\u2019s numbers is if there is zero spending growth in all areas,\u201d he said, adding that the company\u2019s content spending has increased 15% annually in recent years.\n\nIn Netflix\u2019s shareholder letter on Oct. 16, the company\u2019s management said: \u201cAs we move slowly toward FCF [free cash flow] positive, our plan is to continue to use the high-yield market in the interim to finance our investment needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlowly\u201d doesn\u2019t fit with the current consensus of free-cash-flow estimates, White said.\n\nConcentration\n\nThe T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund typically holds about 80 stocks, while the benchmark Russell 1000 Growth Index has about 525. During an interview on Oct. 18, White said: \u201cIt is a hyper-concentrated benchmark now, more than it has ever been.\u201d This means that because the fund\u2019s objective is to beat the return of the index, it is forced to hold similarly large positions in mega-cap stocks unless White is bearish on them.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the five largest holdings of the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (which mirrors the benchmark index) and the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund as of Sept. 30:\n\nSo the fund held the same top five companies as the index did, but allocations were different, especially for Apple AAPL, +1.73%.\n\nLooking past the heavy current concentration of the index and, consequently, his own portfolio, White explained that he prefers to hold stock positions of 2.5% of the portfolio or less. He also gave four examples of stocks held by the fund with concentrations that were much different from those of the index as of Sept: 30:\n\nCompany Ticker Industry T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund weighting Russell 1000 Growth Index weighting Fleetcor Technologies Inc. FLT Misc. Commercial Services 2.74% 0.17% Becton Dickenson & Co. BDX Medical Specialties 2.37% 0.04% NextEra Energy Inc. NEE Electric Utilities 2.06% 0.00% HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA Hospital/Nursing Management 2.16% 0.14% Sources: T. Rowe Price, FactSet\n\nThe \u2018rotation\u2019 may not be happening yet\n\nEven if one investment strategy is winning out over another for a few months by a few return percentage points, it hardly means the market is \u201crotating\u201d in any direction. Typically most investors don\u2019t change their strategies often.\n\nFrom the close on Aug. 27 through the close on Sept 27, the Russell 1000 Value Index RLV, +0.75% returned 5.7%, compared with returns of 0.9% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index RLG, +0.60% and 3.24% for the full Russell 1000 Index RUI, +0.68%. Yes, those dates were selected to underline the \u201crotation,\u201d and it\u2019s a very short period that means nothing to long-term investors.\n\nCheck out the returns for these other short-term periods, which also don\u2019t mean very much:\n\nTotal returns through Oct. 18:\n\nOne week One month Two months Three months Year-to-date 12 months Russell 1000 Index 0.5% -0.7% 3.4% -0.2% 21.0% 9.9% Russell 1000 Growth Index 0.3% -0.4% 2.4% -0.4% 24.4% 12.1% Russell 1000 Value Index 0.7% -1.0% 4.5% 0.0% 17.6% 7.6% S&P 500 0.6% -0.5% 3.7% 0.2% 21.0% 10.1% Source: FactSet\n\nSo the Russell 1000 Value Index has been ahead of the Russell 1000 Growth Index over the past three months, by what pretty much could look like a rounding error. Over the past 12 months, the value index has ranked last.\n\nThe long-term story\n\nInvestors know that the benchmark S&P 500 has had a wonderful ride since the post-crisis bottom in March 2009, led by rapidly growing and very large tech companies (assuming you don\u2019t mind lumping Amazon.com in with that group).\n\nThe Russell 1000 Growth Index and the Russell 1000 Value Index are overlapping subsets of the broad Russell 1000 Index. When I last ran the full index numbers in September, there were 526 companies in the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 760 in the Russell 1000 Value Index, with 288 companies in both. The value list includes companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower expected growth rates. The growth list includes companies that rank lower by the FTSE Russell\u2019s value measures but have higher expected growth rates. FTSE Russell describes the makeup and scoring for all its indexes here.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of long-term average annual returns for all four indexes:\n\n3 years 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years 25 years 30 years Russell 1000 Index 13.8% 11.7% 12.9% 9.2% 6.8% 9.9% 9.91% Russell 1000 Growth Index 17.8% 14.6% 14.7% 10.5% 6.0% 9.7% N/A Russell 1000 Value Index 9.8% 8.7% 11.1% 7.8% 7.1% 9.6% N/A S&P 500 14.0% 11.9% 13.0% 9.0% 6.5% 9.8% 9.81% Source: FactSet\n\nValue wins for 20 years and trails for 25. It\u2019s fascinating to see that the further back you go, the better the broad Russell 1000 strategy looks.", "description": "Justin White uses four \u2018pillars\u2019 for his stock-picking strategy on the T.
