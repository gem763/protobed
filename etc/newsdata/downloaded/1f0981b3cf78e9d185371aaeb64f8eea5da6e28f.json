Stewart was being interviewed about his resignation from the party and how he is running as an independent candidate for London Mayor\n\nIn the clip Rory murmurs to one of the interviewer's before moving forward to greet Bailey with a warm handshake\n\nMr Stewart turns to his interviewer and murmurs as he anticipates the approach of Bailey and an unidentified man just after announcing his intention to quit as the MP for Penrith and the Border at the next general election.\n\nMoments later, Mr Bailey greets him with a shake of the hand without giving eye contact.\n\nThe Tory candidate can be heard saying 'good to see you' and repeats himself while they shake but refuses to hold Mr Stewart's gaze and continues walking with a smirk on his face.\n\nBailey does not stop and chat during the encounter and continues to walk past the camera crew with a wide grin on his face before clapping his hands together and asking 'what's happening?'\n\nBailey tells Stewart it is 'good to see you' before showing a slightly embarrassed smile and strolling away. This is just hours before ITV's Paul Brand revealed Mr Bailey told him: 'If anyone's behind [in the mayoral election] it's Rory Stewart'\n\nHe claps his hands together and asks 'what's happening?' after he passes the camera crew, in the short clip which has gathered 280 likes.\n\nAnd people were quick to share their disbelief at the hastiness of the interaction between them.\n\nGraham Jarvis wrote on Twitter: 'What an opportunity missed. If [Bailey] had stopped just to say a word or two he would have seemed like a nice guy. But he didn't even seem able to look Stewart in the eye.'\n\nAndyDutton10 said: 'What pompous behaviour from Bailey.'\n\nMeanwhile Sally Symonds said 'Shaun is the man' for the interaction.\n\nPaul Brand revealed on Twitter that Mr Bailey told him: 'I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, everyone is freaking out... If anyone\u2019s behind [in the mayoral election] it\u2019s Rory Stewart.'\n\nThis comes just hours after Mr Bailey's Sky News interview where he said Stewart 'has some ground to make up' if he is to become London's mayor.\n\nHe told Sky: 'Ultimately it's a decision for Londoners but I feel there are things [Mr Stewart] will ask them that he might not know as he hasn't lived in the city. He doesn't know what it's like to be homeless like I was, or unemployed in London.'\n\nHe added: 'Some parts of London will be a real challenge for [Mr Stewart]. He has some ground to make up.\n\n'But let's be clear, London is a cosmopolitan, open place. People will receive him and want to explain to him what the challenges are.'\n\nMr Stewart's candidacy could risk splitting the Tory vote as he and Mr Bailey go head-to-head next year.", "description": "Rory Stewart announced his Tory party resignation and standing for London's Mayor before candidate Shaun Bailey walked past and they shared handshake in Victoria Tower Gardens today.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/18/19305370-0-image-a-29_1570209728404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
