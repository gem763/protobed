And after you leave the tattoo artist\u2019s chair, beyond buying stuff to immediately treat your newly inked skin, you\u2019re probably going to want to find the right set of products to keep your art bright and crisp for years to come. When you get tattooed, \u2018your skin cell holds that ink, and when that skin cell dies, it releases the ink into a new skin cell,\u2019 explains tattoo artist Mira Miriah, whose client roster includes celebrities like Ariana Grande and Ilana Glazer. This ongoing transfer of ink is why caring for your skin is so important if you want to keep your tattoo looking its best over time.\n\nAll eight of the tattoo artists we spoke to agreed that the two most important things to keep in mind when caring for your tattoo are hydration and sun protection. Luckily, according to tattoo artist Tamara Santiba\u00f1ez, you don\u2019t need to overthink it \u2014 or spend a ton of money. \u2018Any lotions best for your skin type, as well as using body-safe SPFs, are my personal recommendations to my clients,\u2019 she says. Read on for the best lotions, sunscreens, and oils that Santiba\u00f1ez and our other experts say to use to preserve and protect your ink, all of which they say are effective for any skin type.\n\nBest overall product for preserving and protecting tattoos\n\nSevenhills Wholefoods Organic Extra Virgin Raw Coconut Oil Four of our experts suggest using coconut oil daily to keep your tattooed skin hydrated and healthy. \u2018I apply a thin layer of cold-pressed organic coconut oil on my whole body after showering every morning,\u2019 says Berlin-based blackwork specialist Julim Rosa. Vienna-based Danilo Delfino, who specializes in Brazilian fine-line tattoos, also recommends using coconut oil to preserve tattoos \u2014 especially if you live in a dry, cold area \u2014 because it is rich in fatty acids that soften skin and help it retain moisture, which is why it is great to apply out of the shower, like Rosa does, when the skin is still slightly damp. The tattoo artists at Brooklyn\u2019s Welcome Home Studio also recommend coconut oil, telling us that, when it comes to tattoo-aftercare products, their philosophy is \u2018the more natural, the better.\u2019 \u00a37 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest lighter-weight oil for preserving tattoos\n\nArtNaturals Organic Moroccan Argan Oil If the fattier coconut oil sounds too heavy for your skin, two of our experts suggested going for a lighter-weight argan oil. New York City\u2013based vegan tattooer Em North says it is \u2018the closest you can get to actual human skin oil, and won\u2019t clog your pores like petroleum-based products,\u2019 specifically recommending ArtNatruals organic Argan oil. Rit Kit, who specializes in Ukrainian colourwork, also loves using argan oil, agreeing it does the job when it comes to the \u2018keeping tattooed skin hydrated and healthy.\u2019 \u00a325 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest lotion for preserving tattoos\n\nEucerin Original Healing Lotion If you prefer using a lotion to an oil, Robert Boyle, owner of Brooklyn\u2019s Nice Tattoo Parlor, suggests using an unscented one like Eucerin Original Healing Lotion, which he says can be used from the time your tattoo starts to heal. Boyle also agreed with our other experts that, outside of sunscreen and lotion, there is really no need to get any other products that promise to \u2018preserve or protect.\u2019 According to him, \u2018there are currently quite a few products entering the market that purport to make tattoos last longer, but the science is (for the most part) shaky, and we avoid encouraging our clients to buy them; that doesn\u2019t mean we think they\u2019re bad, we just don\u2019t have any reason to recommend any particular product.\u2019 \u00a315 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest lotion for preserving tattoos in hot, humid climates\n\nNIVEA Cr\u00e8me If you live in a humid or hot climate, Delfino says Nivea Creme is \u2018a very inexpensive and effective option that is lightweight on the skin.\u2019 He also calls it \u2018the perfect travelling companion,\u2019 because it can fit in your pocket. Delfino also shared another tip to keep your tattoos looking fresh: \u2018Drink water! It\u2019s so important to keep your body hydrated from the inside out.\u2019 \u00a36 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest lotion for preserving tattoos on extra-dry skin\n\nViva Naturals Organic Shea Butter North \u2014 who exclusively uses ethically sourced, vegan products \u2014 told us that Viva Natural Organic Shea Butter is ideal \u2018for extra-dry areas,\u2019 because it is chock-full of vitamins A and E, as well as essential fatty acids that will pump your skin full of hydration. \u00a340 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest sunscreen for protecting tattoos\n\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 In addition to using an oil or lotion to hydrate tattooed skin, \u2018the best thing you can do is avoid the sun,\u2019 says Miriah. \u2018Sunscreen helps, but actually blocking your tattoo from the sun with a scarf or something is the best thing you can do.\u2019 To anyone with tattoos in places that are difficult to shield from the sun using clothing, Kit recommends slathering on a \u2018water-resistant, mineral-based, and fragrance-free sunscreen\u2019 like La Roche-Posay Sunscreen SPF 50. She notes that \u2018this is especially important with colour tattoos, because UV exposure accelerates natural fading of colour ink and tattoo vibrancy.\u2019 But Rosa says it\u2019s just as important to protect black-ink tattoos from the sun. \u2018Even black ink can tint blue or green,\u2019 she notes. North agrees: \u2018I can\u2019t stress enough, protect your tattoos from the sun, or they will fade. I\u2019ve seen it happen on my own body.\u2019 \u00a38 at eBay UK Buy\n\nBest lotion with SPF for preserving tattoos\n\nAesop Protective Body Lotion SPF50 If you want to combine your moisturizer and your sunscreen to save some time (and money), Rosa loves Aesop\u2019s Protective Body Lotion, which contains spearmint leaf extract and SPF 50. It is also water-resistant and free of synthetic fragrances. But it it does not contain mineral blockers like the above sunscreen, so it\u2019s probably better to use for brief stints in the sun rather than full days of baking. \u00a330 at Cult Beauty Buy\n\nBest exfoliators for preserving tattoos\n\nAlba Botanica Sea Salt Body Scrub In addition to using SPF and moisturizer, regularly exfoliating your skin is also important for the longevity of your tattoo, according to Mariah and North, who says it will help \u2018keep your tattoos bright.\u2019 North\u2019s favorite, Alba Bot\u00e1nica exfoliator, is a revitalizing sea-salt body scrub, which is formulated with Pacific sea salts to exfoliate dry skin, along with nourishing jojoba, macadamia, avocado, and sweet almond oils to provide hydration. The product is also paraben-, sulfate-, and phthalates-free. \u00a310 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nFresh Brown Sugar Body Polish Mariah\u2019s favorite exfoliator comes from Fresh, and she told us she uses it on her own tattooed skin. \u2018I exfoliate daily with it,\u2019 she says, adding that she thinks it\u2019s best practice to exfoliate daily, or every other day. The Fresh scrub uses brown-sugar crystals to exfoliate, and a blend of evening primrose, sweet almond, and jojoba oil to moisturize. \u00a338 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
