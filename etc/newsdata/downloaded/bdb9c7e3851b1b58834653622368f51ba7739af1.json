Su did not offer any details.\n\nWhile pork prices are likely to rise further, there is also a limit to how much consumers are willing to pay, said Feng Yonghui, chief analyst at industry website Soozhu.com.\n\n\u201cWe are skeptical that hog prices will continue to rise sharply,\u201d he said.", "description": "China's record pork prices are set to rise faster in coming weeks, said analysts on Tuesday, even as official data showed that the nation's most popular meat has already pushed consumer inflation to a six-year high.", "authors": ["Dominique Patton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
