For weeks, the government denied them food and kept them from seeing doctors or family members. The circumstances, one of the girls later told the Times, were \u201ctoo painful to remember, to discuss.\u201d A team of lawyers who went on to represent them and two other girls sued the government, in a case that dragged on for more than a decade, well after the initial plaintiffs were released. By 1997, two Presidential Administrations later, the government decided to settle. Doris Meissner, who was then the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said, \u201cIf there are real issues surrounding the detention of minors, and the government is being held responsible for poor conditions, why are we litigating in favor of what we are doing wrong?\u201d\n\nFor the past twenty-two years, the terms of this legal settlement, known as the Flores Agreement, have been a central tenet of U.S. immigration policy. When dealing with children, the most vulnerable immigrants to enter federal custody, the government must provide certain, baseline protections, including access to food and medical care; it must also promise to detain them for the shortest possible amount of time, in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d settings.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a sweeping new set of regulations to gut the Flores Agreement. \u201cIt is a wholesale attack on kids in custody,\u201d Jennifer Podkul, the policy director of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), told me. The Administration\u2019s immediate target is an outgrowth of the agreement, shored up by a judge a few years ago, which prevents children from being held in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security for more than twenty days. The agreement applies not just to children who came to the U.S. alone but also to those who crossed the border with their parents. This has meant, in effect, that thousands of asylum-seeking families have been released from detention while their cases have moved through the immigration courts. Now, according to Kevin McAleenan, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the government will detain families together for as long as it takes to resolve their immigration claims. For tens of thousands of families, that could easily amount to months in custody\u2014an especially alarming prospect considering that another critical component of Flores, a requirement that the government keep children in licensed facilities overseen by independent monitors, would also fall away under the Administration\u2019s plan.\n\nIn his announcement on Wednesday, McAleenan claimed that \u201call children in U.S. government custody\u201d would be \u201ctreated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.\u201d But his reassurances sound especially hollow at the present moment. In the past year and a half, seven children have died in immigration custody, and there have been widespread complaints about the conditions in which children are being held. Earlier this summer, at a Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas, two hundred and fifty infants, children, and teen-agers spent weeks without adequate food and water, and were denied soap and toothbrushes; despite lice and flu outbreaks, authorities skimped on providing medical care. \u201cThe Flores monitors are the reason we knew about what was happening at Clint,\u201d Podkul said.\n\nOn Monday, a lawyer known as a \u201cspecial master,\u201d who was appointed last year to investigate potential violations of Flores in facilities run by D.H.S. and the Department of Health and Human Services, filed a report with further details. In Customs and Border Protection facilities, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, \u201callegations of severe overcrowding and excessive length of custody, lack of appropriate food for minors, inability of detainees to sleep, ambient temperatures outside a reasonably comfortable range, and lack of access to medical treatment remain unresolved,\u201d the special master wrote. At H.H.S. shelters across the country, the average time that children spent in government custody, between January of 2018 and May of 2019, was sixty-seven days. Nearly three thousand children who turned eighteen while in detention were transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement because they \u201caged out\u201d and were no longer treated as minors.\n\nThe Trump Administration has, from the start, attacked Flores as a \u201cloophole\u201d that immigrant families have continually sought to exploit; closing it was part of a broader mission to deter other families from coming to the U.S. to seek asylum in the first place. In August, 2017, a group of Administration officials met at D.H.S. headquarters, in Washington, to devise a series of policies to restrict the number of asylum seekers entering the country. Among the proposals was separating families at the border and a move to end the Flores agreement. Attendees were also tasked with writing ten separate memos with blueprints for how the Administration could implement each policy goal. \u201cI recall being stumped about what we could do by decree or executive action to get around Flores,\u201d one former official, who was present at the meeting, told me. \u201cIt was one of the memos that floundered,\u201d the former official added, because of its \u201cquestionable legality.\u201d\n\nThe White House decided to work around Flores instead. When the Trump Administration began separating families at the border, in the summer of 2017, part of its rationalization was that, by criminally charging parents for entering the country illegally, the government could detain the adults, and their children would be treated as unaccompanied minors and transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. The government could thus hold the parents indefinitely and penalize the entire family, as the children were kept in conditions that were notionally consistent with the terms of Flores. By late June, 2018, amid a national outcry, Trump promised to stop separating families at the border. But, in the same breath, he announced that the Administration would hold families together instead. Almost immediately, a federal judge in California named Dolly Gee, who is in charge of supervising the government\u2019s compliance with Flores, blocked the Administration. There was a clear precedent for her decision, which the Trump Administration willfully ignored: in 2015, when President Obama responded to a sudden spike in Central American families seeking asylum by trying to detain families in ICE facilities, Gee blocked him, too.\n\nIn September, 2018, the Trump Administration released a two-hundred-page document outlining proposed regulations that would end Flores altogether. Immigration advocates immediately appealed to Gee, in California, who took the challenge under advisement but withheld final judgment until after the Administration\u2019s regulations were entered in the federal register, which is slated for Friday. \u201cThe President is telling [D.H.S.] they must terminate the settlement,\u201d Peter Schey, one of the lead attorneys in the initial Flores class-action suit, told the Washington Post at the time. \u201cThey tried it in court, and now they\u2019re trying it through regulations. But they\u2019re in a bind, because the only way the regulations will be valid is if they\u2019re consistent with the settlement, and if they\u2019re consistent with the settlement then they won\u2019t achieve the changes the President has demanded.\u201d Now the Flores plaintiffs will have a week to amend their suit. Jennifer Nagda, an attorney at the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights, told me, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do a line-by-line comparison between the new regulations and the proposed version from last September to decide how to direct our energy in the next seven days.\u201d\n\nThe broader consequences of the Administration\u2019s rollback could extend well beyond detention conditions. When minors travel to the U.S. alone, for instance, they\u2019re categorized as unaccompanied, a designation that affords them additional rights such as the ability to apply for asylum through an asylum officer, as opposed to a judge in the more adversarial setting of an immigration court. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about being detained,\u201d Podkul said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the next two to three years an immigrant child spends going through the judicial system.\u201d Earlier this summer, an official at H.H.S.\u2014who at the time suspected that the President\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen Miller, was behind an unprecedented push to reclassify unaccompanied children\u2014told me, \u201cThe expectation is that the Administration will change the policy regarding the definition of an unaccompanied child. . . . A child arriving at the border alone will not be declared unaccompanied if they have a parent \u2018available\u2019 in the U.S. to care for them. That means the child will be subject to expedited removal.\u201d The idea, the official added, was to skirt Congress by instituting the change in the form of a regulation, while creating yet another pretext for assailing lawmakers for their failure to take some radical action of their own. And that is exactly what has happened: the regulations announced this week will further whittle away the legal rights of immigrant children. \u201cThe change will end up in court immediately,\u201d the official had told me. But the Administration wanted to send a message anyway.", "description": "Jonathan Blitzer writes about the Trump Administration\u2019s plan to gut the Flores agreement, which, for more than twenty years, has insured protections for children held in government custody.", "authors": ["Jonathan Blitzer", "Dan Piepenbring", "Michael Schulman", "Hua Hsu", "Anna Shechtman", "James B.
