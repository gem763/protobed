Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesperson, warned foreign companies to immediately pull their employees from Saudi energy facilities to avoid becoming targets or victims in future attacks.\n\nThe spokesperson cited Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing role in Yemen\u2019s civil war in threatening future strikes. The Saudi-backed government has been battling the Houthi rebel movement for four years in a conflict that has sent Yemen into a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cRiyadh must reconsider its calculations and stop its attacks and blockade against Yemen,\u201d the general said in his address.\n\nSaudi officials, meanwhile, claim they have proof that the weapons that hit their facilities were in fact Iranian.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said, \u201cPreliminary investigations have revealed that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and work is underway to verify the source of the attacks.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Kingdom pointed to Tehran in being responsible for the weapons, officials fell short of squarely blaming Iran for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom condemns this grave attack that threatens international peace and security, and stresses that the aim of this attack is directed primarily to the global energy supply, an extension of the previous hostile acts against the pumping stations of Saudi Aramco using Iranian weapons,\u201d the ministry tweeted.\n\nThe Trump administration also appeared to ease up on flatly faulting Iran.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper issued a carefully worded tweet following a White House briefing that said his department \u201cis working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump later told reporters that while it \u201ccertainly looks\u201d as though Iran carried out the attacks, he is waiting for additional intelligence to directly point the blame.\n\nThe U.S.\u2019 newly confirmed ambassador to the United Nations, however, gave a much stronger statement directed at Iran\u2019s role \u2014 similar to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s comments just days prior.\n\nAt a U.N. Security Council meeting on the ongoing crisis, Kelly Craft \u2014 who was confirmed by the Senate last week \u2014 said that while the U.S. is still assessing the situation, the latest information \u201cindicates that responsibility lies with Iran.\u201d\n\nU.S. claims were met with guarded international skepticism as countries in the region brace for rising tensions.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a tweet that the \u201cUK condemns the attack on the Aramco oil facilities in Saudi Arabia We will work with international partners to forge the widest and most effective response.\u201d\n\nBritain has faced its own conflict with Iran over the last several months stemming from Iran\u2019s seizure of a British oil tanker in July.\n\nAlthough the U.K. has partnered with the Pentagon in its joint mission to protect vessels traveling through the Persian Gulf, the foreign secretary was hesitant to directly name Iran following conversations with various allies including the U.S. and Germany.\n\nChina and Russia \u2014 who could each see repercussions to their oil industries stemming from the attacks \u2014 called out nations that have implicated Iran in the strikes.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said it is \u201cirresponsible to determine who should assume responsibility\u201d for the attacks. \u201cChina\u2019s position is that we oppose any moves that expand or intensify conflict.\u201d\n\nA Kremlin spokesperson advised countries \u201cin the region and outside of it to avoid any hasty steps or conclusions.\u201d\n\nFollowing a meeting with Russian, Iranian and Turkish leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered \u201crespective assistance\u201d to Saudi Arabia and advised the Kingdom to purchase several Russian-made air defense systems that it had previously sold to Iran and Turkey.\n\nIranian president Hassan Rouhani avoided mentioning the Saudi government\u2019s claim that the weapons used in the attacks were Iranian, but rather pointed to the \u201cYemen problem\u201d as the \u201croot cause\u201d of the attacks.\n\n\u201cWhat the Yemenis are doing is legitimate defense of themselves,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said. \u201cIt is a reciprocation and a fundamental end to this attack can only be obtained through a political process.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
