Chewing tobacco is fermented; snus goes through a steamed pasteurization process.\n\nFDA acting commissioner Ned Sharpless said the agency based its decision on long-term, population-level data showing lower levels of lung cancer, emphysema and other smoking-related disease with the use of snus.\n\nSharpless added that the agency will closely monitor Swedish Match's marketing efforts to ensure they target adult tobacco users.\n\n'Anyone who does not currently use tobacco products, especially youth, should refrain from doing so,' he said in a statement.\n\nStockholm-based Swedish Match sells its snus under the brand name, General, in mint, wintergreen and other flavors.\n\nThey compete against pouches from rivals Altria and RJ Reynolds.\n\nBut pouches account for just five percent of the $9.1 billion-dollar US market for chew and other smokeless tobacco products, according to Euromonitor market research firm.\n\nAnd public health experts questioned whether US smokers would be willing to switch to the niche product.\n\n'Snus products have a bit of a challenge' among smokers who are used to inhaling their nicotine, said Vaughan Rees, director of Harvard University's Center for Global Tobacco Control.\n\nThe U.S. smoking rate has fallen to an all-time low of 14 percent of adults, or roughly 34 million Americans.\n\nBut smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the US, responsible for some 480,000 deaths annually.\n\nThe FDA's decision has been closely watched by both public health experts and tobacco companies.\n\nPublic health experts have long hoped that alternatives like the pouches could benefit Americans who are unable or unwilling to quit cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products.\n\nTobacco companies are looking for new products to sell as they face declining cigarette demand due to tax increases, health concerns, smoking bans and social stigma.\n\nThe FDA itself also has much at stake in the review of snus and similar tobacco alternatives.\n\nCongress gave the FDA the power to regulate key aspects of the tobacco industry in 2009, including designating new tobacco products as 'modified risk,' compared with traditional cigarettes, chew and other products.\n\nBut until Tuesday, the FDA had never granted permission for any company to make such claims for its products.\n\nThe FDA is reviewing several other products vying for 'reduced risk' status, including a heat-not-burn cigarette alternative made by Philip Morris International. While electronic cigarettes are generally considered less harmful than the tobacco-and-paper variety, they have not been scientifically reviewed as posing a lower risk.", "description": "For the first time ever, the US Food and Drug Administration has given a tobacco product the green light to be called 'safer than cigarettes,' an unprecedented designation given to Snus packets.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/wire-20055378-1571777924-771_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
