And it was back in force Wednesday, eliciting angry notice from President Donald Trump as waves of selling dragged the benchmark within points of where it stood 21 months ago.\n\nAs has repeatedly happened in U.S. stocks, a few days of losses just undid weeks and months of progress, depositing the S&P 500 at an all-too-familiar level. Frustrated traders were left to lament that it has taken the better part of two years for the index to advance all of 15 points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at this thing and my god, it\u2019s like a Tour de France kind of bike ride,\u201d Marvin Loh, global macro strategist at State Street, said by phone. \u201cMassive climbs and great descents -- except these are horrible descents. And then we climb up to the next peak and then we get to ride it down.\u201d\n\nTrump loves touting equity gains more than his predecessors, who were usually wary of taking credit for unpredictable returns largely out of anyone\u2019s control. And while the president\u2019s record remains a solid one by historical standards, with the S&P 500 up almost 43% including dividends since his election victory, on a price basis it\u2019s the same return he could\u2019ve claimed in January 2018. Amid uneven economic data and a two-year trade war, the market hasn\u2019t budged since.\n\nFor investors watching day-to-day swings, two years of inertia have been anything but boring. February 2018\u2019s convulsions in volatility markets were followed eight months later by the bull market\u2019s nearest-to-death experience in seven years. The Federal Reserve has done a complete 180, cutting interest rates twice after a series of hikes. Now deteriorating economic data, including the worst manufacturing report in a decade, is reviving recession fears.\n\nThe president doesn\u2019t see it that way. In another torrent of tweets Wednesday morning, he said Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is the reason stocks are falling. A day earlier, he blamed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after equities got rocked by a weak factory report.\n\nPolitics aside, a more pressing concern for investors this week has been economic data that hints of a recession. Carmakers sank Wednesday after quarterly sales reports from Ford and General Motors added to concern over thinning profit margins in the industry. Ten of 11 S&P 500 sectors fell at least 1% after a private payrolls report showed slowing growth one day after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s factory index slipped to 47.8 in September, the lowest level since 2009.\n\nOf course, recession fear is nothing new, and as high as anxiety levels have occasionally gotten among investors, it\u2019s been matched by the market\u2019s resilience. After a vicious August in which the S&P 500 plunged more than 2.5% three separate times and rallied 1% or more seven, the index vaulted within points of a record in September.\n\nAs things stand now, it\u2019s been 614 days since the S&P 500 surged to a high of 2,872 in January 2018. In that period, the benchmark has hit 18 fresh records, suffered through a correction, a near 20% loss, and two more declines of 6% this year. After Wednesday capped the first back-to-back declines of 1% this year, the index is roughly where it stood after Trump\u2019s tax overhaul sent stocks soaring.\n\nBut what tax cuts gave by way of optimistic forecasts, Trump\u2019s trade war has taken away. Persistent uncertainty has led companies to cut back on investment spending, while confidence has faltered.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s all Trump, because you can blame trade and tariffs on Trump,\u201d said Susan Schmidt, head of U.S. equities at Aviva Investors. \u201cIt\u2019s noise that\u2019s cascading out of actions from the administration. We have stalled out because we need another tailwind and nothing is there. If anything, the headwinds are keeping the market from moving up.\u201d\n\nBut while equity markets have stood still, bond yields have plunged. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields stand more than 100 basis points lower than where they were when the S&P 500 hit a record in January 2018. That\u2019s pushed equity investors into so-called bond proxies, with utilities and real estate stocks each up more than 20% in the same 21-month period that the S&P 500 has gone nowhere.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s like a gravitational field the S&P 500 can\u2019t get free from, the place to which all rallies must return.
