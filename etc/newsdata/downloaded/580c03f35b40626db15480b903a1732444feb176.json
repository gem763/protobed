Her early performances in schools and colleges voiced the frustrations of young people unhappy at the lack of opportunity across Tunisia under the Ben Ali government, which promptly banned her songs from the airwaves as they became popular. After a three-year spell in France, she returned to Tunis in late 2010 \u2013 and was on the ground when millions of Tunisians held a series of protests that mushroomed into wider \u2018awakening\u2019 demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa. Mathlouthi sang on the streets \u2013 and \u2018Kelmti Horra\u2019 became an anthem.\n\n\n\nBut Mathlouthi doesn\u2019t just want to look back. Now living in New York, she is now touring her new album 'Everywhere We Looked Was Burning'. For the first time in her career the majority of her singing is in English, with North African folk music and electronica forming the backdrop to a voice influenced by a diverse range of singers including Fairuz, Joan Baez, Bjork and Sinead O\u2019Connor.\n\n\n\nEmel will join The Stream to talk about the persuasive power of music and perform tracks from her new album. Join the conversation.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nEmel Mathlouthi Is The 21st Century's Catalyst For Change - NPR\n\nWhy the World Needs Emel Mathlouthi\u2019s Anthems Against the Dictatorship Machine - Pitchfork\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
