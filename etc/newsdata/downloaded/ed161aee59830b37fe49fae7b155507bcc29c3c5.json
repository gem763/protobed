Tasmanian Greens Senator Nick McKim said.\n\nDeputy Australian Border Force Commissioner Kaylene Zakharoff replied 'yep'.\n\nBorder Force Commissioner Michael Outram said the facility wasn't reopened for the family-of-four but agreed Senator McKim's statements were factually correct.\n\n'It wasn't reestablished for the purpose of detaining four people, they're two separate issues but you're factually accurate,' he said.\n\n'What's been spent has been spent and there are four people in there now.'\n\nNadesalingam and Priya arrived in Australia from Sri Lanka separately by boat in 2012 and 2013.\n\nDuring a Senate estimates hearing on Monday night, it was revealed the government spent about $30million - almost $20,000 a day - to house the family-of-four after the island re-opened in April. Pictured: Kopika, four (right), and Tharunicaa, two (two), were born in Australia\n\nIn March 2018, immigration officials came to the family's home in Biloela, central Queensland, and took them to a Melbourne detention centre.\n\nIn late August, the family were in the process of being deported when a Federal Court judge granted a last-minute injunction forcing a plane en-route to Sri Lanka to land in Darwin.\n\nThe family was moved from Darwin to Christmas Island. Subsequent injunctions meant the family has remained on Christmas Island.\n\nThe family are being deported as Priya's bridging visa has run out and their attempts to claim refugee status have failed.\n\nSenator McKim shared video footage of the budget estimates to Facebook on Tuesday, calling for the family to be returned to Biloela.\n\n'We have learned that it has cost $30million to reopen the Christmas Island detention centre,' he said.\n\nA women weeps outside the Federal Court in Melbourne on September 4, 2019, where a hearing in a case has temporarily spared a Tamil family of four from deportation\n\n'That figure is growing by the day. There are more than 100 staff at the centre.\n\n'This huge sum of money has been used to detain just four people - a family from Biloela who had built a life here in Australia.\n\n'We think this centre should be closed, and the family returned to Biloela.'\n\nSenator McKim then asked viewers to post comments on how they believe the government should have spent the $30million instead.\n\n'Tell me your ideas and stories and I will share them in the Senate when it returns in November,' he said.\n\nSenator McKim shared video footage of the budget estimates to Facebook on Tuesday, calling for the family to be returned to Biloela. He then asked viewers to post comments on how they believe the government should have spent the $30million instead\n\nNumerous commenters suggested the money would have been better spent on drought-stricken farmers, as well as healthcare and education.\n\n'Our cattle farmers, especially the ones surrounding Biloela could have used this money. Please highlight this to bring the argument home and bring this family,' one said.\n\n'It's unbelievable! Spend it on health, education, housing and protecting our precious environment!' said another.\n\n'Spend it on helping the homeless and ensuring more people don't become homeless because of poor job security and unaffordable housing.'", "description": "During a Senate estimates hearing on Monday night, it was revealed the government has spent about $30million - almost $20,000 a day - to house the family-of-four after the island re-opened in April.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/06/20019756-0-image-a-7_1571720881909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
