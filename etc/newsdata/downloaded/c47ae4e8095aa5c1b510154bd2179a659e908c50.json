But he said that business over all remained strong, and that the local economy had improved since Mr. Trump took office. And Mr. Kugler, a conservative Republican, said Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies were worth any short-term cost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes, but for the long haul I think it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat China\u2019s doing to us is just outright criminal.\u201d\n\nMr. Kugler said the economy was the most important issue to him, and said he would consider rethinking his support for Mr. Trump if conditions soured \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t expect that to happen. Mr. Fullerton, too, said he tried to evaluate evidence objectively, though he acknowledged that his political views probably affected his interpretation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m human, and I probably don\u2019t always see both sides of everything,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cI think I\u2019m guilty of it. But I try to be aware of it.\u201d\n\nThe partisan divide in consumer confidence is a relatively new phenomenon. In the early 1980s, Democrats and Republicans largely saw eye to eye on the state of the economy, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s long-running survey of consumer sentiment. By the 2000s, a gap had emerged, with partisans tending to view the economy more positively when their preferred party was in power. The gulf has only widened since.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeing everything through the partisan lens right now,\u201d said Laura Wronski, a research scientist for SurveyMonkey . She noted that the partisanship dwarfed even factors likely to have a bigger impact on people\u2019s financial well-being, like education, income and employment status.", "description": "Views of the economy are starkly split along partisan lines, and have barely budged as growth has slowed. That could make the economy matter less in 2020 than in past elections.", "authors": ["Ben Casselman", "Jim Tankersley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/business/29survey1/29survey1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
