I\u2019m happy to be the Porsche European Open champion.\u201d\n\nCasey started the day one shot behind the Scot and Ritthammer at eight under and recorded his best front nine of the week of 31 to move in contention, with MacIntyre still maintaining the one-shot advantage at the turn.\n\nThe 23-year-old\u2019s only blemish at the 12th left the door open for Casey, who replied with a birdie at the 13th, to get his nose in front before moving back ahead at the 16th following a four-way tie for the lead.\n\nCasey could only par the last to give MacIntyre and Ritthammer hope of a potential play-off.\n\nBut the Scot\u2019s eagle putt slid by the hole before the home favourite\u2019s birdie attempt pulled up just short as the world number 17 became the third successive Englishman to win the event after Jordan Smith and Richard McEvoy.\n\nPA", "description": "Paul Casey claimed his first European Tour title in five years after coming out on top of a congested leaderboard at the Porsche European Open.
