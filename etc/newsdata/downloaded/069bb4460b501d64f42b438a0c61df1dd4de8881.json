Canadian operations are expected to be even quieter next week due to a previously scheduled pause in production at the Ingersoll, Ont. plant that employs 2,400 hourly workers.\n\nEven though the one week stoppage is unrelated to the strike, it will mean no work for the vast majority of GM employees if the strike persists, since most of the remaining workers in St. Catharines and Oshawa are making parts destined for the Ingersoll plant. The lull has uncertain workers constantly checking Facebook for updates, said Tim McKinnon, the unit chairman for Unifor Local 199, which represents workers in St. Catharines, Ont.\n\n\u201cThe last few days I can see the anxiety start to build,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in control of what happens.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian workers remain supportive of their American colleagues who are agitating for better wages and health care as GM shifts gears to focus on electric and automated cars, as they believe the automaker\u2019s business decisions will ultimately affect people on both sides of the border, McKinnon said.\n\n\u201cAs of right now, people are mostly supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer it goes on, the more fear sets in.\u201d\n\nApproximately 150 workers will remain on the job at the St. Catharines plant during the planned stoppage next week, GM spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said Friday. She emphasized that the pause at Ingersoll had nothing to do with the strike.\n\nStill, the anxiety is pronounced for workers in St. Catharines. There, senior members are receiving employment insurance plus a supplemental pay that amounts to about 65 per cent of their wage, while employees with less than six years of experience receive only EI, McKinnon said.\n\nIn Oshawa, temporarily laid off workers are receiving full pay thanks to a separate agreement that will ultimately see vehicle production wind down permanently in December. Ingersoll, meanwhile, has not yet been affected by the strike and, after the pause, expects to resume operations regardless of labour action.\n\nSt. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik, whose sister works for GM, said he\u2019s optimistic about GM\u2019s future in the community despite obvious concerns about the temporary layoffs.\n\n\u201cKnowing first hand what it\u2019s like trying to raise a family and not knowing about when the layoff may end, it\u2019s unnerving,\u201d Sendzik said.\n\nStill, GM, which has operated in St. Catharines for nearly 100 years, remains one of the five largest private sector employers in the city, he said. He\u2019s confident the plant is well suited for changes such as electrification.\n\n\u2022 Email: ejackson@nationalpost.com | Twitter: theemilyjackson", "description": "It will mean no work for the vast majority of GM employees if the strike persists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/mckenna_magna.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
