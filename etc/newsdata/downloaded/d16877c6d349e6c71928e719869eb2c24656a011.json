They've basically given us the green light to rebuild the circuit. We've built a bunch of new cinemas, but on top of that in Australia we've renovated 80 per cent of our 40 cinemas,\" Mr Keogh said.\n\n\"In the world of SVOD (subscription video on-demand) which has changed home entertainment in the last five years, Disney+ and other things coming on the horizon, we're out there renewing 15 year leases and investing a significant amount of money in these renovations. We really are doubling down on cinema.\"\n\nWith Hoyts turning 110 years old last month, Mr Keogh said the investment is to \"create the cinema of the future\", one that keeps people coming into the movies over the long-term.\n\n\"The money that Netflix is spending, the money that Amazon is spending on productions is massive. But the studios keep investing as well. So there's a lot of quality production coming through the pipeline,\" he said.\n\n\"The cinema experience just has to evolve so that it's a great experience. But also, I think that's got to be seen as a valued experience.\n\n\"We've put in what we call treat cities, which are interactive ... we've worked very hard to get [liquor] licences in the majority of our cinemas and we've started to build bars and cafes. While certainly Coca-Cola, popcorn and choc tops are still a staple of cinema, we've introduced more hot food in general admission as well. So that whole experience and offering, giving people the option to have a drink and something hot to eat at the movies is a change as well.\"\n\nMr Keogh said if Hoyts didn't make the investment and change the experience for movie-goers there would have been a real danger cinemas would struggle.\n\n\"But, it's been quite strong, we're up 5 per cent year-on-year. The market overall is up 2 per cent year-on-year. So we could go close to a record box office here in Australia this year, 2015 has been the high watermark.\"", "description": "With Netflix, Stan and Amazon already here and Disney+ on the horizon, the movie experience had to evolve, Hoyts boss Damian Keogh said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.553%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1844%2C$y_479/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/01191980a0747f3c6aedffa7fd790051cb35d27b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
