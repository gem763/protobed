Just as well, considering Georgia faces the Six Nations Grand Slam champion.\n\nEight Georgians ply their trade in southwestern France for Brive in the Top 14 league, including four of the World Cup squad here in Japan.\n\nScrumhalf Vasil Lobzhanidze and flanker Otari Giorgadze are among them.\n\n\u201cIt is a small city, and all the Georgian players live just a few minutes from each other,\u201d Giorgadze said.\n\nThey forge close links around their favorite cuisine - and it\u2019s not French.\n\n\u201cI like to make the Ukrainian soup, Borsch. That is my specialty, I make it well, as well as a good steak,\u201d Giorgadze said. \u201cI make it for all the Georgian boys in Brive.\u201d\n\nLobzhanidze gets to do the baking, but sometimes has to improvise with the ingredients.\n\n\u201cI cook khachapuri for them, which is like Georgian pizza,\u201d Lobzhanidze said. \u201cIn Georgia we make the bread ourselves, but in France I just buy some pizza bread and add in the mozzarella, feta.\u201d\n\nLobzhanidze seems to revel in responsibility.\n\nThe 22-year-old scrumhalf, who is a father, became the youngest player at a Rugby World Cup when he faced Tonga at 18 years, 340 days in 2015.\n\nNow he has 45 test caps, and others are looking to him for leadership.\n\n\u201cI try to use my experience to act like a senior player,\u201d he said.\n\nGiorgadze\u2019s all-action style has seen him draw comparisons with Georgia\u2019s greatest player, forward Mamuka Gorgodze, also the team\u2019s leading try scorer with 26.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be compared to Mamuka, because he is such a great player and a true hero in Georgia,\u201d Giorgadze said. \u201cWe will see in the future whether I can be.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old Gorgodze came out of international retirement to play at his fourth World Cup after injuries hit the side in the warmups. The former captain was picked on the openside flank on Saturday for his first test since March 2017 against Romania.\n\nHe will come face to face with Alun Wyn Jones. The veteran lock will become the fourth Welshman to play at four Rugby World Cups when he leads the side out at Toyota Stadium.\n\nIt will be some occasion for him, since he joins Gareth Thomas (1995-2007), Stephen Jones (1999-2011) and Gethin Jenkins (2003-2015) in a select group; equals Gethin Jenkins\u2019s record of 129 caps for Wales, and plays in a national record 14th World Cup game.\n\nIn picking his side on Saturday, Wales coach Warren Gatland retained 10 players from the starting XV which lost a warmup game against Ireland two weeks ago.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nWales: Liam Williams, George North, Jonathan Davies, Hadleigh Parkes, Josh Adams, Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Josh Navidi, Justin Tipuric, Aaron Wainwright, Alun Wyn Jones (captain) Jake Ball, Tom Francis, Ken Owens, Wyn Jones.
