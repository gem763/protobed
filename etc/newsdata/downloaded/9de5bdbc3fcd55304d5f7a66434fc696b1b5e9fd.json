Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.\n\nThere are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden\u2019s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg\u2019s solo protest has since become a global movement.\n\nClimate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. \u201cI have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,\u201d subsistence farmer Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.\n\nJulia Finch, business editor\n\nBusiness and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world \u2013 and are key to meeting the Paris agreement\u2019s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.\n\nFrom giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers \u2013 all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.\n\nThese are huge questions, and Guardian readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.\n\nOur economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth \u2013 which does not pursue profit at all costs \u2013 must come.\n\nWe are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives \u2013 and alerting readers to those who fall short.\n\nWriting in the Guardian earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France \u2013 Mark Carney and Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau \u2013 underlined the importance of change. \u201cIf some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,\u201d they said.\n\nWithout action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year\u2019s Californian wildfires, for instance \u2013 the worst in the state\u2019s history \u2013 cost insurers more than $12bn.\n\nBanks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become \u201cstranded assets\u201d. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.\n\nMany companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L\u2019Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.\n\nWe are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.\n\nOur reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.\n\nMost corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines \u2013 like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland \u2013 are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.\n\nInvestment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal & General, Europe\u2019s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: \u201cThe effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients\u2019 assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.\u201d\n\nHowever, not every investment group is using its muscle \u2013 and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock\u2019s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: \u201cOur personal views on environmental or social issues don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nThey do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.\n\nJess Cartner-Morley, associate editor (Fashion)\n\nFashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the most\n\nimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.\n\nWe aren\u2019t perfect and we don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers. We\n\nwill continue to listen to a wide range of voices \u2013 our readers\n\nparamount amongst those \u2013 to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion \u2013 in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.\n\nWe have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn\u2019t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic \u2013 but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.\n\nWhat does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintage\n\npieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.\n\nNone of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion \u2013 and about the future of our planet, too.\n\nTim Lusher, editor of Feast\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it\u2019s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.\n\nMeat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public\u2019s focus. There are many reasons why veganism \u2013 or at least flexitarianism \u2013 is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.\n\nAs well as covering the environmental impact of food production, we\u2019re thinking about what we publish in lifestyle terms. The Guardian\u2019s archive contains nearly 10,000 recipes, of which 19% use meat of some kind, but that figure is down to 15% for articles created in 2018 and 2019. We aim to run recipes that use only sustainable fish (we follow the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide in the UK and associates in the US and Australia). Food is complicated though and it\u2019s not all about meat. Almonds and avocados use a huge amount of water. Generally, it feels an era to be mindful \u2013 we have a zero waste column and readers love its inventive, resourceful, frugal ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, divided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together \u2013 families, friends, communities and strangers \u2013 and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It\u2019s also a time when it\u2019s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the Guardian.", "description": "Guardian editors from across the organisation explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centre", "authors": ["Julia Finch", "Jamie Wilson", "Simon Jeffery", "Jess Cartner-Morley", "Tim Lusher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a472d16e95ce5dc405a924d1c5ab92b65ea71bcf/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de255bb081aea7895003c93c4a568d5d", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
