Pictures)\n\nBaldwin makes an unintentional case for Trumpism by playing his Trump-like character as an effective leader with a sinister appeal.\n\n\u2018Chinatown starring Rain Man\u201d would be a fair description of Edward Norton\u2019s new screen adaptation of Motherless Brooklyn, but what\u2019s interesting about this so-so detective story is what\u2019s going on in the background.\n\nNorton has been trying to make this movie, from Jonathan Lethem\u2019s brilliant novel of the same name, since before the book was even published, back in 1999. Norton is no longer a big movie star and no longer young, so why did the film finally get green-lit? I think the ascendance of Trump gave it new resonance. It is rolling out as the closing-night selection of the New York Film Festival ahead of a November 1 theatrical release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the novel is a comic-surrealist romp, Norton\u2019s dramatic adaptation \u2014 which he produced, wrote, and directed, and in which he stars \u2014 swerves off in a completely different direction inspired by the career of Robert Moses, the master builder who held many different job titles for decades across many mayoral administrations and is responsible for a large portion of New York City as we know it.\n\nIn mid-century New York, Norton plays Lionel, a detective with OCD, Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, and intermittent neck spasms who is trying to solve the murder of his boss and friend (Bruce Willis) by shady characters with political connections. The mystery element of the film is tangled and not particularly compelling, and Norton\u2019s chief purpose as a filmmaker seems to be to give himself a lot of attention as an actor. I wouldn\u2019t say his performance is immediately annoying \u2014 it takes a good ten seconds before it becomes unbearable \u2014 but the constant barking and twitching does not work as well on screen as one would hope. What was hilarious and strange in the novel just looks like scenery-chewing in the movie.\n\nThings get a lot more interesting when Baldwin shows up as \u201cMoses Randolph,\u201d the enduring puppetmaster behind City Hall, modeled after Robert Moses. Baldwin, who signed up for the role last February, makes Randolph a variant of Donald Trump that\u2019s much more nuanced than you\u2019d expect. He\u2019s a smart, tough operator instead of a buffoon and even radiates a kind of sinister appeal. It\u2019s a far more interesting take than Baldwin\u2019s loud-but-limp SNL spoofs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Trump, Randolph calls himself a get-things-done guy. Like Trump, he is called a racist, accused of sexual assault, and prone to breaking whatever rules he thinks stand in his way. Like Trump, he is a one-man wrecking crew who can command actual wrecking crews. He says his cause is \u201cmaking America great.\u201d\n\nThough Baldwin\u2019s Randolph is certainly the villain here, Norton makes a wise choice to give the character the breathing room to make the case for himself. He is a successor to John Huston\u2019s character in Chinatown, who, being named Noah Cross, also echoed powerful paternalist forces dating back to the Bible. In a late monologue, Moses explains that there were only two crossings into the city before he effectively took it over, behind closed doors, through bland bureaucracies like the Board of Estimate. He built bridges, parks, and expressways. He put \u201cpalaces of culture where slums used to be,\u201d which is a fair description of the site we today call Lincoln Center, the world\u2019s leading arts and cultural complex \u2014 and also the place where this movie is making its New York premiere. He notes that today no one thanks, or even thinks of, Frederick Law Olmstead, the designer of Central Park, which in the process of being built displaced a lot of farmers and shepherds who, naturally, fought every step of the way. He derides the people displaced by all this progress as \u201cchipmunks\u201d whose worries amount to moving their stores of nuts from one place to another. \u201cThose who can build, do,\u201d he says. \u201cThose who can\u2019t, criticize.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Baldwin\u2019s character makes the case for Trumpism better than Trump ever does: What do the rules matter as long as things get built? Randolph would gladly acknowledge that there are people more brilliant than he is, including his brother, a civil engineer played by Willem Dafoe who seeks to expose his devious methods. But brilliant people get lost in their ideals and disappear into the quicksands of bureaucracy. It takes a bulldozer of a personality to actually create great public works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaldwin is a first-rate actor and, given that he was once identified by the New York Post as \u201cthe bloviator,\u201d a first-rate choice to play the loudest of all bloviators. In his movies, he rarely does things halfway, and he fills this role with smarts and testosterone. Just as his wickedly alert portrayal of the heartless Blake in Glengarry Glen Ross made the character an unexpected hero to hedge-fund types, he may find his Moses Randolph becoming a favorite of the MAGA men.", "description": "Just as Baldwin's wickedly alert portrayal of the heartless Blake in \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" made the character an unexpected hero to hedge-fund types, he may find his Moses Randolph becoming a favorite of the MAGA men.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Kevin D.
