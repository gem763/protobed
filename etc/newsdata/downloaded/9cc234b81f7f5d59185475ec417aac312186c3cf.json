Lokomotiv is one point behind Juventus and four behind Atl\u00e9tico.\n\nLast-place Leverkusen, which has won only one of its last 16 Champions League matches, has zero points after three straight losses.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico had needed a late equalizer to salvage a 2-2 draw in the home opener against Juventus, and Simeone's team was also coming off three consecutive draws in the Spanish league, including two at home.\n\n\"We did well, but there are some areas in which we need to improve, especially in front of the opponent's goal,\" Simeone said. \"It's something difficult to do, but we have to work to create more scoring chances in these situations.\"\n\nSimeone put Morata into the game to help Diego Costa in the attack, and it didn't take long before he headed in a well-placed cross by left back Renan Lodi in the 78th. Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky got his hand to the ball couldn't keep it from going in.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico's best chance until the goal was a shot by H\u00e9ctor Herrera that deflected off a defender and prompted a difficult save by Hradecky in the 64th.\n\nThe result extended the Atl\u00e9tico's unbeaten streak at home in European competitions to 12 matches. It has lost only one of its last 20 Champions League games at home, a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in 2017.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico next visits Leverkusen, while Juventus will play at Lokomotiv Moscow.\n\nLeverkusen had lost 2-1 to Lokomotiv at home and 3-0 to Juventus in Italy.\n\n\"It was 90 minutes against a very dangerous team and we did well to win the ball as often as we did, which is what we've come to expect of ourselves,\" Leverkusen's Kevin Volland said. \"We had space to exploit, but when you don't use it, then Atl\u00e9tico can hit you with one chance and one goal.\"\n\nAtl\u00e9tico defender Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez had to be replaced because of an apparent muscle injury less than 15 minutes into the match.\n\nThe teams had last met in 2016-17, when Atl\u00e9tico eliminated Leverkusen in the round of 16 of the Champions League. Leverkusen was yet to make it to the group stage since that appearance.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
