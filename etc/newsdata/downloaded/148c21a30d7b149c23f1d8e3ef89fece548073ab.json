As we were planning to have a natural birth, we were not sure of when the baby would see the light; yet, four days before the \u201cconventional\u201d due date, we wrote Sandrine a text to verify that everything was fine.\n\nSandrine\u2019s answer was dreadful and unexpected: \u201cHello!! I am thinking of you all. Best of luck and see you soon. Just an FYI: this weekend I am away and will be back on the 7th of May. Remember in France a due date is in 41/42 weeks and NOT 40. Be calm: your body knows what it is doing.\u201d\n\nFamous last words: on 1 May, following a routine visit, I was hospitalised at Chelsea Westminster for an emergency induction.\n\nWe already had decided to rule Sandrine out \u2013 booking a holiday for the very period when your client is expected to give birth isn\u2019t very professional to say the least.\n\nBut before starting the induction process, I wanted to inform her about the outcome of her \u201cprophecy\u201d. I was curious to hear her reply. \u201cIf you want to talk about this, please feel free to ring. The risks of induction are high, too,\u201d she texted. \u201cIf that baby needs to come out quickly, for both your health and baby, why are they not offering you a C-section? An induction can take days surely; the urgency to your well-being is not as severe as they are scaring you with.\u201d After letting me down, she was now offering me unsolicited and unauthorised medical advice. This answer scared me intensely. What a mistake it was to have contacted her. We never heard from her again.\n\nGiven the emergency and the significant stress my husband and I were both experiencing, we decided to contact Juliette, the other doula we had previously interviewed, to search for support. We explained the situation and Juliette replied: \u201cI am sorry to hear this. Of course, give me a call once baby is here.\u201d\n\nWhen our baby boy was delivered the following day, Juliette joined us in the same afternoon and stayed with us for 3 hours. The next day she stayed with us for another 3 hours.\n\nHer schedule was tight and we were aware of that fact when hiring her, but the next day, 4 May, Juliette was unable to make it (yet found the time to send an invoice for the previous 6 hours, that we paid immediately). On the 5 May, she was supposed to join us at the hospital, but texted at 14.04: \u201cHi Isida, huge apologies but I will not manage to see you today as I have been called out. Hopefully, you will get home today and I can see you there tomorrow\u201d.\n\nThen at 19.30: \u201c\u2026I will most likely be able to come tomorrow but sadly cannot guarantee. Can you please contact some of the other doulas that you interviewed to see if they are available?\u201d Our reply: \u201cThank you Juliette, we will contact another doula\u201d. We never heard from her again.\n\nWe felt abandoned, for the second time in a couple of days. We were aware that Juliette had other commitments in the same period and her schedule was busy, but she should not have accepted our request if she felt there was a risk she was unable to follow through on her commitments.\n\nAgain, we frantically searched around for support and, owing to a friend who had recently become a mum, we got in touch with Allyson, a professional night nanny, who helped us immensely.\n\nOur son is now almost five-months-old, is very cheerful, and we are so happy with him. But the first few days of his life were extremely unsettling and I am still very frustrated by the idea that two doulas, professionals who are supposed to help a mother in the most vulnerable moments, literally deserted my family.\n\nBut there is a point here: are they really \u201cprofessionals\u201d?\n\nThe main problem with doulas is that there is not a professional body checking their training or sanctioning them for any misbehaviour.\n\nOur case show that some doulas casually over-book and feel free to provide medical advice that should be reserved to doctors. The \u201cQueendom\u201d of doulas is a grey territory in terms of qualifications and control. There is no real accountability. My husband and I believe that it is essential the government take action and regulate more strictly the activities of doulas in the United Kingdom. No one should have to go through the stress that we did.\n\n*Their names have been changed to protect their identity", "description": "In September 2018, my husband and I met with joy the news that we would become parents the following May.
