He also cited several other episodes that raised questions about the reliability of local Libya security.\n\n\u201cGrowing problems with security would discourage foreign investment and led to persistent economic stagnation in eastern Libya,\u201d Stevens cautioned.\n\nThe Washington Guardian obtained a copy of the memo, a weekly summary of events in Libya dated just hours before a band of terrorists struck the unofficial U.S. consulate in Benghazi and a neaby annex building where the CIA operated, killing the ambassador and three other Americans.\n\nStevens\u2019 cable is likely to become a central focus of congressional hearings that begin Wednesday \u2014 hearings where Clinton will be pressed to explain why security for diplomats in the region wasn\u2019t increased in the weeks before the attack and why so much reliance was placed on local security forces with dubious loyalties.\n\nAmong the questions lawmakers in both parties are likely to probe is why the State Department turned down a request in August that a special military security team extend its stay in the region, and why U.S. officials relied so heavily on local security tied to militias, a concern Stevens himself had flagged.\n\nCongressional investigators have developed evidence that some of the local security at the Benghazi consulate failed to protect the compound during the attack and may have even had forewarnings that violence could occur that day.\n\nObama administration officials declined comment on the cable, referring a reporter instead to the findings released in late December of the State Department Accountability Review Board report on Benghazi.\n\nFor weeks after the attack, State Department officials insisted they had reviewed security at the compound and believed they had adequate resources heading into the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. They also claimed they had no forewarning of impending trouble.\n\nStevens\u2018 concerns about militia security were previously mentioned by news outlets such as The Daily Beast, but the full details of the diplomatic cable and the exact language Stevens used to alert his bosses in Washington show the State Department had plenty reason to know the city he was visiting was in violent disarray and that there was growing distrust of the security capabilities of local police and militias.\n\nThe document described a \u201cstate of maximum alert\u201d that had just ended a few days earlier in the city, detailed \u201cextra-judicial killings\u201d of Libyan government officials that were ongoing in the vicinity, reported on a deadly car bombing, and noted the destruction of power lines that blacked out part of the region.\n\nOne Libya security commander \u201cexpressed growing frustration with police and security forces\u201d and suggested local security was \u201ctoo weak to keep the country secure,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe cable also warned that Salafists had engaged in a gun battle at a Muslim shrine less than 22 miles (35 kilometers) outside Benghazi three days earlier, killing three and injuring seven. Stevens specifically flagged concerns about official security exposed by that incident, saying a militia brigade sent to protect the shrine was \u201clate responding\u201d and some Salafist members in the brigade \u201cwere actually fighting against local residents in support of efforts to destroy the shrine.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the ambassador wrote he also had received a warning of \u201cexpanding Islamist influence\u201d in the nearby community of Derna, noting another local militia brigade had \u201cundercut police presence by accusing the police of being loyal to the former regime.\u201d\n\nAs for the explosives attacks on power lines, Stevens wrote, authorities had \u201cconfirmed press reports that huge 400 kilowatt lines and towers, including their foundations, had been completely destroyed.\u201d\n\nWhile the report was mostly filled with reports of violence and warnings of dubious security, Stevens did relate one meeting he had with local business leaders who tried to make the case for increased U.S. investment in Benghazi. The businessmen argued that \u201cdespite the challenges\u2026 the security situation was improving,\u201d the cable said before rattling off a laundry list of recent violence.\n\nOne of the reasons Stevens apparently risked going from the more fortified embassy in Tripoli to Benghazi was also detailed in the cable: Stevens planned to unveil a new U.S. project in Benghazi to enhance \u201ccultural and education outreach by U.S. Mission Libya.\u201d\n\nInvestigators also have zeroed in on another reason for his trip, an evening meeting with a Turkish diplomat that ended shortly before the attack. Stevens apparently had befriended the diplomat on earlier assignments and the two corresponded as early as August about the possibility of meeting in Benghazi.\n\nThe official State Department review board report on the Benghazi tragedy, released last month, carefully danced around the reasons for Stevens\u2019 willingness to take the risk of going to the less-secure compound in Benghazi on the anniversary of Sept. 11 terror attacks, saying only that ambassadors were afforded great latitude in deciding their movements and schedules.\n\n\u201cThe Board found that Ambassador Stevens made the decision to travel to Benghazi independently of Washington, per standard practice,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report, however, was far more direct in accusing the State Department of failing to assess the security situation in Benghazi and providing adequate protections.\n\n\u201cSystemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) resulted in a Special Mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,\u201d the review board concluded.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
