After making an affidavit, a beneficiary must take their bar coded or smart card ID, together with the completed affidavit to SASSA. Those using personal banks must bring along proof of banking details from their banks.\u201d\n\nSASSA assured the public that there would be no beneficiary who would not receive a grant they were entitled to, due to fraud they did not participate in.\n\n\u201cAs soon as a beneficiary with a stopped payment has reported the matter, SASSA will facilitate a refund after an investigation has been done.\n\n\u201cSASSA and its partners will remain on high alert to ensure that the right grant goes to the right person.\n\n\u201cBeneficiaries are urged to work with officials and the police to report any criminal activity pertaining to social grants so that these fraudsters can be arrested and finally convicted,\u201d the statement read.", "description": "THE SA Social Security Agency (SASSA) has identified potential fraud cases on 2 800 accounts from different banks and the SA Post Office (SAPO).", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-07-10"}
