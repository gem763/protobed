Weiss have quit their planned Star Wars trilogy Getty Images)\n\nGame Of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss have \u2018regretfully\u2019 decided to walk away from the planned Star Wars trilogy.\n\nThe writers were set to create three films that will carry on the story after Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker brings the current saga to an end.\n\nBut having signed with Netflix for a brand new project, the pair are worried they won\u2019t be able to give both their full attention, and have decided to leave the galaxy far, far away.\n\nIn a statement, they said: \u2018We love Star Wars. When George Lucas built it, he built us, too. Getting to talk about Star Wars with him and the current Star Wars team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything. But there are only so many hours in the day, and we felt we could not do justice to both Star Wars and our Netflix projects. So we are regretfully stepping away.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy praised David and Dan as \u2018incredible storytellers\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018We hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on Star Wars.\u2019\n\nBack in August it was announced that David and Dan had signed a \u2018multi-year deal\u2019 with the streaming service.\n\nThe pair were due to create a new trilogy of Star Wars films (Picture: Lucasfilm)\n\nTheir Star Wars trilogy was set to kick off in 2022.\n\nThey had previously admitted they were \u2018a little terrified by the responsibility\u2019 placed on their shoulders by taking on the much-loved sci-fi series.\n\nHopefully whatever they cook up with Netflix turns out to be less divisive than the final season of Game Of Thrones.\n\nIn a new interview they confessed they \u2018didn\u2019t know\u2019 what they were doing as they were so inexperienced.\n\nBenioff and Weiss recently admitted they were out of their depth when they created Game Of Thrones (Picture: HBO)\n\nMaking a rare appearance at the Austin Film Festival, they said of Game Of Thrones author George RR Martin: \u2018We don\u2019t know why he trusted us with his life\u2019s work.\u2019\n\nThey admitted to making basic writing mistakes, saying: \u2018Everything we could make a mistake in, we did,\u2019 which included script, casting, and even costume design.
