Later, Neville is seen suggesting that CNN\u2019s coverage of the president and his administration is driven by Zucker\u2019s disdain for him. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be positive for Trump. He [Zucker] hates him. He\u2019s going to be negative,\u201d says Neville.\n\nIn the following scene, another CNN staffer is caught on camera lamenting how the corporate media\u2019s coverage gave rise to President Trump, who he referred to as a \u201cmonster.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween me and I, we created this monster and now we\u2019re eating a full plate of him every day,\u201d says CNN floor director Hiram Gonzalez. \u201cMedia created the Trump monster.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Project Veritas, Poarch says he felt compelled to blow the whistle on CNN after becoming disillusioned with the network\u2019s bias. \u201cI decided to secretly record the 9 a.m. rundown call meetings and it\u2019s basically run by Jeff Zucker,\u201d says Poarch. \u201cWhen I came to work at CNN, it was my dream job and that dream actually turned into a nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Zucker] was calling Fox News \u2018fake news\u2019 and a \u2018propaganda machine,\u2019 and with what I saw, that\u2019s pretty much was CNN was,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe video then cuts to leaked audio of CNN\u2019s morning editors call featuring Zucker lambasting Fox News\u2019 coverage over the years.\n\n\u201cThe fake conspiracy nonsense that Fox has spread for years is now deeply embedded in American society,\u201d he says. \u201cFrankly, that is beyond destruction for America and I do not think we should be scared to say so.\u201d\n\nIn another part of the video, Zucker is heard saying that while some CNN staffers have a relationship with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), it was \u201ctime to call him out\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wanna say on the Lindsey Graham front, I know that there\u2019s a lot of people at CNN that are friendly with Lindsey Graham. Time to knock that off and it\u2019s time to call him out,\u201d he is heard demanding.\n\nMonday\u2019s video is part of a new series by Project Veritas in which the group, led by guerrilla journalist James O\u2019Keefe, plans over the coming days to release undercover footage from inside CNN that further exposes the network\u2019s bias.", "description": "An undercover video released by Project Veritas shows a CNN staffer saying Jeff Zucker has a \"personal vendetta\" against Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1158665309-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
