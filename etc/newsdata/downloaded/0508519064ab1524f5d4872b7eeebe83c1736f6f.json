As soon as they scored it was starting to kick off again and you could see the Haringey players were getting abused and felt unsettled.\n\n'The referee was seen removing the bottles thrown at the players and then the managers of both teams went on and escorted their teams off the pitch.\n\n'I went into the changing room with the boys, the referee called in both captains and managers to have a talk about what to do next. The boys made a group decision to make a stand and not go back out to play.\n\nHaringey defender Coby Rowe is restrained by security staff following the incident\n\n'The officials and Yeovil manager came into the Haringey changing room and said they will back whatever decision the Haringey boys made, so that was class from them.\n\n'The boys were disgusted and you could see a few were distraught from getting abused like that.'\n\nLoizou told Sky Sports News with regard to taking his players off: 'There was no way that two or three of those players could have continued playing. What they heard was disgusting, they looked frightened.'\n\nRowe wrote on Twitter: 'Can't believe I'm tweeting this and it's 2019 but today I was a victim of racism, in what was supposed to be a great day for @HaringeyBoroFC. Another game of football ruined by racists.'\n\nEngland's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria was halted twice due to racist abuse\n\nThe FA said in its statement on the matter that it was 'deeply concerned' about the allegation and was looking into the incident 'as a matter of urgency'.\n\nIt came just five days after England's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria that was halted twice as fans were warned about racist behaviour.\n\nEngland forward Raheem Sterling retweeted a news report about the Haringey players walking off and posted the message 'more of this', accompanied by two hands clapping emojis.\n\nEngland star Raheem Sterling has tweeted his support for the Haringey players\n\nTyrone Mings, targeted in Bulgaria on what was his England debut, also expressed his support, tweeting: 'Well done for taking a stance, sometimes it can get brushed off in lower leagues but everyone stands with you. Our country isn't perfect either.'\n\nThe football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out praised the 'swift and decisive action' taken by Loizou and his players.\n\nKick It Out said in a statement: 'The reports relating to events at Haringey Borough...are of alleged racist abuse, and yet again means players are continuing to receive discriminatory abuse while doing their job.\n\n'The Haringey manager and players took swift and decisive action as a result of the abuse, similar to that taken by the England team out in Bulgaria just five days ago.\n\n'Kick It Out has informed the FA and will support the club in identifying the offender(s) to ensure appropriate action is taken and strong punishment issued.'", "description": "Haringey players were left 'disgusted' and 'distraught' by alleged racist abuse they suffered in their abandoned FA Cup clash with Yeovil, according to a former Borough defender who attended the game.", "authors": ["Press Association Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/13/19955622-0-image-a-21_1571575636025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
