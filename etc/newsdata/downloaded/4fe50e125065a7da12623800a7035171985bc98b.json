News, the sci-fi action movie is reported to be a major flop.\n\nTHR also reported that Ang Lee's ailing Gemini Man was looking for a save from China's massive theatrical market upon its release, but ticket sales weren\u2019t as great as expected.\n\nInitially when it opened in America, it made R209 million but it has suffered poor ticket sales since then.\n\nREAD MORE: Will Smith on why he doesn\u2019t watch Red Table Talk: 'They\u2019re tellin\u2019 all our business'\n\nFans seemed to be looking forward to seeing the movie, but it came as a surprise when the movie could not beat Angelina Jolie\u2019s Disney Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\n\nGemini Man is about an assassin who faces off against his younger self and thanks to plenty of movie magic including groundbreaking de-aging effects and high frame rate technology designed for 3D screens.\n\nThe movie was reported to have cost R2.6 billion to make and had a marketing sale at R1.4 billion. It seems filmmaker Ang Lee had hopes of making up for the money they spent when making the movie.\n\nDaily Mail reported, on Sunday, that Will can still take comfort in the huge success of Aladdin earlier this year. His Disney's live action remake, in which he starred as Genie, was his best box office opening ever, raking in more than R14 billion worldwide.", "description": "Will Smith movies are normally huge successes, but this may not be the case for his latest release, 'Gemini Man'.", "authors": ["Fulufhelo Ramotsatsi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9496/5ffb01f53b3842229e6c54d9320e020c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
