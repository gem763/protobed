It turned out to be a nothing call'\n\n\"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\"\n\nMr Zelensky says in response: \"We will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.\"\n\nThanking Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky says he stayed in Trump Tower in New York City during a previous visit to the US.\n\nOn the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes.\n\nThe Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine.\n\nWhat is the claim against Joe Biden?\n\nMr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin.\n\nMr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"He's violated so many clauses of the constitution\" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry\n\nOther Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption.\n\nMr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed.\n\nNo evidence has come to light so far of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nHow the controversy unfolded\n\n18 July - President Trump orders White House aide to hold back almost $400m in military aid to Ukraine, report US media\n\n25 July - President Trump speaks with Ukraine's leader in a 30-minute phone call\n\n9 September - Congress learns of a whistleblower's complaint about the call, but is blocked by the Trump administration from viewing it\n\n11 September - Military aid for Ukraine is cleared for release by the Pentagon and US Department of State\n\n23 September - Trump confirms he withheld Ukrainian aid, saying it was due to concerns about \"corruption\"\n\n24 September - Trump says the aid was withheld so that other countries would pay more\n\nWhat's the Trump-Ukraine story about?\n\nWhat is the background of the call?\n\nMr Trump had promised that a \"complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\" of the 25 July call would be released.\n\nBut the details disclosed by the White House on Wednesday morning were notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in.\n\nThe July call occurred days after Mr Trump directed the US government to withhold about $391m (\u00a3316m) in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn the summary of the call, Mr Trump does not tell the Ukrainian president that US aid hinges upon him investigating Mr Biden.\n\nBut Mr Trump stresses the importance of US financial support, before pressing Mr Zelensky for action on the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,\" Mr Trump says.\n\nWhat's the reference to 'CrowdStrike'?\n\nIn one of the most cryptic passages from the call, Mr Trump mentions a \"server\" and CrowdStrike.\n\nHe asks Mr Zelensky to \"do us a favour\" adding: \"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\"\n\nCrowdStrike is a cyber-security firm that was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate the 2016 hack of the party's email server.\n\nThat cyber-breach led to the leak of numerous emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nCrowdStrike determined a pair of hacking groups with suspected Russian ties was responsible for the hack.\n\nMr Trump has previously questioned why the DNC did not turn over the hacked email server to the FBI, instead of asking CrowdStrike to investigate.\n\nThe US president told the Associated Press news agency in April 2017 that he had \"heard\" CrowdStrike was \"owned by a very rich Ukranian\".\n\nIn the phone call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump appears to suggest the DNC server is stored somewhere in Ukraine.\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nOn Wednesday morning at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump said it was the \"single greatest witch hunt in American history\".\n\n\"The way you had that built up that call, it was going to be the call from hell,\" said Mr Trump, who is up for re-election in November 2020.\n\n\"It turned out to be a nothing call.\"\n\nSpeaking alongside Mr Trump at the event, Mr Zelensky told reporters: \"You heard that we had a, I think, good phone call.\n\n\"It was normal. We spoke about many things, so I think you read it that nobody pushed me.\"\n\n\"In other words, no pressure,\" interjected Mr Trump.\n\nBut California Democrat Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters the phone call shows \"a classic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader\".\n\nWhat's happening with the impeachment inquiry?\n\nThe Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday threw her weight behind an official impeachment inquiry into the president's actions.\n\nA House vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office.\n\nCongress' probe focuses partly on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden.\n\nMrs Pelosi said such actions would mark a \"betrayal of his oath of office\" and declared: \"No one is above the law.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pelosi: \"The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law.\"\n\nHow did the controversy arise?\n\nThe inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the Director of National Intelligence in August about the Trump-Zelenksy call.\n\nA whistleblower from within the US intelligence community had filed a complaint about the matter.\n\nFederal law requires such complaints to be disclosed to Congress, but the Trump administration has so far refused to do so.\n\nThe US Department of Justice says the whistleblower had heard the information from \"White House officials\", and did not have first-hand knowledge of the call.\n\nThe department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said on Wednesday it had reviewed a record of the phone call, and determined \"there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was required\".", "description": "The notes show Mr Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p9d04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
