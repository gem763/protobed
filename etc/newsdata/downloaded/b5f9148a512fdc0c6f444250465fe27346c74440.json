"Johnson\u00b4s first Queen\u00b4s Speech dominated by crime Bills", "language": "en", "text": "A crime crackdown dominated the first Queen\u2019s Speech of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership.\n\nWith the Prime Minister pushing for a snap general election the legislative programme presented at the State Opening of Parliament is being seen as a bid by Mr Johnson to set out his campaign agenda.\n\nAs well as law and order issues, immigration and the environment were also major elements of the programme, which had already been extensively trailed.\n\nThe package of 26 Bills include seven relating to crime and justice.\n\nThese include legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders who return to the UK and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse.\n\nThe Queen said: \u201cNew sentencing laws will see that the most serious offenders spend longer in custody to reflect better the severity of their crimes.\u201d\n\nA Sentencing Bill will change the automatic release point from halfway to two thirds for adult offenders serving sentences of four years or more for serious violence or sexual offences.\n\nThe Queen made the short trip to the Palace of Westminster from Buckingham Palace in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach accompanied by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nOther measures outlined in the speech include strengthening environmental protections, improving the NHS, and raising living standards through increasing the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour.\n\nOn adult social care, the Government has pledged to \u201cbring forward proposals\u201d for reform, but the lack of a specific Bill dealing with the situation is likely to draw fire from the opposition.\n\nAt the same time ministers are preparing to rush through a Bill to ratify any Brexit deal Mr Johnson is able to agree this week in Brussels in time for Britain to leave on the EU on October 31.\n\nAhead of the speech, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced he is planning to hold a Budget just six days after the UK\u2019s scheduled Brexit date.\n\nThe Queen leaves Buckingham Palace (Yui Mok/PA)(\n\nMr Javid tweeted: \u201cOn 6th November I\u2019ll deliver Britain\u2019s first Budget after Brexit and set out our plan to shape the economy and deliver our infrastructure revolution.\u201d\n\nWith no Commons majority, it is questionable how much of the proposed legislation in the Queen\u2019s Speech ministers can get through Parliament before a general election.\n\nAnd there is a major question mark over whether MPs will pass the legislative programme, which will go to a vote after several days of debate.\n\nThe law and order package includes a Bill to \u201cdrastically\u201d increase the sentences for foreign criminals who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order, a move ministers say will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs.\n\nProposed legislation will make it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives who are the subject of an Interpol Red Notice without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant, a process that can take a minimum of six to eight hours.\n\nInitially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\nHowever, the Government will be able to add other countries by statutory instrument.\n\nThe programme includes a \u201cHelen\u2019s Law\u201d Bill, named after 22-year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in 1988, to deny parole to murderers who withhold information about their victims.\n\nThe Government will also bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill which fell as a result of Mr Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of Parliament last month.\n\nBoris Johnson at the State Opening of Parliament (House of Commons/PA)\n\nMr Johnson said in a statement: \u201cPeople are rightly horrified by the spate of violent crime plaguing our streets, including the sickening rise in knife-related homicides.\u201d\n\nOther measures in the speech include:\n\n\u2013 Environment Bill setting legally binding targets to reduce plastics, restore biodiversity, improve water quality and cut air pollution.\n\n\u2013 Immigration and Social Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill to end freedom of movement and introduce a points-based immigration system from 2021.\n\n\u2013 Railway reform with a white paper setting out proposals to overhaul the current system of franchising and creating a new commercial model.\n\n\u2013 Action on building standards in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire with the establishment of a new regulator with powers to impose criminal sanctions for breaches of building regulations.\n\n\u2013 The NHS Health Investigations Bill will create a new independent body with legal powers to ensure patient safety.\n\n\u2013 Mental health reform to reduce the number of detentions under the Mental Health Act by ensuring more people get the treatment they need.\n\nMr Johnson is promising to deliver on a pledge by his predecessor Theresa May to ensure all tips are paid to waiting staff following an outcry that some major restaurant chains \u2013 such as Giraffe and Prezzo \u2013 were keeping as much as 10% of tips paid by card.\n\nThe Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill will put a legal obligation on restaurateurs to \u201cpass on all trips, gratuities and services charges to workers without deductions\u201d.\n\nThe Government\u2019s party political broadcast (using the Queen\u2019s Speech) claims to uphold law and order. But the reality of the Tories\u2019 record is the opposite #QueensSpeech pic.twitter.com/cWIKjaP8ns \u2014 Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) October 14, 2019\n\nLabour has dismissed the decision to hold the speech before the Government goes to the country as a \u201ccynical stunt\u201d.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \u201cThis Queen\u2019s Speech is farcical.\n\n\u201cIt is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the Queen\u2019s Speech Mr Johnson received a winter flu jab.", "description": "Health, environment and immigration also feature in programme, but no social care Bill.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/wire-19689952-1571052532-411_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
