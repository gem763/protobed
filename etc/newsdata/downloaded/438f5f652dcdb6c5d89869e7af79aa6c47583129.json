I said: ''OK, I'll get dinner cooked'',' Ms Greenwool told The Sunday Mail.\n\nMs Greenwool said the 23-year-old then left in the afternoon and walked to the local pub, only a short distance away in the small town.\n\nMs Greenwool never saw her again.\n\nAllison Bernard, known as Neeridine to her family, was last seen in the remote far north town of Coen\n\nAfter her disappearance a massive SES and police land search was coordinated - including a traditional land owner on horseback named Dundee - but they found nothing and there have been no developments since\n\nAllison had been visiting her boyfriend in Napranum further north, near Weipa.\n\nShe then hitched a ride to Coen - where she would touch base with her aunty - before continuing to Kowanyama where she lived.\n\n'I stayed up all night. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Then it was the next day and I was asking around,' Ms Greenwool said.\n\nShe revealed Allison had met another relative at the pub who asked her to leave with their group but she refused - later she later left with a local non-indigenous man.\n\nMs Greenwool says she suspects it was foul play.\n\nQueensland police detectives investigated the mother's disappearance but found no proof she was murdered, according the The Sunday Mail.\n\nThey say Allison went with the man to a quarry near Archer River, where he was staying. He told investigators the pair had sex and then she left while it was still dark.\n\nAfter her disappearance a massive SES and police land search was coordinated - including a traditional land owner on horseback named Dundee - but they found nothing and there have been no developments since.\n\nAllison Bernard's family have claimed the police did not thoroughly investigate the disappearance\n\nHer uncle Teddy Bernard, who works for the Kowanyama Shire Council, said he is still deeply affected by his niece's disappearance.\n\n'She was loving mother for her two kids, always respected her grandmother... and we miss her. I think my niece being indigenous, police in north Queensland did not prioritise her as a missing person. There was a person of interest that I don't think the police investigated thoroughly. It still kind of haunts me today.' he said.\n\nA spokesman for the Coroners Court of Queensland told The Sunday Mail: 'The Northern Coroner, Ms Nerida Wilson, has received all investigation material and is reviewing the matter in order to determine whether an inquest is required.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Allison Bernard, known as Neeridine to her family, was last seen in the remote far north town of Coen.
