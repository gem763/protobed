You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOne of the ways the campaign is promoting conversations about smear tests is by asking women to share their top tips for having a cervical screening.\n\nCelebrities including former Love Island contestant Maura Higgins, singer Louise Redknapp and comedian and actor Lolly Adefope have tweeted in support of the campaign.\n\nAdefope implored her Twitter followers to book a cervical screening test if they are due one and to take a loved one with them to their appointment if they are feeling nervous.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re due a test: get it booked, take someone you trust, and treat yourself about 20 times after so you have something to look forward to,\u201d the Rovers star wrote.\n\nAnother light-hearted approach which the campaign is using to spark more open conversations about female genitalia is asking women to share what emoji they would use to refer to their vagina.\n\n\u201cIf I were to send the aubergine emoji, you\u2019d know what I was alluding to right? But what\u2019s the emoji equivalent for a vagina?\u201d Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust states, alluding to the fact that the aubergine emoji is frequently used to refer to a penis.\n\nHiggins revealed on Twitter that her emoji of choice is a blue butterfly, while Redknapp opted for a pink flower.\n\nThe #EndSmearFear campaign has been backed by several other well-known individuals, including The Only Way Is Essex reality star Chloe Sims, sports reporter Bianca Westwood and Jameela Jamil\u2019s I Weigh movement.\n\nMore than 3,200 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer on an annual basis, Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust states.\n\nOf that figure, more than a quarter do not survive.\n\nKate Sanger, head of communications at the charity, explained the impact social media can have on steering positive and supportive conversations about smear tests.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
