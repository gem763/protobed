Within the next fortnight global rugby will also be hailing new kings, although their identity remains uncertain. The highest compliment you can pay England is that even the All Blacks cannot take a place in the final for granted.\n\nDynamic duo Sam Underhill and Tom Curry give England comic-book gusto Read more\n\nIt is even possible New Zealand have done Eddie Jones\u2019s side a favour by thrashing Ireland so convincingly on their way to Saturday\u2019s semi-final in Yokohama. Had they prevailed in a narrow, scrappy encounter, their next opponents may have been tempted to get ahead of themselves. Now the equation is starkly simple: nothing less than England\u2019s absolute best will be remotely good enough.\n\nWhat makes the impending duel even more compelling is the marked contrast in styles. The world\u2019s most lethal attack against the tournament\u2019s tightest defence? In the modern game the equation is more complicated but the manner in which England kept their discipline and pulled away from Australia suggested a side who believe they possess the tools to fix almost any problem.\n\nIn the relatively recent past there would have been a chance of England getting seriously flustered after the Wallabies, 14-3 down early on, had pulled back to 17-16 with 35 minutes left. Despite Australia\u2019s poor second-half record against Eddie Jones\u2019s England sides, the outcome seemed far from certain. For them, in such circumstances, to respond with 23 unanswered points and win 40-16 was no small achievement.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nIf there was a bit of fortune about the two interception tries that widened the margin, England are increasingly making their own luck. The Wallabies were turned over in possession 18 times: some of it was the product of their own inaccuracy and rash decisions but England\u2019s controlled aggression in and around the tackle area was also a major factor. Not for nothing did Tom Curry win the award for the man of the match, although Kyle Sinckler cannot have been far behind.\n\nNew Zealand will be less profligate; they will also be less tactically gung-ho and possess a far better kicking game. But England, unlike Ireland, are a team on the up, having started to marry physical dynamism with surer judgment and calmer decision-making. Do the All Blacks have prop forwards who offer a greater carrying threat than Sinckler and Mako Vunipola? Do they have a hooker in better form than Jamie George? Are Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock superior locks to Maro Itoje? If, on the day, the answer to even some of those questions is \u201cno\u201d then England will feel they can, at worst, rattle the All Blacks\u2019 cage.\n\nAlmighty All Blacks lay waste to the side that inspired their rebuild | Liam Napier Read more\n\nThe fast-improving flankers Curry and Sam Underhill, who even gave the illustrious Wallabies duo of David Pocock and Michael Hooper a tough match, will also be key figures. It is ridiculous, as Underhill himself said afterwards, to think the all-action Curry is only 21. Collectively the pair have the ability to make England a nuisance against any opposition and the big stage is bringing out the best in them. If a British & Irish Lions squad were being selected this week, the depth of back-row candidates would be impressive.\n\nOn the flip side, New Zealand\u2019s Ardie Savea has been among the players of the tournament and Kieran Read, yet to experience a World Cup defeat after 11 years as a Test No 8, has chosen the perfect moment to rediscover the form that seemed to have gone missing following spinal surgery in late 2017. Beauden Barrett and Sevu Reece look scarily sharp and Richie Mo\u2019unga\u2019s crossfield chips have already caught out a succession of unwary opposing wings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s Tom Curry, left, tackles Jordan Petaia of Australia.

Jones may well be minded, even so, to flick back through his digital library to rewatch Australia\u2019s 47-26 victory over the All Blacks in Perth in August. Scott Barrett\u2019s red card clearly inflated the margin but it was the Wallabies\u2019 focused forward effort \u2013 curiously elusive ever since \u2013 that will intrigue the England management.\n\nLike any other side, New Zealand are far less comfortable on the back foot, although their opening pool game against the Springboks did show how swiftly they can turn defence into attack. England\u2019s primary target is obvious enough: if, as at Twickenham last November, they can restrict the All Blacks to 20 points or fewer, anything is possible.\n\nWhile New Zealand have won the past six Tests between the teams, the margins have been steadily decreasing, with three of the last four meetings settled by three points or fewer.\n\nEngland lost 16-15 at Twickenham last November only after Underhill had a 75th-minute try disallowed for a fractional offside. As Jones was quick to stress afterwards \u2013 \u201csometimes the game loves you and sometimes it doesn\u2019t \u2026 the next time we play them it might be a different story\u201d \u2013 these things have a funny habit of balancing themselves out.\n\nWales sigh collective relief as Moriarty try gives Warren Gatland a shot at glory | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\nEither way, England will be energised rather than intimidated by the onrushing challenge. Jones has locked horns with New Zealand sufficiently often to know the most critical battle is often played in the mind.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you play New Zealand, you think: \u2018They\u2019re the best team in the world, we can\u2019t compete against them,\u2019\u201d he said last autumn. \u201cYou sit there, eat popcorn, have a can of Pepsi and watch the movie. By the time you realise \u2018we can be in this\u2019, it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nThis time Jones\u2019s England intend to direct the movie, not sit respectfully in the stalls.", "description": "Strength in depth among his forwards and a disciplined win against Australia are proof enough that Eddie Jones can push the All Blacks all the way", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d778ced6a63d53416cd98b44c96b04e32281cff/0_122_2891_1734/master/2891.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f706a0c512f5fb60fa492e659aa9deb2", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
