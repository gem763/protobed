Blood in Joe Biden's eye causes concern", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was talking about climate change Wednesday night, but it was his eye that caught many viewers\u2019 attention.\n\nThe former vice president was taking part in a televised town hall when the outward corner of his left eye seemed to fill with blood.\n\nIt appeared to be a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which the U.S. National Library of Medicine simply defines as \u201ca bright red patch appearing in the white of the eye.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not painful and doesn\u2019t cause changes in vision or swelling, so many people may not even know they have it until they look in the mirror.\n\nA subconjunctival hemorrhage, close up. Alamy Stock Photo\n\nWhy does it happen?\n\nThe white of the eye is covered by the conjunctiva, clear tissue that contains many tiny blood vessels, the American Academy of Ophthalmology noted.\n\nThe capillaries can break and bleed when a person:\n\nsneezes, coughs, strains while using the toilet or otherwise experiences a spike in blood pressure.\n\nrubs his eyes too hard\n\nwears contact lenses\n\nhas high blood pressure or is taking blood thinners\n\nhas a viral infection\n\nhas undergone eye surgery or suffered an eye injury\n\nhas diabetes\n\nConfined to the conjunctiva, the blood stays in place and can\u2019t be wiped away. The bright red spot looks frightening, but it\u2019s usually harmless, the American Academy of Ophthalmology said.\n\nSuch hemorrhages are common in newborns, likely caused by the pressure changes in the baby\u2019s body during childbirth, the U.S. National Library of Medicine noted.\n\nHow is it treated?\n\nA subconjunctival hemorrhage usually heals on its own and goes away without any treatment in a matter of days or weeks, depending on its size. Its color may change as it heals.\n\nWhen is it a concern?\n\nIn rare cases, it may be a sign of a serious vascular disorder in older people. Patients who frequently experience such broken capillaries in the eye may get tests to try to find an underlying cause, such as a blood clotting disorder, the Cleveland Clinic noted.\n\nIf the redness comes with pain, it could be a sign of a hyphema, a more serious condition where blood collects inside the front of the eye.", "description": "Blood in Joe Biden's eye appeared to be a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which happens when tiny blood vessels burst and bleed when a person strains or rubs eyes.", "authors": ["A.
