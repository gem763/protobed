Production and sales of vehicles and home appliances have been plunging,\u201d said Richard Lu, an analyst with CRU in Beijing, speaking before the data was released. He said steel firms had also underperformed due to rising raw material costs.\n\nMost listed steel firms in China reported profit declines or reversals into loss in the first half compared with a year earlier. The most-active steel rebar futures SRBcv1 tumbled in July and dropped 8.5% in August, although it has begun to recover ground this month.\n\nProduction has also been hit by the implementation of anti-pollution curbs beginning this month, helping to support prices.\n\nTop steelmaking city Tangshan last week ordered industrial firms to curb production or emissions for a four-day period, in addition to its month-long anti-pollution measures, after its air quality dropped in early September.\n\nThe curbs are expected to strengthen later this month to ensure good air quality during the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n\u201cThere are also uncertainties on how much the restrictions during this (winter) heating season will be,\u201d said CRU\u2019s Lu.\n\nIn the first eight months of the year, China churned out 664.87 million tonnes of steel, up 9.1% from the same period last year, the NBS data showed.", "description": "China's monthly crude steel output picked up in August, after falling for two straight months, official data showed on Monday, as mills boosted output ahead of production cuts expected to kick in by October as part of Beijing's anti-pollution drive.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430319953&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F03U", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
