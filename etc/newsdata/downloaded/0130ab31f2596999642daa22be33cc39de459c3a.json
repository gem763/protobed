It\u2019s horror. What the books share is a sense of abiding fear\u2014fear that is, just like the Overlook\u2019s, infrastructural and architectural. Fear that derives not only from the alleged villains themselves, but also from the environments that have given them their power. The memoirs tell stories not only of monsters, but also of the spaces that the monsters roam. The basements with no windows; the hallways with no doors; the rooms that emphasize the utter lack of escape or egress. These books explore how easily familiar places can be made into places of fear\u2014and how readily familiarity itself can transform into an agent of danger. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away,\u201d Jack Torrance, a man made monstrous by his surroundings, says in The Shining. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was like an octopus,\u201d Jessica Leeds, a woman from Donald Trump\u2019s ever growing contingent of accusers, has said, describing how Trump allegedly groped her while she was seated next to him on an airplane. In All the President\u2019s Women, Karen Johnson claims that during a party at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s, Trump grabbed her from behind one of the resort\u2019s elaborate tapestries, kissing her against her will\u2014the man and the space that contained him grotesquely fused together. (Trump has denied the claims of sexual abuse made against him.) One of Charlie Rose\u2019s former employees shared the nickname that staffers created to describe the unwanted massages he would allegedly offer to some of them: \u201cthe crusty paw.\u201d (Rose has denied some of the claims made against him; of others, he noted in 2017, \u201cI always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d) Miller, who until this year was best known as the \u201cStanford rape survivor,\u201d describes in Know My Name the unique horror of realizing that she had been assaulted while she was unconscious. In the hospital, when Miller is providing evidence for her rape kit\u2014another kind of nightmare\u2014she realizes that she is covered in pine needles. It\u2019s further evidence of what her assailant had done to her as she lay on the ground, unable to speak or move. As Miller walks through the sterile rooms of the hospital, she leaves a trail of pine needles in her wake.\n\nThese details double as pleas for empathy. Just as the horror movie establishes an emotional connection between the audience and the characters who fight on-screen for their lives, the stories told in these public accounts engage in small acts of radicalism: They center the survivors. They preempt the impulse to minimize the severity of sexual abuse. The New York Times recently promoted a story about Deborah Ramirez\u2019s allegation against Brett Kavanaugh\u2014he thrust his penis in her face at a party at Yale, Ramirez claims\u2014with a tweet that began like this: \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun \u2026\u201d (Kavanaugh has denied the allegation, and the paper quickly deleted and apologized for the tweet.) In Ronan Farrow\u2019s Catch and Kill, the reporter quotes Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, who was overseeing Farrow\u2019s investigation into Weinstein for the network. Oppenheim wasn\u2019t sure, Farrow suggests, that the stories Farrow\u2019s sources were telling him about Weinstein\u2019s alleged predations were, in the end, that egregious. Hearing of the recording Farrow had obtained\u2014in which Weinstein seemed to admit to having groped the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez\u2014Oppenheim asked, in Farrow\u2019s telling, \u201cHow serious is this stuff, really?\u201d", "description": "She Said, Catch and Kill, and other new books tell stories of monsters brought to account.
