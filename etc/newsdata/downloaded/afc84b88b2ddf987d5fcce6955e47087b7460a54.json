White House officials said he was planning to meet with China\u2019s Xi Jinping in a bid to lock in details of a \u201cphase one\u201d trade pact that could ease tensions between the economic powers and lay the groundwork for a bigger deal next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChilean officials also pulled out of playing host to the Conference of the Parties, or COP, a major climate change summit, at which more than 100 international delegations were expected.\n\n\u201cA president must always put his compatriots above all else,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said, according to news reports. \u201cOur main concern is reestablishing public order, our citizens\u2019 safety and social peace along with pushing through a social agenda to respond to the main demands of our citizens.\u201d\n\nTrump said Oct. 11 that U.S. and Chinese negotiators had \u201cagreed in principle\u201d on a \u201csubstantial phase one\u201d pact, the first step toward the comprehensive arrangement that the U.S. president has promised amid an extended trade war with Beijing.\n\nAD\n\nAs part of the agreement, Trump agreed not to proceed with plans this month to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports to 30 percent from 25 percent in return for China promising to buy billions of dollars in additional products from U.S. farmers.\n\nAD\n\nNegotiators have been meeting since then to produce a written agreement, which Trump hoped to sign in Chile. But there is no real deadline for those talks, and with the Santiago summit off the calendar, it is not clear when the phase-one deal will be finalized.\n\nTrump had expressed optimism about the talks Monday. \u201cWe are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, we\u2019ll call it Phase One but it\u2019s a very big portion,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts have said that the deal is unlikely to address most of the structural concerns that U.S. officials have raised over China\u2019s economic model, including intellectual property theft. Both sides have also left in place sweeping tariffs on a range of products that have disrupted global supply chains and sent tremors through economic markets, depressing growth, according to analysts.\n\nAD\n\nTrump had not planned to attend the environmental summit in Chile, though a U.S. delegation was expected.\n\nThe White House also announced Wednesday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross would lead the U.S. delegation to the East Asia Summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathering in Bangkok next week. Trump has not attended those events since 2017.\n\nAD\n\nLeaders from around the world had planned to gather in Chile for the COP to continue a push to ramp up efforts to sharply cut carbon emissions in coming years and to meet the goals of the landmark Paris climate accord, which was signed in 2015.\n\nTeen climate activist Greta Thunberg had planned to speak at the conference, once again chiding world leaders to act with more urgency. Trump is also expected to give official notice soon that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris accord next year, and delegates to the summit would have been forced to wrestle with that reality.\n\nAD\n\nNow, questions remain about how many nations will be prepared to meaningfully increase their pledges to take more aggressive climate action ahead of 2020 \u2014 the date when the Paris agreement said countries must make a new round of promises.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said she was informed of Chile\u2019s decision to not host the conference \u201cin view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are currently exploring alternative hosting options,\u201d Espinosa added.\n\nKaren DeYoung and David J. Lynch contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump was expected to meet with China\u2019s Xi Jinping at the APEC summit, which was scrapped along with a climate-change conference amid unrest in the Chilean capital.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/53JbI5YyuR6DS29Y7XU4Z8fHhmc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F4BEA7X3EQI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
