Parliament should be sitting.\n\n\u201cParliament should be holding the government to account. And the prime minister appears to want to run away from questions.\u201d\n\nOther opposition MPs also expressed their anger at the announcement. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson tweeted: \u201cThis is simply wrong at a time of national crisis. I would be willing to sit day and night until 31 October to get this sorted out. This is what a real leader would do, not send MPs away.\u201d\n\nAlex Cunningham, a shadow housing minister, wrote: \u201cI am appalled that Johnson is shutting down parliament at a time of national crisis, but it\u2019s not just Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s the NHS starved of cash, increasing crime, education with schools desperate for more resources, housing, poverty, poor wages, cuts in council services and much more.\u201d", "description": "No 10 confirms that prorogation motion will be moved after bill blocking no-deal Brexit becomes law", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36359ba346b1158704196ea6f1a02e8d41f43e05/0_73_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22bb0295e44b21e37a2c503449461e3f", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
