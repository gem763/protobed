That\u2019s in line with the median estimate compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year tenor was kept at 4.85%. The added just 0.2% while the yield on 10-year government bonds rose by one basis point to 3.12% as of 10:33 a.m. local time.\n\nChina traders were disappointed by a lack of policy rate cuts from the People\u2019s Bank of China earlier this week after data showed economic growth continues to slow. Stocks, bonds and the currency tumbled when costs on medium-term loans were kept steady Tuesday. The central bank also held money market rates unchanged on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe mildly lower LPR suggests Chinese policy makers don\u2019t want to disappoint the market again like it did on Tuesday, but also that they don\u2019t intend to send a strong easing signal,\u201d said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cAuthorities may need to step up its fiscal stimulus if growth slows further in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nWhile the PBOC has tweaked policies in recent months to support the slowdown, it has refrained from more aggressive stimulus out of concern over financial stability and high debt levels. China releases its revamped loan prime rates on the 20th day of every month.\n\n\u201cThe LPR cut is not enough to soothe the market and also not enough to counter weak growth,\u201d said Iris Pang, an economist at ING Bank NV. \u201cBoth fiscal and monetary policies have to work together to maintain growth at 6% in 2019. I\u2019m still looking for more fiscal stimulus.\u201d\n\nWith central banks around the world turning increasingly dovish, the PBOC\u2019s calibrated approach stands out as Beijing seeks to prevent a bubble in the property market and to curb leverage in the financial industry. Its reluctance to cut rates has capped a bond rally, as the 10-year sovereign yield trades within its narrowest range in seven years.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say..\n\nIn our view, a series of small tweaks in rates is a more practical way for the authorities to achieve a balance between stabilizing the economy and minimizing further accumulation of financial risks, such as debt buildup and asset price bubbles. This is also reflected in Friday\u2019s steady five-year LPR, which is the base rate for mortgage loans.-- David Qu, Bloomberg EconomicsFor the full note click here\n\nThe LPR is a revamped market indicator of the price that banks charge clients for loans, and is linked to the rate at which the PBOC will lend financial institutions cash for a year. It\u2019s made up of submissions from a panel of 18 banks, though the central bank has a role in setting the level.\n\nThe reserve ratio cut that took effect this week released 800 billion yuan ($113 billion) into the financial system. The move -- together with two more narrower cuts planned in the next two months -- will lower lenders\u2019 annual funding costs by 15 billion yuan, according to the PBOC.\n\nWhy China\u2019s Starting to Shake Up Its Interest Rates\n\nInvestors may grow even more hopeful for monetary easing after Friday, betting on the PBOC cutting interest rates to pave the way for lower LPR in the future, said Zhaopeng Xing, a markets economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.\n\n\u201cThe cut is in line with the market expectation, but it\u2019s not sufficient to encourage loan demand,\u201d said Xing, adding that he believes the PBOC would want the LPR at 3.9% by the end of the year.\n\nChi Lo, a senior economist at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset Management, isn\u2019t expecting any swift moves from the PBOC as its aim is to keep increasing liquidity in the system, but at a moderate pace.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s game plan is to have a controlled process of selective easing. It\u2019s just sticking with its rule book. Right or wrong, it\u2019s the way it is,\u201d he said.", "description": "China\u2019s Lower Loan Rate Lacks Punch for Liquidity-Hooked Markets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8a9925e750f1ad6e935e20cd72582714.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
