The moon is the best place to prove those capabilities and technologies. The sooner we can achieve that objective, the sooner we can move on to Mars.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence\u2014 who also spoke at the IAC\u2014 said that NASA should use its Artemis Mission to return astronauts to the moon in 2024 as a building block for its mission to Mars.\n\n\u201cWith Apollo in the history books, the Artemis mission has begun, and we are well on our way to making NASA\u2019s moon-to-Mars mission a reality,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence added that America is the leading force in the world when it comes to space exploration, but appeared to be open to partnering with other like-minded countries on some missions.\n\nA journey to Mars is becoming more of a reality for America in the future. In November 2018, NASA announced the location on Mars where the Mars Rover will land. NASA expects the Rover to reach the red planet\u2019s surface by February 18, 2021.", "description": "NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has claimed that the space agency would enable humans to fly to Mars by 2035.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176059449-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
