The border dispute over a dusty town with little in the way of natural resources was described when it began as \u201ctwo bald men fighting over a comb,\u201d but they fought bitterly for decades. Mr. Abiy believed Ethiopia would not be stable unless the region around it was, too. His commitment to pushing policies that enriched all of his country\u2019s people rather than those in the upper echelons of government cracked a once-uncrackable conflict.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut presiding over a fledgling democracy after years of repressive rule isn\u2019t easy. The persistent threat of punishment for any dissent kept many tensions at a simmer, and now the pot is boiling over. Ethiopia led the globe last year in internally displaced civilians. A coup attempt in Amhara resulted in the assassination of the region\u2019s leader. Some problems could perhaps have been preempted by closer attention in Addis Ababa to local grievances, and others might have been inevitable in a nation made up of nine ethnic states that are often at odds. The response from the government has been to revive some of the same liberty-squashing behavior that Mr. Abiy at first made it his mission to root out.\n\nThe peace with Eritrea isn\u2019t complete, either. The border has not been demarcated or demilitarized, and the people living along it have not been settled. President Isaias Afwerki might be loath to give up the despotic practices he has long justified as necessary in wartime, and the ruling party in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region is particularly ill-disposed toward its northern neighbor.\n\nMr. Abiy should hold fast to the reality that animated him at the outset: A healthy nation is essential to a healthy Horn of Africa. Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia has started a truth and reconciliation process. It should include community leaders from across the country, including the Tigray region, who can articulate their concerns \u2014 and then the government should actually address them, whether that means accountability for past abuses or concessions for present qualms. Mr. Abiy has earned this award. Now he has the chance to honor it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A healthy Ethiopia is essential to maintaining a well-functioning Horn of Africa in the wake of the area\u2019s conflict.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iUJkxS_s-CGQBmwN5IlsAPi23H4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LISCLYXMFYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
