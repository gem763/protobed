You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThis idea of purity, and you\u2019re never compromised, and you\u2019re always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.\u201d\n\nObama stated that the danger of being too \u201cjudgemental\u201d of people on social media is something he sees \u201cparticularly on college campuses\u201d, and has been \u201caccelerated by social media\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is this sense sometimes of, \u2018The way of me making change is to be as judgemental as possible about other people.\u2019 And that\u2019s enough,\u201d the 58-year-old said.\n\n\u201cLike if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Cause, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was? I called you out\u2019.\u201d\n\nObama added that in his opinion, the form of behaviour described is not effective when a person is trying to make a positive difference.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 9 of Barack Obama's best feminist quotes Show all 9 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 9 of Barack Obama's best feminist quotes 1/9 On shifting sexist attitudes 'We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure and our boys to be assertive, that criticises our daughters for speaking out and our sons for shedding a tear. We need to keep changing the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality and rewards men for theirs.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 2/9 On fair workplace policies 'Today, women make up about half our workforce. But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it\u2019s an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work. She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship \u2013 and you know what, a father does, too. It\u2019s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode.' (State of the Union speech, January 2014) Getty Images 3/9 On the importance of feminist role models 'Michelle and I have raised our daughters to speak up when they see a double standard or feel unfairly judged based on their gender or race \u2013 or when they notice that happening to someone else. It\u2019s important for them to see role models out in the world who climb to the highest levels of whatever field they choose. And yes, it\u2019s important that their dad is a feminist, because now that\u2019s what they expect of all men.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 4/9 On breaking glass ceilings 'As we prepare to write the next chapter of women's history, let us resolve to build on the progress won by the trailblazers of the past. We must carry forward the work of the women who came before us and ensure our daughters have no limits on their dreams, no obstacles to their achievements, and no remaining ceilings to shatter.' (Presidential Proclamation for Women's History Month, February 2011) Getty Images 5/9 On granting women equal opportunities 'Around the world there is a tradition of oppressing women and treating them differently and not giving them the same opportunities, and husbands beating their wives, and children not being sent to school. Those are traditions. Treating women and girls as second-class citizens. Those are bad traditions. They need to change.' (During speech in Nairobi, Kenya in July 2015) Getty Images 6/9 On gender stereotypes 'We know that these stereotypes affect how girls see themselves starting at a very young age, making them feel that if they don\u2019t look or act a certain way, they are somehow less worthy. In fact, gender stereotypes affect all of us, regardless of our gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 7/9 On gender pay inequality 'It is now our generation\u2019s task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.' (Inaugural Address, January 2013) Getty Images 8/9 On the true meaning of masculinity 'It\u2019s easy to absorb all kinds of messages from society about masculinity and come to believe that there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to be a man. But as I got older, I realised that my ideas about being a tough guy or cool guy just weren\u2019t me. They were a manifestation of my youth and insecurity. Life became a lot easier when I simply started being myself.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 9/9 On what a feminist looks like 'I did want to stop by and make one thing very clear: I may be a little greyer than I was eight years ago \u2013 but this is what a feminist looks like. Of course, in my household there\u2019s no choice.'
