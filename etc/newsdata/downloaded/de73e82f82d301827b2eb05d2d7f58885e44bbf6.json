Story connected in his first four games - totaling six homers in that span - for Colorado in 2016.\n\nLewis hit a solo drive in the fifth inning Thursday night against Cincinnati. He doubled and singled earlier in the game.\n\nCalled up Tuesday from Double-A Arkansas, Lewis got his first career hit that night when homered in the fifth inning for Seattle\u2019s first hit against the Reds\u2019 Trevor Bauer. On Wednesday, he homered in the seventh to end Sonny Gray\u2019s no-hit bid.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mariners rookie Kyle Lewis has tied a major league record by hitting a home run in his first three games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/reds_mariners_baseball_05747_c0-188-4502-2812_s1770x1032.jpg?5a4a545fd7e1e50165ec59c09364f2f369f307da", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
