The DJIA is underperforming due almost solely to IBM's (IBM) reaction to its earnings report, but breadth is running close to two to one positive and the Russell 2000 Index Fund ETF (IWM) is trading up more than 1%.\n\nWhile the number of stocks hitting new 12-month highs is still suppressed at around 225, there are some better pockets of momentum and that is a positive change.\n\nI've been distracted by some outside matters and haven't been able to be as aggressive with buying as I'd like.
