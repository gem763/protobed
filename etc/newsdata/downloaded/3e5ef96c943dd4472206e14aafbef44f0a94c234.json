He will sometimes cry for hours straight. We have had trouble with sucking (checked for tongue tie/lip tie) those were fine. Cut out dairy, tried colic calm, he doesn\u2019t spit up so prob, not reflex. What works is him tightly double swaddled in a dark cool room with very loud white noise...\"\n\nRaising Three Children\n\nThe 'Christina on the Coast' star reveals how different handling her baby boy while also raising her two children.\n\n\"Hudson\u2019s choice of spending his time is very unrealistic when we have a crazy 4-year-old running around who definitely needs attention as well as a 9-year-old girl who one-on-one time is her love language. I say this with mad props to all stay at home moms/moms with more than 2 kids.
