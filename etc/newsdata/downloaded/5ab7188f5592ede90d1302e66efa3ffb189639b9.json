I want to stop writing about this. You want to stop reading about this. And yet, because Trump cannot be wrong, here we are, watching an American federal agency rip apart at the seams.\n\nThe whole stupid event started September 1, when Trump erroneously tweeted that Alabama was among states that \u201cwill most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by then-Hurricane Dorian.\n\nAlabama was never in any danger of serious impacts, particularly by the time of Trump\u2019s tweet. The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) office in Birmingham quickly responded by tweeting that there would be no impacts from Dorian on the state, and that should\u2019ve been the end of that.\n\nInstead, there were more tweets, a fake forecast map, and according to new reporting from the New York Times, pressure for U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) staff to fall in line.\n\nThe Times reports that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the NOAA, threatened to fire some of the weather forecasting agency\u2019s top employees the Birmingham tweet that contradicted the president.\n\nThe news broke on Tuesday, a few days after NOAA put out an unattributed, feckless statement in support of Trump\u2019s Alabama-related shenanigans around the Hurricane Dorian forecast. The whole thing has a soap opera quality to it, but it also shows the administration\u2019s ever-expanding war on science now extends to the weather forecast.\n\nRoss ordered the acting administrator of NOAA to issue a statement backing the president, the Times reported based on information from three unnamed sources.\n\nNeil Jacobs, the NOAA acting administrator, reportedly refused, which in turn allegedly prompted Ross to threaten firing him and other high-ranking political staff at NOAA. And thus, the agency farted out a weak, easily disproven statement on Saturday.\n\nThat statement threw forecasters who were correct under the bus and undercut the core missions of the NWS and National Hurricane Centre \u2014 both of which are housed under NOAA \u2014 to save lives.\n\nThe statement enraged many in the weather community who saw the forecast as above the political fray. And it appears NOAA\u2019s top scientists are determined to get to the bottom of the bullshit and stand up for what\u2019s right. On Tuesday, we got an answer on where some of NOAA\u2019s top scientists stood.\n\nCraig McLean, the agency\u2019s acting chief scientist, sent a letter to employees that was obtained by the Washington Post. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cThe NWS Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should. There followed, last Friday, an unsigned news release from \u2018NOAA\u2019 that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political.\u201d\n\nMcLean said he would investigate why the statement was put out and if it violated NOAA\u2019s sterling scientific integrity policy (reader, it almost certainly did). That was followed by a speech at a major weather conference by U.S. National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini, a guy who literally wrote the book on forecasting when it comes to snowstorms in the Northeast. Here\u2019s what he had to say about the Birmingham NWS statement refuting Trump\u2019s original Alabama tweet, per the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cThey did what any office would do. With an emphasis they deemed essential, they shut down what they thought were rumours. They quickly acted to reassure their partners, the media and the public \u2014 with strong language \u2014 that there was no threat.\u201d\n\nDuring any weather event, forecast offices often have to contend with misinformation. For Dorian, they had to correct the president of the United States.\n\nThis whole thing comes across as incredibly childish and stupid (and make no mistake, it\u2019s both those things), but beyond that, it\u2019s dangerous as hell. The Trump administration has raced to politicise everything and undermine trust in institutions, but particularly so with science.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen them roll back all sorts of climate rules to enrich a few fossil fuel executives while putting millions of Americans at risk of worsening climate impacts and toxic air. For the administration\u2019s efforts, people will almost surely get sick, lose property, and even die.\n\nNow the race has begun at one of the most un-politicised things imaginable: the goddamn weather forecast. How things play out in the coming days will go a long ways toward clarifying who\u2019s a real one at NOAA and who\u2019s all in for the race to the bottom.", "description": "We are now into the second week of Donald Trump\u2019s dumb tweet.
