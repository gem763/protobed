Coaxing the nanoparticles into the nontoxic zone resulted in enhanced imaging, while pushing them into the phototoxic \u2014 or light-activated \u2014 range produced effective on-site tumor treatment.\n\nThe key was learning to control the electronics of their photoactive molecules independently from their optical properties and then making the leap to apply this understanding in a new way to a seemingly unrelated field.\n\nRichard had recently discovered the ability to electronically tune these salts from his work in converting photovoltaics into solar glass.\n\nSophia had long studied metabolic pathways unique to cancer cells.\n\nIt was when the Lunts were discussing solar glass during a walk that they made the connection: Molecules active in the solar cells might also be used to more effectively target and kill cancer cells.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A study claims a new way to detect and attack cancer cells using technology traditionally reserved for solar power as dramatic improvements were showcased.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cancer-cells-solar-technology-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
