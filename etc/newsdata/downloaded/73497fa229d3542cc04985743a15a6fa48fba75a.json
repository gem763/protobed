The funding, led by Pangaea Ventures and Happiness Capital, will be used to further commercialize its technology and develop new solutions.\n\nAlong with earlier rounds, this brings TruTag\u2019s total funding to $25 million. Its clients include PwC, which uses the company\u2019s technology in its Food Trust Platform quality assurance program for Australian beef exports.\n\nCalled TruTags, the company\u2019s tiny barcodes are made out of nano-porous silica, a material that has received GRAS (generally recognized as safe) notice from the U.S Food and Drug Administration, and can be placed directly on products or in packaging to track it through the supply and logistics chain.\n\nTruTags are used with hyperspectral imaging technology, which is able to process much more wavelengths than other imaging methods, so it can collect more precise and detailed data from an image. When scanned, the barcodes provide information about where a product was manufactured, lot numbers, authorized distributors and safe use.\n\nIn email, TruTag chief executive officer Michael Bartholomeusz, who holds a PhD in materials engineering from the University of Virginia, told TechCrunch that the company sees the most growth opportunities in industries, such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceutical foods and cannabis, that deal with counterfeit products from the black market or the \u201cgrey market,\u201d including products from unauthorized suppliers.\n\n\u201cTruTags material is an already approved excipient in pills by the FDA. Pharmaceuticals and food comprise a very large portion of the global counterfeiting problem, and given the very unique edible feature of TruTag\u2019s solution, this is a core area of focus for the company,\u201d he says.\n\nFor example, the technology can be used to lock vaping systems so they only work with authentic vaping pods, helping reduce the number of counterfeit pods on the market. Bartholomeusz adds that TruTags is close to coming to market in the CBD space.\n\nTruTags\u2019 ability to be placed directly on products, its edibility and instant authentication in one to five seconds differentiates it from other solutions. Bartholomeusz notes that other quality assurance tech include specialized symbols, inks and holograms, though many of those products have the disadvantages of being replicable by high-quality printers or relying on consumers\u2019 ability to recognize them.\n\nIn a press statement, Matthew Cohen, director of technology at Pangaea, which focuses on investing in advanced materials technology, said \u201cPangaea is excited to partner with TruTag and help the company expand its team and product portfolio. We believe TruTag\u2019s edible barcode technology will help increase consumer confidence and ultimately save lives. TruTag is making our world better by utilizing compelling advanced materials and advanced material process innovations to combat rising problems such as drug counterfeiting.\u201d", "description": "TruTag Technologies, a company that creates microscopic, edible barcodes to authenticate medications, food, vaping pods and other products, has raised a $7.5 million Series C.
