Corporations could be fined up to $10 million.\n\nIt comes after a string of high profile cases, particularly in the hospitality sector, including former Masterchef judge George Calombaris and his Made Establishment which was found to have underpaid staff $7.8 million earlier this year.\n\nIf George Calombaris thought his fall from grace couldn\u2019t have been much worse, he\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe former Masterchef judge was fined $200,000 earlier this year as part of his punishment for underpaying staff $7.8 million in wages and super. Now, however, Australia\u2019s largest union the ACTU is urging the Attorney-General\u2019s Department to implement a harsher underpayment offence that would carry a five-year maximum prison sentence.\n\n\u201cThe availability of [a higher] offence would encourage earlier pleas to the lesser, strict liability offence, where the higher offence was appropriately charged on the facts,\u201d the ACTU submission said, as reported by the AFR.\n\nUnder it, on top of prison time individuals could be fined $2 million while corporations could face penalties of up to $10 million.\n\n\u201cIf the object of the current review is the deterrence of wrongdoing and encouragement of compliance, it cannot follow that an unreasonably high bar is set to attracting the stigma of criminality,\u201d the ACTU said.\n\nThose harsher penalties, the ACTU suggested, should be faced by those who make \u201cintentional, reckless or dishonest\u201d underpayments.\n\nThere\u2019s no suggestion that the Calombaris case should be characterised as such, but the ACTU\u2019s recommendation does demonstrate what new penalties could potentially be applied to employers. And while the government discussion paper on wage theft is non-sector specific, it\u2019s the hospitality industry that has been littered with high profile cases \u2013 so much so that we had to restrict our list of restaurants to just those with celebrity chefs.\n\nBut those ACTU proposals, sure to be echoed by other groups, aren\u2019t the answer according to the Australian Industry Group, representing the nation\u2019s employers.\n\n\u201cAi Group strongly opposes the introduction of criminal penalties for wage underpayments. While at first glance, the introduction of criminal penalties for underpayments might seem like a good idea, there are many reasons why this is not in anyone\u2019s interests and needs to be rejected,\u201d it said in a statement outlining its submission.\n\nIt has made the counter-argument that criminal charges will just make delay compensation for victims, with civil proceedings having to wait for criminal ones to finish. It\u2019s also argued that those penalties will prevent employers coming forward when they discover mistakes.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s plenty of appetite for more to be done. Even the Fair Work Ombudsman, the body that handed down Calombaris\u2019 $200,000 fine, told a Senate Estimates Committee last week that it \u201cwould have liked it to have been higher\u201d.\n\nAdmittedly, Calombaris faced other penalties too. Like three years of external auditing and having to speak publicly on the need for employers to pay their staff properly \u2013 as if that needed to be said. He also appears to have been cut from the \u201cthree musketeers\u201d, after his former colleagues, ex-judges Gary Mehigan and Matt Preston, were signed by the Seven Network for a new show without him.\n\nMatt Preston, Gary Mehigan & George Calombaris: \u201cWe\u2019re a package deal, you get all three of us or you get no one\u201d Channel 7: \u201cWe have money for you but we don\u2019t want George\u201d Matt & Gary: \u201cWe\u2019re listening\u201d \u2014 im vegan (@bloodyauspol) October 23, 2019\n\nGiven the public outrage about him and other high-profile cases, the ACTU\u2019s submission will likely find a receptive public audience.\n\nWhat a limp wristed pile of unmitigated BS, George Calombaris.\n\nOutdated \"back-office systems\" is the greatest cop out of an excuse.\n\nEven your extensive 2017 \"audit\" wasn't within cooee of the real extent of the non-payment of wages.\n\nYou've failed as an ethical employer. @abc730 \u2014 Robert Waddell (@TroyWaddell) July 31, 2019\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
