The extension will keep Martin in Houston while the Texans try to build continuity on a line that allowed an NFL-high 62 sacks last season.\n\nHe\u2019ll work with new left tackle Laremy Tunsil, who was traded from Miami on Aug. 31, as the team tries to better protect Watson after the revamped unit allowed six sacks in a season-opening loss to New Orleans on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Center Nick Martin has signed a three-year, $33 million contract extension with the Houston Texans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
