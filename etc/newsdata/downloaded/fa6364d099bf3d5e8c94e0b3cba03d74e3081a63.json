That prohibition is lifted after the DNI can certify, within a certain timeframe, that \u201cneither the Government of Russia, nor any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of that government, has knowingly engaged in interference in the most recent election for Federal office\u201d; and after \u201cCongress has passed a joint resolution certifying the determination\u201d of the DNI.\n\nIn other words, the Democrat-controlled House would suspend transactions \u2014 both public and private \u2014 with Russia\u2019s government until the U.S. can be satisfied that Russia had not interfered with the most recent federal election.\n\nThat is exactly what Mulvaney said Trump had wanted Ukraine to show, as part of its commitment to fighting corruption \u2014 namely, that it was not involved in documented efforts by the Democratic National Committee to use Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMulvaney said: \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things [President Trump] was worried about in corruption with that nation. That is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nTo Democrats and the media, it was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 and grounds for impeachment.\n\nUpdate: Mulvaney clarified Thursday evening that there was never any \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine, adding that no funding had been withheld for reasons related to a suspected Democratic National Committee communications server (that was said, at the time, to have been hacked by Russians, but was never handed to the FBI).\n\nJoel B.
