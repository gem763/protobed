The school would like five Ferraris there.\" Aren't modern chicks getting demanding \u2013 whatever happened to a pony?\n\nA Wenona girl's wheels of choice: the Ferrari FF, which retails at $625,000. Supplied\n\nThe Ferrari owners, who incidentally \"are very welcome to talk to the girls about the car(s)\", have \"done this previously at Wenona and it's a tremendous joy to see the excitement these kids have with our cars\".\n\nPresumably not as joyful as the day the Wenona parents meet their daughter's first Ferrari-driving boyfriend, who lives upstairs from his family's corner store while he saves up his cocaine-dealing money for the deposit on a lock-up storage facility. Either that or he's thrice-divorced, wears a toupee and owns a knocking shop in Lidcombe.
