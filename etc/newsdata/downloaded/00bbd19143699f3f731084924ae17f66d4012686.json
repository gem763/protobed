She was alone, and she was to view the sunrise near this viewpoint, and had decided to climb a section of this mountain,' said Mr Salter.\n\nMs Shaw was reported missing on Thursday March 7 this year, after being last seen in the town of San Juan La Laguna, on the shores of Lake Atitlan.\n\nPolice announced on Monday March 11 that her body had been found unclothed and in a state of decomposition near the viewpoint.\n\nBut her father, Tarquin Shaw, who attended the hearing with his wife, Ann, and Ms Shaw's godmother, Trish, said his daughter was 'quite capable' of having removed her own clothing.\n\n'It's unusual for a 23-year-old to not be body-conscious,' he said.\n\nOxford Coroner's Court heard that Ms Shaw, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had been hiking alone and had removed her clothing before slipping off the trail\n\nHer father Tarquin, pictured, said his daughter was 'quite capable' of having removed her own clothing\n\nDespite previous online speculation about foul play, the coroner said there were 'no suspicious circumstances or third party involvement'\n\n'She believed in what she was presented with. She was confident and it was quite refreshing to see in a youngster. She was very comfortable in her own skin.'\n\nA family statement, read out to the court, said Ms Shaw was 'a vivacious, friendly, kind and adventurous person who made friends all over the world. She loved mountains, waterfalls, sunrises and sunsets.'\n\nHer short-term plan had been to explore a volcanic area before travelling to a festival in Colombia.\n\nRecording a conclusion of accidental death, Mr Salter offered his condolences to Ms Shaw's family, saying: 'She was someone who led a very full and active life.'", "description": "Catherine Shaw's naked body was found around 100m from the Indian Nose trail, in the south-western highlands of Guatemala, after she was reported missing several days earlier by friends.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/18/20145544-0-image-a-10_1571938030031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
