The report contained photos of fractures suffered by Epstein that forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden told Fox News are \u201crare\u201d in suicidal hangings.\n\nBaden revealed to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in an exclusive interview earlier Wednesday that Epstein's body bore signs of homicide despite the New York City Medical Examiner's Office ruling that the money man's death was caused by suicide by hanging.\n\nBaden, whom Epstein\u2019s brother hired and who observed the autopsy, told Fox News the findings were more consistent with homicidal strangulation than a suicide.\n\nHe described three fractures that were noted in the autopsy: one each on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam\u2019s apple, and one on the left hyoid bone above the Adam\u2019s apple.\n\nAccording to the autopsy summary, the hyoid bone exhibited a fracture on the left, and the thyroid showed two fractures, one on the right and one on the left -- consistent with what Baden described.\n\n\u201cThose three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,\u201d Baden, also a Fox News contributor, said.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not enough information to be conclusive yet, the three fractures were \u201crare,\u201d said Baden, who's probed cases involving O.J. Simpson, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, record producer Phil Spector, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez and many others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,\u201d the 85-year-old former New York City medical examiner said.\n\nThe New York City Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday stood by its conclusion that Epstein\u2019s death was caused by suicide by hanging.\n\nMEDICAL EXAMINER STANDS BY EPSTEIN AUTOPSY AS FAMED PATHOLOGIST AND DETECTIVE RAISE CONCERNS\n\n\u201cWe stand by that determination,\u201d New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein's family, their representatives and their pathology consultant. The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.\u201d\n\nBaden has said his independent study isn\u2019t complete because pieces of information are missing, and the Epstein family is demanding answers.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is not completed until all the information has come in,\u201d he said.\n\nEPSTEIN'S ATTORNEYS 'NOT SATISFIED' WITH AUTOPSY RESULTS THAT CONCLUDED FINANCIER DIED BY HANGING\n\nEpstein was found hanging in his prison cell at the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and was later declared dead, investigators said.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the previously convicted sex offender paid girls as young as 14 hundreds of dollars for massages before he molested them in his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., between 2002 and 2005. He was awaiting trial in federal prison, thus federal agencies -- presumably the FBI and Justice Department -- had jurisdiction over the investigation into his death, Baden had explained.\n\nHe said it was unknown to him and the Epstein family what work the feds may have done and what results they might have.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons told Fox News in a statement Wednesday that the case is currently under investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General.\n\n\"We point to previously published reports indicating the New York Medical Examiner's Office has ruled the death a suicide,\" the bureau said.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN'S FORMER EX-COP CELLMATE AT NYC LOCKUP MUST HAVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS, JUDGE RULES\n\nThe ligature, or item used to tie something tightly, allegedly was made from a sheet that had been twisted and put around Epstein\u2019s neck, Baden said. Evidence on the cloth material could help prove whether or not someone else was involved in Epstein's death.\n\n\u201cWhoever it is would have their DNA all over the ligature,\u201d Baden said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those results yet,\u201d he added, saying those results \u201cshould be reported quickly to give an idea and lessen the speculation.\u201d\n\nEpstein had been previously discovered on July 23 -- more than two weeks before his death -- on the floor of his prison cell with marks around his neck, after which he was placed on suicide watch.\n\nHe was taken off suicide watch a week later and put in another cell with a roommate, who was taken out a few days after that, leaving Epstein alone in the cell, Baden explained.\n\nOn the day Epstein was found dead, the prison security had experienced a \u201ctotal breakdown\u201d in procedure, according to Baden.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTwo guards allegedly had fallen asleep while on duty, missing their 30-minute rounds for more than 3 hours; and security cameras in the cell and the hallway apparently had malfunctioned, according to Baden.\n\nHe said Mark Epstein, Jeffrey\u2019s next of kin, had hired him to perform an independent investigation because the family wasn\u2019t getting answers. If Jeffrey Epstein's death is determined to be a homicide, his brother and others \u201cmay be at risk because of somebody not wanting knowledge given out,\u201d Baden said.\n\nFox News' Bryan Llenas contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News has obtained the summary of the autopsy report of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead this past August in his\u00a0Manhattan prison cell while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.
