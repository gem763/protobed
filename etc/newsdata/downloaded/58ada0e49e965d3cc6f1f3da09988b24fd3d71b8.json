Mexico City legalized abortion in 2007.\n\nHundreds of people took to the streets in the capital, some using green smoke and waving banners. Local television also showed footage of protests in the states of Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Oaxaca and Veracruz.\n\n\"When a woman decides to have an abortion, she makes an intimate and profound decision,\" wrote Patricia Mercado, a senator from the Citizens' Movement party on Twitter. \"The reasons are very much hers.\"\n\nThe former presidential candidate who has also promoted a bill to ban gay conversion therapy in Mexico also said the government had an obligation to provide professional and safe health services to women.\n\nOthers have criticized the movement.\n\nThe topic has long been a controversial one, but a persistent groundswell of support from the abortion rights movement has generated more discussion in Latin America in recent years.\n\nArgentina's lower house earlier this year presented a bill to legalize abortion less than a year after the Senate rejected similar legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, activists in El Salvador have been protesting a decision to seek a third trial for a woman who was accused of killing her stillborn son, sentenced to 30 years in prison and exonerated at an August retrial.", "description": "Mexican activists take to streets demanding safe, legal abortions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8S03G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
