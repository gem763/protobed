Simple as that.\n\n\u201cLeBron James stands for money. Period.\u201d\n\nOf Morey\u2019s tweet \u2014 which was posted Oct. 4 and quickly deleted, and which read, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d \u2014 James said to reporters Monday that \u201cso many people could have been harmed not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSaying \u201cwe do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too,\u201d James added that Morey was \u201ceither misinformed or not really educated on the situation.\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old forward, who was in China with his Lakers for a pair of exhibition games while the firestorm raged over Morey\u2019s tweet and the NBA\u2019s response to it, subsequently posted to Twitter to \u201cclear up the confusion.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t \u201cdiscussing the substance\u201d of Morey\u2019s tweet but rather addressing \u201cthe consequences and ramifications\u201d of it.\n\n\u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week,\u201d James tweeted. \u201cI think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThose statements on Twitter appeared to do little at the time to mollify James\u2019s critics, many of whom painted him as a greedy hypocrite for having spoken out in the past on issues of social injustice in the United States but seeming now, as they saw it, to be kowtowing to China\u2019s authoritarian regime.\n\nAD\n\nIn Hong Kong, a crowd alternated chants of \u201cThank you Morey\u201d with \u201c[expletive] off James.\u201d A photo of James was affixed to a basketball hoop\u2019s backboard, and people cheered as shot attempts bounced off it.\n\n\u201cIt is so hurtful to us that [James], the face of the NBA, would speak up for freedom of speech in America while dismissing Hong Kong, when we are suffering every weekend,\u201d said James Lo, a 30-year-old who wore a Lakers jersey to the demonstration. \u201cI know it is about business. I know that China has 1.4 billion and we are just 7 million. But the NBA should be protecting their values, not their money.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke of his league\u2019s \u201cvalues\u201d in a statement last week, one that followed an initial NBA reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet that drew criticism for being overly solicitous toward the anger emanating from China.\n\nAD\n\nJames said Monday that Morey\u2019s tweet set up a \u201ctough situation\u201d for Silver, who was forced to try to \u201cput out such a fire that he didn\u2019t create and he didn\u2019t start.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the four-time NBA MVP again spoke with reporters and addressed his comments, saying (via USA Today), \u201cWhen the issue comes up and you feel passionate about it and you feel like it\u2019s something you want to talk about, then so be it.\"\n\n\u201cI also don\u2019t think every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem as well,\u201d James added. \u201cWhen things come up, there\u2019s multiple things that we haven\u2019t talked about that have happened in our own country that we don\u2019t bring up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked if he saw video of Hong Kong protesters burning his jersey, James said that he had not and thus did not have a reaction to it.\n\nNikio Yuen was wearing an Enes Kanter jersey, said he appreciated Daryl Morey's support and was disappointed in LeBron. \"I thought he supported democracy and freedom. When it comes to freedom of speech that affects the business of the league, he doesn't support it.\" pic.twitter.com/vpczcIGtQc \u2014 Daniel Victor (@bydanielvictor) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cIt is clear that [James] was not prepared for the backlash that would ensue, and his follow-up responses where he attempted to backpedal made him look a bit foolish,\u201d public relations executive and crisis expert Ronn Torossian said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIt would have been better to either stick to his guns or completely retract the statement \u2014 now, he just looks like someone who bowed to the pressure of a big organization like the NBA.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat said, Torossian said the demonstrations in Hong Kong would not affect James very much.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLeBron doesn\u2019t really have a vested interest in how he is perceived in Hong Kong,\u201d Torossian wrote in an email exchange with The Post. \u201cHis interests lie in his core U.S. fan base as well as supporting the league\u2019s interests in China \u2014 attempting to make nice with Hong Kong would only further complicate the situation.\u201d\n\nSo going forward, what should the strategy be for the NBA\u2019s biggest and most marketable star? \u201cThe best track for him to take now is to stop talking about it,\" Torossian wrote. \u201cLet the story blow over as the season starts and the news moves to his game play.\u201d\n\nJames can certainly hope that\u2019s how things play out, but in Hong Kong, his brand may never fully recover.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are very angry,\u201d Lo told the AP, showing video of a James jersey being burned. \u201cStudents, they come out every weekend. They\u2019ve got tear gassed and then they got gun-shot, like, every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like, every day.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd then [James] just comes up with something [like] that. We just can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nShibani Mahtani contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "James lost more than a few fans in Hong Kong after saying that Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet in support of their cause was \"misinformed.\"", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zc8Mr1yv48-KsTuSlkAIJRjKL4g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG4KVIHPLEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
