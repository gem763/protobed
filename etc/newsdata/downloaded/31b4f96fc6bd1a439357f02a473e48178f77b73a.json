(Image: Disney)\n\nA lot of fans have been waiting for different forms of representation in Star Wars for a long, long time and, it turns out, at least one has already been there for a little while.\n\nSpeaking to the Coffee With Kenobi podcast, the executive producers of Star Wars Resistance confirmed that Orka and Flix \u2014 voiced by Bobby Moynihan and Jim Rash \u2014 are in fact a gay couple and have been since the show first premiered last year.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re an item,\u201d said EP Justin Ridge when asked the question. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely a gay couple and we\u2019re proud of that,\u201d added EP Brandon Auman.\n\nFans have speculated that the characters \u2014 referred to as \u201cpartners\u201d who own the \u201cOffice of Acquisitions\u201d on the Colossus (the ship where the show takes place) \u2014 have been in a relationship, but no one said it officially until now. When asked about it, Moynihan was overjoyed the news was finally out there.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy we\u2019re allowed to say it,\u201d the actor said with audible relief and excitement. \u201cI have had a sentence prepared for a year and a half if someone would finally ask me. I would say, \u2018All I can say is when Flix says \u2018I love you,\u2019 Orca says \u2018I know.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough the characters are mere support to the main drive of Resistance, here\u2019s a clip \u2014 titled \u201cPay Attention\u201d \u2014 the producer referenced that could have keyed fans into the relationship.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot to talk about here. First is that it\u2019s refreshing that this piece of information was just allowed to be what it is. In the past, some have chosen to make a grand declaration about representation and, well, that usually doesn\u2019t come off well.\n\nListening to the audio here, you realise everyone involved has long been aware these characters were simply in love and that\u2019s that. That Moynihan says he\u2019s had an answer prepared for a year and a half, and only last week got to say it, speaks volumes to the respect everyone on Resistance has for this choice. There have been other characters in canon (mostly books) whose orientation has been touched upon or confirmed but this is slightly more prominent.\n\nOn the other hand, Flix and Orca aren\u2019t human. Orka is a Chadra-Fan and Flix doesn\u2019t have an official species, as per his official Star Wars database entry. We just know they are both coded as male.\n\nIn a universe where humans exist, it\u2019s certainly welcome to see queer representation, but this couple\u2019s not humanoid (like, say, Finn and Poe) so it feels like a bit of a half-measure. Plus, it\u2019s unlikely it will ever be made more explicit in the show itself outside of the above clip.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a step and perhaps the next step could be on the big screen. Star Wars Resistance returns for its second, and final, season this weekend. We\u2019ll have much more soon.", "description": "A lot of fans have been waiting for different forms of representation in Star Wars for a long, long time and, it turns out, at least one has already been there for a little while....", "authors": ["David Tracy", "Andrew Couts"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/n0cwfy7czw0kzovph09z.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
