I\u2019ve been in here for a week with her now, and I just need to kiss her\u201d.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t sure how reciprocated it was, but I hoped it was, and so I just needed to kiss her,\u2019 he added. \u2018I thought, as I went to kiss her, as it was a doorway they might not have seen, but nope! There\u2019s cameras everywhere!\u2019\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019re both really happy with how it turned out,\u2019 Jack continued. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have liked to have had that experience with anyone else. It wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\u2019\n\nJack and Beth have got close catfishing together as Joyce (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nBeth was clearly in agreement, and said: \u2018I\u2019ve said it loads of times, it wouldn\u2019t have been the same without Jack, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to do it with anyone else, and he\u2019s pretty much made my experience on The Circle what it was.\u2019\n\nJack then revealed: \u2018You have agreed to go on a date with me, so\u2026we\u2019ll see where it goes from there, but I\u2019m taking that as a good sign!\u2019\n\n\u2018I agreed to that before we\u2019d even had a kiss!\u2019 she laughed.\n\n\u2018Yeah, you did! God things have moved in a weird order.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nConsidering they moved in together before they even really knew each other, we can\u2019t say we disagree there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being locked up together in a flat with little alone time, the pair both admitted to us that they were actually happy with it that way.\n\nBeth admitted that it might have actually worked in their favour, and told us: \u2018We obviously started as friends and we\u2019re just seeing how it goes, but ultimately, we know each other so well after just a week of living together.\n\n\u2018We know each other\u2019s quirks, we know when Jack\u2019s going into a little huff because he\u2019s hungry or you need a bit of space. You just get to know each other so quick that in real life it\u2019ll just be a lot easier.\n\n\u2018You face a lot in there and it\u2019s an intense pressurised environment so if we can be good in there we can be great out here.\u2019\n\nThe couple have even shared cosy mornings in bed together over the past couple of days (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018I fancied you for the personality and before I knew you were you,\u2019 Jack continued. \u2018So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many situations in the world where you get to know each other as a friend, then start to really connect with them so much you fancy them, and then to see them and go \u201cjeez this girl is stunning!\u201d\n\n\u2018It was a really nice order of things.\u2019\n\nMore: The Circle The Circle recap: Sammie and Paddy plot to take down Ella as Woody blocks Beth and Jack When is the final of The Circle?
