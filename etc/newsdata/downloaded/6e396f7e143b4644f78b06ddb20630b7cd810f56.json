But nothing compares to his current job.\n\nAs director of AARP\u2019s startup incubator Hatchery Ventures, Smith is at the center of the company\u2019s latest efforts to improve the lives of Americans over 50\u2014which, today, means leveraging technology. So Smith and his colleagues scour the global marketplace for impressive organizations that can help shape their AI, virtual-reality and robotics products. They\u2019re also building digital solutions for some of the most intractable challenges facing older Americans now and into the future.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been unfolding [over] the last year is probably one of the most powerful innovation stories I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith\u2019s deep enthusiasm is shared by his teammates at AARP. And it has a lot to do with creative teams within the organization\u2014including product development hub Innovation Labs and AARPx, a department focused on consumer experience\u2014that are adapting their ethos for a new generation. That translates to a workplace that makes employees passionate about their ability to change with the times and disrupt the status quo.\n\nHelping people choose how they live as they age, then and now\n\nAARP was founded in 1958 by Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus her goal was to reframe aging in a more positive light and give retired Americans a collective voice around issues like affordable health care and pension reform. That vision is still playing out today in AARP offices nationwide, including the ones in Washington, D.C., where Smith and his colleagues at the Hatchery are located.\n\nThe Hatchery hosts projects developed by AARP and its partners. And just as Andrus knew precisely what retirees were up against in the 1950s, Smith understands the challenges facing older adults today, from cardiovascular disease to dementia, social isolation and insufficient retirement savings. These are challenges that \u201cwe need solutions for, desperately,\u201d Smith said.\n\nInnovation Labs has heeded that call by launching a virtual-reality platform aimed at making life easier for folks over 50 called Alcove, which facilitates intergenerational connection. To build Alco ve, they collaborated with Hatchery Ventures portfolio company Rendever, which has a virtual reality platform that provides cognitive stimulation and socialization to seniors. Innovation Labs\u2019 workspace is even designed for collaboration and creativity, with an open layout and writable walls that encourage brainstorming.\n\nGiving consumers a voice\n\nAARPx, a department within the organization, aims to ensure that people\u2019s interactions with AARP are easy, enjoyable and useful for their specific needs. To get a feel for what people want, the team taps into social media and listens to AARP\u2019s call center, where members can get in touch with experts. Employees also volunteer throughout D.C. for a wide variety of organizations, including one that that provides legal counsel to elderly people at risk of losing their homes.\n\n\u201cThat allows us to really understand what it\u2019s like to be in their shoes,\u201d said Michelle Musgrove, senior vice president of AARPx.\n\nThrough her research, Musgrove learned that older adults depend on AARP for information about life transitions, but they nonetheless want to make their own decisions. This led to the creation of Frontline Feedback, an app that lets employees and volunteers gather questions and comments from the public on the spot, whether pertaining to healthcare, neighborhood safety or caregiving, so AARP can provide more targeted information and solutions.\n\n\u201cFiguring out Medicare is not easy. Caring for somebody who is in decline when you have a teenager at home is not easy,\u201d Musgrove said.\n\nFor this vulnerable population, AARP offers a powerful combination of community and information that can be life-altering. That could include anything from getting the right prescription drug for a particular condition to finding a local ride-share to doctor appointments and the grocery store.\n\nThis window into the lives of older Americans has profoundly affected Musgrove\u2019s outlook.\n\n\u201cAround here, there\u2019s no shortage of inspirational stories of people who are what would be considered \u2018old\u2019 doing amazing things,\u201d she said\u2014including a 92-year-old marathoner who didn\u2019t take up running until her late 70s. \u201cIt\u2019s sincerely changed my perception on life. I\u2019m excited about getting older.\u201d\n\nA culture of disruption that puts older adults first\n\nBefore founding AARP, Dr. Andrus empowered older Americans by creating the first group health insurance program just for them\u2014a decade ahead of Medicare. Her boundary-pushing spirit still thrives across all levels of AARP, which is now led by CEO Jo Ann Jenkins; about 10 percent of staffers are allotted extra time and resources to pursue innovation, AARP has become a regular at tech trade shows and it invests tens of millions of dollars in \u201clongevity economy\u201d trailblazers like the Dementia Discovery Fund, an effort to find non-traditional solutions for the disease.\n\nThat try-anything atmosphere was made clear to director of audience marketing Maura White at AARP\u2019s 60th anniversary event last year. There, White suggested launching state-specific online communities to ramp up consumer engagement, to which an AARP executive responded by gathering state management for an impromptu discussion. As a result, four states may test the idea this fall.\n\nFeeling encouraged to share her ideas, and being able to bring them to fruition, is part of what White loves about working at AARP. She receives the same support from her team on Raise Your Voice, a voice app for smart speakers and phones that keeps users abreast of legislative issues like Social Security changes and prescription drug prices. The app even connects users directly to their senator or representative, so that they can advocate for themselves.\n\nThe dedication and drive of the employees powering these teams keeps them operating at tip-top shape. Whether it\u2019s making sure people know when and where to vote or working through the weekend to provide customers with answers, \u201cmy staff, they go to the mat,\u201d White said.\n\nIt all speaks to the fact that AARP is pulling off something that remains a challenge even for some of the world\u2019s most impressive businesses: \u201cHow to infuse disruption within their organizations,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd it feels like within AARP, we are figuring it out.\u201d\n\nLearn more about careers at AARP", "description": "How tech makes life easier for people over 50 (Partner Content)", "authors": ["Wp Brandstudio"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/brand-studio/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hatchery1.jpeg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"}
