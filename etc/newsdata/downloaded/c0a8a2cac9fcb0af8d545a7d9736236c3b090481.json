That is \u201caggressive capitalisation of costs and R &D, poor disclosure of organic revenue growth and a highly aggressive and opaque roll-up strategy\", but other aspects of the report such as poor customer reviews was weak.\n\nOther short sellers that believe there are issues with WiseTech also said elements of the report missed the mark.\n\nJCap questioned WiseTech's use of a deed of cross guarantee, which means subsidiaries that own its acquired businesses are not required to lodge separate audited financial statements with the regulator.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot wrong with their acquisition accounting,\u201d report author Anne Stevenson-Yang told The Australian Financial Review from New York.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the amount of money they spend on acquisitions, they have to lose money to keep up the growth.\"\n\nThe author highlighted the introduction of the deed of cross guarantee and its link to WiseTech\u2019s performance and transformation, from what it considered a sleepy private company before listing to a star performer.\n\n\u201cMost of the international subsidiaries are tucked into this Australian company with the deed of cross-guarantee. First of all, it\u2019s a loophole, secondly, it\u2019s a loophole that [coincided with] the growth in the company,\" Ms Stevenson-Yang said.\n\n\u201cOnce they had that in place, things really started to ramp, nothing about the business changed, nothing about trade changed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think it's the biggest accounting headache we\u2019ve had,\" she added.\n\nWiseTech chief executive Richard White has previously explained to the market that revenue from acquired companies dips at first and then ramps up over time, as it shuts down some revenue streams and he restructures the businesses into \"mini WiseTechs\".\n\nWiseTech has been described as the most expensive software stock in the world by former Credit Suisse analyst Lucas Goode in 2018, who has since joined Investors Mutual. It currently has a trailing price earnings multiple of 170.5.\n\nTech bubble concerns\n\nOn Thursday Investors Mutual founder Anton Tagliaferro said WiseTech's performance was typical of a market once again in the throes of a technology bubble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bubble and it\u2019s ridiculously valued and we\u2019ve seen these things before,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Integrating a new software system in a foreign country into your existing system is quite a massive thing, let alone 15 or 20 times.... making a variety of quick-snap acquisitions and trying to integrate the software, that's a very complex, risky and difficult thing to do.\"\n\nThe company is renowned for its highly acquisitive strategy. Most of its deals are low-cost and have been aimed at geographic expansion, with Mr White saying previously it's never bought a company to \"buy growth\". Of the 30-plus founders and CEOs of international companies it's acquired, they all still work for WiseTech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe business counts 12,000 companies globally as customers and has an attrition rate of less than 1 per cent.\n\nFounder and billionaire Mr White has previously been quizzed during analyst calls, including the first-half 2019 results, about WiseTech's organic revenue growth. At the time, Mr White said he did not see any \"softness\" in organic revenue, and there had not been a drop-off.\n\nThe JCap report states that between the half and the full-year results, the company compares both organic and acquired revenue over two different time horizons. It also says that WiseTech makes currency adjustments for organic and acquired revenue for the half-year, but only organic revenue in the full year.\n\nBut a local analyst questioned the dates JCap used to calculate their version of the company's acquired and organic revenue, saying it had used the announcement date, not the acquisition date, which accounted for some discrepancies.\n\nRevenue growth\n\nFollowing WiseTech's full-year results, Mr White said organic revenue growth tended to be between 20 to 30 per cent, but could be \"lumpy\" over time.\n\nApplying JCap's numbers, WiseTech's revenue for the full year to June 30 should have been $304 million, compared to the $348 million the company reported, while its operating profit would be $36 million, not $80 million, it asserted.\n\nThe gap between the revenue reported by WiseTech and JCap's estimates come down to the capitalisation of sotware costs. JCap argues that WiseTech counts the cost twice, once as current costs and again as capitalised software costs paid via an investment in cashflow and then placed on the balance sheet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeeds of cross guarantees, like the one used by WiseTech, are also reasonably common when a company has many entities, but the research firm said it meant auditors could not rule out if the company was exaggerating revenue.\n\nThe report also argued that WiseTech's flagship CargoWise One product was not viewed highly by customers, but this was in stark contrast to the hundreds of reviews on software reviews website FeaturedCustomers, where it received an average rating of 4.7 out of five.\n\nMr White, who owns more than 48 per cent of the business, is the largest shareholder.\n\nFidelity portfolio manager for the Australian Opportunities Fund, Kate Howitt, said the fund had invested in WiseTech prior to its IPO and it had delivered great returns, but it had flipped into a \"very very rich rating\" and it had sold down.\n\n\"When we first invested there was clear room for re-rating. It was underloved, underdiscovered,\" she said.\n\n\"We have taken money off the table particularly because it's a very volatile stock... But you weigh that up against the potential for these firms to grow into the future.\n\n\"WiseTech is worth more if it does continue to develop new products for the future, so part of what you are seeing with these software valuations is the inability of our accounting standards to differentiate between old school investments and investments for the future.\"", "description": "Hedge fund research firm JCap claims WiseTech has overstated its profits and growth.
