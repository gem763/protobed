Biden had made a similar point earlier Monday, saying the raid was successful despite Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cineptitude\u201d as commander-in-chief.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke entered the presidential race with a splash earlier this year after his unsuccessful U.S. Senate run in Texas in 2018, but he has been mired in the low single digits in recent polling on the 2020 Democratic presidential field.\n\n\u201cLook, I would love to be doing a lot better \u2014 that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I got to tell you \u2014 I am so grateful for the extraordinary supporters and volunteers \u2014 some of whom I see here right now that traveled all the way to New York to be here.\u201d\n\nAfter some cheering and applause, he said: \u201cI wish that enthusiasm and dedication was reflected in the polls. \u2026 I don\u2019t think the polling reflects the passion and the commitment and the resolve of our supporters from all over the country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
