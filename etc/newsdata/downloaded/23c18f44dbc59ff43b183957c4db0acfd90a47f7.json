I tried, you know? But that's not cinema,' Scorsese said.\n\n'Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks,' he continued.\n\n'It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,' he added.", "description": "The Doctor Strange star, 43, expressed his support for the negative comments as he said during an appearance on SiriusXM's The Jenny McCarthy Show on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/02/20111444-0-image-a-85_1571879326070.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
