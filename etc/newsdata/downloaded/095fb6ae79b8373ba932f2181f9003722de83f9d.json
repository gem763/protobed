That's a disgrace.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nThe dead-of-night deportation of Marine Jose Segovia Benitez, an Iraq combat veteran with PTSD, is a shameful way to say 'thank you for your service.'\n\nA Marine combat veteran, one who served two tours in Iraq where he was seriously injured, has received the thanks of a grateful nation.\n\nLate Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, he was kicked out of the country, deported from Arizona to El Salvador where his life may be in danger given his U.S. military service.\n\n\u201cThey snuck him out in the middle of the night,\u201d Texas attorney Tom Sanchez told the Orange County Register.\n\nTake a good look in the mirror today, America. Tell me, what do you see?\n\nMaybe you know the story of Jose Segovia Benitez. The 38-year-old Marine was brought to this country from El Salvador when he was 3 years old. He grew up in Long Beach, Calif., and was a legal permanent resident. A week after graduating from high school in 1999, he became a U.S. Marine. He did two combat tours in Iraq, returning home in 2004 after a bomb blast left him with a traumatic brain injury.\n\nTroubled and undiagnosed\n\nOnce home, he struggled with substance abuse and PTSD that would not be diagnosed for seven years. He got into trouble and eventually was convicted of six serious crimes, including DUI, possession of narcotics, injuring his girlfriend and assault with a deadly weapon. (His attorney has said the assault charge stemmed from having a screwdriver in his pocket which he did not use.)\n\nSegovia served his time and, having paid his debt to society, he was snared In January 2018 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and put into a holding facility.\n\nHeadstones reflected in a photo leaning against the headstone for Iraq war casualty U.S. Army Master Sgt.

But his scheduled exile was halted and he was pulled off the plane at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Then he was sent to a holding facility in Florence while his attorneys appealed to California Gov. Gavin Newsom for a pardon.\n\nOn Wednesday, Texas attorney Roy Petty was en route to Arizona with papers seeking to reopen the deportation case. Segovia's attorneys have said they believe the felonies were overstated and would have been reduced to misdemeanors had he been represented by a private attorney instead of a public defender.\n\nThis is all legal, but is it moral?\n\nJust hours before Petty arrived in Florence, apparently in the dead of night, Segovia was whisked away to El Salvador where he now sits in jail.\n\n\"ICE kept his deportation a secret,\u201d Petty told the Phoenix New Times. \"They kept it a secret from him, me, his other attorney, and they kept it a secret from his mother.\"\n\nFor good reason. Because it is disgraceful.\n\nThe Gallagher effect: Navy SEALs want to kick out bad actors. Then commander in chief Donald Trump stepped in.\n\nOh, what\u2019s been done here is legal. Segovia is a felon and not a U.S. citizen -- he applied for citizenship while he was in the military but the process never was completed. As such, he is subject to deportation.\n\nBut is it moral?\n\nMorality would require a careful consideration of not just his criminal offenses but his military service and his life after that service. Morality would require an acknowledgement that his troubles didn\u2019t begin until after his honorable discharge from the Marines. An acknowledgment of the well-known lack of support and treatment for combat veterans who desperately need help. Morality would have required a holdup, even if only for a few days, to see whether a pardon is warranted.\n\nReward for patriotism could be torture\n\nReward for patriotism could be torture\n\nCertainly, Segovia is responsible for his crimes. But he already paid for them in prison.\n\nNow, he\u2019s paying again, by being secretly swept from the only country he has ever known before his lawyers could intervene.\n\nCentral America dangers: Asylum seekers I meet flee something even worse than Trump's unethical immigration agenda\n\nI suppose it is all in how you look at things.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday told The Hill that Segovia-Benitez is \u201ca citizen of El Salvador who has repeatedly violated the laws of the United States\" and has an \"extensive criminal history\" in the United States.\n\nHe\u2019s also a Marine combat veteran whose family says he never got the help he needed after his honorable service to the country he fought for. The one that now has kicked him to the curb.\n\nPetty says Segovia \u2014 who sports tattoos of the Statue of Liberty and the U.S Marine Corps insignia \u2014 could be in danger in El Salvador. \"Gangs target former U.S. military,\" he told the Phoenix New Times. \"They'll kidnap a person, they may hold a person for ransom, they may torture an individual.\"\n\nThis, then, is the thanks Jose Segovia Benitez gets from an oh-so-grateful nation.\n\nLaurie Roberts is a columnist at the Arizona Republic, where this piece first appeared.
