In his first year as head coach, Michael Locksley has used virtually everyone on the roster and attempted to develop a positive culture within a program that hasn\u2019t had a winning season since 2014.\n\nSo, even though the Terrapins (3-4, 1-3 Big Ten) have struggled following a 2-0 start, Locksley remains upbeat.\n\n\u201cWe want to win now, but winning isn\u2019t something we talk a lot about,\u201d Locksley said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s really the process and the habits and behaviors that help you win. We set standards for how we practice, how we want to prepare and how we want to play.\u201d\n\nInjuries have forced Locksley to use a variety of freshmen, but there have been instances when he purposely went with first-year players just to get them experience.\n\n\u201cI still think playing time is the one thing that motivates players at this age and this stage of their careers,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe know in the long run, they\u2019ll be better as we get into the tough part of our season.\u201d\n\nThat would be now. Maryland faces No. 17 Minnesota (7-0, 4-0) on the road Saturday before hosting No. 19 Michigan and traveling to No. 3 Ohio State.\n\nIt\u2019s a daunting task, but at least the Terrapins will have their top two playmakers back on offense. Quarterback Josh Jackson and running back Anthony McFarland Jr. are both expected to return from high ankle sprains for a matchup against the most surprising team in the conference.\n\n\u201cWe need every weapon,\u201d Locksley said.\n\nPerhaps, but that hasn\u2019t deterred Locksley from going young in certain situations. The trick is to balance the desire to win now with the notion of building toward the future.\n\n\u201cYou do that with how you put together game plans, how you develop your depth, with how you play your players,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s just as much the chess match with what plays you call. We\u2019ve really forced some young guys into having to play, and we\u2019ll be so much better for it.\u201d\n\nJunior running back Javon Leake, who ran 158 yards and two touchdowns last week in a 34-28 loss to Indiana, understands and accepts the rebuilding process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely a young team,\u201d Leake said. \u201cIt\u2019s Coach Locks\u2019 first year. He\u2019s seeing what he can do with this program. The biggest thing is these young guys just have to step up and come to play.\u201d\n\nDespite the skid, Locksley was encouraged by the way Maryland played against the Hoosiers. After falling behind by 10 points in the third quarter, the Terps were in position to win before a pair of fourth-quarter turnovers aborted the comeback.\n\nIt conjured memories of Week 3, when Maryland faltered in a 20-17 loss to Temple.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to be able to take the next step: knowing how to execute in critical situations,\u201d Locksley said.\n\nThat, to a degree, is the difference between Maryland and a Minnesota team that won each of its first four games by seven points or fewer.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re undefeated. How they\u2019ve played, who they\u2019ve played, really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing with a great amount of confidence because they\u2019ve won the close games that we haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In his first year as head coach, Michael Locksley has used virtually everyone on the roster and attempted to develop a positive culture within a program that hasn't had a winning season since 2014.
