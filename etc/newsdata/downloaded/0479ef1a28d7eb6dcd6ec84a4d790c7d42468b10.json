Amazon can\u2019t do that. So they\u2019ve got to figure out how to compete with Target and Walmart.\u201d Ron Johnson, Enjoy CEO and former CEO of JCPenney (JCP), told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round.\n\nAn outside view of an Amazon logistics centre in Mannheim, Germany, September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski More\n\nAmazon has changed the retail landscape over the past 25 years, but now the industry it disrupted is beating the company at its own game, he said. Johnson said that the company\u2019s lack of physical locations is putting it a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cOnce the physical companies took advantage of online shopping, fast shipping, pick-up in store, great technology, their traffic in stores is growing and their online is growing. So Amazon is kind of left out not having a physical footprint, and so they\u2019re trying to compete with this fast delivery which is going to be very expensive for them.\u201d\n\nAs Walmart and Target maintain rapid e-commerce growth, it\u2019s clear that the merging of online retailing with traditional retailing is becoming more important in the success of a company\u2019s e-commerce business.\n\n\u201cAmazon disrupted for a while, that\u2019s over now. Now the big stores have disrupted Amazon back\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSara Dramer is an associate producer at Yahoo Finance.
