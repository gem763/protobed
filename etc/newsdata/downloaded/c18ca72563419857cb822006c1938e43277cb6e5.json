Arcus is a partner of the U.S. State Department\u2019s Global Equality Fund, which engages in LGBT advocacy around the world. One of its board members is Darren Walker, the president of the deeply influential Ford Foundation, which gives out about $500 million in grants each year.\n\n\n\nSince CNA\u2019s February 2015 report on a multi-million dollar campaign against religious freedom protections, the Arcus Foundation has given an additional $2.8 million in grants earmarked for projects aimed at restricting legal protections for religious freedom, especially religious and conscience exemptions in state and federal law.\n\nAmong its recent donations is an ACLU grant designed to \u201cbeat back\u201d laws protecting freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.\n\nIn fact, a CNA examination of grant listings and other documents has shown that the Arcus Foundation has funded a variety of coordinated projects, focused on limiting religious freedom, redefining religious liberty, and perhaps even shaping religious doctrine itself.\n\nRedefining Religious Liberty\n\nOn June 30, 2016, the Arcus Foundation said that \u201ccountering religious exemptions to anti-discrimination law in the United States is the aim of grants to the American Civil Liberties Union, Catholics for Choice, and the Center for Gender & Sexuality Law at Columbia University, all of which are working to reframe religious liberty in inclusive terms, whether through the courts, religious bodies, or policy-making bodies.\u201d\n\nSince 2016, $450,000 in Arcus grants went to the Center for American Progress, which was founded by John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s last presidential campaign manager.\n\nThe grants funded projects like promoting religious liberty \u201cas a core progressive American value that includes LGBT equality and women's reproductive health and rights.\u201d The Center for American Progress sponsors a self-described \u201cReligious Exemptions Public Literacy Project\u201d that will oppose \u201creligious exemptions policies that have a negative impact on women, LGBT, and POC (person of color) communities.\u201d\n\nFunding Dissent\n\nSince June 2016, the Arcus Foundation appears to be focusing on controversies at Catholic institutions and schools where staff who publicly support or contract a \u201cgay marriage\u201d have been fired for contradicting Catholic doctrine. Some Catholic institutions have faced lawsuits over such employment decisions and invoke religious freedom protections as a defense.\n\nIn an apparent complement to its work on religious freedom limits, the foundation has also been funding some self-described Catholic groups that reject Church teaching on marriage and sexual morality, among them Dignity USA, the Equally Blessed Coalition, New Ways Ministry, and Catholics for Choice.\n\nThe Arcus Foundation outlines its strategy in a section on its website. It aims to mobilize \u201cmoderate and progressive faith leaders\u201d and to leverage \u201cstrategic opportunities in historically resistant faith communities,\u201d including Roman Catholic churches. It said that some resistant communities \u201cstill afford opportunities for making limited but significant progress.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the focus on religious exemptions, Dignity USA and the Equally Blessed Coalition are working to combat the firing of LGBT staff and allies, who support marriage equality, at Catholic Institutions,\u201d the foundation\u2019s June 2016 announcement continues.\n\nThe Arcus Foundation gave a $250,000, two-year grant to Dignity USA to fund the Equally Blessed Coalition, in order to \u201c support and give voice to the growing majority of Roman Catholics who support full acceptance and equality for LGBT people.\u201d\n\nA 2017 grant gave $35,000 to New Ways Ministry to help develop the Global Network of Rainbow Catholics and its work \u201cto connect the work of pro-LGBT Catholic organizations in every region of the world.\u201d The Global Network of Rainbow Catholics had engaged in advocacy related to the Church\u2019s Synod on the Family.\n\nIn February 2010 Cardinal Francis George, then-president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, released a statement on New Ways Ministry, which is also part of the Equally Blessed Coalition. Cardinal George rejected the claim that the group presents an authentic interpretation of Catholic teaching and Catholic practice. \u201cTheir claim to be Catholic only confuses the faithful regarding the authentic teaching and ministry of the Church with respect to persons with a homosexual inclination,\u201d he said.\n\nIn October 2016 New Ways Ministries gave its Bridge Building Award to Father James Martin, S.J., editor-at-large of the Society of Jesus\u2019 America Magazine. The priest\u2019s lecture at the award ceremony was the basis for his book \u201cBuilding a Bridge,\u201d on Catholic-LGBT relations\n\nIn 2016, the Arcus Foundation gave a one-year grant of $125,000 to Catholics for Choice, to fund a coalition of religious leaders to oppose \u201cdiscriminatory religious exemptions,\u201d as well as a different coalition to oppose \u201creligious intolerance\u201d in southern and eastern Africa.\n\nThe U.S. bishops have frequently criticized Catholics for Choice, saying it is not affiliated with the Catholic Church. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, speaking as the bishops\u2019 pro-life chairman in September 2016, charged that it is \u201cfunded by powerful private foundations to promote abortion as a method of population control.\u201d\n\nBeyond Catholics\n\nArcus Foundation grantees have been linked to doctrinal changes within mainline Protestantism as well, including groups that helped split the Anglican Communion. In 2011 and 2012, the Arcus Foundation provided financial support to raise the national profile of Center for American Progress\u2019 expert V. Gene Robinson, whose controversial election as the Episcopalian Bishop of New Hampshire in 2003 helped split the Episcopal Church and the global Anglican Communion.\n\nNon-Christian religions are also a focus.\n\nA June 2015 grant of $100,000 to Muslims for Progressive Values suggests religious exemptions sought by some Muslims are also unacceptable to the foundation. The grant listing voiced hope that the group\u2019s advocacy at the United Nations would assist \u201cin asserting that \u2018religious exemptions,\u2019 such as reservations on the basis of Sharia law, are unacceptable on matters of human rights.\u201d\n\nCNA took a screenshot of the Arcus Foundation\u2019s grant listing to Muslims for Progressive Values in mid-2016. Since that time, the grant listing on the foundation website appears to have been changed to read simply \u201cgeneral operating support,\u201d rather than directly listing advocacy against religious exemptions. The grant is one of several six-figure Arcus grants to the group, including one given to cultivate LGBT activists among imams and other Muslims\n\nKevin Jennings, a co-chair of Muslims for Progressive Values, is a former Arcus executive director and Obama Administration official. Reza Aslan, the controversial Iranian-American author of the book \u201cZealot: the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,\u201d is a consultant for the group, according to its website.\n\nFighting Religious Exemptions\n\nIn 2016, the Arcus Foundation gave the ACLU a $150,000 grant to implement \u201ca national coordinated media and public-education campaign to beat back religious exemptions at federal and state levels.\u201d\n\nThis year, the foundation gave a $300,000 grant to the Proteus Fund\u2019s Rights, Faith and Democracy Collaborative. The collaborative brings together wealthy activists who aim to restrict legal protections for religious freedom, in order to advance its vision of reproductive health and LGBT causes. According to CNA\u2019s examination of grant listings and tax forms, the collaborative\u2019s donors and others have spent at least $8.5 million in projects to advance a similar, narrow vision of religious liberty.\n\nThe Proteus Fund\u2019s Civil Marriage Collaborative, which worked to recognize same-sex unions as marriages, closed in 2015 after spending more than $153 million over 11 years on various U.S. projects.\n\nThe Arcus Fund has given grants totaling $300,000 to Faith in Public Life: one to rally faith leaders to advocate \u201cfair and balanced\u201d religious exemptions, especially in the states Georgia, Florida and North Carolina; and the other for \u201cpro-LGBT public education campaigns\u201d and to organize \u201cmoderate clergy to inform state and national policymakers about the negative impact of using religion to deny the civil rights of LGBT people.\u201d\n\nA $125,000 grant from the Arcus Foundation to Columbia University\u2019s gender and sexuality law center backs the Public Rights/Private Conscience Project \u201cto promote progressive and nondiscriminatory views on religious exemptions.\u201d This builds on Arcus\u2019 previous support for the project, whose co-sponsors have included the deeply influential Ford Foundation.\n\nAnother $200,000 has gone to the ACLU, including support for its \u201creligious refusals\u201d communications hub and for ongoing research to gauge what it considers to be \u201cthe harm of anti-LGBT religious refusals.\u201d\n\nArcus has also given $200,000 in grants to the D.C.-based Civitas Public Affairs group\u2019s Religious Liberty and Equality Project aim \u201cto advance equality protections and respect for personal autonomy, while dissolving public support for religious carve-outs that go beyond what is already protected in the First Amendment\u201d; and to \u201creframe the current debates over religious exemptions by bringing together some of the most experienced thinkers and advocates within the reproductive justice and LGBT movements.\u201d Another $100,000 2016 grant to NEO Philanthropy appears linked to this project, \u201cto counter religious exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe Arcus Foundation backs several news media projects, including National Public Radio, The Atlantic LGBT summit in 2015, and a series on LGBT issues for the public radio show Faith Matters. Many of those grants did not list religious freedom specifically, but the foundation did give $200,000 for the University of Southern California-based news site Religious Dispatches\u2019 reporting on religious liberty and LGBTQ issues.\n\nAbout $450,000 spread across four grants went to the Public Religion Research Institute to create \u201ccomprehensive state maps\u201d of public attitudes on religious exemptions and non-discrimination policies. Other funding aims to track public opinion on \u201creligious refusal legislation,\u201d among other topics; and to help develop strategies \u201cto stop the expansion of religious exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe Interfaith Alliance was also funded in the amount of $75,000 to explore mapping state laws related to religious exemptions, for policy development, and for training of \u201cskilled messengers to educate state and federal policy makers.\u201d\n\nThe Pride Foundation received $150,000 in 2016 to strengthen coordination \u201camong groups opposed to discriminatory interpretations of religious freedom,\u201d and for \u201cemergency-response grants to key public-education initiatives.\u201d\n\nSoulforce, which became prominent for busing LGBT activists to demonstrate at various colleges, received $100,000 to organize students of color in the U.S. South to challenge both \u201canti-trans policies at conservative Christian schools\u201d and religious exemption statutes.", "description": "", "authors": ["New York City", "N.Y.", "Nov", "Pm"], "top_image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Money_Credit_Andy_via_Flickr_CC_BY_NC_20_CNA_8_7_15_1.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-11-06"}
