Unlike dolphins, which are mammals and breathe air like us, sharks are a species of fish. And unlike dolphins, which are popular with people, sharks often have something of a undeserved bad reputation. Sharks, though, are amazing creatures in their own right, and deserve just as much protection as we\u2019d give any other animal \u2013 and that includes condemning shark finning.\n\nShark finning is the removal of fins from sharks \u2013 often when the shark is still alive. Sometimes, they get thrown back into the ocean \u2013 but without their fins, they have next to no chance of survival. Other times, they get tossed on-board fishing boats, where they suffocate and die. Either way is a pretty horrible way to die.\n\nAccording a 2013 edition of the journal Marine Policy, around 100 million sharks are killed every year to satisfy the demand for shark fin and meat. Hong Kong is one of the world\u2019s biggest shark fin trading hubs, and makes up 50 per cent of the global shark fin trade. Why, when so many other countries have banned the practise already, is shark fin still so popular \u2013 and legal \u2013 here? Young Post talked to Tracy Tsang, a senior programme officer at WWF-Hong Kong, and Apple Chow, an executive director at Hong Kong Shark Foundation, to find out more.\n\nTsang said that, for locals, eating shark fin is something that is ingrained deep in our food culture.\n\n\u201cAbalone, sea cucumber, dried fish organs, and shark fin make up the \u2018big four\u2019 dried seafoods,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cPeople consume shark\u2019s fin soup mostly during weddings, birthdays, and festival celebrations.\u201d\n\nShark fin is seen as a symbol of class and wealth, which is why hosts of a special event or occasion will serve it. Despite a growing number of people that are choosing not to serve this dish, it is still a popular dish that implies status without having a person actually having to state it.\n\nChow said that, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), 12 shark species are listed as endangered, or threatened with extinction. Late last year, a study found that more than a third of shark fin products sold in Hong Kong shops come from species that are vulnerable or endangered.\n\n\u201cStatistics show that, in 2016, 5,700 tonnes of shark fin was imported [into the city]. In 2011, that number was 10,300 tonnes. We\u2019re happy to see a decline,\u201d Tsang said, but added that more needs to be done to impress upon people the importance of not consuming shark fin. \u201c[From our research, we found that] 100 per cent of Chinese restaurants are still willing to sell shark fin.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung people are very aware [of the dangers of shark finning], and demand for shark fin seems to be reducing,\u201d Chow said. \u201cBut the problem is that shark fin is still commonly found in traditional Chinese restaurants. We urge restaurants to help in reducing the sales of shark fin, and to help stop threatened shark species from being culled further. We also urge the government to tighten shark fin regulations, and to provide proper consumer information.\u201d\n\nLast year, Hong Kong published a bill to ban the ivory trade by 2021. It\u2019s not too late to take similar action to ban the shark fin trade. Whether it\u2019s advocating and adopting a shark\u2019s fin soup alternative, pushing educational campaigns, or straight-up banning the import of shark fin outright, we need to do something, and we need to do it soon.\n\nOrganisations you can get invovled in:\n\nWWF Hong Kong - Say No to Shark Fin\n\nShark Savers - I'm FINished with Fins\n\nWildAid\n\nAnimal Welfare Institute\n\nEdited by Ginny Wong", "description": "Jaws, Shark Tale, Sharknado: the world is fascinated with sharks.
