Additional data is being collected.\n\nEarlier this month, DR Congo medical officials said a second vaccine, Ad26-ZEBOV-GP produced by Johnson & Johnson, will also be introduced from November.\n\nThe J&J vaccine had been rejected by the country's former health minister Oly Ilunga, who cited the risks of introducing a new and unlicensed product in communities where mistrust of Ebola responders is already high.\n\nIlunga resigned in July and was subsequently charged with embezzling funds intended for the fight against Ebola.\n\nEight vaccines are undergoing clinical evaluation, the WHO said.\n\nThis is the eighth epidemic of the deadly haemorrhagic fever on Congolese soil since the disease was first identified in the country, then called Zaire, in 1976.\n\nIt is the second most deadly outbreak since about 11,000 people died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016.", "description": "A vaccine against Ebola, not yet licensed but used to stem an outbreak in DR Congo, moved a step closer to\u00a0the market Friday after obtaining a green light from Europe's medicines watchdog.
