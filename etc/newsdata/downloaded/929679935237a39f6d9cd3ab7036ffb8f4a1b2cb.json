Mr Huang is challenging the ATO's position that he is entitled to half of the value of the house.\n\nIn an affidavit, Mrs Huang has said that the funds were a gift from her husband.\n\nThe house is the main asset in Australia to which the ATO has a claim, after Mr Huang on March 9 removed himself as a beneficiary of the Huang Family Trust, the Yuhu Investment Trust, the Austrump Family Trust, and the 626 Family Trust, which hold the bulk of the family assets in Australia. He was replaced as an appointor of three of the trusts on the same day.\n\nAnthony McInerney, SC, for the ATO, said that in regard to assets held in China or Hong Kong, evidence had been led that enforcement was not likely, but \"not impossible\".\n\n\"It is possible for an Australian bankruptcy to be recognised in Hong Kong,\" he said.\n\nMr Hutley said that it was a well known principle that countries including Australia refused to enforce tax orders made by foreign courts and that there was \"no prospect\" that any attempt to pursue Mr Huang's assets outside Australia would succeed.\n\n\"That\u2019s why my learned friend turned to bankruptcy,\" Mr Hutley said. But foreign courts also did not recognise bankruptcy debts that were based on tax penalties.\n\nHe said freezing orders should not be issued where there is no prospect of enforcing them: \"These orders are orders of the most intrusive variety.\"\n\nMr Haung is the subject of an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption into allegations that he provided an illegal $100,000 donation to the NSW Labor Party. He has denied making the donation but declined request to testify before the ICAC.\n\nJustice Jagot reserved her decision on the freezing orders until Monday.", "description": "The Tax Office is seeking to bankrupt the Chinese billionaire and will consider court action in Hong Kong to recover his $140.9 million tax bill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_584%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6766167ae8ce5efbd1d1aab47eb124a9a25d751b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
