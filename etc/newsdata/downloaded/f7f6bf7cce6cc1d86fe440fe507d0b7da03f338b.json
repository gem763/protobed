He also sent the EU an \"explanatory letter\" from the United Kingdom's ambassador to the EU and a letter signed by Johnson making it clear he doesn't want a delay to Brexit, per the Guardian.\n\nWhy it matters: Johnson had said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than seek an extension. But he was legally required to send the Brexit delay request after the U.K. Parliament passed a law in September requiring him to seek a Brexit extension rather than crash out of the EU without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nWhat they're saying: European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted, \"The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\"\n\nGo deeper: U.K. Parliament thwarts Boris Johnson's Brexit plan\n\nEditor's note: This is a developing news story.
