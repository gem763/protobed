Who was it?'\n\nThe Girls Trip star answered 'yes' and then broke into laughter and admitted she 'still can't remember their name.'\n\n'I was at the Oscars and I was all excited because I had just met Meryl Streep for the first time, and I went completely blank.'\n\nAfter some prodding from Ellen to describe the mystery celebrity, Ellen figured out it was actress Kirsten Dunst.\n\n'I Think that's her name,' she shot back in agreement.\n\nRefreshingly honest: Haddish was asked: 'Have you ever forgotten another celebrity's name? Who was it?' The actress-comedian couldn't remember the actress' name, but with a little prodding and help from Ellen, she deducted it was Kirsten Dunst\n\nConfession: Haddish said she would never 'laser myself intoxicated again'\n\nWhen asked 'what's something you have to do before you turn 40', Haddish quickly shot back that she's like to be able to do the splits, and then after a brief pause she added 'on a celebrity,' to the amusement of Ellen and the live studio audience.\n\nThe next Burning Question was 'one thing you have tried that you will never do again?'\n\nAt first Haddish was stumped to find an answer. But after taking more time to ponder she fired back with enthusiasm, 'laser myself while intoxicated,' which left Ellen somewhat bewildered.\n\nTurns out she bought a laser device to remove hair, and decided to have a couple of alcohol beverages so she wouldn't feel any pain.\n\n'I removed my brown skin because I was intoxicated,' she explained.\n\n'I burned myself because I could't feel nothing... I burned my arm, my leg and I had somewhere else but I can't show you.'\n\nBrutally honest: When asked 'what's something you have to do before you turn 40', Haddish quickly shot back that she's like to be able to do the splits, and then after a brief pause she added 'on a celebrity,' to the amusement of Ellen and the live studio audience\n\nThe segment also included whether she had 'ever hooked up with a celebrity that the world doesn't know about?'\n\n'Chingy. I mean, it was a hookup,' Haddish said as she turned and looked directly at Ellen with a big smile.\n\n'That was the early 2000s, y'all. I don't even know if that counts anymore,' the actress-comedian added before the pair started singing Chingy\u2019s hit song Right Thurr.\n\nWhen word of her answer went public this past week, Chingy took to social media and denied ever having sexual relations with Haddish.\n\nHe said, she said: The segment also included whether she had 'ever hooked up with a celebrity that the world doesn't know about?' She revealed rapper Chingy, which he denied on social media after a clip from the segment was made public last week; she has since responded and called him a liar in the comments section\n\n'Now @tiffanyhaddish knows damn well that's a lie [and] since she lied I'm a tell the truth,' he wrote, as reported by Page Six.\n\n'She use to hook up with my brother not me but she liked me. Hey if we gone be honest let's be honest.'\n\nHaddish, 39, didn't waste time in responding and offered specific details about their alleged encounter.\n\n'Really Chingy stop. I hooked up with you once like 2 months after we met,' she shot back, adding, 'granted the sex was not good cuz you was sleepy.'\n\n'I was definitely in your bed at that hotel on San Vicente and Sunset. S**t, you pulled down my Sergio Valentes,' Haddish wrote.", "description": "Tiffany Haddish revealed the celebrity whose name she forgot and the one thing she's tried and will never do again during a round of Burning Questions with Ellen DeGeneres on Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/06/19382080-0-image-a-59_1570427628685.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
