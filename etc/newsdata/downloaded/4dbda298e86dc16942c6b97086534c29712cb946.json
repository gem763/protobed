Adam Schiff \u201cdemonstrably mentally ill.\u201d (There are lots of things we\u2019d call Schiff, though.) The problem, though, is that we heard about Carlson\u2019s comments from CNN hall monitor Brian Stelter, who seemed concerned.\n\nTucker Carlson says Adam Schiff is \"clearly, demonstrably mentally ill,\" in case you're wondering how it's going over on Fox's pro-Trump talk shows. \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 27, 2019\n\nHow many \u201cTrump\u2019s Mental Fitness\u201d panels did you convene? To the nearest dozen. \u2014 100 Proof (@ChampionCapua) September 27, 2019\n\nSeriously \u2026 this is the same guy who\u2019s spent months of airtime questioning President Trump\u2019s mental fitness to be president. We went through our archives quickly and pulled up these gems from Stelter and his CNN collegues, although Stelter usually cushions his remarks by limiting them to Trump\u2019s \u201cfitness.\u201d\n\nNo, @GeraldoRivera, I never called Trump a \"mental case.\" I asked questions. Here's the transcript of Sunday's show: https://t.co/RgfQxbcu9B https://t.co/yyHpV7LLdF \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 21, 2017\n\n\"madness, shouldn't we call it that?\" Yes @brianstelter, this is madness. \u2014 April Conyers (@aprilolanoff) January 3, 2018\n\nThis is about the president's fitness. It's uncomfortable. But it's incumbent on journalists to ask these Q's. https://t.co/6DbjZW8S71 \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 3, 2018\n\nPsychiatrist tells Dems in Congress: Trump is losing grip on reality https://t.co/6dxJcC2bZr #TheLead pic.twitter.com/mJ71x1S5s2 \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 4, 2018\n\nThe gossipy parts of Wolff's book obscure the bigger, more important point. His reporting suggests Trump is unstable \u2014 raising alarms about his fitness for office. Here's my new column https://t.co/d9Y5JNBJtq \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 4, 2018\n\nMaybe President Trump is cool, calm and collected in person. But on Twitter, he sounds deeply troubled right now. He sounds unhinged. This is why Q's about his fitness for office are so urgent\u2026 https://t.co/Kj8xG1PZAp \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 18, 2018\n\nIf we were watching this unfold from some other country, we'd question the US president's wellness. \"Is the president okay?\" pic.twitter.com/9XsHAC9L0f \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 20, 2018\n\nSunday on @ReliableSources, I'll be joined by Dr. Bandy X.

The volume is much louder as of late\u2026https://t.co/dZFc4ie8JD \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 26, 2019\n\nYeah, so how many dozen panels has Stelter done about Trump\u2019s \u201cfitness?\u201d Since 2017 at least.\n\nFor the record, how often have you or guests discussed the President in this light? https://t.co/dYSXsGbzMf \u2014 Jeff Cunningham (@jeffrygc) September 27, 2019\n\nBrian Stelter has questioned Trump\u2019s mental health many times. https://t.co/5YKiAuISGv \u2014 Blake Aspen (@realBlakeAspen) September 27, 2019\n\nThat's so shocking! I'm shocked!

All you did was sit there and nod your head in approval. You have zero room to talk. https://t.co/y1Wfxrl95i \u2014 Ryan Smyth (@RyanSmyth7) September 27, 2019\n\nNowhere near as bad as your guest saying Trump may be responsible for more deaths than Hitler, Stalin, and Zedong combined.
