The Washington Post reported in May that from 2015 to 2017, revenue at Doral dropped 18%, from $92 million to $75 million, and that net operating income fell from $13.8 million to $4.3 million during the same time period.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Saturday night bowed to strong criticism and dramatically reversed his decision to have his Miami golf resort host next year's G-7 summit.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106190058-1571412963187gettyimages-514040234.jpeg?v=1571412991", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
