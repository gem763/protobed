It\u2019s the story of people. The story of farmers.\n\nIt\u2019s the story of mealies and tractors and bakkies. It\u2019s the story of the 12 859.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a story that begins on 1ha of land deep in the rural Eastern Cape.\n\nIt\u2019s a story that\u2019s been there for 20 years now, but which you\u2019ve not been told.\n\nThere, on that 1 hectare of land, is everything that South Africa can be.\n\nAnd there are 12 859 black farmers on their 1ha of land who are what this story is all about.\n\nIt\u2019s also the story of Jeremia Mathebula, last year\u2019s Grain SA Farmer of the Year.\n\nHe is the one of the 171 new black commercial farmers who are also the most positive story in South African farming and land reform that you\u2019ve not heard of.\n\n\u201cThis is not window dressing,\u201d Mathebula says emphatically.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go for that. I\u2019m the product of a white commercial farmer \u2013 Mr Pieter Vorster \u2013 who mentored me on grain farming.\n\nProgramme gives the subsistence farmers access to 90 of South Africa\u2019s most successful commercial farmers, who serve as their mentors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen how farmers are willing to help. But unfortunately these good stories don\u2019t travel as quickly.\u201d\n\nThe 12 859 and the 171 represent a 20-year investment of pure passion and faith by the farmers who fall under the auspices of Grain SA to achieve the one thing they all believe in.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong belief that the farming community can heal one another and heal the country,\u201d says Jannie de Villiers, the chief executive of Grain SA.\n\nFRACTURED\n\nFarming in South Africa seems as fractured as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nFrom the negative newspaper headlines comes a public perception that farming is divided and that the story of land is one of heartache, anger and resentment.\n\nBut for the past 20 years the farmers of Grain SA have looked deep into their own souls and reached out even deeper into their communities to try to prove that farmers have their own solution to land reform.\n\nAnd they\u2019re making it work with a R25 million a year operational budget and managing a further R120 million worth of projects on a farming development programme that is changing lives.\n\nThis development programme, a privately funded collective through Grain SA, is aimed entirely at new black farmers.\n\nIt now supports 12 859 black subsistence farmers \u2013 half of whom are women \u2013 from nine offices nationwide, and it has already created 171 new black commercial farmers producing 250 tons or more of maize annually.\n\nFarmers like Jeremia Mathebula.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve reached a great opportunity where black and white farmers are coming together to make sure the farming community of South Africa works,\u201d says Mathebula.\n\n\u201cOn the ground we work together. The white commercial farmers have the experience and they can and are willing to transfer. Colour is not an issue for us. It\u2019s about being productive on our land and feeding the nation. I\u2019ve worked with people of all races in farming and we are coming together like never before to make the farming community better, starting with skills transfer and programmes like the ones Grain SA is running.\u201d\n\n\n\nDriven by their belief to use farming to heal South Africa rather than divide it, Grain SA sponsors mobile units that travel into the most rural communities to offer clinics to teach skills, such as welding, grinding and painting, as well as how to service a tractor or repair farm equipment.\n\nThe programme has spawned a partnership with the science and technology department to develop small portable threshers so that these farmers can harvest their crops without having to work their thumbs till they bleed.\n\nAnd another partnership with Sasol provides these farmers with bags for their harvest so that it doesn\u2019t lie on the ground where it is subject to a mould that can cause serious illness.\n\nBut most importantly, this programme gives the subsistence farmers access to 90 of South Africa\u2019s most successful commercial farmers who serve as their mentors.\n\nThey travel by bakkie deep into these communities with the sole aim of helping an old black woman, barely surviving on 1 ton of maize a year from her 1ha of land, and using their science and expertise to make that same piece of land yield up to 8 tons of maize a year.\n\n\u201cYou change that person\u2019s life permanently because now he or she is not just living from hand to mouth, but actually making a profit by selling,\u201d says De Villiers, who leads the development programme\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked these women farmers what they did with the extra money they earned. It brings you to tears.\n\n\u201cOne old woman told me she bought herself a bed. She\u2019d never slept on a bed in her life. Another bought a fridge and another new school uniforms for her kids. That\u2019s how farming alleviates poverty.\n\n\u201cThese are the untold stories of farming in South Africa. That\u2019s the real story of land reform nobody is telling. And that\u2019s why we say agriculture can heal South Africa, because I\u2019ve seen how these farmers bond with their communities around farming and are helping one another.\u201d\n\nBut the story of land in Africa is a complex one.\n\nIt\u2019s an often one-sided conversation with a narrative that feeds political machinations and a tribal view of power, instead of people.\n\nIt\u2019s also a story of politics and that makes things difficult for everyone involved.\n\n\u201cThe subsistence farmers we support plant only 30% of their land because they cannot get bank loans to grow their operation. They work on communal land, so they have no title deeds. And that means they have no security to offer a bank to get finance to grow their potential,\u201d De Villiers says.\n\n\u201cThe National Credit Act says you cannot loan to anybody who has no security and these farmers can offer no security without title deeds for the land they\u2019re on. So we cannot help them get this land into full production for their benefit. We can only help them to use 30% of their land, while the rest just lies fallow. That\u2019s not real land reform and that\u2019s what we\u2019re campaigning to change. We have vast tracts of untapped communal land that we can develop to the benefit of these communities long before we get to the commercial farming land. We can solve this thing. If you give these thousands of subsistence farmers on communal land title deeds, you transform farming in South Africa right there.\u201d\n\nAs frustrating as the situation is for De Villiers and his team at Grain SA, he still believes in the words of South African mega-farmer Kallie Schoeman who says: \u201cAs a farmer, you can run out of money but you must never run out of plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are motivating at government level for an agricultural development fund where we can help secure finance for these farmers without them having a title deed. We will still fight for title deeds for these farmers, but in the meantime we are making plans to find another way for them to grow out of their subsistence situation,\u201d De Villiers says.\n\nHe knows full well that, as the stereotype of the white Afrikaans farmer, changing perceptions is as much a part of the battle as changing legislation.\n\n\u201cThere are days when this is tough, when all you hear is the negative attitude towards farmers. But I\u2019ve seen how black and white farmers can work together and love each other. And that\u2019s because farmers are optimists at heart. The average farmer will go and get a loan for R10 million, put it in the ground and pray for rain. That faith is the same faith that can change people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nSo while the headlines and politicians might still tell only part of the story of South African farming, there is a 1ha piece of land in the Eastern Cape where a commercial farmer and an old Xhosa woman are telling the other side of the story.\n\nAnd the seeds they\u2019re planting together are quietly growing into the new story of an African farm.", "description": "Programme gives the subsistence farmers access to 90 of South Africa\u2019s most successful commercial farmers, who serve as their mentors.", "authors": ["Michael Vlismas"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9336/638486ebbce44415b5093cc7acec3e3f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
