These have been undergoing extensive on-road validation testing throughout the US, Canada, and China. We\u2019re continuing to fine-tune various systems to ensure that we deliver our flagship vehicle to the market with the highest standards of safety, reliability and comfort. I\u2019ve frequently said that the last 5% of this final stage of delivering a production vehicle is often the hardest; however, our entire team is moving rapidly to accomplish this goal. We will begin delivering our production SOLO\u2019s to early adopter customers in early 2020, strategically launching in the Los Angeles area first, followed by broader expansion into other West Coast markets.\u201d\n\nRivera, concluded: \u201cWe stand at an inflection point as a company, moving from a great idea into commercial production. To support these initiatives, we\u2019ve taken many strategic steps to enhance relationships with partners, bolster our team and ensure the vehicles we are delivering meet our high standards, which ultimately, will help support a much larger, more mature organization. We\u2019re also working to ensure a seamless and convenient customer experience. I look forward to providing future investor updates as we launch this category-defining vehicle and create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d\n\nProactive Investors Video Interview\n\nIn the just-released interview Rivera discusses how the company\u2019s flagship EV, the SOLO, is redefining the commuter experience, while providing a thorough update on his vision and upcoming launch of the SOLO.
