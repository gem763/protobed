The airline\u2019s capacity expansion, as measured by available seat km (ASK), peaked at 51% growth year-on-year in June 2018 but has since plummeted, hitting just 1% last month amid the focus on preserving cash and cutting costs.\n\nAnalysts in the Reuters poll had forecast ASK would show no growth at all in the year to September.\n\nNorwegian\u2019s bondholders agreed last month to postpone repayments on $380 million of outstanding debt for up to two years, in the company\u2019s latest bid to sort out its finances.\n\nA string of European airlines have folded in the last two years, including recent collapses of Aigle Azur, Adria Airways and travel firm Thomas Cook, but loss-making Norwegian has secured funding from shareholders to stay in the air.", "description": "Norwegian Air's income per passenger rose less than expected in September, although its aircraft were more full than at the same time last year, the airline's monthly traffic report showed on Friday.", "authors": ["Terje Solsvik", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436924708&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930DY", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
