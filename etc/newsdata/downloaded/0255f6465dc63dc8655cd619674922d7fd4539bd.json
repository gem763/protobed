It was just stupidity.\n\n'The hard shoulder is a refuge for you to pull into to sort your car out.\n\n'I want the police to see it because this is going to kill someone if it happens again.'\n\nThe incident happened on Sunday at around 7.40am near Junction 4 on the M25.\n\nJustin played back the footage repeatedly but could not identify the car's registration number.\n\nHe reported the incident to police who are considering an investigation.", "description": "Chauffeur Justin Scrutton, 47, caught the dreadful driving on his dash cam.
