The autopsy report appeared to put much speculation about the 66-year-old financier\u2019s death to rest.\n\nThe medical examiner says Wednesday she stands \u201cfirmly\u201d behind her findings.\n\nBaden says Epstein\u2019s injuries included fractures to the larynx and hyoid bone. He says he hasn\u2019t seen that in a suicide in 50 years of death investigations, but cautioned that his observations were not conclusive.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center with a bedsheet around his neck on Aug. 10. He\u2019d been held there since his July 6 arrest on sex trafficking charges.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A longtime forensic pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein's brother says some evidence suggests Epstein died by homicidal strangulation, not suicide by hanging.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/jeffrey_epstein_39147_c0-170-2000-1336_s1200x700.jpg?dfd39ead359feca747ed461be48844e45d26a69b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
