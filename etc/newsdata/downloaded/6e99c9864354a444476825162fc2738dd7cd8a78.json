[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nEditor's Note: The State Council recently released a special report on national administrative and public State-owned assets, which shows that at the end of 2018 the scale of national administrative and public State-owned assets was 33.5 trillion yuan ($4.74 trillion), among which the scale of administrative organizations' State-owned assets was 10.1 trillion yuan, and that of public institutions' State-owned assets was 23.4 trillion yuan. Beijing Youth Daily comments:\n\nThe total scale of China's State-owned assets has been released to the public, which not only satisfies the public's right to know, it also gives them more confidence in social development.\n\nState-owned assets management departments at various levels are responsible for preventing the loss, depreciation and waste of State-owned assets, and should make efforts to increase the value of State-owned assets as much as possible.\n\nChina's State-owned assets include not only the assets of State-owned enterprises, but also the assets of administrative bodies and public institutions. Assets such as government buildings, office facilities and government vehicles are administrative State-owned assets, while assets such as medical facilities and hospital beds are public State-owned assets.\n\nWith the country's rapid social and economic development in recent years, more and more public funds and resources have been invested in public infrastructure, housing, education, culture and medical care. This rapid growth of administrative and public State-owned assets has improved the quality of public services.\n\nBut while increasing the scale of public State-owned assets in medical treatment, education and public culture should be encouraged, and the growth of administrative State-owned assets, such as government buildings, should be curbed, in order to reduce local governments' fiscal burden.\n\nThe larger the scale of China's State-owned assets, the greater the responsibility of State-owned asset management departments at all levels to ensure that they help improve public services and enhance people's sense of well-being.", "description": "Editor's Note: The State Council recently released a special report on national administrative and public State-owned assets, which shows that at the end of 2018 the scale of national administrative and public State-owned assets was 33.5 trillion yuan ($4.74 trillion), among which the scale of administrative organizations' State-owned assets was 10.1 trillion yuan, and that of public institutions' State-owned assets was 23.4 trillion yuan.
