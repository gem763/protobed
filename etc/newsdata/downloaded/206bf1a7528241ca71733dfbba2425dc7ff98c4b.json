The 22-year-old Jacobson had played just 20 minutes off the bench against Argentina before he was named in the squad for the tournament.\n\nHe came off the bench against Tonga on 7 September and did not suffer any issues until the All Blacks arrived in Japan and he developed symptoms after their first training session.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: New Zealand team guide Read more\n\n\u201cAfter discussing this latest episode with Luke, as well as our medical team, the decision has been made to, sadly, withdraw him from the tournament,\u201d All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said. \u201cWe all felt that the best thing for him to do is to take a break from rugby until he is symptom-free.\n\n\u201cWhile it was a tough conversation to have, ultimately it was a very simple decision. Luke\u2019s health is the most important thing above anything else.\u201d\n\nThe highly regarded Jacobson had been one of New Zealand\u2019s form players in Super Rugby but after he made his debut against the Pumas he did not appear again due to concussion symptoms. The former captain of the New Zealand Under-20 side, however, told media last month that his symptoms were behind him.\n\nHe said on Friday he was \u201cgutted\u201d to be missing the World Cup. \u201cWhilst I\u2019m feeling 98% OK, I know I\u2019m still not quite right,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cBy taking a break now, I\u2019ll give myself the opportunity to continue my career in the future.\u201d\n\nNumber of Kiwi coaches at World Cup prompts questions over health of global rugby | Matt McIlraith Read more\n\nJacobson battled concussion in 2018 and only returned to rugby in March after eight months out of the game. He told reporters in April that he had headaches for \u201cfour or five months\u201d last year.\n\nFrizell was in the original 39-man squad selected by Hansen this year as he narrowed his picks for the tournament and while he played against the Springboks in July, he was not included for two matches against Australia.\n\nThe 25-year-old had been playing in New Zealand\u2019s provincial competition, appearing as a lock, No 8 and blindside flanker. Hansen added that Dalton Papalii and Vaea Fifita, who also dropped out of World Cup contention earlier in the season, were not considered because of injury.", "description": "All Blacks loose forward Luke Jacobson has been ruled out of the Rugby World Cup due to a delayed onset of concussion and will be replaced by Shannon Frizell", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148fd329ab7a350065bcb09a933e572d7f96a341/0_146_2934_1760/master/2934.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d6ff5caa171ad0eb9b5dab4ca848aa6", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
