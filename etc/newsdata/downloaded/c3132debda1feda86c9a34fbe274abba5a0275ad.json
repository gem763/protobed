The problem was the title: The Vagina Bible. It appeared that \u201cvagina\u201d was red-flagged by Twitter Ads as \u201cinappropriate language\u201d.\n\nGunter was understandably outraged: \u201cWhen we\u2019re not allowed to say a word the implication is it\u2019s dirty or shameful. Not being able to buy an ad because of the word vagina for a book about vaginas is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nJennifer Gunter: \u2018Women are being told lies about their bodies\u2019 Read more\n\nA suitably vagina-laden outcry followed, and Twitter permitted the offending promoted tweets on its network. But if Twitter\u2019s default position is to ban the word vagina on the grounds of vulgarity, what does that say about the way we think about women\u2019s bodies?\n\nIt\u2019s time we all got comfortable with the term vagina \u2013 and while we\u2019re at it, vulva, labia and clitoris. How are women supposed to talk about their health or sexuality if the anatomically correct words used to describe their body parts are taboo? While it might make sense to ask a beautician to vajazzle your vajayjay, cutesy euphemisms don\u2019t cut it in the doctor\u2019s surgery.\n\nWhen women absorb the \u201cick\u201d factor associated with our vaginas, it puts us at risk of missing out on essential healthcare. A 2015 survey in the UK revealed that 66% of women aged 18 to 24 avoided going to the doctor to talk about gynaecological issues altogether.\n\nWhile it might make sense to ask a beautician to vajazzle your vajayjay, cutesy euphemisms don\u2019t cut it in the doctor\u2019s surgery\n\n\u201cAs a gynae doc I see so many adult women who refer to problems in their \u201cdown belows/minnie/fanny/foof\u201d and then have to spend valuable consultation time trying to get them to specify which bit of their genitalia they are talking about,\u201d observed one medic.\n\nOur unwillingness to correctly label female anatomy contributes to other problems, including a \u201cpleasure gap\u201d that sees men\u2019s sexual needs prioritised over women\u2019s. Sex is often seen as synonymous with male pleasure. Female pleasure, however, is usually overlooked, tossed into the too-hard basket.\n\nDr Jessica Eaton, a UK-based psychologist who runs sex education training for teachers, recounts on Twitter how teachers admitted they were willing to say the word \u201cpenis\u201d and talk about male masturbation, but none were comfortable talking about vaginas and female pleasure in the same way.\n\nThe effect of this double standard is captured by Peggy Orenstein, who spent three years talking to young women about their experience of sex while researching her book Girls & Sex. In a 2017 TED Talk, she talks about how many young women don\u2019t feel entitled to enjoy sex. They expressed a sense of shame around their genitals, a problem that she says stems from a cultural reluctance to talk about women\u2019s bodies. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to make something unspeakable than not to name it.\u201d\n\nIf we want to make female pleasure as important as male pleasure, we need to normalise conversations about sex \u2013 starting with the proper names for our sexual organs.\n\nThe pleasure revolution: the sex women really want Read more\n\nIt\u2019s also essential for kids to know how to talk about their bodies. Sexual health educators argue that teaching children anatomically correct terms for their body parts \u2013 genitals included \u2013 helps reduce shame and gives them the language they need if they ever become the victim of abuse. Children are less likely to disclose inappropriate behaviour if they don\u2019t have the vocabulary to describe it or believe that they will get in trouble for broaching a taboo topic.\n\nNow, many will note that the vagina refers specifically to the internal structure that connects the cervix to the external genitalia. In common parlance, however, vagina is shorthand for the whole kit and caboodle, which is fine with me.\n\nAs Gunter argues in her book\u2019s introduction, \u201clanguage evolves and words take on new meaning\u201d. She points out that just as the term \u201cgut\u201d originally referred to the lower intestinal tract but is now used to describe the entire digestive system as well as the liver and pancreas, \u201cvagina\u201d is typically understood to refer to the lower reproductive tracts.\n\nSo, familiarise yourself with the correct terms for the human body\u2019s reproductive bits and make sure your kids know the difference between the vulva and the vagina. After all, knowledge is power.\n\n\u2022 Nicola Heath is a freelance writer", "description": "Our collective reluctance to say \u2018vagina\u2019 shrouds women\u2019s bodies \u2013 and their sexuality \u2013 in shame", "authors": ["Nicola Heath"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86db1fb383ef3502021cbd4bb982e4c212b55dd3/942_487_4568_2741/master/4568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0bb6e7d6435cf8363f11d7057ff11139", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
