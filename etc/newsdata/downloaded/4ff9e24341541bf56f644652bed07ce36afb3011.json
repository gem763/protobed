We've touched base on how to deal with the situation.\n\n'Harry Kane even said that if it happens and we're not happy with it, we speak to the player and if he's not happy, we all come off the pitch together.\n\n'It's a team thing. Don't isolate one person, we're a whole team. If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\n\n'We did speak about the three-step protocol. Harry Kane did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps, if we decide that we want to stop the game \u2014 no matter what the score is \u2014 if we're not happy with it, as a team we'll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.'\n\nRaheem Sterling cups his hands to his ears after scoring in England's win over Montenegro\n\nMontenegro were fined after their fans were found to have racially abused England stars\n\nAsked if he believes players would follow through with a pitch walk-off, Abraham replied: 'I do. Watching the gaffer speaking yesterday, he was quite keen on putting a stop to it.\n\n'No one wants (racism) in football. It's not just affecting one person, it's affecting the team. It's a team decision if we decide in the end that we don't want to play this game anymore because of what's going on. We'll come off as a team.\n\n'We don't stand for it and we want the world to see that we don't stand for the silly abuse.'\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton has pulled out of the squad with an unspecified injury. Dean Henderson, 22, on loan at Sheffield United from Manchester United, has been called up in his place.", "description": "Southgate led a team meeting to discuss the prospect of racist taunts during Monday's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria, and also Friday's game in Prague against the Czech Republic.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19460438-0-image-a-20_1570565991279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
