I felt like my heart broke.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I was just absolutely shocked and devastated.\n\n\"I couldn't believe she had died right at the very end when there had been nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old, who lives in Overton, Hampshire, had a completely standard pregnancy and she and husband Sam couldn't wait to meet their beautiful baby girl.\n\nTheir older daughter was very excited to be a big sister, and when Roxanne went into labour on Thursday, November 15 last year the countdown to become a family of four was on.\n\n(Image: Roxanne Burrows)\n\nSpeaking to mark Baby Loss Awareness Week, Roxanne told Mirror Online: \"I was thrilled when I found out I was pregnant. I had a completely textbook pregnancy, the same as with my first daughter. It was totally uneventful.\"\n\nWhen she went for her 38 week appointment her bump was measuring slightly smaller than the nurse would have liked so she was sent for tests, which were all healthy and normal.\n\nRoxanne said: \"She was absolutely fine. She was perfect. Her heartbeat was strong and they thought she was growing fine.\"\n\nRoxanne went into labour at home and starting counting down the hours until she got to meet her little girl.\n\nHowever she didn't progress out of the early stages for more than 30 hours, and after two days she was fed up so the hospital told her to come in for a routine check up appointment.\n\n(Image: Remember My Baby)\n\nThe midwife did all the checks and everything seemed fine, until she tried to find the baby's heartbeat.\n\nRoxanne said: \"At this point I was thinking maybe it's just the equipment. I was starting to worry a bit but I didn't think anything so terrible had happened.\"\n\nThe midwife told her not to worry and went to get another machine, but that didn't pick up a heartbeat either.\n\n\"It was then that I knew. I knew something bad had happened. They had always been able to find her heartbeat.\"\n\nShe was sent straight down for an ultrasound which confirmed Roxanne's worst fears.\n\n\"I was having a complete breakdown. Sam just looked completely shocked. He just sat there silently, holding my hand.\n\n(Image: Roxanne Burrows)\n\n\"I don't really remember the bits that happened after that. It's like I was looking at it through a fog.\"\n\nThey were then taken up to the hospital's bereavement suite, which gave them complete privacy and meant they were away from other pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nJust after 7.20pm, Roxanne gave birth to baby Kaitlyn.\n\n\"I'd had been through labour before so I knew what labour felt like, but with Kaitlyn my brain just couldn't get involved at all. My brain was in a totally different place to what my body was doing.\n\n\"The pain was unbelievable. It was far worst than my first labour. It was just dreadful.\"\n\n(Image: Remember My Baby)\n\nIn the end Roxanne was given an epidural, which she was grateful for as it meant Kaitlyn could had a peaceful delivery.\n\nShe said: \"She had the delivery that I always wanted for her. It was quite beautiful.\n\n\"They asked if I wanted to see her and I didn't even hesitate. I couldn't wait to meet her. I just wanted to have her and hold her in my arms.\n\n\"She was perfect. She looked like any other newborn baby, she just didn't open her eyes or make a sound.\n\n\"I don't think I let go of her that night. I cuddled her for hours.\"\n\nDuring the next few hours they gave Kaitlyn a bath, brushed her hair, took photos and made prints of her hands and footprints.\n\n(Image: Remember My Baby)\n\nThe hospital lent them a pram so they could go outside and organised for a professional photographer to go out with them to capture the special moment.\n\n\"I really wanted to take her for a walk. I just wanted her to see outside.\"\n\nOver the next few days they went back to the hospital to spend more time with Kaitlyn, introducing her to her big sister.\n\n\"It was really hard to explain it to her. She had no idea what 'died' meant, it was probably the first time she had heard the word.\n\n\"It took a long time, we drip fed it to her over a number of days, probably weeks.\n\n\"She would ask questions and we would keep it very simple and keep repeating the same words.\n\n(Image: Remember My Baby)\n\n\"We don't talk about sleeping or being poorly as we don't want her to be scared of those things. We don't talk about dying in hospital as we don't want her to be scared of going to hospital.\n\n\"We have to be honest, even though it hurts.\"\n\nThe hospital gave them a book called 'Playground in the Sky' which they read to her to help her understand, and she still says that's where her little sister is now.\n\nOn the Wednesday Roxanne returned to the hospital on her own to say goodbye to Kaitlyn.\n\n\"I just spent a couple of hours with her. I had written her a letter and bought her a pendant with the letter K on it.\n\n\"I made sure she was wrapped up in her cot with all her things and I left her with the midwife.\n\n(Image: Roxanne Burrows)\n\n\"I had spent nine months growing her and speaking to her everyday, I felt like I needed to be the last person to give her a kiss and say goodbye and hold her.\n\n\"It was beautiful but it really hurt.\n\n\"Every day that we walked out of that hospital without her just felt wrong. You walk past parents carrying their babies and I just thought 'that should be us'. It really hurt.\"\n\nRoxanne described the weeks that followed as \"horrendous\".\n\n\"I could barely get out of bed. I cried all the time, just all the time in a way I have never cried before in my life.\n\n\"I couldn't spent time with our oldest daughter. People kept saying at least you've got her to get up for, but it made me panic as I couldn't spend time with her because every time I saw her I just saw a missing space where Kaitlyn should be.\n\n(Image: Remember My Baby)\n\n\"They just looked so similar. I thought I was a terrible mum.\"\n\nJust a few weeks after losing Kaitlyn the family had to deal with Christmas.\n\n\"It was just brutal. I just felt like I was walking around in a glass box. I could see and hear people but I just wasn't on this planet. I felt like a ghost.\"\n\nRoxanne and Sam decided to try a Sands support group, and ended up meeting a number of people who truly understood the pain they were feeling.\n\nThe couple also both used the charity's helpline and say it gave them invaluable support when things got really, really bad.\n\n(Image: Remember My Baby)\n\nRoxanne said: \"I've spent hours just crying and talking to them about all the things in my head and they're always there.\"\n\nThe couple have also done a number of incredible things in Kaitlyn's name to help other parents going through the same painful time.\n\nThey set up a support group at their local hospital called Flutterbyes, offering support to anyone who needs it.\n\nOne of the things that Roxanne found really helpful during the weeks after saying goodbye to Kaitlyn was a weighted memory bear, custom made to be the exact same weight as she was.\n\n(Image: Roxanne Burrows)\n\n\"My arms would really ache, I would feel this longing to hold a baby. It would take over everything.\n\n\"The bear was beautiful.\"\n\nSo Roxanne told the midwives about the bears, who loved the idea and put in touch with the hospital charity who also agreed it was a great. They agreed to help fund one for any parents who lost a baby there.\n\nRoxanne said: \"Just being able to do little things here and there in her honour, it just means such a huge amount.\"\n\nSands (Stillbirth and neonatal death charity) supports anyone affected by the death of a baby.
