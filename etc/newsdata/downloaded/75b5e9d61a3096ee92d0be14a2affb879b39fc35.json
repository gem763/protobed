You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nShe instead suggested the comments were being taken out of context, and that in the business leaders\u2019 meeting she was trying to explain her thought process for staying on as leader.\n\nHong Kong has entered its 14th consecutive week of protests, with thousands of students and some school pupils again boycotting classes on Tuesday despite the end of the summer holidays.\n\nWhat started out as a series of demonstrations against an unpopular extradition bill has expanded into a broad-based protest movement seeking to defend Hong Kong\u2019s democratic freedoms from perceived encroachment by Beijing.\n\nIn the audio recording, Ms Lam could be heard saying she felt it was unforgivable for a chief executive to have presided over such a crisis. She suggests the weeks of unrest were her fault for introducing the now-suspended bill, and that her preferred course of action would have been \u201chaving made a deep apology\u2026 to step down\u201d.\n\nDuring the chief executive\u2019s weekly media briefing on Tuesday, she was asked repeatedly why Beijing would not let her step aside \u2013 one of the key demands of the protest movement.\n\nBut Ms Lam said that \u201cnot resigning was my own choice\u2026 I have not given myself the choice to take an easier path and that is to leave\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never tendered a resignation to the central people\u2019s government. I have not even contemplated to discuss a resignation,\u201d she said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Protest leaders in the city are now demanding that the process of electing a chief executive be opened up \u2013 something the Chinese government said in 2014 it would not allow.\n\nProtesters at Hong Kong University on Tuesday criticised Ms Lam for failing to listen to any of what they call their \u201cfive demands\u201d.\n\nAside from the matter of the chief executive\u2019s position, they are for the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, an amnesty for all arrested demonstrators, for police to stop categorising rallies as \u201criots\u201d and for an independent inquiry into allegations of police violence.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

doesn\u2019t matter. Chief executive is still chosen by the central government. What matters is if she refuses to respond to the five demands. She\u2019s an irresponsible leader.\u201d\n\nThe school and university boycotts follow on from one of the worst weekends of violent clashes in Hong Kong in recent weeks.\n\nAfter the police attempted to ban a planned march on Saturday, protesters set up and burned barricades, and threw petrol bombs. On Sunday, thousands gathered to block key roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport, and smashed turnstiles and other public property at an MTR station. Police retaliated on both days with water cannons, tear gas and baton charges.\n\nMore than 1,100 people have been detained since the unrest began, including prominent activists like the 2014 Umbrella Movement leader Joshua Wong.\n\nMr Wong was held and then bailed on Friday in what his party, Demosisto, called an attempt to intimidate the protest movement.\n\nOn Tuesday, he spoke at an event in Taipei, calling on the Taiwanese people to hold their own demonstrations as they face their own pressures from China.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the past have said \u2018today Hong Kong and tomorrow Taiwan\u2019,\u201d Mr Wong said, a reference to China\u2019s suggestion that Taiwan could be ruled by Beijing under the same \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle that it applies to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cBut I think the most ideal thing we\u2019d say is \u2018Taiwan today, tomorrow Hong Kong\u2019. Hong Kong can be like Taiwan, a place for freedom and democracy.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam has insisted she never offered to resign, after an audio recording was leaked in which she appeared to suggest she would quit as chief executive if she could.", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/14/carrie-lam.jpg"}
