What a normal limousine-builder would definitely not want to start with is a tiny 1993 Ford Festiva. That would make no sense, but then, here we are.\n\nIn an attempt to figure out what the heck is going on with this elongated econobox, I reached out to the Missouri-based seller, who has listed this \u201c93 Festiva Limo and spare parts\u201d on Facebook Marketplace for a seemingly reasonable $2,982. Sadly, I have yet to receive a response, so we\u2019re just going to have to use our imaginations, and maybe some clues, to attempt to understand why something this absurd exists.\n\nIn the listing\u2019s description, the seller admits that the Festiva Limo is a \u201cproject\u201d that\u2019s about 90 per cent done. It apparently has air conditioning, a clean title, and it\u2019s legal to drive on the road. That last point is amazing considering that this is clearly a home-brew contraption made by hacking one Festiva\u2019s nose off, and welding it to a Festiva that has had its rear chopped off.\n\nThe best part of the build is the short black triangular prism bridging the C-pillar of the front Festiva to the A-pillar of the rear Festiva to yield a perfectly flat roof. Sure, you could argue that this awkward patch further highlights the fact that maybe the Festiva isn\u2019t the optimal base for a limousine, but I think it gives the cute black and red stretched compact car tons of character.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the Ford Ranchero in the background of the picture above, but it\u2019s not just any Ranchero, it\u2019s one with a camper. And it\u2019s not just any Ranchero with a camper, it\u2019s a one with a short camper.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just any Ranchero with a short camper, I think \u2014 despite a lack of stacks, a different colour hood, and a missing side skirt \u2014 it\u2019s one that was featured last year on Barnfinds.com. The site wrote about a wacky 1970 Ford Ranchero for sale in Nebraska, and referred to the car as a \u201cside-show freak\u201d before describing some of its oddball features, writing:\n\nThe lower tail lights are stock 1970 Ranchero, with 1970 Torino tail lights and a fog light re-purposed as a loading light above the sliding rear window. Vertical stacks exhaust the engine\u2019s spent gasses, and a Lincoln Continental trunk serves as a bed cover. The combination of the crude fender skirts and front and rear rubber \u201cspoilers\u201d impart Hovercraft-inspired aerodynamics.\ufeff [...] From the \u201cWTH\u201d department\u2026 this, folks, is the fifth-wheel goose-neck ball and safety chain loops, though I\u2019d rather not find out what happens when your giant fifth-wheel camper pops loose while descending Fancy Gap.\n\nThe weirdo Ranchero is, I think, one of two clues that have me convinced that there\u2019s some sort of strange mutant automobile operation going on in Missouri. The second clue is the sheer number of spare parts this seller has for this (these?) Festiva(s). Seriously, look at this:\n\nI\u2019m seeing doors, hatches, a wheel, seats, and what is that on the bottom? A transmission?\n\nThen there are more seats, and what looks like at least four radiators.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the four gauge clusters?\n\nAnd there appear to be more gauge clusters, and a bunch of taillights. Plus, whatever all this crap is:\n\nI don\u2019t know what the heck is going on in Kearney, Missouri, but between the wacky Ford Festiva limo, the Ford Ranchero with the short cab, and the absurd number of spare parts, I\u2019m thinking that perhaps an ambitious Festiva-lover with lots of zany car ideas got a hold of a welder, and set about living their best life.\n\nI\u2019m all for it.\n\nh/t: James!", "description": "I you want to build a limousine, chances are you\u2019ll want to start with something big, seeing as the aim is to maximise interior volume.
