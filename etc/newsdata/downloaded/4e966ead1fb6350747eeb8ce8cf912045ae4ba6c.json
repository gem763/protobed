I think we need to see the world as it is. And, I think it's important that the president meets with Erdo\u011fan.\"\n\n\"His conversations, so far, I think are leading towards peace,\" he noted, admitting that trust \"has to be verified.\"\n\nPaul said that he believes it's important that the United States does not \"slap sanctions on Turkey that never go away\" and that he thinks the Kurds \"have had many, many, lives saved here by the president's action.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think there's also the possibility for the Kurds to negotiate a semi-autonomous region where they would share in oil receipts with the Assad government,\" he stated. \"But, it means that [Syrian President Bashar] Assad has to be part of the equation.\"\n\n\"This is a war that was started with President Obama getting involved in a senseless way in the Middle East again,\" Paul concluded. \"But now, it looks like we may actually see a realignment and a possible peace plan that will come about because of President Trump's decisive action.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Ronn Blitzer, Andrew O'Reilly, Melissa Leon, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky.,\u00a0said that President Trump's Wednesday announcement of a \"permanent ceasefire\" between\u00a0Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is an \"extraordinary breakthrough.\"", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/RAND-CROP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
