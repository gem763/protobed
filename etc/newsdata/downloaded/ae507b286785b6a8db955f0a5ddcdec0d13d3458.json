She is speaking science to power. I admire her and I am glad to see I am not the only one.\u201d\n\nLast month the Dark Knight Rises star heaped praise on the teen climate crusader, posting an Instagram video of Thunberg at the United Nations accompanied by the hashtag \u201c#ImWithGreta.\u201d\n\nThunberg garnered glowing praise from the corporate media for her furious tirade against world governments\u2019 inaction against so-called climate change at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City last month. While attending the annual summit, the 16-year-old and a group of child activists filed a complaint against Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina, and Turkey in which they alleged their inaction on global warming is a violation of child rights.\n\nIn an interview with Europe 1, French President Emmanuel Macron called the complaint \u201cvery radical\u201d and warned it would likely \u201cantagonize societies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the movements of our youth \u2014 or our not-so-young \u2014 are helpful,\u201d explained the globalist leader. \u201cBut they must now focus on those who are furthest away, those who are seeking to block the way.\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s actions not only attracted criticism from male leaders, but female ones as well.\n\nBrune Poirson, France\u2019s Ecological Transition Minister, joined Macron in criticizing Thunberg\u2019s remarks, telling French radio station France Inter: \u201cI am not sure that you mobilize people with despair, with what is almost hatred, setting people against each other.\u201d\n\nHathaway\u2019s comments come as Thunberg was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize, which instead was awarded to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for ending his country\u2019s long-standing border conflict with Eritrea.", "description": "Hollywood actress Anne Hathaway has accused critics of Swedish climate alarmist\u00a0Greta Thunberg of\u00a0\"textbook misogyny\" in a newly-released interview with the British press.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Anne-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
