Because it\u2019s great news for them, it\u2019s great news, but as I keep saying, it\u2019s just the start.\n\n\u2018And the moment any complacency creeps in, or standards drop, they\u2019ll all suffer, so I\u2019m pleased that they\u2019re smiling.\n\n\u2018But they need to take this now as something to add to their armoury and go, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m an England player now, I\u2019m in the England squad, so I need to show even more day in and day out, game in and game out, for us\u201d.\u2019\n\nLampard has shown a huge amount of faith in Chelsea\u2019s emerging youngsters (Picture: Getty)\n\nOn Abraham, he added: \u2018I want to see him continue playing in the same vein for Chelsea, continue scoring those goals. And then when he goes to England I think he naturally has the attributes to go there and be successful, but it will be another step for him.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s competition there. When he steps into the squad he\u2019ll see that there are great strikers around him there already, so it\u2019s a good challenge for Tammy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Frank Lampard has told Chelsea duo Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori they must raise their game even more and not rest on their laurels after earning call-ups to the England...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174699886_1570194020.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
