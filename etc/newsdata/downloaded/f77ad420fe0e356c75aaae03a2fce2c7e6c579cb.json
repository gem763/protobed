I don't find it hard because I'm kept busy and he is too.\n\n'Obviously it's very different after coming out of the villa where you were with each other 24/7.

I believe don\u2019t rush things in life, think of the longevity, think of the long term.\n\n'Things have a plan. If you are with someone\u2026 its back to labels again, everyone labels things these days. But if you are seeing someone, you don\u2019t go out and do something with anyone else, you just focus on them.'", "description": "The Love Island pair were putting on a united front when they attended the launch of the ballroom dancer's new collection with Debenhams, looking just as loved up as ever.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19502260-0-image-a-16_1570642107896.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
