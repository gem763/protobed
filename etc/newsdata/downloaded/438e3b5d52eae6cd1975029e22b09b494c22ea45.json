Not fighting. Just there. Just there. And it\u2019s time to come back home,\" Trump said in his first public remarks since the shift was announced late Sunday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"But I can understand the other side of it,\" he continued. \"But if you go by the other side, that means we should never, ever come home.\"\n\nThe president lamented that the most difficult aspect of his job is writing letters to the families of soldiers killed overseas. He described writing to families of soldiers killed by mines or snipers, calling it \"devastating.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re willing to do what we have to do, but there has to be an endgame,\" he said. \"And if you stay, it\u2019s going to be the same thing. Eventually you\u2019re going to have to leave.\"\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that Turkey will soon be launching a military operation in northern Syria and that U.S. troops will no longer be \u201cin the immediate area\u201d when it happens. The U.S. had more than 1,000 troops deployed in northern Syria, working closely with Kurdish-led forces that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nAsked Monday if he consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the decision, Trump claimed that he had.\n\n\"I consulted with everybody,\" he said. \"I always consult with everybody.\"\n\nBut there appeared to be disunity in the administration and the GOP in the aftermath of the White House announcement.\n\nShortly after Trump spoke, a senior administration official told reporters in a phone briefing that the shift in strategy did not constitute a withdrawal and that the impacted troops \u2014 approximately 50 to 100 special operators in the region \u2014 would merely be relocated to other bases in the region.\n\nThe official also pushed back on any notion that Trump had given a \"green light\" to Turkey to conduct the operation.\n\n\"There was a headline in The New York Times today that the president endorsed the operation in northern Syria,\" the official said. \"We made it very clear that we did not endorse and do not endorse an operation in northern Syria.\"\n\nThe Pentagon had issued a statement earlier Monday indicating it did not approve of any Turkish offensive, while Republican lawmakers appeared to have been left in the dark on Trump's thinking and lined up to criticize the strategy.\n\nSen.

When do we leave?

In tweets and comments in the Roosevelt Room, he chiefly argued that he campaigned on a pledge to end U.S. involvement in \"endless wars\" and that American forces should not serve as a global police force.\n\nHe insisted that, if needed, he can act to cripple the Turkish economy or that the U.S. forces can return to the area, though he has not specified under what conditions those things would happen.\n\nMorgan Chalfant contributed.
