Then nerves crept in once more.\n\n\"We're unable to control our second halves, especially at the start of them,\" France head coach Jacques Brunel said. \"We need to work on that.\"\n\nFrance has won two games by a two-point margin despite having been seemingly in control of both- Argentina also finished 23-21 after France led that one 20-3 at halftime.\n\nThe 33-9 win against the U.S lineup was sealed with three late tries from the bench after the Eagles hit back after trailing 12-0 early on.\n\nFrance coach Jacques Brunel watches his players warm up ahead of the Rugby World Cup Pool C game at Kumamoto Stadium between France and Tonga in Kumamoto, Japan, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.

Ntamack sent two penalties over with France creaking against the Tongans to make it 23-14.\n\nMuch of the credit for the improvement in France's play has been attributed to assistant coach Fabien Galthie, and the staff members he brought with him when joining the set up after another dour Six Nations campaign from Les Bleus.\n\nBrunel is widely expected to be replaced by Galthie - a former standout scrumhalf for France - after the tournament ends and remains evasive about his current role.\n\n\"What would you like me to be specific about?\" Brunel said dismissively. \"Like the rest of the staff he contributes to building this team.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport\n\nFrench players celebrate after their Rugby World Cup Pool C game at Kumamoto Stadium against Tonga in Kumamoto, Japan, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.
