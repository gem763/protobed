This week the European Club Association (ECA), will complete a two-day general assembly in Geneva. The main subject of discussion will be Uefa\u2019s proposed reform of the Champions League in 2024.\n\nThere is little unanimity among the clubs about the direction the sport should take. What almost everyone agrees is that football is emerging from a period of rapid change and, in the course of two decades, has become bloated by money. At least at the top end. And in England.\n\nHuddersfield Town finished bottom of the Premier League last season and received \u00a397million in television money. Only Barcelona and Real Madrid earned more in domestic broadcast cash. The changes being promoted by Uefa and debated in Geneva are driven by this situation. A wave of envy and resentment has swept across the continent as Premier League television rights spiralled upwards.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe English top flight achieved its wealth by producing a very attractive product but it also benefited from strong leadership. Richard Scudamore, the former executive chairman, was an excellent negotiator and had a clear sense of purpose that brought 20 clubs with competing interests together. Scudamore\u2019s aim was to make the clubs wealthier. That is something they could all buy into. An alternative name for the top flight could be Greed United.\n\nThe avarice remains but the leadership has gone. Scudamore stepped down in November and 10 months later there is no sign of a replacement. While seismic changes are being plotted across Europe, the Premier League is drifting without either a chief executive or a chairman. Susanna Dinnage accepted the role as Scudamore\u2019s replacement last year but the Discovery Channel executive changed her mind quickly. Tim Davie, the chief executive at BBC Studios and the second choice, also turned down the position. Since then there has been a vacuum at the helm.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Lokomotiv Moscow Some canny additions with plenty of European experience to complement a strong Russian base, but not enough top-end quality to predict progression. Getty Images 8/33 26. Galatasaray Jean Michael Seri and Ryan Babel have joined the Turkish champions, which bodes well after Fulham's efforts last season, even if Babel was something of a find. Europa League a realistic target. AFP/Getty Images 9/33 25. Red Star Belgrade The Serbian side will be bothersome at home, and have just installed a tank outside their ground for extra intimidation points, as they were last year, when they beat Liverpool. Lack true forward quality, though. Getty Images 10/33 24. FC Salzburg Austrian champions in each of the last six seasons, which counts for something. Not much, mind you, hence the low ranking. Getty Images 11/33 23. Atalanta Punched well above their weight as the surprise Serie A packages last season, but they may struggle more at this level. Getty Images 12/33 22. Shakhtar Donetsk A faded force from the heady Uefa Cup winning days, but they remain an entertaining Brazilian/Ukranian ying and yang. They'll have at least one 5-4 result, or something along those lines. AFP/Getty Images 13/33 21. Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust. AFP/Getty Images 15/33 19. Zenit St Petersburg Ever a tricky trip, Zenit have a sneakily fun squad. Malcom will look to rebound from his torrid time at Barcelona. Getty Images 16/33 18. Valencia Europa League semi-finalists after dropping down last season, the squad is a coherent one with experience. Round of 16 likely if they get a friendly group draw. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/33 17. Lyon More impressive in the Champions League than Ligue 1 last season, in many ways. Gone are Tanguy Ndombele, Ferland Mendy and Nabil Fekir, however - a tough ask to replace such quality. AFP/Getty Images 18/33 16. Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Getty Images\n\nWho benefits from this? The Big Six \u2013 Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 do not appear to be in any hurry to replace Scudamore. They pay lip service to the primacy of the domestic leagues but, as much as Paris Saint-Germain or Ajax, they resent that the likes of Huddersfield get such a large share of the television windfall. That does not necessarily mean that they are out to undermine the game at home but self-interest is the driving force.\n\nThe Big Six can see the value of a variation of the Champions League that pits them more regularly against Europe\u2019s most famous names. There are plenty of clubs across the continent who privately believe it would be a positive innovation but pour scorn on the idea in public. The ECA is likely to come out broadly against Uefa\u2019s blueprint for a 32-team, four-group competition with two teams in each mini-league relegated each year but it is a matter of fine tuning rather than fundamental opposition to the concept.\n\nA third Uefa competition will act as a sweetener for some of Europe\u2019s smaller leagues so it is not just the biggest clubs who will embrace the new age. At the heart of the plans is the idea that England should not be allowed to become too rich and powerful. When the Big Six realise that the Premier League\u2019s contingent in the new revised competition will probably be capped at four, at least two of the clubs will wish they had not played both sides.\n\nEurope is only part of the challenge. Fifa and Uefa are looking to reform the game\u2019s calendar in 2024. The face of football is changing.\n\nScudamore is a wily strategist and it is hard to escape the thought that the 60-year-old got out at the right time. His successor \u2013 whenever they are eventually named \u2013 will have their hands full. The next few years will be a testing time for domestic divisions.\n\nThe Premier League needs a supremo who can galvanise resistance to any threat to the integrity of the top flight and convince the Big Six that their future is rooted at home rather than switching their emphasis towards Europe. The longer the delay continues, the less likely it becomes that the next chief executive can achieve those aims. Forget managing England, replacing Scudamore might be the real impossible job.\n\n", "description": "While international football takes the spotlight, the future of the domestic game is being determined behind the scenes.\u00a0This week\u00a0the European Club Association (ECA), will complete\u00a0a two-day general assembly in Geneva.
