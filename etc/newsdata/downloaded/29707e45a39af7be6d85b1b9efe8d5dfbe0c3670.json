Players and manager Mauricio Pochettino must wonder if that chance to reach the summit will ever come their way again.\n\nTo illustrate the way their paths have diverged, the Champions League finalists are already separated by 13 points in the league.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has only watched a rerun of the final twice, recognises a maturity gleaned from the experience of losing the 2018 final to Real Madrid that has stood them in good stead.", "description": "Four months on from the Champions League final, it\u2019s hard not to think of the sliding doors effect it has bestowed upon Liverpool and Tottenham.", "authors": ["Adam Lanigan", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214100107-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqyah24xujI4bAbg1jBqcGi3oLipNroJnnKnPfuZkILjk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
