It informs our work for the British public, free from interference by HM government.\"\n\nA briefing to The Mail on Sunday suggested that Downing Street had launched an investigation into alleged links between foreign governments and the MPs behind the Benn Act.\n\n\"Sources said No 10 took the unprecedented action after officials received intelligence that the MPs, including former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, had received help drafting the bill from members of the French government and the EU,\" the newspaper claimed.\n\nThe prime minister was forced to honour the legislation, requesting an extension to the Brexit negotiating period from the EU, as MPs held back from ratifying Mr Johnson's deal during an extraordinary sitting of the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Umunna also demands the prime minister rules out supporting a bid by backbench Tory MPs to introduce a new law aimed at punishing those who undermine government negotiations abroad.\n\nHe said: \"I have also demanded he rule out introducing any law seeking to prevent parliamentarians from speaking to other governments \u2013 we cannot properly scrutinise government foreign policy if we are prevented from doing do so.\n\n\"If he fails to give these assurances, we can take it as a given that another term of a Tory government will be altogether more authoritarian than any government we have seen in a generation.\"\n\nThe Independent has contacted Downing Street for a response to Mr Umunna's letter.\n\nRead more\n\nMPs revolt against Johnson's plan to rush Brexit bill through Commons\n\nBrexit secretary under fire over Northern Ireland export admission\n\nJohnson Brexit deal derailed again as vote plan blocked by Speaker\n\nMore than 260,000 in 48 hours sign letter demanding second referendum\n\nBoris Johnson not signing Brexit letter changes nothing, says EU\n\nWhat happens now as Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal hangs in the balance\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "Boris Johnson has been urged to disclose whether his government has sanctioned any surveillance or intelligence gathering on MPs involved in derailing his Brexit plans.The extraordinary demand from the Liberal Democrats follows claims published in newspapers that the government had carried out investigations", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X5akU3fbY_og.tuUHzOugw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9da05384359917644600d3f0667e1d4a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
