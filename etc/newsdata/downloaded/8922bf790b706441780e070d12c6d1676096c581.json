I don\u2019t know why so few people are willing to say it.\u201d\n\nIf impeachment is largely fought in the court of public opinion, Republicans lawmakers are barely mounting a defense on television. Since the Sept. 25 release of a rough transcript of Trump urging Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens, none of the 53 Republican Senators have appeared on MSNBC, though a source told POLITICO the network has put out invitations to them. Just four of 197 Republican House members have appeared on MSNBC, one of whom isn\u2019t running for reelection.\n\nSeven Republican House members have appeared on CNN during this time period, but no senators have done so. CNN anchor Jim Sciutto said Friday that more 60 Republican members of the House and Senate didn\u2019t respond when asked if Trump went too far in publicly asking China to investigate a political rival.\n\n\u201cGOP Lawmakers Silent On Trump\u2019s Call For China To Dig Up Biden Dirt,\u201d read the on-screen graphic, followed by the names of the lawmakers.\n\nOne Republican on that list, Johnson, appeared two days later on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in a contentious interview that quickly went viral.\n\nTodd became visibly exasperated with Johnson after he deflected the host\u2019s question about comments he made to the Wall Street Journal about Ukraine to talk about emails by former FBI agent Peter Strzok, a recurring character in the conservative media narrative of a \u201cdeep state\u201d out to get Trump. \u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy, propaganda stuff is popping up on here,\" Todd said.\n\nTodd drew praise for his aggressive handling of Johnson. \u201cSomething has happened to Chuck Todd,\u201d tweeted NYU journalism professor and media critic Jay Rosen. \u201cI view @MeetThePress almost every week. Today his tone \u2014 I mean his voice itself \u2014 was different, as if the gravity of events had sunk in and his patience with denial had run out.\u201d\n\nThe tense exchange between Todd and Johnson, filled with cross talk, \u201cdidn\u2019t make for enjoyable television or helpful civil discourse,\u201d wrote The Washington Post\u2019s Margaret Sullivan, but \u201cit was the right thing for Todd to do.\u201d\n\nAnother GOP senator, Missouri\u2019s Roy Blunt, visited CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, where host Margaret Brennan asked if it was \u201cappropriate to ask for a foreign government to interfere in the election.\u201d Blunt suggested the president was joking when he called on China to investigate the Bidens, a response that stalwart Trump defender Rep. Jim Jordan echoed on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d while evading questions from host George Stephanopoulos.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have successfully dodged questions in the past about Trump\u2019s conduct, such as an outrageous tweet or offensive remark, and the news cycle tends to move on. Several Republicans told reporters upon leaving Washington on Sept 26 that they hadn\u2019t read the whistleblower complaint, even though it was published online hours earlier and dominated news coverage.\n\nBut impeachment isn\u2019t going to quickly disappear from the headlines and Republicans\u2019 silence has become a story itself following two weeks of revelations, including explosive text messages among diplomats, along with Trump\u2019s shocking call on the White House lawn for China, too, to investigate the Bidens. \u201cRepublicans Mostly Silent After Trump\u2019s Ukraine Revelations,\u201d read a CNN chyron Monday morning.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3257/1155968404_6091759372001_6091757354001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nRepublicans considering speaking out may fear stoking Trump\u2019s ire and becoming a target of his allies in conservative media. Trump ripped Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for tweeting that Trump\u2019s \u201cbrazen and unprecedented\u201d calls for foreign nations to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter are \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nRomney hasn\u2019t provided that critique in a TV interview, unlike Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who said last week on CNN that exchanges between U.S. diplomats over efforts for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens were \u201cdamning.\u201d Hurd, who also appeared on MSNBC and Fox News in recent weeks, has already announced he\u2019s not running for reelection.\n\nHurd is one of 19 House Republicans who have appeared on Fox News during weekdays from 6 a.m. to midnight since Sept. 25, according to data provided by progressive watchdog Media Matters. A few Republican Senators, including Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, Rob Portman, and Lindsey Graham, have appeared during that time period.\n\nGraham expressed criticism of Trump on Monday on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d though it was over his decision to pull out of Syria and abandon U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters. Some other Republican lawmakers have criticized the Syria decision, while also blasting the NBA for apologizing to China after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support on Twitter for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nTapper noted lawmakers \u201crightly condemning the NBA for kowtowing to China\u201d amid the comparative silence around foreign intervention in domestic politics.\n\n\u201cThe idea of China interfering in the sanctity of the NBA is somehow incredibly offensive to them,\u201d he said, \u201cwhereas the same standard for American elections results in the sound of crickets.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/84/d2/19599b2d44e79e200b3866054e39/20191007-jake-tapper-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
