But considered especially egregious was his remarks about the number and route of the commando's helicopters.\n\n\u201cI always get a little bit nervous when people without knowledge of operations start describing operations,\u201d said Michael Nagata, a retired Army lieutenant general who was the senior special operations commander in the Middle East during the early stages of the anti-ISIS campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s a good story, and I can understand the impulse to tell a good story. Telling it can have positive benefits. But the benefits are unpredictable and marginal, whereas the harm could be more substantial.\"\n\nTaken together, some of the details Trump revealed could help terrorist groups piece together new information about how U.S. counterterrorism forces gather intelligence and execute such dangerous missions, said veterans of previous operations.\n\n\"I\u2019m surprised that he went into that level of granularity,\u201d said a former senior military officer who has commanded troops in the region and like some others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject.\n\nNagata stressed that Trump is not alone in the practice. He cited the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, which was recounted in significant detail at the time by Obama administration officials.\n\n\"This tradition two administrations have established of talking about the details of missions like these may actually make them more dangerous and more difficult in the future,\u201d said Nagata, who was also the senior U.S. military officer in Pakistan at the time of the Bin Laden mission.\n\nHere are a few example of what Trump shared on Sunday that IS raising eyebrows.\n\nThe intelligence\n\nTrump didn\u2019t offer specifics about how the U.S. located Baghdadi. But he keyed in on the highly sensitive discipline of signals intelligence \u2014 or the remote monitoring of enemy communications \u2014 that struck several with deep experience as better left alone.\n\n\u201cThese people are very smart, they\u2019re not into cell phones anymore,\" Trump said. \"They're not \u2014 they're very technically brilliant. You know, they use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump. But they use the internet incredibly well.\"\n\n\"Why mention it?\u201d asked Nagata. \"It could contribute to a reverse engineering of our intelligence methods by the adversary, and if there\u2019s any possibility of that, why do it?\u201d\n\nTrump also described the layout of the compound. \"The tunnels were dead end for the most part,\" he recounted. \"There was one we think that wasn\u2019t but we had that covered too,\u201d he said, seemingly suggesting the U.S. mapped the tunnel network ahead of time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit sensitive,\u201d said a former special operations commander who also asked that he not be identified. \u201cThe enemy knows to some degree that we have technology that can detect that. But they don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done or how good we are at, and we don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something the president should not have said about the target development,\u201d added Eric Robinson, a former Army special operations officer. \u201cIt\u2019s reckless. But it\u2019s not as bad as hanging the satellite image of the Iranian space launch site two months ago. That was bad.\u201d\n\nThe raid\n\nTrump also specified the number of helicopters the commandos used \u2014 eight \u2014 and reported that, upon landing, the commandos \u201cblew holes into the side of the building, not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby-trapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cAircraft counts and means of conducting a breach are [tactics, techniques and procedures] that special operations forces have developed and learned the hard way,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t helpful to talk about.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi revealed a slew of sensitive details about the secret military operation that could imperil future raids, special operations and intelligence, veterans fear. \u201cIt\u2019s a good story, and I can understand the impulse to", "authors": ["Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ueh3v2QF7N9glQTBsjtZIw--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/72382e614ec042d952069287e554555d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
