(Reuters)\n\nIn July, free-agent forward Marcus Morris reneged on a verbal agreement with the San Antonio Spurs to sign with the New York Knicks.\n\nAfter making the deal with the Knicks, Morris told The Athletic that he has a good relationship with the Spurs and kept them in the loop as he made his decision.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI have a good relationship with those guys and I have so much respect for (head coach) Pop (Gregg Popovich), (general manager) RC (Buford) and (assistant GM) Brian Wright,\u201d Morris told The Athletic. \u201cThe first thing that I did when I knew I would be going another direction, I called and made sure they knew.\u201d\n\nPopovich is not pleased\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear from Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich about the decision. Until Monday.\n\nHis account paints a less cordial picture of the transaction that left his team scrambling to make roster moves. The Spurs had traded promising young forward Davis Bertrans to to open up the mid-level exception to make room for Morris under the cap.\n\nPopovich made clear that he wasn\u2019t pleased about making that sacrifice for nothing during San Antonio\u2019s media day.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt was more than difficult to lose Davis,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that was an unfortunate situation that was handled unprofessionally on a couple of different levels. We made that move to make the signing that we did and got blindsided.\u201d\n\nBertrans, a 26-year-old 6-10 forward, played 21.5 minutes per game last year in San Antonio, averaging 8 points and 3.5 rebounds while shooting 42.9 percent from 3-point distance. He was a reliable shooter Popovich could depend on off the bench.\n\n\u201cDavis was a special player as we all know, and he was young and getting better and better,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSo, yeah, we hated losing him.\u201d\n\nWhen Morris backed out, the Spurs made a deal with former Denver Nuggets forward Trey Lyles instead.\n\nMorris doesn\u2019t shed much light on situation\n\nMorris had a chance to address the issue again on Monday during Knicks media day. He didn\u2019t offer much in terms of clarity.\n\nMarcus Morris says his free agency didn't go like he planned and that he committed early. He cited \"unknown\" issues. He committed to the Spurs but then signed with the Knicks. Says he wanted to be closer to Philly, his hometown. pic.twitter.com/H72YRC0ERW \u2014 Mike Vorkunov (@MikeVorkunov) September 30, 2019\n\n\u201cMy free agency didn\u2019t go as planned,\u201d Morris said. \u201cA lot of the specifics came off a lot of unknown \u2014 unknown situations. I kind of committed very early.\u201d\n\nHe went to explain that the Knicks \u201cembrace guys like myself\u201d for his reasoning of joining New York \u2014 not exactly a crystal clear account of what prompted his decisions.\n\nMorris and his agent Rich Paul split up after the ordeal, but it\u2019s not clear what prompted the pair to go their separate ways.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Spurs felt jilted. And rightfully so.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Gregg Popovich told the Spurs side of the Marcus Morris saga, and he wasn't pleased.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jrtEvt4K819nnYOemur7qA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qyYQLrUmvV0SyAyZzIddEA--~B/aD0yNjUyO3c9Mzk3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/260e47b0-e3fa-11e9-ac7e-bd24b281d00a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
