So with their sights set on a return trip to the WNBA Finals, losing Toliver for the final four weeks of the regular season with a knee injury wasn\u2019t how they would have drawn it up.\n\nBut Toliver returned in time for the playoffs, and both on the court and on the sidelines, Washington is better off for it. Toliver\u2019s championship experience could be what the rest of the Mystics need to help them over the hump and win their first title.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been kind of like the Zen master for us in these Finals so far,\u201d LaToya Sanders said.\n\nFrom league MVP Elena Delle Donne to coach Mike Thibault, others agreed, using words like \u201ccalming voice\u201d and \u201ccomforting\u201d when describing having Toliver back in the fray.\n\nToliver was no doubt still vocal at practices and on the sidelines at games while she was unable to play. After all, this is the same player who spent last winter as a full-time coaching assistant for the NBA\u2019s Washington Wizards. But she returned to action for the semifinal series and now is back in the starting lineup.\n\nToliver put up a clutch performance in Sunday\u2019s win over the Connecticut Sun, finishing with 18 points and five assists. During one crucial stretch in the fourth quarter, she pulled off a textbook crossover to drive inside and dished it behind her to Delle Donne for a basket. Two possessions later, she stretched out for a finger-roll layup that put Washington up 11 with 3:16 left.\n\nFor someone who was wearing a knee brace until very recently, she hardly looked uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cYeah, I feel great. We\u2019re 1-0 in the Finals,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cAdrenaline takes over, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re rolling with right now. Since taking the brace off, I\u2019ve been able to be able to play a little bit more downhill and a little bit more like myself, and I\u2019m just going to continue to try to be in attack mode, whether that\u2019s getting to the rim or finding other people once I can engage, too.\u201d\n\nToliver won the WNBA title with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2016 before joining the Mystics the following year. Even before the pros, she was never one to shy away from a high-profile moment: She knocked down a game-tying 3-pointer for Maryland with three seconds left in the 2006 NCAA championship game, forcing overtime and helping the Terrapins beat Duke to win the title.\n\nThibault said Toliver\u2019s leadership had less to do with whether she had a championship on her resume and more to do with taking shots in key moments.\n\n\u201cThe best players in the history of basketball are ones who want to make plays when the game is on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people that kind of run from it when it gets late in games, and there are others who step up. Luckily we have three or four on our team that are all willing to do that.\u201d\n\nSanders said Toliver imparts nuggets of wisdom from what it took for her Sparks to win the title three years ago \u2014 but not any more than usual since they\u2019ve reached the Finals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more so off the court,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cShe can be the feisty one on the court and stuff like that. But at halftime, she\u2019s usually the first person to tell us what she sees, what we can do better offensively and defensively.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will say her ad-libs here and there,\u201d Natasha Cloud added, \u201cbut again, we\u2019ve been in the final series before, so our whole roster is prepared for this moment. We had the experience. Unfortunately we got swept last year, but we made the commitment to each other and to this organization that we\u2019d be back.\u201d\n\nNow they are back, and they\u2019re only two wins away from the franchise\u2019s first WNBA title. The Mystics host the Sun for Game 2 Tuesday at 8 p.m. Then Connecticut will host Game 3 on Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
