Although encouraging in the nearer term, overall, I don\u2019t find the moves that impressive. With Wall Street lacking the holistic energy to push the indices to fresh heights, I believe investors are better served acting defensively. As such, retail stocks to buy provide an intriguing mix of protection and upside potential.\n\nBut at first glance, retail stocks seem like a sector to avoid like the plague. If our economy stumbles into a recession \u2013 and the latest jobs report suggests this is a very real possibility \u2013 the natural instinct is to curb unnecessary spending. Thus, it\u2019s no surprise that many discretionary retail stocks, such as Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) and JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) have suffered volatility.\n\nThat said, this segment isn\u2019t about people making superfluous purchases on a whim. Instead, many retail stocks to buy enjoy secular revenue streams. For instance, no matter what goes on in the economy, people have to live and work. Therefore, retailers who specialize in core products, accessories or apparel may see a spike in interest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, some retail stocks might thrive in a recession. During a bull market, confident consumers will probably eschew discount stores for something higher brow. But in a recession, discount stores might see customers that they normally wouldn\u2019t see.\n\nIf we do have a downturn, it\u2019s important not to lump all retail stocks together. Here are seven stocks to buy if we encounter choppy waters.\n\n\n\n\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\n\nRetail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Dollar Tree (DLTR) More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmong discount retail stocks to buy, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is one of the most well-known. From household goods to cleaning products to various food items, everything you see costs a buck. Not only that, DLTR stock has a proven track record for performing brilliantly during distressed economic times.\n\nFor example, since 2008, the market value for DLTR stock has increased roughly tenfold. Additionally, we could see even bigger gains if we suffer another downturn. Recently, Dollar Tree upgraded its guidance for full-year earnings per share from a range between $4.77 to $5.07 to between $4.90 to $5.11. Management also narrowed down its expectations for full-year revenue.\n\nMuch of this enthusiasm has to do with same-store sales exceeding analysts\u2019 forecasts. While I\u2019d tactically like to wait to see if DLTR stock will correct some of its extreme bullishness, in the longer run, I\u2019m confident in the upswing. This is a company that\u2019s going to give customers exactly what they need at a price they can afford.\n\n\n\n\n\nDollar General (DG)\n\nRetail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Dollar General (DG) More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile several publicly traded companies suffered a bloody month of August, Dollar General (NYES:DG) went completely against the grain. Last month, DG stock gained a little over 18%. Even in September, Dollar General has so far returned nearly 4%.\n\nAnd on a year-to-date basis, DG stock has veritably skyrocketed, up over 51%. Even better for stakeholders, the surge in market value appears fundamentally justified.\n\nAs with Dollar Tree, Dollar General increased its earnings and revenue expectations for the year. Also, the discount retailer experienced an unexpectedly strong lift in same-store sales. That it was also able to beat expectations for its most recent earnings report gave investors little choice: it was time to buy into DG shares, which has proven to be among the most resilient of discount retail stocks.", "description": "Closing out the first week of September, the benchmark indices finally started to gain some positive momentum.
