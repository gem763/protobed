Washington\u2019s retreat paved the way for a deal between the Kurds and Damascus, allowing Syrian forces to regain control of territories in the northeast after over seven years of war.\n\nEven on Tuesday, Ankara questioned if the US had honored its end of the deal and facilitated the withdrawal of Kurdish forces, but the Turkish ministry then said Washington told Ankara that the Kurdish groups had all left the area by the end of the 120-hour ceasefire pause.\n\nUS President Donald Trump also weighed in on the development, calling it \u201cgood news\u201d in a tweet on Monday night.\n\nGood news seems to be happening with respect to Turkey, Syria and the Middle East. Further reports to come later! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nThe deal struck between Ankara and Moscow on Tuesday will ensure the territorial integrity of Syria; allow the government to regain control over towns and cities in the northeast; establish Turkish-Russian patrols along the border; and revitalize the Adana Accord, a security pact struck between Damascus and Ankara in 1998. Dealing with captured Islamic State militants was also addressed in Tuesday\u2019s agreement, which the Syrian government has endorsed.\n\nThe agreement underscores Washington\u2019s waning sway in the region and represents a positive step toward winding down a bloody years-long conflict, independent political analyst Ali Demidras told RT.\n\n\u201cThe Sochi agreement has cemented the Russian-Turkish cooperation in Syria, also effectively reducing the American influence in the country,\u201d Demidras said. \u201cUnited Syria has been secured.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
