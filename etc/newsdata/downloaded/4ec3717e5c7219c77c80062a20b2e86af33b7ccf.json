And he was.\"\n\n\"In the end, Biden assured [Thomas], repeatedly on the phone and in person, 'Clarence, you will be confirmed'. And he was.\" \u2014 Armstrong Williams\n\nBiden served as the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment in the midst of his confirmation process.\n\nDuring three days of hearings, Thomas adamantly denied Hill's accusations that he made inappropriate sexual remarks, including references to pornographic movies. Thomas admitted that he did talk about X-rated movies while at Yale Law School, adding that so did many other young people in the 1970s.\n\nThis episode in American history is re-examined and new revelations are made in the new Fox Nation documentary, \u201cThe Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s handling of Hill's allegations has dogged his 2020 presidential campaign. Biden has apologized for the way Hill was treated during the hearings, but he has defended his own conduct. In April, Biden had a private conversation with Hill during which he expressed his regret for the treatment that she received, but she reportedly wasn't satisfied with his comments.\n\nThe new revelation is also not the first to apparently refute Biden on this sensitive topic.\n\nIn \u201cThe Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching,\u201d another former member of the 1991 Senate Judiciary Committee says Biden told him that he did not believe Hill's allegations.\n\n\u201cBiden told me personally that he didn\u2019t believe her. He said, \u2018I don't know why she did this.\u2019 I don't mean to malign Joe, but Joe told me he didn\u2019t believe her and there were some others that told me that, too,\u201d former Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told Fox Nation.\n\nORRIN HATCH: JOE BIDEN TOLD ME HE 'DIDN'T BELIEVE' ANITA HILL\n\nAdditionally, the late-Sen. Arlen Specter wrote in his 2000 memoir, \u201cPassion for Truth: From Finding JFK\u2019s Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton\u201d that Biden told him in 1998 that he had doubted parts of Hill\u2019s testimony regarding her interactions with Senate staffers. Specter was a Republican at the time of the Thomas/Hill hearings. He later switched back to the Democratic party. The passage from Specter\u2019s book was first unearthed by Federalist Senior Editor and Fox News Contributor Mollie Hemingway.\n\nBiden has repeatedly claimed that he believed Anita Hill from the very beginning.\n\nIn one instance, during an interview on ABC\u2019s \"The View\" in April, shortly after Biden launched his current presidential campaign, he said \u201cI believed her from the beginning. I was against Clarence Thomas. I did everything in my power to defeat Clarence Thomas\u2026\u201d\n\nFox News has previously reached out to the Biden campaign for comment on these claims.\n\n'The Confirmation Chronicles Vol. 2: High-tech Lynching' available Sept. 18 exclusively on Fox Nation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
