But are they any good? Should you buy some? Mike Roorda, Reviewed\n\nIsabelle Tham was putting her jacket on before a red-eye flight from California to New York on Delta Air Lines in March when one of her AirPods flew out of her ear.\n\nThe 23-year-old legal writer from San Jose frantically searched the area around her window seat for the wireless headphone before the plane took off. She figured the tiny white device slid to the back of the plane, so she went to sleep with plans to look again upon landing.\n\nTham woke up to great news: the errant AirPod had caught on a seat and was retrieved by the passenger behind her.\n\nHer luck ran out on the return flight. In a rush to catch a connecting flight, Tham left her AirPod case, which doubles as the charger, in the seatback pocket. (The AirPods were in her ears.)\n\nShe reached out to Delta on Twitter as soon as she got to her Airbnb and realized it was gone: \"Delta please help a millennial out and reunite her with her AirPods case.''\n\nSimilar cries and pleas go out daily to airlines on social media and via customer service centers as owners of the pricey periscope-shaped devices desperately seek their return. A new pair of AirPods, which includes a case, starts at $159. A new wireless charging case, $79.\n\nApple event: What about 5G, AirPods and Macs?\n\nPassengers post details on where they were sitting, complete with photos of holes and seat cracks they fell into. One traveler posted a screenshot from the \"Find my iPhone app'' showing his AirPods on a plane that was heading down the runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport while he was at the airport.\n\nLosing AirPods is a #firstworldproblem, for sure, as snarky commenters often remark on Twitter, but the lost gadgets are a costly headache for travelers and can be a logistical challenge for airlines.\n\nAirPods were introduced three years ago and, after a relatively slow start, have become ubiquitous, the devices wedged into ears around the world, an odd-looking status symbol. Critics say they look like Q tips; electric toothbrush heads; and, when in the case, dental floss. The second generation AirPods were introduced in March, and went on sale in August.\n\nApple's second generation AirPods (Photo: Apple)\n\nRay Wong, senior reviews editor for technology magazine Input, was an early adopter. He got a pair of AirPods from his sister for Christmas the year they came out and lost one of them a few months later on a Delta flight from New York to Austin, Texas, for the technology summit South by Southwest.\n\nHe was in the middle seat when a colleague nudged him to look at an email. He was holding his AirPods, and one of them disappeared into the seat. He mentioned it to a flight attendant and, upon landing, the next thing he knew they were ripping open seats in search of the tiny ear buds. The cleaning crew even got involved.\n\n\"They're like, \"OK, lets see if we can find your little AirPods,'' he said, noting that this was before users could locate them using Find my iPhone.\n\nThe AirPod didn't turn up, so he had to buy a single replacement for about $70 from Apple in New York.\n\nWhat are the chances you'll get lost AirPods back from an airline?\n\nFor travelers today who lose their Airpods, the Find my iPhone app helps, especially if you realize the AirPods are lost when you're still on the plane or at the airport.\n\nBut staying on the plane to search or returning to the plane isn't always an option given airplanes' brief time on the ground between flights.\n\nSometimes, an item is stuck and not retrievable, or the airline is unwilling or unable to tear seats apart.\n\nAnother risk: Other passengers could spot the in-demand items and decide finders keepers, since the AirPods can easily connect to other devices.\n\nAirlines are reluctant to release figures on the volume of items turned in by type, and how many are returned to their owners. Delta did disclose that it receives about 40 pairs of AirPods per month. Spokesman Morgan Durrant said that doesn't rank in the top five of turned-in items. Phones, tablets, laptops, other varieties of headphones and eye/sunglasses can each reach into the hundreds per month, he said.\n\nOne sign of the volume of lost AirPods not reunited with passengers: Sales of AirPods at Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro, Alabama, which buys unclaimed items from airlines and resells them to the public, spiked in the past two years. Sales this year are up 126% from a year ago, according to spokeswoman Jamie Scalici.\n\nThe store does not release the number of AirPods sold or how it compares with other electronics. The store sells first generation AirPods for $100 and second generation for $159, according to a representative reached by phone, and \"they go quickly.''\n\nAirlines say they do everything they can to reunite travelers with their lost items and note that the process has gotten easier with automation and central lost-and-found warehouses.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, the nation's largest domestic carrier, has a 60% overall return rate for items reported lost, according to Laura Adams, director of baggage services, which includes lost-and-found.\n\n\"We're really proud of that because, I can tell you, back in the day it was more like 16% before everything was automated,'' she told USA TODAY.\n\nBut the AirPods bring their own challenges, she said, including their size (they can easily fall into the nooks and crannies throughout the plane) and the fact that they all look alike, especially when they're out of the case.\n\n\"That is the frustrating part for us,'' Adams said. \"We can't just return anybody's AirPods. We have to return that rightful owner's AirPods.''\n\nAirPods lost on a plane: Travelers' tales\n\nTham was certain she'd see her AirPods case again after detailing her flight information on Delta's lost-and-found form the day of her flight.\n\n\"I put in the exact seat that I was in,' '' she said. \"But time goes by and they go, 'Hey, we're still looking for your case. I'm sorry.'''\n\nShe waited a couple weeks but finally coughed up $59 for a replacement case.\n\nHarish Malik was hopeful, too, after sending American Airlines seat information and photos from his wife's flight from Oklahoma to San Francisco this summer.\n\nThe software engineer said the AirPods were a three-month anniversary gift for his wife. She dropped one of them and didn't want to disturb the elderly passenger next to her. She said she told the flight crew she could see it in a hole between the two seats but was told they couldn't do anything about it because the seat would have to be taken apart by a technician.\n\nThey reported the incident at customer service in San Francisco and filed a lost-item report but they haven't turned up, he said.\n\n\"It means, like, nobody went there and checked and nobody cared about it,'' he said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to American Airlines.\n\nMalik's wife has an upcoming flight and refuses to take the other AirPod out.\n\n\"She's scared to use them now,'' Malik said. \"She'll only use the wired ones if she needs them.''\n\nEven when airlines bring in a technican, they are not always able to help. An Arizona woman posted the saga of a lost AirPod on United on Twitter, with a picture of a maintenance worker who tried to retrieve it after it bounced on the floor and into a hole. A chirping sound triggered by the Find my iPhone feature told her it was close.\n\nBut not close enough. She never got her AirPod back.\n\nWhelp. I\u2019m so embarrassed at the level of service I\u2019m getting right now. And the fact that I\u2019m holding up the plane. But yo, never say @United didn\u2019t try to give you good service. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/RkmeamMWpp \u2014 Jane Pizzolato (@jane_pizzolato) May 4, 2018\n\nKim Thomas thought she was one of the lucky ones. The 45-year-old hospital IT executive reported her lost AirPods to the Southwest baggage claim office at Los Angeles International Airport and was thrilled when she called down from the gate to see they found them.\n\nOne problem: The case wasn't hers And it was empty.\n\n\"I never got them back, '' Thomas said.\n\nShe bought a new pair within 24 hours.\n\n\"I love that they charge quickly. I love that they've got a long battery life. I love that I can use one, and I don't have to use both so I can semi-multitask if I'm on a conference call.''\n\nHow NOT to lose your AirPods on a plane: Lessons from those who did\n\n1. Don't bring them, or at least switch to wired headphones when sleeping. Wong initially vowed not to travel with them after two incidents but now is just careful. He doesn't put them in while sleeping on flights, for example. \"You never know when there\u2019s some turbulence and boom, your AirPods are gone.''\n\n2. Buy accessories, including ear hooks or a strap, that tether them to you on a flight. They are cheap on sites including Amazon and eBay.\n\n3. Establish a routine before you get on and off the plane. Put them in the same place every time. Thomas, who travels weekly, puts them in her left pocket and is now religious about checking it before she deplanes.\n\n4. Put some identifying characteristics on the AirPods to help you identify yours if the airline finds them. Southwest's Adams says her family uses a Sharpie to mark their electronics. Others stick on a label with contact information. Some Reddit users recommend naming the AirPods with your email or phone number in it.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/16/apple-airpods-lost-on-plane-whats-a-traveler-to-do/3976685002/", "description": "Travelers who lose or forget AirPods on a plane often don't see them again because they are hard to find and not easily identifiable.", "authors": ["Dawn Gilbertson", "Published P.M.
