Morgan", "language": "en", "text": "Bone up on the term \u201cmarket rotation\u201d if you want to hold your own at the water cooler these days.\n\nDeutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid and his team define that term best as a \u201cbig unwind in some popular trades.\u201d In the last couple of days, investors have been intensely pulling money out of momentum stocks \u2014 those that have had the best returns over the past year \u2014 and into so-called slow-and-steady value stocks. It\u2019s sort of like trading your pet hare for a tortoise.\n\nFor examples of the companies that fall into these categories, check out the holdings of iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF VLUE, +0.39% and iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF MTUM, -0.01%.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Daily Shot Moving out of momentum\n\nOf course, some analysts say more time is needed time before we can really call these moves a trend.\n\nDiving right into the debate is our call of the day from a team led by J.P. Morgan\u2019s global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy, Marko Kolanovic, who says this value switch may be promising.\n\n\u201cIn summary, we believe the value rotation can continue and the broad market could move higher going into October [trade] negotiations, and if real progress is made, continue into a more sustained rally,\u201d they tell clients in a fresh note.\n\nAlas, Kolanovic says the broader S&P 500 may not see much of the glory here, given the index is heavy in companies less ready to pounce on good economic news. It\u2019s full of bond proxies \u2014 defensive stocks that could be substituted for low-returning bonds \u2014 and companies resistant to short-term trends.\n\nSmall-cap, cyclicals, value and emerging markets equities may get much love out of a global upturn, he says.\n\n\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, +0.13%, S&P SPX, +0.11% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.30% are inching higher at the start. Gold GCZ19, -0.10% and the dollar DXY, +0.34% are up, while oil CLV19, +0.59% is climbing ahead of U.S. inventory data due later. Meanwhile, OPEC cut its oil-demand forecast for 2019 and 2020.\n\nEurope stocks SXXP, +0.59% are up on trade hopes and easing expectations for Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, while Asia markets ADOW, +1.56% finished mostly higher.\n\nRead: ECB needs to push rates further into negative territory without wrecking eurozone banks\n\nThe tweet\n\nThe Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nThis morning may have marked the first time President Trump voiced support for negative interest rates, in a mini-tweet storm early Wednesday.\n\nThe buzz\n\nApple AAPL, +1.59% AAPL, +1.59% AAPL, +1.59% unveiled three new iPhones \u2014 look away if you hate ugly cameras \u2014 and a competitive price tag on its streaming services, putting the spotlight on companies in that space \u2014 Netflix NFLX, -0.77%, Disney DIS, -0.43% and Roku ROKU, -1.15%.
