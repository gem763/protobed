Football has always been more than a game here,\u201d Rodgers, a VICIS investor, said in a news release. \u201cI chose to invest in VICIS because of their ultimate commitment to player protection. These kids deserve the best, and I\u2019m happy to play a small role in outfitting them with the safest helmets for the upcoming season.\u201d\n\nThe coaches of the three teams also expressed their gratitude.\n\n\u201cI have been the head coach now for eight years and not one time have I ever had to ask Aaron for anything,\u201d Pleasant Valley High School coach Mark Cooley said in a news release. \u201cHe calls or texts every year and says \u2018Coach, here is what I would like to do this year, is that OK?\u2019 He does so much for our school and community that most people have no idea regarding the contributions he has made!
