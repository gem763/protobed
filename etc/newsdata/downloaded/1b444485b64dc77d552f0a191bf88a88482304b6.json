It was then that the boos ended and cheering and applause began again.\n\nBut as Nationals starting pitcher Joe Ross, who took the place of Nationals ace Max Scherzer who was scratched from Game 5 due to muscle spasms in his neck, took the mound the crowd again turned their attention again to the president and began chanting \u201cLock him up!\u201d in an apparent nod to his ongoing impeachment proceedings as well as chants that he has led in his previous campaign rallies of \u201cLock her up!\u201d that had been directed toward his former political opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nFull on \u201cLOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP!\u201d chants heard throughout the crowd at Nats Park after President Trump was announced and shown on screen here #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/1ktVXkHYFy \u2014 Monica Alba (@albamonica) October 28, 2019\n\nOnly hours earlier President Trump announced the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in remarks delivered at the White House in what had been a good day for the president who has recently been mired in political scandal as congress pushes to impeach him.\n\nThere could be some cheers heard for President Trump when he was announced but the sound of jeers were much more prominent in the stadium when the president was announced to be in attendance. President Trump is a deeply unpopular figure in the Washington area having received only 4% of the vote in the District of Columbia as well as having lost the states of Virginia and Maryland in the 2016 election.\n\nBoth cheers and boos for Pres Trump at game 5 of the #WorldSeries: pic.twitter.com/KSXiCnsczR \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 28, 2019\n\nIn an interesting subplot, vocal Trump critic, local restaurateur and humanitarian chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s threw out the ceremonial first pitch and was warmly welcomed by the home team\u2019s crowd. Andr\u00e9s settled a lawsuit with the Trump Organization in 2017 after he pulled plans to open a restaurant in Trump International Hotel in 2015 following Trump\u2019s remarks in 2015 about Mexican immigrants when he was on the campaign trail.\n\nThis is the first time that Washington has had a team in the World Series since 1933. The Nationals won the first two games in Houston but have since lost three in a row at home to the Astros.\n\nGame 6 will be on Tuesday and the Astros can clinch their second World Series victory in 3 years with a win over the Nationals.", "description": "President Donald Trump was showered with a chorus of boos followed by chants of \u201cLock him up!\u201d at Game 5 of the World Series between the Nationals and the Astros.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Trump-Nationals-Astros-Haworth_hpMain_20191028-042005_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
