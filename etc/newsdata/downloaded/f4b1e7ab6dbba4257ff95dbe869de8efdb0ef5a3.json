It started when I was getting massively fatigued and I had a lot of sickness. I thought it was a bug at first, but I continued to get worse.\n\n(Image: Bristol Live WS)\n\n\u201cThese symptoms went on for several months before I was officially diagnosed, and it was a continuous cycle of going back and forth to the doctors.\"\n\nHollie missed year four to year nine of school because \u201cit was impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe reason for my illness was because I was really badly bullied.\n\n\u201cIf something stressful and traumatic is happening to you it can inflict chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\u201cThe bullying started in year three, but in year four it took a massive turn and this is when I left because my health deteriorated. It was a horrendous time.\"\n\nShe describes not being able to move and says \u2018it was a horrendous time\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t move unaided. It hit me like a ton of bricks at the beginning. I couldn't leave the house for several months, I couldn\u2019t eat, I was skin and bones.\"\n\nDuring the five years Hollie wasn\u2019t at school she didn\u2019t experience many \u2018ups\u2019 and her mental health suffered.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have many good days, but what kept me going was education. I had so many aspirations and goals in life so I tried to keep my mind occupied with these thoughts,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDuring the five years, I had some hospital education, but it was more playing games and I didn\u2019t feel it was an education, and I felt myself becoming more tired because I put all my energy into something that wasn\u2019t ever going to help me.\"\n\n(Image: Bristol Live WS)\n\nIn 2012, Hollie got in contact with Bridge Learning Campus secondary who \u2018helped and supported\u2019 her condition, however she said she \u2018struggled to cope\u2019 as the bullying continued.\n\n\u201cMy chronic fatigue never stabilised,\" she said.\n\n\u201cSo I pretty much only did year 10 and year 11 full time. I had some days where I really struggled physically but I got my head down. I wanted education so badly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been academically driven so I really tried my best and I was pleased with what I got, I left school with A\u2019s, B\u2019s and C\u2019s.\n\nIn March 2018, after her A levels, she plunged in and went to work full time in a nursery, but the physicality of the job resulted in her becoming incredibly ill three months later.\n\n\u201cI had to leave because I could not keep up with consistency. One day I would be in, the next I wasn\u2019t, I was stuck in the vicious cycle. So I had to take myself out of this situation.\n\nDuring this time, Hollie developed glandular fever, which heightened her chronic fatigue, making any activity impossible.\n\nAfter a well rested few months, Hollie felt positive and ready to embark into a new job field.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was in a bit of boat where I didn\u2019t want to give up, and I needed something where I could find my feet again.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAt the end of August 2019, Hollie was offered a part time job as a pharmacy assistant which she started to enjoy.\n\n\u201cHowever, the second week I had a massive chronic fatigue flare up, I couldn\u2019t even sit up on my own, and I lost my job.\"\n\nWithout notice, she received a letter terminating her contract, Hollie claims.\n\n\u201cThe communication from the pharmacy was awful. The week after my flare up, I received a letter from them saying that they were terminating my contract,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBefore I received the letter, I saw my job advertised online. I was panicking so much because this was my job, my stability, my finance.\n\n\u201cI felt I was sacked because I had an illness. They didn\u2019t let me go back and try again, they didn\u2019t give me a chance.\n\n\u201cMy manager told me he could of made adjustments for me, if he knew I had a chronic illness, but he did nothing.\"\n\nHollie is now out of work and is searching for a job which will accommodate her condition.\n\n\u201cI am so passionate and motivated and all I want is to do well. I just want to be a job that I can cope with, with an understanding team.\n\n\u201cIt really does get me down because I can\u2019t control it, but I am determined to come out stronger.\"\n\nHollie describes a flare up as \u2018the flu, times by 10, and then five all-nighters in a row\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen I have a flare up, I wake up and I cannot move. It is not just tiredness, but exhaustion, I can barely lift my head.\n\n\u201cI either slept and slept and slept or I would never sleep because I was in too much pain.\n\nSome of the main symptoms of the codition are sleep problems, muscle or joint, and headaches , a sore throat or sore glands that aren't swollen\n\nMost people find overexercising makes their symptoms worse.\n\nThe severity of symptoms can vary from day to day, or even within a day.", "description": "When Hollie Buxton's ME flare's up, she can barely move when she wakes up, and the condition has resulted in her losing several jobs", "authors": ["Brendan Mcfadden", "Image", "Bristol Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525682.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hollie-Buxton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
