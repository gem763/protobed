What is so unique about Hong Kong?\n\nAccording to Marxist doctrine, which recognizes only the material side of man, the residents of Hong Kong should be the most contented citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nTheir per capita income is $58,322 ($1,000 higher than ours). Inflation is 2.6%, unemployment 3.4%. There are 87 billionaires in Hong Kong. According to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom, Hong Kong has the freest economy in the world.\n\nAnd yet, the residents of Hong Kong are challenging the authority of their local government and the communist leadership in Beijing\u2014thereby risking their fortunes and their lives.\n\nThe immediate reason they took to the streets was to oppose a law that would allow Hong Kong suspects to be tried under mainland China\u2019s judicial system, which hands down multi-year prison sentences as easily as a tap of the gavel.\n\nBut much more is at stake. Beijing is threatening the individual freedom that the people of Hong Kong enjoy more than any other \u201ccity\u201d in China. By their bravery, the people of Hong Kong are showing that man has two sides\u2014economic and noneconomic\u2014and that the noneconomic side is just as important as the economic.\n\nProtesters with U.S. flags take part in a pro-democracy march in Hong Kong\u2019s Tuen Mun district on Sept. 21, 2019.

They came to Hong Kong not because its streets were paved with gold, but to live as free men, which was impossible in communist China.\n\nToday, Hong Kong residents understand how precious their freedom is and how easily it can be lost. They are willing to risk everything to preserve it.\n\n>>>What Hong Kong Unrest Tells Us About China\u2019s Plans for the Rest of the World\n\nWhat can we in the West do to support them?\n\nProtect and patronize the democratic opposition in Hong Kong and throughout China.\n\nThis is critically important because opposition, as Chinese political analyst Dimon Liu has written, \u201cis the harbinger of the future.\u201d The U.S. must support an effective human rights policy toward China, including the guarantee of religious freedom.\n\nStudents hold the U.S. flag and sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the Hong Kong University campus on Sept. 20, 2019. One sign reads, \u201cWe need the 2nd Amendment.\u201d (Photo: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDemocracy means \u201crule by the people.\u201d President Xi Jinping and his communist colleagues reject such an idea and are trying to stamp it out whenever it appears.\n\nBut democracy is a resilient ideal not easily suppressed. We see that in the Hong Kong demonstrations. We cannot know their final outcome, but it is encouraging that Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced the full withdrawal (and not just suspension) of the proposed extradition measure.\n\nThe Hong Kong demonstrators are the tip of a giant iceberg: the Chinese people, who are no longer satisfied with just a \u201cfull rice bowl\u201d but seek basic human rights and some form of democracy.\n\nWithin each and every Chinese, whether in Hong Kong or any city in China, there is the innate desire to be free\u2014to be able to live your life not as the government dictates, but as you wish. So it was with the freedom swimmers all those years ago, and so it is today in Hong Kong and in the many other cities and towns of mainland China.", "description": "Students, young professionals, and not-so-young Chinese have now\u00a0demonstrated in Hong Kong\u00a0for many weeks, despite the brutal attempts by the government to stop them.\u00a0\n\nThe police have used clubs, tear gas, and water cannons\u2014everything but dogs\u2014to silence them. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t protest,\u201d one young woman said, \u201cthis might become just another Chinese city.\u201d\n\nWhy are they protesting?
