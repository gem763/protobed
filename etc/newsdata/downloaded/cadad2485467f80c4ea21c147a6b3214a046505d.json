That\u2019s why they come to me. That\u2019s what makes it high end. And that\u2019s what I enjoy most, coming up with something individual every time.\u201d Such bespoke service comes at a price, though Bragg won\u2019t be drawn into divulging rates.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from her childhood, spent on a mountain in Scone, NSW. \u201cLife wasn\u2019t about pretty things. And we didn\u2019t come off the mountain very often,\u201d she says. Bragg had no interest in art at school, but she remembers an unusual response to colour. \u201cMy dad used to buy big sheets of stamps, and I\u2019d look at the spots down the side, which I think were the colour codes, though I didn\u2019t understand it at the time. Those spots! Still if I see them, something physical happens to me.\u201d\n\nHer mother gave Bragg and her two brothers a garden bed to do what they liked with, and that bloomed into an interest in floristry. She signed up for an evening class, and to pay for the flowers, took a job at Laura Ashley. \u201cGradually, the flowers morphed into interiors.\u201d From there she became an assistant at Colefax & Fowler, the renowned English decorators who specialise in fabric and wallpaper. \u201cI was useless,\u201d she says, with a grimace. \u201cNo, really, I was. My boss, a wonderful woman called Martine Burns, used to re-type my letters when I\u2019d gone home. But she must have seen something. It became almost an apprenticeship.\u201d\n\nGretel Packer (seen here at a 2015 fundraiser) was a school friend of Bragg's, and together they launched an interior business in 1989. AAP\n\nAt lunchtime, she\u2019d meet up with her school friend Gretel Packer (\u201cHer mum and my dad are cousins\u201d) and chat about the fun they\u2019d have working together. Both were keen on design, and Packer was blessed with a head for numbers, so they made it happen, launching an interior design business in 1989.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be so brave now, but I was a baby,\u201d says Bragg, who was 21 at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had anything to lose.\u201d\n\nWith no further ado, the cogs of pre-internet social networking clicked into gear. \u201cIt was the eastern suburbs of Sydney and we were very lucky that people talked about us socially. That was definitely an advantage to begin with, but that will only get you so far. After that, you have to produce the goods.\u201d\n\nAfter the thrill of their first commission \u2013 a worker\u2019s cottage in Woollahra \u2013 she remembers periods when they \u201chad to work very hard to keep it going, to get the next job\u201d. They ran the business for almost five years, before Packer temporarily relocated to the UK. \u201cShe\u2019s still my dear friend, and she\u2019s also a very wise counsel for me. If there are big decisions to make, I quite often call her.\u201d\n\nThese days, Bragg owns the business outright, and loves the freedom that brings. It meant she could scale things back when she moved to Melbourne and had children (three boys, now 14, 13 and 12). \u201cThen we cranked it back up when my youngest turned five. That flexibility has been incredibly special. And I love the fact my kids are used to a working mother.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s proud to have brought this pragmatic approach to work-life balance into her studio, where she employs 10 people \u2013 all women, but that wasn\u2019t a conscious decision (71.2 per cent of interior designers in Australia are female).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no drama when someone needs to go to the dentist, or stay home with poorly children. Kids come in after school and do their homework while their mums work. You can have a career, you can have a life, and you can be a nice person. It\u2019s a really warm, welcoming work environment. It takes immense effort, and it creates an immense loyalty. It\u2019s one of my greatest successes of the past 30 years.\u201d\n\nI like layers. I like fabric. I like comfort. And we have a lot of clients who want comfort too. \u2014 Adelaide Bragg\n\nBragg\u2019s decorating style has remained true to itself over the years. If a prospective client wants something that\u2019s not the right fit for her company \u2013 \u201csay, an ultra-modern house\u201d \u2013 she\u2019ll refer them to former team members who\u2019ve moved on to start their own businesses.\n\nSo what does she think of the current trend for minimalism \u2013 polished concrete, industrial fittings, frill-free furnishings? \u201cI admire it \u2013 some of it\u2019s extraordinary \u2013 but it\u2019s not me,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t live in it, and I can\u2019t decorate that way because that\u2019s not who I am. I like layers. I like fabric. I like comfort. And we have a lot of clients who want comfort too. It\u2019s that classic, timeless look that we do. We don\u2019t do trends, or themes. It\u2019s a home, not a stage set.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s well aware of the civilised world\u2019s fascination with home makeover shows, and is horrified by the concept of the big reveal. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d she shudders. \u201cYou don\u2019t want clients getting a surprise. We want the absolute opposite. Too much money is changing hands to risk giving them something they\u2019re not expecting. That\u2019s why the paperwork side of our business takes up 70 per cent of the team\u2019s time. Our quoting is very detailed, right down to what piping is on a cushion, so the client knows exactly what to expect.\u201d\n\nAh, yes \u2013 that clientele. How do they find the whole experience? Anthony Baillieu hired Bragg to work on his Yarram Park property near the Grampians not long ago. Before engaging her services, he\u2019d seen her work in the homes of friends \u2013 no, he won\u2019t say who \u2013 and that was key. \u201cWe\u2019ve known Adelaide and her family for a long time, which can be a good thing and a bad thing,\u201d he points out. \u201cMy rationale is that if you\u2019re going to use a friend, make sure you know a lot about them professionally. If it ends in a bad way, it\u2019s easy to lose an interior decorator, but you don\u2019t want to get rid of a friend at the same time.\u201d\n\nIf my brother was using Adelaide, she would not tell me about it. She does not discuss anything with anyone. \u2014 Anthony Ballieu\n\nWhat stood out was her collaborative way of working. \u201cA lot of designers are \u2018my way or the highway\u2019,\u201d says Baillieu. \u201cAdelaide certainly doesn\u2019t go in there and take over. She gets to know the client, understands what they want, then quietly puts her ideas in front of them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, he concurs that our attempts to break her confidentiality are futile. \u201cIf my brother was using Adelaide Bragg, she would not tell me about it,\u201d he laughs. \u201cShe does not discuss anything with anyone.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? After decorating everything from secret government properties to house boats, is she feeling the urge to hang up her swatches? Not remotely. \u201cThe best thing I did is turn 50. It\u2019s a wonderful stage of life. I was young for so long in the industry, and now I\u2019m not. And what\u2019s great is that it\u2019s a business that enables people to become older.\u201d (The average age of interior designers in Australia is 39.5.)\n\nRecently, she branched out with a side business, Bragg & Co, to produce the type of homewares that are difficult to source for clients. It\u2019s a diversification she works on with her \u201cextraordinary\u201d husband, Tim, who runs a retirement village in regional Victoria. \u201cHe\u2019s very flexible with that, so he can be hands-on with the children,\u201d she says. \u201cHe also takes an interest in my business. Bragg & Co is something we find really fun to do together.\u201d\n\nAs for our insatiable urge to stickybeak inside beautiful homes? That\u2019s just a part of modern life that keeps Bragg on her toes.\n\n\u201cThese days the world is very educated on my industry. It\u2019s so visual, which makes it perfect for Instagram,\u201d she says. \u201cSo for us, it\u2019s even more important to produce something that is really special. It\u2019s for you. Your neighbour doesn\u2019t have it. Your friend doesn\u2019t have it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we do. And I love it.\u201d\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
