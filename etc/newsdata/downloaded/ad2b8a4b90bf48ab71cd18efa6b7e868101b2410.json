It\u2019s very different from being at a hockey arena, or basketball or football, where there\u2019s high energy and everybody is getting riled up all the time.\u201d\n\nShe said she had tried knitting while watching hockey on TV. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work as well,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause if you look down for five seconds, you\u2019re missing something.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel, the managing editor of the baseball website The Hardball Times, doesn\u2019t mind the long games, which are dragging more than ever because of longer at-bats, more foul balls, more pitching changes and more time in between pitches .\n\n\u201cThis style of baseball that I have grown attached to and devoted so much time to writing about \u2014 it allows me to pursue these other activities,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really watch a ton of other sports because of the fact that there\u2019s so much happening and I can\u2019t sit down and pay attention for that long. I want to do something else at the same time.\u201d\n\nBaseball and knitting worked so well together that, in 2005, the Mariners hosted an inaugural Stitch N\u2019 Pitch event that nearly 1,000 people attended, Butler-Gluck said. Soon, the national trade association, the National Needle Arts Association, got involved, and many teams held similar events, drawing knitters of all ages, ethnicities and genders .\n\nButler-Gluck, who used to work for the trade association, traveled the United States organizing events and educating stadium security staffs about knitting needles, which can be made from wood or bamboo rather than metal.", "description": "Games have steadily gotten longer, but a subset of fans has embraced the plodding place by stitching together sweaters, mittens and scarves in the stands.", "authors": ["James Wagner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/sports/00knitting1/00knitting1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
