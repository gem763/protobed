However, it\u2019s dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very taxing on the body. You\u2019re getting hit in the head constantly.\n\n\u201cBoxing is a sport that goes hand-to-hand with brain damage. I don\u2019t know if you can tell, but I think I\u2019m already suffering from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got tired last year, but I don\u2019t think anyone can tell me KSI is a better boxer than me. That\u2019s just not facts and I\u2019m a man of facts.\n\n\u201cThis year, the conditioning\u2019s improving and the relaxation is improving. That\u2019s why I got tired last year, the adrenaline was rushing.\u201d\n\nPaul and KSI meet at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, California on 9 November.", "description": "Logan Paul believes the brutal sparring sessions he is putting himself through have led to\u00a0early signs of brain damage.
