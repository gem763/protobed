Are the democrats doing the opposite? If they continue to play a long game where it doesn't really matter if they get Trump's tax returns or Deutche Bank records now, because they expect they will get them sometime between January and a year from October. It will hit like a ton of bricks during campaign season. I keep hearing, \"they can't do this as the primary season gets going.\" Why the heck not? The plausible candidates are almost all senators. The Senate isn't going to be investigating much of this, if anything at all. It is fodder for the campaign, sets a nice background for promising anti-corruption bills, and keeps the president on the edge of hysteria. It also provides fodder for his Republican challengers. I don't see why they can't just keep doing this and even have an impeachment vote AFTER the election. Just make sure that the moderate House members don't have to take that vote until after they have been re-elected.", "description": "Eugene Robinson discussed his latest columns and political news.", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson", "Eugene Robinson Is An Associate Editor", "Twice-Weekly Columnist For The Washington Post.
