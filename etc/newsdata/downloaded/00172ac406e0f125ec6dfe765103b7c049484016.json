Widespread significant tree damage is possible with the expected heavy, wet snow and strong winds,\" the weather service said.\n\nWhile it will certainly turn colder here this weekend, our fellow meteorologists at @NWSGreatFalls could see something historic. Maximum recorded one day snowfall for September at Great Falls, Montana (records go back to 1937) is 6.1 inches. By comparison, Seattle's record is 0. pic.twitter.com/vrVWpW0xzH \u2014 NWS Seattle (@NWSSeattle) September 25, 2019\n\nAccuWeather said that enough snow is likely to fall to cause substantial travel delays through the mountains and over the passes. The snow may be heavy enough to shut down travel.\n\n\"There will be heavy accumulation on the roads over the passes with this storm,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Anderson said.\n\nThe cause of the cold will be the jet stream, which will take a sharp, southward plunge from western Canada into the Northwest late this week, the Weather Channel said. That will send temperatures crashing well below average for this time of year.\n\nInstead of winter, folks in the southeastern USA will see temperatures more typical of midsummer for at least the next several days. Some record highs are possible.\n\nLikely \"HISTORIC SNOWSTORM\" to impact much of MONTANA and parts of WYOMING this weekend! (This is not your typical September dusting!)
