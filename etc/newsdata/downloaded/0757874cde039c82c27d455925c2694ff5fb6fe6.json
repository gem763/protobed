But documents describing the police department\u2019s cover-up of that murder \u2014 including falsified police statements, the improper disposal of eyewitness statements, and a culture of silence among police \u2014 were withheld from the public for nearly three years.\n\nPolice claimed during that time that Van Dyke feared for his life and that McDonald was a threat, and fought to keep the city\u2019s report from an internal investigation sealed.\n\nThe withheld report from that investigation, written in 2016, was finally released at the urging of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Wednesday.\n\nJoseph Ferguson, the city\u2019s inspector general, alleged in the newly released report that officers had widely engaged in falsifying statements to \u201cexaggerate the threat McDonald posed.\u201d\n\nREAD: Chicago finally fired 4 cops accused of covering up the murder of Laquan McDonald\n\nFor example, Anthony Wojcik, a former lieutenant who was at the scene of McDonald\u2019s death, improperly threw away statements from witnesses of the shooting and recreated police reports without checking with detectives for accuracy, according to the internal investigation.\n\nWojcik then retired from the department in May 2016, while the city was still investigating the police officers\u2019 alleged misconduct. He was never charged with a crime.\n\nAdditionally, at least two other cops falsely reported after the shooting that they heard Van Dyke tell McDonald to drop a weapon multiple times, when they wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear any part of the encounter from where they were standing. And four other cops either failed to record the events or improperly withheld video evidence.\n\nThe police department previously claimed that patrol cars were either facing away from the shooting \u2014 dashboard cameras automatically activate when a cop engages lights and sirens \u2014 or that audio was missing due to a technical problem.\n\nPolice dash-cam footage from the shooting, released in 2015, contradicted the cops\u2019 version of events, sparking the city\u2019s internal probe. The footage showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald as he walked away with a small knife, and then continuing to shoot even after the teen fell to the ground and lay dying. According to the report, McDonald was still breathing but officers failed to render aid or check for a pulse.\n\nAfter officers viewed the damning dashcam footage of McDonald\u2019s shooting years ago, they further justified the murder, alleged McDonald was dangerous, and continued to approve false police statements, according to Ferguson\u2019s report.\n\nREAD: Prosecutors wanted 18 years in prison for Jason Van Dyke. He got less than 7.\n\nVan Dyke, who refused to participate in the inspector general\u2019s probe, was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison for second-degree murder earlier this year. Four police officers who were with Van Dyke that night \u2014 Richard Viramontes, Janet Mondragon, Stephen Franko, and Daphne Sebastian \u2014 were also fired this year over their alleged efforts to protect Van Dyke or obstruct justice, although they were never charged criminally.\n\nMeanwhile, Van Dyke\u2019s partner, Joseph Walsh, and officers Thomas Gaffney and David March were found not guilty of engaging in a cover-up earlier this year. Walsh and March have since resigned.\n\nThe inspector general initially recommended the firing of 11 cops, including the high-ranking Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy and Deputy Chief David McNaughton, according to NBC News. He recommended discipline for four other officers he said were involved.\n\nREAD: Chicago police officers found not guilty of conspiring to cover Laquan McDonald's death\n\nMcNaughton was one of the officers to approve false police reports after watching the dashcam footage, according to the report. Roy also viewed the video but \u201clet stand reports containing materially false statements and conclusions.\u201d Both retired before they could face punishment.\n\nSome of the allegations in the investigation were previously revealed years ago through documents obtained by the Chicago Tribune.\n\nCover: Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke, left, at his sentencing hearing at the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago on January 18, 2019.
