Well, he\u2019s completely professional by most accounts, now that we\u2019ve gotten an exclusive look into the way he treats the desk in Seth Meyers\u2019s Late Night studio when the NBC host isn\u2019t around to protect it, despite Meyers generously sharing his studio with the SNL crew when they need extra space. After chatting about his storied career on Nickelodeon\u2019s All That and SNL, Thompson was forced to face some recent behavior that Meyers considers unacceptable: A photo was shared of Thompson taking an imaginary dump on Meyers\u2019s desk while filming the \u201cRoyal Romance\u201d sketch for Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s SNL episode last week. \u201cThe only thing I ask is respect the desk! This is my home! Without the desk, I\u2019m nothing,\u201d Meyers pleads. \u201cYou tell me if you think this is professional.\u201d Thompson\u2019s only defense? \u201cI just wanted to leave you a little gift!\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "On NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night,\u201d Seth Meyers talks with Kenan Thompson about \u201cSNL\u201d and \u201cAll That\u201d and calls him out for disrespecting the \u201cLate Night\u201d desk.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-kenan-thompson-late-night-seth-meyers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
