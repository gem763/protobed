He can no longer blackmail members with a no-deal crash out as the only alternative to his sell-out deal.\n\n\"Today is a historic day for parliament because it said it will not be blackmailed by a PM who it seems is prepared to defy a law.\"\n\nMr Johnson carefully avoided saying he wouldn't send the legal letter asking for a delay - rather than he wouldn't negotiate a delay.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nAsking for a delay and negotiating one are two different things - and the letter of the law states PM is only forced to ask, not negotiate. \"I'm absolutely certain he will comply with the law,\" said Sir Oliver.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson added the Commons sitting should be briefly suspended so the Prime Minister could \"go and send his letter\" while MPs wait.\n\nNaomi Smith, CEO of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain said: \u201cThe success of this amendment shows that MPs do not trust Boris Johnson not to run the country off a No-Deal cliff-edge a year down the line.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister tried to bounce MPs into quickly nodding through a deal which makes Theresa May\u2019s botched effort look good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another humiliation for the Prime Minister who can\u2019t win a parliamentary vote.\n\n\u201cHe must now do what is right for the country by requesting an extension from the EU, and averting the crisis he created through his last minute renegotiation.\u201d\n\nClosing the debate, Michael Gove said that as democrats, MPs should back leaving the EU with a deal.\n\nMr Gove, the cabinet minister with the responsibility for no-deal preparations, said: \"I know that deciding how to vote today for many members will have been difficult and it is important for us to recognise that for those who argued to Remain, and still argue that that is the best outcome, they do so as patriots but they take a different view from some of us.\"\n\nHe added: \"What unites us in this House is that we are democrats. And we voted in this House of Commons to have a referendum, we voted in this House of Commons to say that we would respect the verdict of the people.\n\n\"We voted overwhelmingly for Article 50 which honoured that referendum and said that we would leave. How would it look to those who send us here now if we say to them we made those sacred promises but now we chose to dishonour them?\"", "description": "The Prime Minister insists he will press ahead to \"get Brexit done by October 31\"", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653979.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
