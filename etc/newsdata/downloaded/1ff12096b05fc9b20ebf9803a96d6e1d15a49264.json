It's a technique that's been used for thousands of years, but it was most recently popular in the '70s. You've probably seen it in vintage chairs.\n\nRetailers are already selling caned items, including a chair from Urban Outfitters, a cabinet from Pottery Barn, and a bed frame from Anthropologie.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAs with any medium, decor trends come in and out of style with time.\n\nSeventies furniture has been making a comeback in recent months according to Etsy, with shoppers flocking to furniture covered in fringe and velvet.\n\nYou might have already noticed an increase in shag rugs and macram\u00e9 wall hangings, but the next big '70s item that's slated to return is caned furniture.\n\nCaning was most often used in chairs in its '70s heyday. Urban Outfitters\n\nCaning is a style of wicker furniture often used in chairs. It refers to the process of weaving rattan together, which creates a distinct open pattern.\n\nThe style can be dated all the way back to ancient times, according to Apartment Therapy, but it was most recently popular in the 1970s.\n\nAnd now it's back again with a more modern look, as you can see from items like the Urban Outfitters' Marte Lounge Chair shown above ($379).\n\nLeanne Ford, an interior designer and HGTV star of \"Restored By The Fords,\" shared with Insider that she's excited about the caning trend at an event for the Leesa Legend mattress. She's an ambassador for the brand.\n\n\"It's old and new, which is what I like about design,\" Ford told Insider, speaking of caning.\n\nThe modern caning trend isn't limited to chairs, with retailers expanding into other kinds of rattan furniture\n\nPottery Barn currently sells this Dolores Cane Buffet Cabinet. Although it usually retails for $1,499, at the time of writing, it's available for a discounted price of $1,119.\n\nYou can use caning in armories and other storage pieces. Pottery Barn\n\nAnthropologie is even selling a caned bed. The Heatherfield Bed ($1,998) also features a velvet frame, so it has double the '70s energy.\n\nYou can even buy a caned bed frame. Anthropologie\n\nRegardless of the type of furniture, the distinct pale wicker stands out and the open weave gives caned items a breezy vibe that work in every room.", "description": "Caned furniture with a woven wood design was all the rage in the 1970s.
