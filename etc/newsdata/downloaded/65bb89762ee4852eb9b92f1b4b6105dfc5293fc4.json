That amounts to about $109 billion worth of annual imports, according to research firm Panjiva. On Dec.15, the 15% tariff will be assessed on another $155 billion worth of consumer goods from China. At that point, there will be new Trump tariffs on virtually everything imported from China.\n\nDuring the last 18 months, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on about $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, but those are mostly component products consumers never see. Those tariffs have led to some price increases, with some importers also taking a hit through lower profits. In some cases, Chinese suppliers have lowered their own prices to offset the tariff. Importers have also begun seeking new suppliers outside China, to avoid the tax.\n\nA $1,000 annual tax on the typical US household\n\nThe new Sept. 1 tariffs will take about $16 billion out of Americans\u2019 pockets over the course of a year, if they remain in effect and Chinese import levels remain the same. Add in the Dec. 15 tariffs and the cost of the tax would rise to $40 billion. That\u2019s not a huge hit in a $21 trillion economy, but it does add up. JPMorgan Chase estimates the tariffs already in place and scheduled to go into effect will cost the typical American household more than $1,000 per year.\n\nA shopper is seen in a Target store in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., November 14, 2017.

Here are some of the main product categories subject to the new tax, according to Panjiva:\n\nClothing and footwear such as sneakers, sweaters and baby clothes \u2014 $39 billion worth of annual imports\n\nElectronics such TVs, monitors, and audio equipment \u2014 $24 billion\n\nMachinery such as printers, desktop computers, hand tools, and air-conditioner parts \u2014 $15 billion\n\nPlastic products such as tableware, buckets, and school supplies \u2014 $5 billion\n\nLeisure products such as NordicTrack fitness machines \u2014 $5 billion\n\nFurniture such as bedding \u2014 $1 billion\n\nPrice hikes won\u2019t hit consumers right away on every product. Some importers have been stockpiling Chinese imports ahead of the new tariffs, so they\u2019ll be able to sell from non-tariffed inventories for a while. But retailers have been griping about the tariffs nonetheless. A group of more than 200 shoe companies, for instance, recently sent a letter to Trump calling the tariffs a \u201chidden tax \u2026 driving up costs for hardworking American families.\u201d\n\nNike shoes are seen displayed at a sporting goods store in New York City, New York, U.S., May 14, 2019.

And the latest consumer-sentiment survey by the University of Michigan showed a big drop, largely due to the escalating trade war.\n\nChina, in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs, has raised its own tariffs on some U.S. imports, and simply stopped buying some American products, such as soybeans and pork. The trade war is hurting both sides. Trump needs a deal with China to bolster his reelection odds 14 months from now, before the trade war does too much damage to the U.S. economy. But China may wait him out, as American consumers adapt to paying more\u2014and decide whether it will affect their vote in 2020.", "description": "Here's a list of the major product categories subject to a new 15% tax.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e8xu2cGQgRZ0ec_MPO6d8w--~B/aD0zNzg5O3c9NTk5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/93aa62d0-c3a8-11e9-affe-0101ab214509"}
