About a third of debutants are playing in those sectors. They include the founders of small business online lender Prospa, Greg Moshal and Beau Bertoli with estimated fortunes of $101 million and $45 million.\n\nAnd despite the recent fall in Afterpay shares the stock's stellar run over the past year \u2013 it's up more than 130 per cent \u2013 has put swelled the fortune of its co-founder Nick Molnar, cementing his place on the Young Rich List with wealth of $341 million. Larry Diamond, co-founder of Zip Co, is also on the list with an estimated wealth of $64 million.\n\nSteve Smith debuts even after a horror year Atlassian duo supercharge a record year of wealth The fitness star and the Millennial bank Atlassian co-founders Australia\u2019s richest young entrepreneurs Targeting Uber drivers a splendid move for Chris King Where are the women? Inside Afterpay, Prospa and the fintech boom The billionaire brothers from Bundaberg How Young Rich Lister Jimmy Spithill invests The first Young Rich Listers - where are they now?\n\nMelbourne-based Archa is joining the rush to steal market share from the big banks. After securing seed investment from Ms Skye and Australian rugby union player Quade Cooper, it's now seeking $7 million from venture capitalists to help it launch a deposit product over the summer and progress its ADI licence.\n\nBut forget about mortgages. Mr Kidd argues Millennials want products for their lifestyle and home ownership isn't on the agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We just don't think our [potential] customers are interested in that kind of debt,\" Mr Kidd said. \"I think a lot of people talk about whether mortgages and whether houses are affordable but I don't think enough people are talking about whether getting a house is desirable for younger people.\"\n\nInstead it plans to roll out a pre-pay debit card. It is advertising features like \"social invoicing\", which allows users to invoice their friends when they pay a bill, even if their friends don't bank with Archa.\n\nSquare Peg's Paul Bassat queries the rise of so-called neo banks, arguing their capital requirements will be large, and this disadvantage will outweigh any cost benefits their models deliver.\n\n\"The folks that are going down the ADI route of becoming deposit-taking institutions and getting licences and going down that path, it's a very, very capital-heavy approach,\" he said.\n\nMr Kidd sees things differently. Regulatory change is throwing opportunity he feels Archa can profit from. \"We are building something that is lifestyle-based. We are not trying to re-dress a bank in prettier clothes. We want to completely redo the products through a mobile platform.\"", "description": "Young Rich Lister and social media star Emily Skye has made her first investment in a start-up.
