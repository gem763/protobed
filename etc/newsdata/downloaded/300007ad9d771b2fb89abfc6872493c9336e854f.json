But to the employees of a department demoralized by the administration\u2019s repeated attempts to slash its budget and staff, cooperating with the inquiry is seen as a moment of catharsis, an opportunity to reassert the foreign policy norms they believe Trump has blown past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a while to understand just how weird the policy process has become but it was inevitable,\u201d said Ronald Neumann, president of the American Academy of Diplomacy. The group wrote a letter last month calling for the administration to support career diplomats and protect them from politicization.\n\nThe State Department officials parading through Capitol Hill include high-ranking diplomats with decades of experience serving both Republican and Democratic administrations. Among them: Kurt Volker , who resigned as the administration\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine after being named in the whistleblower complaint that jumpstarted the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOthers who have testified behind closed doors include Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was pushed out of the post after a concerted campaign by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; Michael McKinley , who resigned after 37 years in the foreign service in part over treatment of Yovanovitch; and Fiona Hill, a National Security Council staffer who worked closely with the former Ukrainian ambassador.\n\nVolker told investigators he did not believe there was anything improper in his dealings in Ukraine. But the others have all spoken of their unease and concern about Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine and their testimony has largely corroborated the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which centered on a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader, as well as Giuliani\u2019s dealings in the former Soviet republic.\n\nYovanovitch, who remains a State Department employee, said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d at being recalled early from her post despite having been told she did nothing wrong. She lamented that her experience is evidence that American diplomats can no longer count on support from their government if they are attacked by foreign interests.\n\n\u201cThat basic understanding no longer holds true,\u201d she said according to the text of her opening statement to lawmakers. \u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within.\u201d\n\nMcKinley said he was \u201cdisturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents.\u201d\n\nTrump has long cast career government officials as part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d out to undermine him, associating the officials\u2019 service under Democratic administrations as signs of their political leanings. That\u2019s despite the fact that most longtime career officials have served under both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, argued last week that the diplomats were disparaging Trump because they were upset that he was imposing his political priorities on their work. He singled out in particular McKinley, who entered the foreign service while Republican Ronald Reagan was in the White House and had served under both presidents of both parties.\n\n\u201cElections have consequences and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cAnd what you\u2019re seeing now, I believe, is a group of mostly career bureaucrats who are saying, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics, so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt that they\u2019re undertaking on the Hill\u2019.\u201d\n\nFormer Deputy Secretary of State William Burns called Mulvaney\u2019s assertion \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor them to be dismissed unfairly and accused of acting out of some political motive I think is just wrong,\u201d said Burns, who is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cThey are demonstrating that they are responsible, decent public servants and that they have an obligation to tell the truth even when it isn\u2019t convenient for the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives a lie to the deep state caricature. These aren\u2019t people plotting behind anyone\u2019s back. They are stepping up to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe White House has insisted the administration, including career officials, would not participate in the impeachment investigation. Democrats have compelled the testimony of most of the officials through subpoenas and the State Department has so far not retaliated against those who have appeared.\n\nNeumann, the American Academy of Diplomacy president, urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to back up his staff if there are calls for them to be punished.\n\n\u201cSo far, Pompeo has failed to show loyalty to the people who work for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, he has another test. Does anything happen to those who testify? If nothing happens, I would give Pompeo credit for having blocked it.\u201d\n\nPompeo has not spoken frequently about the inquiry except to say it is unfair to the people who work for him because they are not allowed to bring State Department lawyers with them to testify. Yet in a Friday interview with Politico, he suggested his opposition to their appearances was not particularly strong.\n\n\u201cI hope they go to tell the truth,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cAnd say things that are accurate to the best of their knowledge and complete - not only accurate, but complete, and then I have every expectation that Congress will perform its oversight function properly if the process is appropriate.\u201d\n\nTwo more diplomats get their turn to talk this week: William Taylor, currently the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three years of simmering frustration inside the State Department is boiling over on Capitol Hill as a parade of current and former diplomats testify to their concerns about the Trump administration's unorthodox policy toward Ukraine.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Lee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/trump_impeachment_ukraine_ambassador_26106_c0-138-3727-2312_s1200x700.jpg?acfcddc052fdeea0a4b79fd77df884f65e7e2a67", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
