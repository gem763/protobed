For the past few weeks, the company has been embroiled in a slow-motion scandal over its inexplicable policies on political misinformation, one that epitomizes the kind of moral cowardice that characterizes Facebook\u2019s approach to its political challenges.\n\nThe controversy kicked off last month when the Facebook executive Nick Clegg revealed in a speech that politicians are exempt from the company\u2019s third-party fact-checking program. The policy drew immediate scrutiny due to the distinctly dystopian context in which the speech was made: just as the president of the United States was actively promoting misinformation on Facebook to smear a political rival and undermine an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump\u2019s Facebook page has launched 5,883 different ads since news of the Ukraine-call whistleblower broke on 18 September, 40% of which mention impeachment, according to a Guardian analysis of the Facebook political ad archive. The Trump campaign has spent between $1.3m and $3.8m promoting the impeachment ads, which had been viewed between 26.5m and 43.9m times, as of Wednesday. (The ad archive reports spending and impression data as a range.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attends meetings on Capitol Hill on 19 September.

The 30-second video falsely claims that Joe Biden \u201cpromised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company\u201d. It uses audio of Biden speaking loosely of his role in Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u201d he says, \u201cWell, son of a bitch, he got fired\u201d \u2013 to create the impression that Biden admitted to extorting Ukraine on behalf of his son. CNN declined to run the ad, saying: \u201cIn addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s insistence on protecting Trump\u2019s right to mislead the public and distort verifiable facts is a strange look for a company that attempted to burnish its reputation post-Russian interference with an ad campaign declaring \u201cFake news is not your friend\u201d. And attempts by the company to justify the decision are nearly impossible to parse.\n\nIn a letter to the Biden campaign, which complained about the Trump ad, Facebook\u2019s elections policy director, Katie Harbath, invoked \u201cFacebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is\u201d. She then explained that if a politician shared a link to a viral hoax written by someone else, that post would be rejected as an advertisement, but if the same politician wrote the viral hoax in his own words, that would not only be fine, but Facebook would not allow third-party fact checkers to flag the information as false.\n\nWhen I asked Facebook whether this new rule would also exempt politicians who promote vaccine misinformation, which is explicitly barred from advertisements, a company spokeswoman said that it would not. If your head is spinning, you are not alone. These rules do not make any sense.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more absurd is that Facebook actually did take action against the ads, just for a different reason. As I reported on 2 October, the Biden ads were briefly blocked for violating Facebook\u2019s policy against profanity. (After the Trump campaign bleeped \u201cson of a bitch\u201d, they were allowed to run again.)\n\nWhy does Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression privilege the right of a politician to lie but not to use a swear word?\n\nIt has been tempting for some to ascribe Facebook\u2019s motives here to economic self-interest. The Trump campaign is a major advertiser on Facebook, after all, much larger than the Biden campaign.\n\nBut I suspect that this incident has less to do with revenues and more to do with Zuckerberg\u2019s fundamental political programming, which defaults to protecting incumbent power above all else.\n\nWas it really an act of \u201ccourage\u201d for Zuckerberg to criticize Trump\u2019s xenophobia in April 2016, when a Hillary Clinton coronation appeared assured?\n\nOver and over again, Zuckerberg and Facebook have failed to take action to prevent real and lasting harm, when that action involved challenging the status quo or state power. This was demonstrated most devastatingly by its unwillingness to rein in Myanmar\u2019s military until after a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya had already been accomplished, as well as in its foot-dragging on banning white nationalism. This predilection for the powerful is how Zuckerberg went from calling out Trump on building walls to an Oval Office grip and grin.\n\nWe are living in an age when everyone from cheap furniture makers to video game publishers is being forced to pick sides in serious struggles between business and barbarism, between authoritarianism and democracy. That Zuckerberg refuses to do so reveals whose side he\u2019s really on.", "description": "Tech giant has insisted on protecting the president\u2019s right to mislead the public and distort facts, writes Julia Carrie Wong", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40eccc1e8d7547c3dbdcae23c1b1c4246d010379/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a90244979342c796720aee4dc321687e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
