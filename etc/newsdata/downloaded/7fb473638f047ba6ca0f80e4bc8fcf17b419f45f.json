I took time out \u2013 I went to a singing teacher and also to a gym, which I hated, so that didn\u2019t continue!\n\nIt took me a while to build up again, but I learnt from it.\n\nBefore that I would go to the opening of an envelope.\n\nNow I limit what I do.\n\nI like to sit and be quiet and do nothing.\n\nMajella will say, \u2018What are you thinking about?\u2019\n\nAnd I\u2019m not thinking of anything.\n\nI may be meditating and I don\u2019t know it, but I\u2019m actually not thinking of anything.\n\nI don\u2019t feel guilty, though, because I need to sit and do nothing.\n\n(Image: Unknown)\n\nMy music, to be realistic, is not what you\u2019d hear on Top Of The Pops ordinarily.\n\nI grew up watching the show and so to appear on it was amazing.\n\nWhen I started my career I could never have imagined the things I\u2019ve got to do and the places I\u2019ve been, or that I\u2019d have an album in the charts every year for 32 consecutive years\n\nBefore I met my wife I was very solitary and career-driven.\n\nMarriage has given me another life.\n\nWe\u2019re very independent too.\n\nI travel so much and Majella had been on her own with her two children for a good while before I met her.\n\nI would say we survive apart, but we thrive together.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly happy when I\u2019m on stage.\n\nMy new album Halfway To Paradise contains 60 tracks over 3 CDs, with tributes to The Beatles, Elvis and Cliff Richard.\n\nThe music is very much from the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll 50s and 60s.\n\nMy Secret Snapshot\n\nI grew up in Donegal and I enjoy what this area offers.\n\nThis is where I live and this is where I became what I am.\n\nIt\u2019s a rural community and I know all the people and they know me.\n\nI\u2019m in the country and by the sea \u2013 the Atlantic Ocean is just in front of me.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful.\n\nI love getting involved in local community events, and I get as much pleasure singing for 10 people at a local festival as I do for 1,000 in a concert hall.\n\nI take part in the Mary From Dungloe Festival every year.\n\nThere\u2019s a parade on the Sunday, and this picture was taken two years ago at the 50th anniversary parade.\n\nMy wife Majella and I dressed up\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t even know what we were supposed to be, it was just something they gave us \u2013 maybe a prince and princess.\n\nWe were on a float waving to everyone and Olivia, my four-year-old granddaughter, came on the float with us for a bit.\n\nMy greatest passion in life is my family.\n\nMajella has two kids, who have been such a joy to me.\n\nSiobhan now has children of her own \u2013 Olivia and 18-month-old Archie, and I chat to them on WhatsApp every day.\n\nI know it\u2019s not the same as a hug, but God it\u2019s great to see them and for them to see us.\n\nWe\u2019re lucky they don\u2019t live too far away, so we physically see them too.\n\n- Daniel O'Donnell Halfway to Paradise is released on CD and vinyl on 18th October on the DMGTV label. he is touring the UK this Autumn - for details CLICK HERE", "description": "The crooner says he had to take time out and stop singing as he learnt a valuable lesson", "authors": ["Sue Crawford", "Image", "Getty Images", "Copyright", "Eoin Mc Garvey", "Daily Record", "Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20387453.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pride-Of-Ireland-Awards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
