The ISM manufacturing index dived to a 10-year low of 47.8 in September and is well into contraction territory. New export orders crashed to 41.0, the lowest level since March 2009.\n\nThe figures may have been distorted by a strike at General Motors but it clear that the US economy has entered a classic \"window of vulnerability\" where even a modest external shock could push it over the edge. \"Recession is a real risk,\" said Torsten Slok from Deutsche Bank. Only three sectors out of 18 in the ISM survey are still above water, compared with nine a month ago. Many firms blamed the trade war.\n\n\"Chinese tariffs are hurting our business. Most of the materials are made only in China,\" one food processor said.\n\nGreatest risk\n\nSwedish unemployment has crept up from 6.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent this year. That may cause stress in the housing market, where apartment prices have more than doubled in a decade and household debt has risen to a record 190 per cent of disposable income.\n\nThe central bank said in its financial stability report that household debt \"poses the greatest risk in the Swedish economy\" and could lead to trouble if job losses mount or the housing boom starts to deflate. \"The rise in unemployment is quite dramatic and it is worrying,\" said Lars Christensen from Markets and Money Advisory. \"Sweden is being hit by the contraction in world trade. It is telling a story for the whole world economy, and that story is 'watch out.'\"\n\nThe central bank may have made a mistake by raising interest rates last December from minus 0.5 per cent to minus 0.25 per cent. Even this modest withdrawal of emergency stimulus has been too much to bear in the trade downturn.\n\nIt also shows just how hard it is for a country to extricate itself from the negative rate trap once deflationary forces become embedded in the economy. The European Central Bank may have the same difficulties if it tries to lift rates. The puzzle is the weakness of the Swedish krona. Even against sterling, it has fallen 12 per cent over the past two years. This should have acted as an economic shock absorber but the mechanism seems to be broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwitzerland's PMI data for September also slumped, dropping to a 10-year low. A pattern is emerging where open economies that rely on trade and have big current account surpluses are getting into difficulties.\n\nMr Christensen says large perpetual trade surpluses have a corrosive side-effect. They drive down the natural rate of interest to negative levels and effectively disarm monetary policy. The Swedish and Swiss central banks are stuck. It is a lesson that you can have too much of a good thing in macro-economics.\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "A pattern is emerging where open economies that rely on trade and have big current account surpluses are getting into difficulties.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1889%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8eaefc31db510997ac20c8c34cff7d6f42032e29", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
