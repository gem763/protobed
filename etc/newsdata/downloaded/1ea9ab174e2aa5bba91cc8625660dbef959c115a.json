She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it\u2019s not clear under what authority.\n\nTellingly, almost no one on her side says, \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re getting at Liz, but you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nTo their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Her answer came down to the assertion that if a majority supports the tax, it should pass muster. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren\u2019t thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.\n\nThis gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal, didn\u2019t raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn\u2019t have the power to do it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
