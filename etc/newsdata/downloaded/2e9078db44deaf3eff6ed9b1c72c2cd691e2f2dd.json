Bend the right leg, placing your knee by your right wrist and your foot towards the left wrist.\n\nExtend the left leg behind you. If you are tight on the right side, place a yoga brick or folded towel under your bottom to take some pressure off elevating your right side slightly.\n\nThe left hip flexor will then also be stretched with the extension of the leg. Hold for 45 seconds to 1 minute or until you feel yourself relax into it.\n\nThen repeat on the other side. Include it after all of your exercise sessions when the body is warm.\n\nCelebrity personal trainer Nadya Fairweather suggests practicing the pigeon pose to achieve flexible hips\n\nWHAT TO EAT\n\nYour diet can also help, says nutritionist Shona Wilkinson (shona wilkinson.com). Anchovies contain Omega 3 essential fatty acids.\n\nThese help with heart health and inflammation, but also enhance joint mobility to help with flexibility.\n\nInclude fresh ginger in your diet, too. It has a stimulatory effect on the circulatory system, with the added benefit of working to reduce the inflammation, which is known to reduce flexibility.\n\nKeep hydrated, by drinking plenty of water. Our muscles are largely composed of water, which is key to muscle elasticity. Sip water throughout the day to help lubricate joints.\n\nWHAT TO WEAR", "description": "Nadya Fairweather suggests practicing the pigeon pose to achieve flexible hips.
