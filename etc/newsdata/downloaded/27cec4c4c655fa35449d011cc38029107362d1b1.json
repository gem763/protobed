REUTERS/Lucas Landau\n\nBy Anthony Boadle\n\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s state nuclear power company Eletronuclear plans to complete its long-delayed Angra 3 plant by partnering with either China\u2019s National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), France\u2019s EDF (EDF.PA) or Russia\u2019s Rosatom, its president Leonam Guimaraes told Reuters.\n\nEletronuclear will decide by the end of the year whether to create a subsidiary joint venture or if the foreign partner will become a minority shareholder in the state company, which would entitle it to a stake in its existing Angra 1 and 2 nuclear power plants, Guimaraes said.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on Tuesday, he said the partner would require deep pockets, as completion of Angra 3 will require 15 billion reais ($3.7 billion) on top of the 9 billion reais already invested.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for an international partnership to invest in the completion of Angra 3 and that partner would own part of the plant until the end of its life,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Brazilian law, the partner must have less than 50% of the voting capital.\n\nIn June, Eletronuclear sounded out market interest in a partnership for Angra 3 with invitations to 10 foreign firms, Guimaraes said. Seven replied but the most interested are CNNC, EDF and Rosatom, he said.\n\nCNNC executives visited Angra 3 in June and reaffirmed their interest in completing it and building future plants in Brazil.\n\nU.S. company Westinghouse, which is owned by Brookfield Business Partners LP, and France\u2019s Framatome, majority owned by EDF, were also interested. However, they are suppliers of nuclear technology and Eletronuclear is looking for a partner to help build the rest of Angra 3, Guimaraes said.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kepco Engineering and Construction and China\u2019s State Power Investment Corporation also showed interest in Angra 3, located on the coast south of Rio de Janeiro, but seemed less committed to exploring a partnership, he said.\n\nThe plant was first planned in the 1980s but dropped due to lack of finance. Building restarted in 2010, but Eletronuclear was hit by a corruption scandal in 2015 and stopped paying contractors such as French company Areva, which was installing the Siemens-designed reactor technology now owned by Framatome.\n\nAngra 3 is 70% finished and 80% of the nuclear reactor equipment has been bought, Guimaraes said. Eletronuclear spends 25 million reais a year on upkeep and insurance for the construction site and nuclear technology, he said.\n\nThat does not include interest payments on 10 billion reais in loans from national development bank BNDES to build Angra 3.\n\nEletronuclear is a subsidiary of state-run electric utility Eletrobras EKET6.SA, which the government plans to privatize, although the nuclear power unit will be spun off and remain under state control.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January, has pledged to complete Angra 3 and study new plants in a push to expand the contribution of nuclear power to Brazil\u2019s electricity output, from 3% currently.\n\nGuimaraes said two potential sites for future plants have been identified, one in the northeastern state of Pernambuco and another in southeastern Minas Gerais state.\n\nBrazil has had to buy uranium concentrate for Angra 1 and 2 on the global market, mainly from Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, due to a halt in output over licensing at the only domestic mine in operation, in Bahia state, Guimares said.\n\nA new open pit mine in Bahia near the first mine should be licensed by year-end, he said.", "description": "Brazil's state nuclear power company Eletronuclear plans to complete its long-delayed Angra 3 plant by partnering with either China's National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), France's EDF or Russia's Rosatom, its president Leonam Guimaraes told Reuters.", "authors": ["Anthony Boadle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444213587&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1T8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
