Great.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Thursday night's Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Texas made clear that there are three main candidates leading the field, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, according to AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace. (Sept. 13) AP, AP\n\nIn their war on rural America, Democratic candidates want to take guns, put churches out of business and pay for sex reassignment surgery for inmates.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more jaw-dropping \u2014 the disdain Democratic presidential candidates have for rural Americans and their values, or their willingness to make it a centerpiece of their campaign to unseat Donald Trump.\n\nDid they learn nothing from 2016?\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plans to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens and to put churches out of business, combined with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s stinging insult that conservative religious people are too ugly and backward to find a suitable mate, are good reminders that the national Democratic Party has simply abandoned rural and Middle America. The presidential candidates' appearance last week at a CNN town hall tackling LGBTQ issues revealed a serious weakness in Democratic plans to defeat President Donald Trump.\n\nTo be fair, these sentiments have been around on the left for quite some time, even if they used to keep it under wraps. When Barack Obama bemoaned \u201cbitter\u201d people \u201cclinging\u201d to guns and religion in 2008, he did so at a private fundraiser in San Francisco. His rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton, used it against him in fliers and on the stump, saying she was \u201ctaken aback\u201d at his \u201celitist\u201d remarks.\n\nObama said the quiet part out loud, and Clinton pounced.\n\nBut Obama won the war, and Hillary learned her lesson. By 2016, she had gone from defending people in \u201csmall-town America\u201d and handing out \u201cI\u2019m not bitter\u201d stickers to calling Trump supporters \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nDemocrats aren't hiding their disdain\n\nAnd now, in the run-up to the 2020 election, the veil is completely off. The question was simple and so was the answer from O\u2019Rourke, who has little chance to win his party\u2019s nomination but has become a suicide bomber for whoever does.\n\n\u201cDo you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities \u2014 should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?\u201d asked moderator Don Lemon. O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nSay goodbye to your place of worship if Beto gets his way.\n\nMore from Scott Jennings: With Democrats, every story ends the same: Republicans are racists or Russians\n\nSomewhere, a staffer at the Democratic National Committee is wondering: What do we tell African American church pastors as we try to turn out their congregants? You know, the ones who failed to show up in 2016.\n\nScott Jennings, columnist (Photo: photo courtesy Scott Jennings)\n\nThis followed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s previous call for mandatory gun confiscation, which, to quote rural philosopher Emmett from the movie \"Roadhouse,\" went over \u201clike an elevator in an outhouse.\u201d\n\nBeto\u2019s answers on guns and religion weren\u2019t all that surprising coming from a thoughtless, skateboarding ne'er-do-well trying to goose a flailing campaign. But the thunderous applause from the studio audiences will ring in the ears of rural voters for quite some time. It\u2019s not just Beto \u2014 base Democrats really believe this stuff.\n\nInsults won't attract voters\n\nFront-running Elizabeth Warren is no better. The odds-on-favorite to win the nomination took Hillary\u2019s \u201cdeplorable\u201d quip one step further. Here\u2019s NBC News recounting her viral moment:\n\n\u201cLet's say you're on the campaign trail and a supporter approaches you and says, 'Senator, I'm old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.' What is your response?\" asked Morgan Cox, board chairman of the Human Rights Campaign, which co-hosted the event.\n\nDon't reinvent the meaning of 'sex': Transgender athletes deserve compassion, but not the right to transform women's sports\n\n\"Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that, and I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that,'\" Warren said, to laughs and applause from the audience.\n\nAs the clapping subsided, the senator paused before going in for the kill \u2014 \"assuming you can find one\" \u2014 drawing sustained applause and cheers from the crowd.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks during an LGBTQ town hall in Los Angeles, California. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t good enough to stop at \u201cmarry one woman.\u201d Playing to the audience, she added the final insult \u2014 that people (especially men) with conservative values on traditional marriage are just plain ugly. And this comes from a Democrat who routinely attacks Trump as divisive. What a hypocrite.\n\nBut it was an absolutely nuts policy position Warren took that will haunt her in swing states with substantial rural areas. Back in 2012, a more rational Warren, then a candidate for U.S. Senate, did not support using taxpayer dollars to pay for transgender surgeries for prison inmates.\n\nBut 2020\u2019s version of Warren, further woke and delighted by applause from small crowds locked in television studios, said that now she believes inmates are \u201centitled\u201d to transgender surgery, at taxpayer expense. Warren perhaps was catching up to former Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries back in September.\n\nImagine Democrats going door-to-door in the Pennsylvania countryside next fall on a platform of, \u201cWell, I see that you are too ugly to find a spouse. Anyhow, we are raising your taxes to pay for inmate gender reassignment surgery. Do you have your gun and church directory handy, by the way?\u201d\n\nI hope the applause is satisfying in 2019, because the 2020 electoral results in rural America won\u2019t be.\n\nScott Jennings is a CNN contributor, a former adviser to Republican candidates and causes and a founding partner at RunSwitch Public Relations.
