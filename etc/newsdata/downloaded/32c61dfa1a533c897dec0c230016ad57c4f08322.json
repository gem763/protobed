Our base in the town of Mestia could easily have come straight out of a Game of Thrones set, with its ancient stone buildings and Svan towers \u2013 defensive structures that date back as far as the 12th or 13th centuries \u2013 giving a medieval feel to the place. Yet Tetnuldi ski resort, 15km to the east, is at the forefront of the modern freeride scene in Georgia.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ve got to like travelling to get here. The four-hour flight from London to Tbilisi is no big deal, but if the short connecting flight to Mestia isn\u2019t operating \u2013 as is often the case given the region\u2019s wild mountain weather \u2013 you\u2019re looking at an eight-hour drive. At least it\u2019s scenic, taking you above inaccessible river gorges, through deep forests that are home to bears, wolves and lynx and beneath savagely steep mountains that are higher than anything in the Alps.\n\nThe potholed dirt road to Tetnuldi adds another half-hour to the journey, but when you eventually get there, you\u2019ll be glad you made the effort if deep powder, fantastic mountain panoramas and empty slopes are your idea of a good time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDespite having only four chairlifts, Tetnuldi offers some of the wildest and quietest skiing in Europe. That said, you\u2019d get bored pretty quickly if you stuck to the modest collection of blue, red and black runs beneath the lifts, but the terrain off the side, which is forested on the lower slopes, is a freerider\u2019s dream, and there\u2019s 900 vertical metres of it from the resort\u2019s high point of 3,160m in the shadow of 4,858m Mount Tetnuldi.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Reuters/Ekaterina Anchevskaya\n\nMost visitors to Tetnuldi come from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands at the moment, but their numbers and those of the locals are so low that lift queues are unheard of. And Tetnuldi is not the only ski resort in the area \u2013 directly above Mestia is the dinky little ski hill of Hatsvali. One chairlift takes you from the town to the base station, and a second carries you up to the 2,348m summit of Mount Zuruldi \u2013 and that\u2019s your lot.\n\nA handful of well-groomed pistes and the option of tree skiing off the side will keep you busy for a day at most, but Hatsvali is well worth a visit if only for the dramatic views of 4690-metre Mount Ushba \u2013 its pointy twin peaks allow the locals with some justification to call it the \u201cMatterhorn of Georgia\u201d. And the skiing comes at a bargain price: a two-day \u201cmultipass\u201d for both resorts costs just \u00a322.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to head back into Mestia for your apr\u00e8s-ski action, which is limited to lively bars and restaurants serving such renowned Georgian dishes as khachapuri (a kind of Georgian pizza) and khinkali (meat, cheese or vegetable dumplings eaten by hand) along with superb Georgian wines, and you\u2019ll be hard pushed to pay more than \u00a315 for a slap-up meal with drinks, while beer comes in at less than \u00a31 a litre.\n\nIf Tetnuldi is, say, the Chamonix of Georgia with its wild mountain landscapes and freeride scene, then the country\u2019s biggest resort, Gudauri, is maybe Georgia\u2019s answer to Les Arcs \u2013 albeit on a much smaller scale. By this I mean it offers something for everyone, and it\u2019s easy to get to, being less than two hours from Tbilisi.\n\nWith some fourteen lifts, many installed in the last few years, almost 60km of pistes, 1,200m of vertical, endless off-piste opportunities and even heli-skiing for the minted (\u20ac750 per person for seven drops) Gudauri is a serious challenger to budget Eastern European resorts like Bansko in Bulgaria, which is a similar size.\n\nLift passes cost just \u20ac14 per day or \u00a375 per week, and most of the runs are wide, open intermediate cruisers, while the big snowfields between them provide easily accessible and unchallenging off-piste that doesn\u2019t get tracked out too quickly, and there are six freeride areas offering steeper slopes for more advanced skiers.\n\nAnother feather in the cap for Gudauri is the close proximity of Tbilisi \u2013 a stopover here is a must. The city\u2019s buzzing nightlife, rich cultural heritage and architectural influences from Persian and Art Nouveau to Soviet-era and modern shouldn\u2019t be missed.\n\nAnd talking of modern, Georgia also has the newest ski resort in Europe, Goderdzi, which lies 1,724m up in the Lower Caucasus.\n\nThe resort opened in 2015 \u2013 and it shows. Despite two brand new ski lifts taking you up to 2,364m, the resort has limited accommodation simply because the hotels are still being built, and the road to the resort \u2013 well, unless you have a rugged 4WD vehicle forget it, especially in heavy snow.\n\nIn theory Goderdzi is only two-hour\u2019s drive from the cosmopolitan Black Sea city of Batumi, but until the final 20km or so of the road is surfaced (a priority, I was told) you\u2019re unlikely to get there in less than three hours, if at all in bad weather.\n\nThis does have some advantages for more adventurous skiers \u2013 we literally had the resort to ourselves when we skied there in bright spring sunshine (lift passes \u00a37 per day/ \u00a337 per week), which made the morning of off-piste cat skiing that we enjoyed (\u00a370 per person per hour/\u00a3280 per day) almost unnecessary as the resort was almost as quiet the backcountry (note that you\u2019ll be standing on a platform on the back of the snowcat rather than riding in a cab, so luxurious it is not).\n\nAt present Goderdzi remains a destination to look out for in the future, especially if you like the idea of skiing and frolicking on a beach on the same trip; Mestia\u2019s resorts, particularly Tetnuldi, will appeal to anyone looking for adventure and endless backcountry, and Gudauri \u2013 well, that should be on the bucket list of pretty much any skier looking for great skiing, good value and a ski experience quite unlike anything in the Alps.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nFlights from London Gatwick to Tbilisi start from \u00a3301 return with Georgian Airways. Internal flights to Mestia start from 65GEL (approx \u00a318) with Vanilla Sky.\n\nFrom 2020, package ski deals to Georgia are available from \u20ac2,100 pp (flights not included) with Mountain Heaven.", "description": "Driving up the snowbound dirt road to Tetnuldi ski area in Georgia\u2019s Caucasus Mountains is like taking your 4WD vehicle back in time.
