She said briefs were mainly given to men.\n\nAccording to the website Judges Matter, Kusevitsky acted at the High Court for three terms in 2017 and three in 2018.\n\nTurning to the Free State, the JSC recommended Nokuthula Sylvia Daniso for the single vacancy in that division.\n\nNews24 earlier reported that while the Black Lawyers Association raised concerns that she had acted for less than two terms in the High Court and said it did not support her appointment, Daniso said, while acting for five months, she had managed to write judgments in \"all\" sections.\n\nMeanwhile, after being interviewed for a third time for the position of North West Deputy Judge President, Hendricks managed to convince the JSC that he was right for the job.\n\nHe was the only person who was interviewed for the vacancy.\n\nHendricks presided over the trial of two men convicted of killing Coligny teen Matlhomola Moshoeu.\n\nHe found the two accused - Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte - guilty of murder, kidnapping, intimidation, theft and the pointing of a firearm in November 2018.\n\nDoorewaard and Schutte were sentenced to 18 and 23 years in prison respectively.", "description": "Three women and one man have been recommended to President Cyril Ramaphosa for appointment to the Bench.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7024/bf7111c5f08443d79b59d5534755b2df.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
