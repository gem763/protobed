In that call, Trump asked Ukraine to \"look into\" unsubstantiated corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary \u2014 and his son Hunter.", "description": "The White House said Tuesday that it will not cooperate with House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, claiming that the proceedings amount to \"baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process.\"", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106170427-1570551124767rtx76lxm.jpg?v=1570568803", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
