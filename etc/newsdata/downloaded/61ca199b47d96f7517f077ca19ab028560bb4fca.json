We can check back in a year or so and see, but, outwardly, it\u2019s possible little is likely to change. James will continue to play basketball and build out his brand and make lots of money. He will speak out anytime he wants while the protesters he ignores cannot without fear of retribution. Irony eludes him.\n\nOPINION:LeBron James undermines values he's espoused in most disgraceful moment of career\n\nWAR OF WORDS:Are LeBron James and the rest of the NBA right to bow to China?\n\nBut in other nuanced ways, everything has changed for him. We thought James was a different kind of athlete, more Ali than Jordan, more Billie Jean than Tiger. We thought he did in fact care about Hong Kong, that he did care about Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s right to speak out, that he did care about how the NBA might even begin to force change on China\u2019s repressive regime.\n\nWhy did we think that? Because of the way James has spent a career constructing an authentic and authoritative presence not just in sports, but in our culture. He was smart about his role in our lives and the wider world of American politics. In these fraught times, he was consistently positioned right where we thought he would be. His tweet calling Donald Trump \u201cu bum\u201d was an instant classic. He wasn\u2019t ever going to shut up and dribble no matter who told him to, and that made sense.\n\nSo we knew this guy. Knew him well. We could count on LeBron to be a voice for sanity and honesty and fairness.\n\nBut then, in an instant, we couldn\u2019t.\n\nAs shock rippled across social media Monday night, and as James and the NBA failed to step up and meet the moment all day Tuesday, a new reality settled in:\n\nLeBron James is now a weakened messenger for whatever it is that he is going to be selling, be it products or politics. His significant voice has been diminished. This is that big of a development.\n\nIt took James a week to gather his thoughts and finally speak out about the controversy that has engulfed his league and already cost it untold dollars in basketball-crazed China.\n\nKnowing LeBron as we do, or, did, he might have started out by saying he hoped the NBA could show the way by opening a dialogue on the important issues of freedom of speech and democracy in China. Instead, he blew it. He said Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand,\u201d which is just an awful, and incorrect, comment.\n\nThen he dropped a line that will live with him in infamy: \u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nUnderstandably, social media erupted, so James inexplicably came back for more, tweeting out that he wanted to \u201cclear up the confusion,\u201d but then only created more when he said his team and the NBA had been through \u201ca difficult week,\u201d adding Morey \u201ccould have waited a week\u201d to send his pro-democracy tweet.\n\nOh my.\n\nThings only got worse Tuesday afternoon when James replied to the controversy by telling a gaggle of reporters in Los Angeles that he hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen paying attention to it much.\u201d\n\nIt's rare that any athlete can become a quintessential 21st century cultural figure, equal parts sports superstar and esteemed voice of a generation.\n\nWho throws that away in a few sentences? LeBron James, that\u2019s who.", "description": "LeBron James stood by his critical comments of the Rockets GM, saying on Tuesday he doesn't think \"every issue should be everybody's problem.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/15/USAT/b85f6f27-44c0-4b7f-bf78-e142e564bc79-AP_Warriors_Lakers_Basketball.JPG?crop=3382,1902,x1,y188&width=2852&height=1902&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
