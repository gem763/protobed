Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on watches? Now that I graduated from college and I\u2019m moving to the city, I\u2019d like to purchase one that I can wear anywhere from work to out at night. Rolexes are a little pricey me for right now, and I hate smartwatches, so looking to find something tasteful and high-quality that won\u2019t totally break the bank.\n\nI have had a long journey with pricey wristwear. In my early 20s, in an attempt to seem rich and grown (SMFH), I bought a Panerai (before the bankers ruined them). It was a little gauche for me and ended up sitting in a drawer. So I sold it and got a Rolex GMT Master II, which also sits in a drawer. Watches just aren\u2019t for me. That said, they can be so so chic.\n\nCartier Tank Solo Watch I would definitely advise buying vintage, as your dollar will go further. A timeless, previously owned Cartier Tank never goes out of style and can be had for less than $3,000. Good enough for Alain Delon and Princess Diana, good enough for you. Then there\u2019s the Rolex Air King, which is a little more pricey. This one from 1973 would do the trick. Initially produced for the British Royal Air Force and its pilots, it will serve you well at the office or a corner table at Frenchette. And a lot of guys I know love Omega. This vintage Seamaster has a cool rugged look and is one of the most important dive watches ever made. Jump into the Atlantic without worry! $2,120 at The Real Real Buy\n\nSwatch Metal Knit Quartz Resin Watch If you want something new and crushingly simple, the Swatch Skin Classic is the perfect choice. A truly \u201cless is more\u201d piece of wristwear, it says I am smart and successful, but don\u2019t need a piece of high-end wristwear to prove it. $120 at Amazon Buy $120 at Amazon Buy\n\nI just bought a new 13\u201d Lenovo Yoga laptop, and I\u2019m looking for a sleek, classy sleeve or case to protect it. What\u2019s the best way to protect my laptop without looking like a dweeb?\n\nFirst of all, what is a \u201cyoga laptop\u201d? I have never seen those two words next to each other. Laptop sleeves are a tough category since most of them are over-designed and scream \u2026 \u201cdweeb.\u201d I\u2019m lucky enough to have a plain black leather one that a friend made for me almost ten years ago, and it\u2019s held up beautifully. A search for \u201claptop sleeve\u201d returns mostly the bad stuff, so the key here is to search for \u201cdocument holder\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s fashion-speak for two pieces of leather connected by a zipper that can hold something.\n\nBurberry London Check Digital Case Show your love for British heritage with this one from Burberry with the brand\u2019s classic check, but in a darker hue. Timeless! $690 at Farfetch Buy\n\nBottega Veneta Intrecciato-Leather Document Holder This document holder from Bottega Veneta is absolutely beautiful and looks like a clutch. If you are rich, this is the only option. $1,900 at Matches Fashion Buy\n\nThule Gauntlet 3.0 13\" MacBook Pro Retina Sleeve $54 (was $60, now 10% off) If you need something more durable, this Thule option, a more traditional laptop case, is cool because it\u2019s rugged; purely functional, and designed to take a beating, it features \u201csuperior edge protection,\u201d which sounds dangerous. Namaste. $54 at Amazon Buy $54 at Amazon Buy\n\nI recently proposed to my longtime girlfriend, and we are now beginning to plan for our wedding next fall. We haven\u2019t decided if it will be black-tie or not, but I\u2019m wondering what tuxedo or suit you would recommend I wear for the big day (depending on what we choose)? Feel free to provide a full head-to-toe look.\n\nLet me say this, chief, no one likes black-tie. It\u2019s fussy, and a lot of men in your life do not own a well-fitting tuxedo. But, if you do decide to go that route, let\u2019s do it right. I actually wore a black seersucker Thom Browne shorts tuxedo to the MTV VMAs last week and am itching to wear it again! Anyway, let\u2019s give you a full look.\n\nThe Row Black Mark Slim-Fit Silk Grosgrain-Trimmed Escorial Wool Tuxedo It\u2019s your big day, no expense can be spared: That\u2019s why you are wearing The Row. Supple, luxurious fabric will help you feel confident and relaxed even when all eyes are on you and your bride. This tuxedo is a thing of beauty. It\u2019s retro in the best possible way, double-breasted front and peak lapels, subtle and slim-fitting. Perfection! $5,795 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nThe Black Tux Double Breasted Tuxedo If you don\u2019t have upward of $6,000 to spend, a good trick is to rent a tux from The Black Tux, which is a great service that I actually used when serving as a groomsman in my sister\u2019s wedding. The process couldn\u2019t have been easier. They even cover tailoring. But do splurge on the shirt, tie, and shoes (see above). It will help bring the rental tux up a notch. You will look great and you might even have a little cash leftover for your first house. From $125 at The Black Tux Buy\n\nIf you\u2019re just looking for some basics, might we suggest this Chris Black Starter Pack \u2014 his favorite white T-shirt, jeans, sneakers, socks, gym shorts, etc.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
