(AP) - Broncos coach Vic Fangio says he\u2019s not worried about star linebacker Von Miller, who spoke for 13 seconds and took no questions at his daily news conference.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not frustrated with his role,\u201d Fangio said Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s frustrated with where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos host Jacksonville (1-2) on Sunday still searching for their first sack, first takeaway and first victory.\n\nDating to the final two weeks of last season, Miller has tied his career-long sackless streak at five games.\n\nMiller\u2019s curt news conference on Thursday caught the Broncos\u2019 off guard and led to speculation he might be unhappy having to play more coverage or containment rather than just getting after quarterback and adding to his 98 career sacks, which are the most in the NFL since his arrival in 2011 as the No. 2 overall draft pick.\n\nFangio said he wasn\u2019t aware Miller was planning to give a statement, wave and walk off the podium.\n\n\u201cHe might be tired of answering the same questions over and over again,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it as a big deal.\u201d\n\nAlthough Miller has been melancholy at times in front of the media this season, he was in a jovial mood in the locker room Friday, joking around with teammates.\n\nFangio said his team\u2019s mood has been good at practice this week, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to paint the picture that they\u2019re OK with it, but work this week has been really, really good,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nFangio is holding out hope that DB Kareem Jackson and ILB Josey Jewell, both of whom pulled hamstrings last week at Green Bay, will be available Sunday.\n\nJewell returned to practice Friday but Jackson hasn\u2019t practiced all week and will have to run full speed over the weekend to be active against Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t play DB if you\u2019re not close to 100 percent,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got to get there.\u201d\n\nIf he can\u2019t go, Duke Dawson Jr. will make his debut at nickel back.\n\nFLAG FOOTBALL\n\nFangio said he was stumped but not surprised by the eyebrow-raising pass interference ruling in the Eagles-Packers game Thursday night.\n\nGreen Bay challenged a non-call, believing Marquez Valdes-Scantling was interfered with on a deep pass. Eagles DB Avante Maddox had his left hand jammed into the receiver\u2019s facemask as the ball was arriving, but the league ruled \u201cthere was no clear and obvious evidence\u201d that Maddox \u201csignificantly hindered\u201d Valdes-Scantling.\n\nAfter seeing that non-call stand, Fangio told reporters: \u201cYou guys will be extra light on me if you thought I should or shouldn\u2019t challenge something. You guys have seen it. What would you do? Yeah, there\u2019s obviously some disconnection there. I\u2019m not surprised about it because the whole meeting at the league meetings when all this was started was dysfunctional, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me. \u2026 It just wasn\u2019t in my opinion well thought-out, well-prepared and a little haphazard.\u201d\n\nHis boss, John Elway, sits on the NFL\u2019s competition committee, and Fangio said, \u201cJohn\u2019s as frustrated with it as anybody else.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Broncos coach Vic Fangio says he's not worried about star linebacker Von Miller, who spoke for 13 seconds and took no questions at his daily news conference.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/broncos_packers_football_06258_c0-173-4140-2586_s1770x1032.jpg?7644c65483fe720c6881cf56212e584570d07169", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
