The chief data scientist for money manager Neuberger Berman, which manages $339 billion of funds, said investors should avoid the hype of new, expensive and flashy \u201calternative\u201d datasets \u2014 a range of information derived from phones, social media and satellites \u2014 and make better use of already available materials to figure out the true value of a company.\n\n\u201cThe alpha is less in the data, it\u2019s more in what you do with it,\u201d said Recce, in an interview with MarketWatch. He previously held the role of chief data scientist at Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC and at Steve Cohen\u2019s hedge fund Point72 Asset Management.\n\nFocusing on long-term returns allows him to buy information on a delayed basis, rather than when it\u2019s first released, the period when it\u2019s valuable for short-term traders and the most expensive. Having an extended time horizon allows him to squeeze the most value from existing sources of data, such as those tracking credit card usage or even the movements of shoppers.\n\n\u201cIn the longer-term, stock prices ultimately have to reflect the true value of their businesses. On a daily basis, and on an hourly basis, there\u2019s just not going to be any indication [of this value] in\u201d a lot of the alternative data on offer, he said.\n\nSee: The explosion of \u2018alternative\u2019 data gives regular investors access to tools previously employed only by hedge funds\n\nIt\u2019s why Recce said he still finds reviews from Glassdoor useful because it helps him track signs of poor management before warning signs emerged in a company\u2019s regulatory disclosures and eventually the value of its shares.\n\nAnd even if companies try to game job reviews, Recce said there are ways to isolate authentic assessments from those manufactured by public relations teams, such as screening out shorter comments.\n\nStill, he says quant investors may want to look for sources of information that may be less prone to manipulation.\n\n\u201cIf a CEO says: I\u2019m going to have a great fourth quarter. You have to ask if he\u2019s just managing the audience. For example, how many jobs the company posts online could be a true indication of how much staff they need. You have to look at places where the data can\u2019t be spun,\u201d said Recce\n\nUltimately, he sees the future as one where money managers will combine mathematical and statistical wizardry with more old-school financial valuation knowledge to improve their stock-picking capabilities. Recce worried, however, that there were no specialist college programs that could feed Wall Street with these hybrid talents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this situation where there\u2019s a lot of incomplete information in the market simply because the general investing world doesn\u2019t know. The data is clearly there, it\u2019s not being digested. There\u2019s a lot of inefficiency in the market as a result of this lack of information processing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe future is here already \u2013 it\u2019s just not evenly distributed,\u201d added Recce, quoting science-fiction writer William Gibson.\n\nRead: The next frontier in investing is \u2018quantamental\u2019 stock picking\n\nCheck out: How oil traders are using satellites to keep an eye on an increasingly unpredictable market", "description": "Neuberger Berman\u2019s Recce says market-beating returns will come from investors who make better use of existing datasets", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU031_michae_ZG_20191025113024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
