The new discovery suggested a much greater distribution of the genus.\n\nIt was also suggested that North China be another trove of exceptionally preserved fossils, which will help researchers know more about Cambrian explosion and early life evolution, according to the research team from Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe discovery was published in the journal Geological Magazine.", "description": "Scientists have discovered well-preserved fossils of Cambrian arthropod Sidneyia in East China's Shandong province, which is believed to be the first time that the genus has been found outside of Laurentia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9c1da3a310cf3e97a00e8c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
