Squash it, smash it...just get rid of it.\n\n'In the fall, these bugs will lay egg masses with 30-50 eggs each. These are called bad bugs for a reason, don't let them take over your county next.'\n\nA fully grown spotted lanternfly measures approximately one inch (2.5cm) long and half an inch (1.25cm) wide without its wings extended.\n\nSome areas of the US already have problems with lanternflies. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture tells residents on its website: 'Kill it! Squash it, smash it...just get rid of it'\n\nThey are a combination of colours, with black and yellow on their bodies and grey, black, brown and red wings.\n\nAn important factor in predicting where the spotted lanternflies might appear next was measurements of the average temperature.\n\nPlaces where the driest quarter of the year had a temperature range between 19\u00b0F and 45\u00b0F (-7\u00b0C and 7\u00b0C) are best suited to the bugs.\n\nThe research was published in the Journal of Economic Entomology.", "description": "The US Department of Agriculture has devised a map of where the spotted lanternfly, which can destroy plants like apple trees, hops and oak trees, is most likely to spread to .", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/15/19253122-0-image-a-13_1570111521961.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
