Christian's body has not been found.\n\nAuthorities have not said what led to charges being filed at this time, but at a press conference on Friday, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell said Ferguson's arrest came after a weeks-long review of the case.\n\nChristian\u2019s mother, Theda Person, attended the news conference announcing Ferguson's arrest and told reporters she was 'totally overwhelmed' by this latest development and feeling a mix of emotions.\n\n'I knew that justice was on its way, but I\u2019m in shock,' she said. 'I feel supported and I\u2019m excited.
