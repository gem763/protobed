(Lee Jin-Man/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nPresident Trump is expected to nominate Stephen Biegun, the State Department\u2019s special representative for North Korea, to be the next deputy secretary of state, three administration officials confirmed to me. The move comes as North Korea nuclear negotiations are set to resume and the Trump administration overhauls its national security leadership for the president\u2019s fourth year in office.\n\nBiegun has served in his North Korea role under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo since August of last year. He\u2019s a well-respected foreign policy professional with decades of relevant experience in government and on Capitol Hill. Although the North Korea negotiations have been largely stalled, Biegun has maintained a vigorous schedule of traveling to partner countries to drum up diplomatic progress and sanctions enforcement. He is said by colleagues to have a good personal relationship with both Pompeo and Trump. He clashed with former national security adviser John Bolton over North Korea policy, but that\u2019s no longer an issue.\n\nNo Trump personnel decision is final until the president makes the announcement, officials warned, and the timing is still unclear. The date of current deputy secretary John Sullivan\u2019s long-expected departure is not set. Trump is considering Sullivan to be the next U.S. ambassador to Moscow. Biegun must go through a new vetting before his official nomination, followed by a Senate confirmation process. But the Senate is expected to confirm him easily if he makes it that far, considering his long relationships with lawmakers and Hill staffers. The State Department declined to comment.\n\nBiegun is expected to keep his job as Pompeo\u2019s lead negotiator with North Korea if confirmed; in fact, his promotion could increase his credibility with Pyongyang. After North Korea\u2019s last negotiating team disappeared following the failed Hanoi summit, their new counterpart to Biegun appears to be First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui.\n\nThe State Department is reportedly negotiating for a new working-level meeting, presumably between Biegun and Choe, in a third country. Biegun has long been a proponent of striking an interim agreement with Pyongyang as a steppingstone to full normalization, sometimes referred to as the \u201csmall deal.\u201d\n\nIn advance of the potential new talks, North Korea has been firing short-range ballistic missiles and increasing its demands for concessions in exchange for progress on the nuclear issue.\n\nLast month, Trump said he had received another \u201cvery beautiful letter\u201d from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Asked Monday if he planned to visit North Korea, the president said, \u201cprobably not,\u201d but didn\u2019t rule it out for the future.\n\n\u201cI would do it ... at some time in a later future, and depending on what happens I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love coming to the United States also. But, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ready for that. I think we have a ways to go yet,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for Biegun, he is another example of a member of the GOP establishment who is succeeding inside the Trump administration. During the campaign, Biegun didn\u2019t criticize Trump like many of his GOP foreign policy expert colleagues; he was working for Ford Motor Co. at the time.\n\nBut Biegun\u2019s roots in the GOP foreign policy community go way back. He was a House and then Senate staffer who worked on NATO enlargement and aid packages for Europe and former Soviet states after the Berlin Wall fell. In 1992, he moved to Moscow to open the office of the International Republican Institute, to support Russia\u2019s shift to democracy.\n\nHe worked in the George W. Bush White House and was executive secretary of the National Security Council on 9/11. In 2008, Biegun worked on the John McCain presidential campaign as the personal foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin.\n\n\u201cSteve is a consummate foreign policy professional with the political acumen to be successful in this job,\u201d said Randy Scheunemann, vice chairman of the International Republican Institute. \u201cHis selection demonstrates that they want a seasoned professional that can connect with the establishment but also holds deeply the values that make American foreign policy great.\u201d\n\nAlthough his foreign policy ideology might not align perfectly with Trump or even Pompeo, Biegun has proved himself to be a team player willing to take on tough jobs. If confirmed, his job will include helping to manage the State Department and representing Foggy Bottom at the NSC Deputies Committee meetings.\n\nWho will be leading the NSC is still an open question following Bolton\u2019s sudden departure last week. On Tuesday, Trump publicly named five finalists: Fred Fleitz, Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, Keith Kellogg, Robert O\u2019Brien and Ricky Waddell.\n\nRead more:\n\nJosh Rogin: The G-7 summit failed, and the G-7 is failing\n\nMax Boot: John Bolton was bad.
