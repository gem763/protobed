This week, the news media has relied on innuendo, speculation, unnamed sources and wishful thinking with its nonstop coverage of the Democratic Party\u2019s impeachment \u201cinquiry.\u201d The prospect of impeachment has delighted the press, which has gleefully bandied the \u201cI-word\u201d around like a magical spell this week. But journalists have been in love with the idea of impeachment anything for quite some time.\n\n\u201cTheir obsession with evicting President Trump from the White House predates his actual presidency. By November 10, 2016 \u2014 just two days after the election \u2014 television talking heads were already conjuring up theoretical scenarios in which Donald Trump could be removed from office,\u201d writes Bill D\u2019Agostino, a research analyst for Newsbusters.org who unearthed the damning video evidence of yore.\n\n\u201cSince then, TV journalists have amassed quite a repertoire of possible causes for a premature end to the Trump White House, including (but not limited to): his tax returns; his family\u2019s business dealings, both home and abroad; his firing of various cabinet officials; and of course, his tweets,\u201d he notes.\n\nThere are already impeachment ironies afoot, though.\n\n\u201cD\u2019oh! The Democrats\u2019 impeachment parade is raising lots of money \u2014 for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and other GOPers,\u201d reports Twitchy.com, while Politico points out that \u201cGOP cashes in on impeachment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the idea of impeachment is subject to interpretation. A few headlines from the last 24 hours:\n\n\u201cDemocrats fear impeachment blowback in 2020\u201d (Politico); \u201cThings are just impeachy now\u201d (PJ Media); \u201cImpeaching to the choir\u201d (The New York Post); \u201cLate night hosts react to Trump impeachment probe\u201d (The Hollywood Reporter); \u201cDoes Donald Trump want to be impeached?\u201d (The New York Times); \u201cTrump impeachment inquiry theatrics\u201d (Fox Business Network); \u201cWill there be enough votes to impeach Donald Trump?\u201d (MSNBC); \u201cWhat is impeachment and how does it work?\u201d (NBC News).\n\nRONNA SPELLS IT ALL OUT\n\nHere\u2019s a tidy summary of impeachment obsession this week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a double standard from Democrats since Day One with this president. They have refused to accept the results of the election, boycotting the inauguration, the two-year Russia hoax where the president was clearly exonerated, no collusion, no obstruction. And now this, where they rush to judgment in a knee-jerk way to bring impeachment proceedings when they haven\u2019t even read the transcript or heard from the inspector general,\u201d Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cThey are so determined to stop this president in his tracks and refute the will of the American people, they are putting our democracy at risk. I think it\u2019s something we should say \u2014 they are undermining our democracy with what they\u2019re doing, and they should be called out. We will do it in November when we send them home.\u201d\n\nCLASSIC CLIMATE PREDICTION FAILURES\n\nWhile the nation wrestles with Climate Week, one organization reveals the follies of it all.\n\n\u201cWrong again: 50 years of failed eco-pocalyptic predictions,\u201d write Myron Ebell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Center for Energy and Environment, and Steven J. Milloy, a climate scholar with the organization.\n\n\u201cModern doomsayers have been predicting climate and environmental disaster since the 1960s. They continue to do so today. None of the apocalyptic predictions with due dates as of today have come true,\u201d the pair explain.\n\n\u201cWhile such predictions have been and continue to be enthusiastically reported by a media eager for sensational headlines, the failures are typically not revisited.\u201d\n\nHere are their favorite examples, and their sources:\n\n\u201cAlready too late: Dire famine forecast by 1975\u201d (The Los Angeles Times, 1967); \u201cEveryone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam by 1989\u201d (The New York Times, 1969); \u201cScientists predicts a new ice age by 21st century\u201d (The Boston Globe, 1970); \u201cAmerica subject to water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980\u201d (Redlands Daily Facts, 1970); \u201cU.S. scientists sees new ice age coming\u201d (The Washington Post, 1971); and \u201cGreat peril to life: Gas pares away Earth\u2019s ozone\u201d (United Press International, 1974).\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFox News Channel remains the most-watched cable network of all for the 37th consecutive week according to Nielsen, attracting 2.5 million viewers, beating ESPN, which drew 2.3 million, MSNBC with 1.5 million and HGTV with 1.1 million. CNN was in seventh place with 775,000 viewers.\n\nSean Hannity remains the ratings master in the cable realm, drawing 3.4 million viewers to his prime-time show last week. In fact, presentations of \u201cHannity,\u201d \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d \u201cThe Five\u201d and \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d numbered 17 of the top 30 cable telecasts.\n\nSome other programming notes: the midday news program \u201cOutnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner\u201d outpaced ABC\u2019s \u201cStrahan and Sara\u201d throughout the week; a rare case of cable trouncing broadcast fare. Debuting on Sunday, Maria Bartiromo\u2019s one-hour investigative documentary on artificial intelligence drew 823,000 viewers and was ranked among the top-10 programs in cable news.\n\nLastly, MSNBC\u2019s prime-time \u201cClimate Change Forum\u201d attracted 1.3 million viewers \u2014 down by 27% compared to the network\u2019s normal programming at that time \u2014 and aced by the aforementioned Mr. Carlson, who garnered 2.7 million viewers in the time slot.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 50% of Democratic primary voters think Democrats will have a tougher time defeating President Trump if the party nominates a candidate who has \u201cstrongly liberal views.\u201d\n\n\u2022 50% say Democrats will have a tougher time if they nominate someone who is gay.\n\n\u2022 49% say Democrats will have a tougher time if they nominate a woman.\n\n\u2022 39% say Democrats will have a tougher time if they nominate \u201ca person of color.\u201d\n\n\u2022 35% say Democrats will have a tougher time if they nominate someone over 70.\n\n\u2022 33% say Democrats will have a tougher time if they nominate someone who is a white man over 70.\n\nSource: A Fox News poll of 504 Democratic primary voters conducted Sept. 15-17.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
