This separation of powers was designed to ensure that government does not become oppressive. As James Madison put it, combining these powers into one branch would be \u201cthe very definition of tyranny.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the three branches of government have surrendered some of their powers to an unofficial \u201cfourth branch\u201d composed of government agencies that combine legislative, executive and judicial powers. This fourth branch doesn\u2019t wield all of the government\u2019s power \u2014 the three traditional branches still function \u2014 so we don\u2019t live under tyranny in America. But as we allow unaccountable bureaucrats to accumulate more and more power, we move closer to the tyranny feared by Madison.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would consider the constitutionality of one particularly unaccountable federal agency: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB enjoys vast legislative, executive and judicial powers. And is it virtually immune from oversight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere's why this is problematic. The CFPB may prescribe rules and regulations under various consumer-protection laws; enforce conduct that it may define as \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d; and adjudicate its own enforcement actions and impose legal and equitable remedies. Right away, you\u2019ll notice by that brief description that the CFPB captures the roles and responsibilities of all three branches of government under one roof. So much for separation of powers.\n\nSo let\u2019s say your company is accused of violating a CFPB rule. The CFPB can sue you in court or \u2014 at its sole discretion \u2014 subject you to an administrative-enforcement hearing, administered by the CFPB. If you don\u2019t like the CFPB\u2019s in-house decision, you can appeal \u2014 to the CFPB\u2019s director. And only after the director\u2019s decision could you seek review in a court of law.\n\nBut the deck is stacked even then, because courts are required to defer to the CFPB\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions. The ultimate outcome of this concentration of discretionary power, together with its significant independence of the three traditional branches of government, is arbitrary and abusive government.\n\nIn wielding these vast, discretionary powers, the CFPB is largely immune from oversight by the other branches of government. For example, the agency receives funding outside the appropriations process, so it doesn\u2019t have to answer to Congress. Further, the agency is led by single \u201cdirector,\u201d who is appointed to a five-year term and cannot be removed by the president except for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office\u201d \u2014 even if the agency director carries out policies contrary to the wishes of the democratically elected president.\n\nSupporters of rule by unaccountable \u201cfourth branch\u201d agencies argue that their independence and discretionary powers insulate them from politics, which supposedly allows them to respond quickly and efficiently to the complexities of the modern world. But it\u2019s dubious, at best, to believe that government employees are immune from politics, and efficiency and convenience do not trump constitutional protections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut leaving those questions aside, imagine if we applied the arguments made by \u201cfourth branch\u201d enthusiasts to law enforcement. Imagine that the police not only could interpret or rewrite criminal statutes as they wish but also could act as prosecutor and judge. What do you think a defendant\u2019s chances of success would be?\n\nBut it gets worse. Under current Supreme Court jurisprudence, agencies are allowed to establish new rules through litigation. This means that administrative agencies can prosecute you for conduct that was previously legal.\n\nSo, imagine a cop pulls you over for driving 30 mph in a 35-mph zone. Again, the police decide to prosecute you themselves, instead of in court. At the hearing, you make the reasonable argument that you can\u2019t be guilty, since you were driving under the speed limit. No matter. The department\u2019s prosecutor argues that, upon further consideration and for the public\u2019s safety, it\u2019s too dangerous to drive over 25 mph in that zone. The department\u2019s \u201cjudge\u201d agrees, and finds you guilty.\n\nSmall businesses and individuals face the same kind of arbitrary, change-the-rules-as-you-go treatment from the CFPB. It\u2019s hard to run a business and plan for the future if you don\u2019t know what the rules are and can\u2019t predict with some reasonable certainty what they\u2019ll be next week. And if a small business happens to catch the CFPB\u2019s attention, it must defend itself in an administrative proceeding in which constitutional protections are watered down, if not ignored.\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a way forward that would help restore the federal separation of powers to its rightful place in government: The Supreme Court can put an end to the arbitrary power wielded by the CFPB \u00adand other \u201cfourth branch\u201d agencies. Pacific Legal Foundation has asked the court to do just that in a friend-of-the-court brief. By granting this case, the court can help ensure that we have \u201ca government of laws, and not of men.\u201d\n\nOliver Dunford is an attorney for Pacific Legal Foundation, which litigates nationwide to achieve court victories enforcing the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of individual liberty.
