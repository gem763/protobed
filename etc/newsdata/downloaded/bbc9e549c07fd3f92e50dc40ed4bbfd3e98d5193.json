The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe failed president singled out the following as a \u201cdanger\u201d for young people\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd I think one danger I see among young people, particularly on college campuses \u2026 and this is accelerated by social media,\u201d he explained, \u201cis this sense sometimes of, \u2018The way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people, and that\u2019s enough.'\u201d\n\nObama used the example of someone using the wrong \u201cverb,\u201d although he probably meant pronoun, meaning how people are being destroyed for referring to a biological male who thinks he\u2019s a woman as a \u201che.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong verb \u2026 then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Cause man, you see how woke I was? I called you out.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not activism,\u201d Obama added. \u201cThat\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d\n\nBefore we put a MAGA hat on President Bitter Clinger, what\u2019s important to keep in mind is that if the Fascist Woketard Movement was effective at furthering the left\u2019s agenda, does anyone doubt Obama would be all for it?\n\nListen, this guy lost a brutal re-election campaign in 2016. No, he wasn\u2019t on the ballot, but make no mistake, he was out there next to Hillary promising America a third Obama term, and lost to a man he personally despises, a man who promised to reverse Obama\u2019s entire legacy.\n\nEverything Obama spent eight years building, including ISIS *teehee,* Trump has either completely or nearly unraveled or considerably weakened, from the Iran Deal to the Paris Accords to the Obamacare mandate.\n\nUnlike his vice president, though, Obama is no dummy. He might not like everyday Americans, but he is not out of touch, and he proved that by winning two national elections by pretty safe margins.\n\nIn other words, Obama understands that one of the primary reasons Trump won was due to a backlash against increasingly stifling political correctness, which has only gotten worse while Trump has been in office.\n\nObama knows how unattractive this movement is, how it turns off most Americans, and that it plays into the hands of the political right.\n\nTo Obama\u2019s credit, though, his argument against these puritan fascists is a good one, a moral one, especially what he says at first about how their demand for purity denies the fact that good people can have honest differences, that different ideas about the world, and that ambiguities over absolutes, even flaws, do not equal PURGE THE WITCH!!!\n\nWoke is what happens when a large part of our culture rejects the Judeo-Christian ideals of tolerance, a path to redemption, and forgiveness, and instead embraces a secular religion that demands rigid conformity, celebrates intolerance of dissent, and punishes individualism and intellectual diversity.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
