We know as a team and we know as a defensive unit that we have to be solid. That we have to shut the door and be stronger.\n\n\"But when you have players like that obviously it does help as well. We're working every day in training and working on what we need to do and we'll just keep going.\n\n\"Aubameyang's very key. He's a quality striker and a lot of the players on this team are quality, so to have him at the top of the team, scoring the goals is brilliant for us.\"\n\nWhile Aubameyang's goals are a regular occurrence, the 30-year-old having scored 16 goals in his last 16 games, Chambers - who spent last season on loan at Fulham - had not hit the back of the net for Arsenal since August 2016 and felt he owed it to his team-mates after shouldering the blame for Villa's second goal.\n\n\"It is my first goal for a while and it is always nice to get it,\" he added.\n\n\"I felt like I needed to do something after their second goal and to get a goal myself was quite nice.\n\n\"I have said it (Villa's goal) came from me, my touch was poor. It sort of started from me so I felt like I had to get my head right and bring something back, and bring the team back into it. Luckily I did that.\"\n\nThe defeat leaves Villa in the bottom three having taken four points from their first six games back in the top-flight.\n\nTyrone Mings, whose error led to Chambers' equaliser, bemoaned a lack of ruthlessness from Dean Smith's side once they had taken the lead in north London.\n\n\"We were good at times on Sunday,\" he told the club's official website.\n\n\"But it feels like when we go ahead a bit of desperation creeps in. Instead, we should be tying to get another goal and really being ruthless.\n\n\"I don't know what it is at the moment, but it's something we need to change. It might be a mentality thing.\"", "description": "Calum Chambers admits Arsenal cannot continue to rely on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goals.
