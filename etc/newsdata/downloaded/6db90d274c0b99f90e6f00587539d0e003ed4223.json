When the pair entered the store, Cromartie shot Slysz twice in the head, killing him, prosecutors said.\n\nCromartie and Clark tried to open the cash register but were unsuccessful. Cromartie then took two 12-packs of Budweiser beer and the men fled, according to court papers.\n\nCromartie was arrested three days later. During the trial, Clark and Lucas testified against Cromartie. Both men pleaded guilty to lesser charges, court papers showed.\n\nCromartie has filed unsuccessful appeals with state and federal courts on several grounds since his conviction. The State Board of Pardons and Paroles in Georgia refused to stay his case and denied Cromartie clemency on Tuesday.\n\nCromartie requested the board to intervene so federal courts could rule on his request that DNA testing be done on evidence in his criminal case.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court rejected Cromartie's request for an appeal in his case in December 2018.\n\nCromartie would be the 18th inmate in the United States and the third inmate in Georgia to be executed in 2019, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "Ray Cromartie, 52, is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET (2300 GMT) at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson for the shooting death of convenience store clerk Richard Slysz in 1994.
