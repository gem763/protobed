Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made national headlines when she said, in context of referencing the socialist congresswoman\u2019s signature Green New Deal, that what planet Earth called for \u2014 that what was needed in order to save planet Earth from utter environmental devastation \u2014 was a widespread, collective, societal agreement to \u201cget rid of the babies\u201d by \u201ceating babies.\u201d\n\nCrackpot? Yes. Political plant? Apparently. A conservative group later came out and claimed the whole thing was a stunt, aimed at outing the left\u2019s radical environmentalism for what it is \u2014 radical.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Crackpot as the eat-the-babies moment was, it\u2019s not really so far off base of what the left says and does in the name of protecting the earth.\n\nThe world liberals occupy is filled with similarly crack-potted individuals who aren\u2019t putting on political shows, but who are seriously, well, crackpot.\n\nThis woman said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be here for much longer because of the climate crisis,\u201d she said, during the Queens district town hall, Fox News reported. \u201cWe only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green Deal, but it\u2019s not going to get rid of fossil fuel. It\u2019s not going to solve the problem fast enough. \u2026 So, I think your next campaign slogan needs to be this: We\u2019ve got to start eating babies.\u201d\n\nShe then pulled back her jacket to reveal a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase, \u201cSave the planet, Eat the Children.\u201d And she then wagged her finger at other town hall-goers and accused, \u201cYou\u2019re a pollutant!\u201d\n\nAnd she then wrapped by saying, \u201cJust stopping having babies just isn\u2019t enough. We need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nEven Ocasio-Cortez had to admit the woman seemed whacked. And later, a Twitter account from LaRouche PAC took credit for the stunt, saying the intent was to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBut then again, a behavioral scientist named Magnus Soderlund just argued a few weeks ago the environmental benefits of \u2014 get this \u2014 cannibalism.\n\nThe title of Soderlund\u2019s talk was, \u201cCan you Imagine Eating Human Flesh?\u201d And during it, he went on to ask, \u201cAre we humans too selfish to live sustainable? Is cannibalism the solution to food sustainability in the future?\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t being rhetorical, nor pulling a stunt.\n\nAnd in 2011, Live Science ran a piece on growing populations and dwindling food supplies \u2014 something radical Greenies attribute to climate change \u2014 that was entitled, \u201cEat the Old: Could Mass Cannibalism Solve a Future Food Shortage?\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s an even bigger travesty \u2014 an even larger look at the mental madness of the liberals on the left: Many environmentalists actually see abortion as an acceptable means of controlling the climate.\n\n\u201c[G]roups like World Wildlife Federation and Sierra Club support abortion to protect the environment from what they claim are too many people polluting the environment,\u201d Life Issues Institute wrote in September.\n\nYep. It\u2019s a real thing all right.\n\n\u201cWe cannot deny the intertwined nature of environmental and reproductive justice, or the influence reproductive justice has \u2026 on the sustainable health of the entire planet,\u201d wrote Carmen Barroso in a June, 2015, New York Times piece, while serving as a regional director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation. \u201cScientists estimate that providing voluntary family planning for those who want it cold provide up to 29 percent of needed reductions in carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nIn October that same year, Vice quoted Allison Doody, an advocate at PAI, also known as Champions of Global Reproductive Rights, as similarly drawing a direct line between abortion rights and a clean earth.\n\n\u201cReproductive health and rights are an important aspect of environmental sustainability,\u201d Doody said.\n\nMy gosh.\n\nFar leftists are so bent on saving the environment, they actually see abortion and the destruction of precious human life as A-OK.\n\nIt\u2019s actually almost believable they could suggest baby eating to save the climate.\n\nAfter all, abortion, cannibalism, baby eating, they\u2019re all part and parcel of the same leftist way of thinking of environmentalism first, humanity second \u2014 of trees and animals first; men, women and babies last.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s enough to make you implore the left: Please Democrats, please don\u2019t eat the babies.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
