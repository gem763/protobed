The square was cleared of camping protesters earlier in the week.\n\nPolice made further arrests on the adjacent street of Whitehall, where Extinction Rebellion protestors blocked the road.\n\nHundreds more protesters gathered outside the London office of News Corp to demand newspapers owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, including the Times and Sunday Times, do more to inform readers about the dangers posed by climate change.", "description": "About 150 mothers with babies and young children defied a police ban on climate protests to stage a \"nurse-in\" outside the London offices of Google on Wednesday, while activists launched a parallel protest at the premises of its subsidiary YouTube.", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441485420&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F15V", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
