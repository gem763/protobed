Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has pushed for a mandatory buyback of all assault weapons, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have both argued for a federal gun licensing system.\n\nBiden and other leading Democratic 2020 presidential contenders are set to speak at a forum in Las Vegas sponsored by the gun control groups Giffords and March For Our Lives. The forum is scheduled two years and one day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which killed 58 people at a country music festival in the city.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan, which would need to pass a potentially divided Congress, would offer a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons. Gun owners who don\u2019t want to sell their weapons could register them with the ATF under the National Firearms Act. Owners are already required to register machine guns and short-barreled rifles under the law, which the Biden campaign says limits how frequently the weapons are used in criminal activity.\n\n\u201cThe way the vice president approaches this is \u2018first things first,\u2019\u201d a Biden adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters. \u201cWe have a comprehensive plan to deal with the problem of assault weapons.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a gun violence policy forum in Iowa this summer.

He was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the existing background check system passed in 1993, and when the assault weapons ban (no longer in effect) passed in 1994. In 2014, as vice president, he served as the point person for the Obama administration\u2019s unsuccessful push for tougher gun laws following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is also proposing the creation of a task force to \u201cstudy rampant online sexual harassment, stalking, and threats, including revenge porn and deepfakes \u2014 and the connection between this harassment, mass shootings, extremism and violence against women.\u201d\n\nThe plan also takes aim at a favorite proposal of some conservatives in response to school shootings. A theoretical Biden administration would bar the use of federal funds to train teachers on how to use guns.\n\nLove HuffPost?
