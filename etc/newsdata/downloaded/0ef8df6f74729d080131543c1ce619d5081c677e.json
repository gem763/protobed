They held on under concerted pressure to lead 12-10 at halftime and 15-10 early in the second half before the United States drew level with a try to hooker Dylan Fawsitt.\n\nIosefo latched onto an offload and beat the defense to score the winning try in the 71st minute, allowing the 13th-ranked Eagles to continue a six-year winning streak over 21st-ranked Canada. The United States won 47-19 when the teams last met during this season\u2019s Pacific Nations Cup.\n\nWhile Canada was close to full strength Saturday, the United States fielded a largely second-string lineup to rest players who will likely take part in its first World Cup match. Eagles captain Blaine Scully played his 50th test.\n\nCanada opened the scoring after only four minutes when scrumhalf McRorie skirted the defense after a breakdown turnover for a try converted by flyhalf Peter Nelson,\n\nNelson scored himself in the 16th minute when Canada quickly tapped a lineout penalty. The try was closely scrutinized by the television referee before being awarded.\n\nFlyhalf Will Magie put the United States on the board with a penalty in the 22nd minute and back rower Cam Dolan touched down from an attacking scrum to cut Canada\u2019s lead to two points at halftime.\n\nNelson expanded the lead to five points with a penalty after two minutes of the second half but Canada found its lead under siege from an improved United States team.\n\nFawsitt came off the bench and almost immediately scored the try that tied the scores and after several close calls Iosefo crossed for the winning score.\n\nThe United States then had to endure considerable pressure near its own line before holding on for the win.\n\n\u201cI think we were below our best today,\u201d United States head coach Gary Gold said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed about that but really, really encouraged by the courage we showed to fight back after being 12-0 down.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important going into the Rugby World Cup if you\u2019ve got the courage to know how to win.\u201d\n\nBoth teams now head to Japan for the World Cup where Canada will face Italy in its opening pool match on Sept. 26 and the United States will play England on the same day.\n\n____\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Winger Martin Iosefo scored a match-winning try with nine minutes remaining as the United States rallied from 12-0 down to beat Canada 20-15 Saturday in the final match for both teams before the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/us_canada_rugby_17608_c0-196-3393-2174_s1770x1032.jpg?a1aaba5031dbf36e14813a9f9b16e0fc03ddda4a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
