Meanwhile, the federal government is turning to the ACCC to tackle wicked policy problems on everything from petrol to dairy to foreign exchange, supermarkets and gas. In September, the government handed\n\nThe issues we\u2019ve been given are really important...The future of telecommunications is fundamental to the future of society. \u2014 Rod Sims\n\nSims the so-called big stick: the power to ask a court to force energy companies to divest assets. As one competition insider puts it, the ACCC chairman has \u201can extraordinary amount on his plate\u201d. Or put another way, there\u2019s an awful lot happening in Sims\u2019 little wheelie suitcase.\n\n\u201cThe issues we\u2019ve been given are really important,\u201d Sims tells The Australian Financial Review Magazine, in his familiar patter, which will be repeated during his lunchtime address at the Melbourne Press Club. \u201cAustralia used to have the third-lowest-cost energy in the world, now we are almost the most expensive \u2013 some say we are the most expensive. So those electricity and gas inquiries are just fundamental. The future of telecommunications is fundamental to the future of society, as are digital platforms.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Sims who first mentions what has become, of late, his biggest claim to fame \u2013 his digital platforms inquiry, a world-first examination of the impact of Google, Facebook and other tech giants on the advertising market, traditional news outlets and journalism. The inquiry arose from a political deal struck between former senator Nick Xenophon and the government in 2017 to get laws passed that would allow for media companies to merge.\n\nTrue to form, Sims seized it with both hands and ran. He has met with regulators and political leaders from the US and Europe, and taken what many consider to be the global front foot on the issue. The Global Competition Review cited the inquiry glowingly in March, naming the ACCC Government Agency of the Year at its ninth-annual Awards Ceremony, a sort of regulatory Oscars held in Washington, DC.\n\nThe government is still mulling 22 of the ACCC\u2019s 23 recommendations for digital platforms but swiftly backed it on creating a new branch with power to peer into Facebook and Google\u2019s algorithms and test for anti-competitive or misleading conduct. Since then, Google has changed its algorithm to reward journalism that breaks news \u2013 the original report will rank higher,\n\nwhile rehashed stories will rank lower \u2013 addressing a key complaint news organisations made to the ACCC. Sims returned to the US in September to speak to global regulators in New York. He also has been asked to appear before a US House Committee, equivalent to the one that grilled Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGetting real change there is important, I think, frankly, to the future of society and democracy,\u201d Sims says. He chuckles over one cartoon that depicts the battle, with him as a tick on an 800-pound gorilla. It is the sort of fight Sims relishes, as he reveals a series of landmark cases he will soon unleash against the tech giants over privacy breaches.\n\nThe ACCC may well feel buoyed by the reaction to its digital platforms inquiry but it\u2019s still early days for its allegations that ANZ, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan entered into a criminal cartel when they hid a shortfall in a $2.5 billion capital raising for ANZ in 2015. The case is the highest profile of its kind since criminal cartel laws took force in 2009, with charges against three top bankers at Citigroup, two former bankers at Deutsche and Rick Moscati, ANZ\u2019s former treasurer. JPMorgan has obtained immunity in return for giving evidence.\n\nIn banking circles, and in the clubby world of competition lawyers, there is a sense of astonishment the ACCC, together with the Director of Public Prosecutions, opted to make this a criminal matter rather than a more-vanilla civil prosecution. Does such conduct warrant sending bankers to jail?\n\nAsked why the ACCC was nosing around in financial services \u2013 traditionally the turf of ASIC \u2013 Sims argues it\u2019s not the first application of cartel laws to the sector; in 2016, ANZ and Macquarie admitted some of their traders colluded to fix a Malaysian funding rate. \u201cPeople thought the rules around fundraising were mainly governed by the ASIC Act. We are saying \u2018Yes, but you are also subject to the competition laws\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is the commission\u2019s decision in May to block the $15 billion merger between TPG and Vodafone. The ACCC said the merger should not proceed on grounds that it would prevent billionaire David Teoh\u2019s TPG from building its own mobile network, thereby becoming a fourth operator to Vodafone, Optus and Telstra.\n\nCritics say the ACCC\u2019s thinking is fanciful \u2013 with average revenue per user plunging across the industry, only a madman would build a fourth mobile network. Instead of getting mad, Teoh has taken the ACCC to court, appealing the merger decision. And Teoh\u2019s odds appear good. In recent years, there have been six instances of companies challenging the ACCC over its refusal to approve a merger application. The score is 6-0, against the ACCC. The TPG case was still being heard when AFR Magazine went to press.\n\nIf the ACCC loses, and the scoreboard hits 7-0, many expect Sims to push for a tightening of the rules governing mergers. In the US, which uses the same \u201csubstantially lessening competition\u201d test, there is momentum to change this to \u201cmaterially lessening competition\u201d \u2013 something that would wreak havoc on many companies\u2019 merger and acquisition ambitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSims\u2019 habit of calling for law reform whenever the watchdog loses has sparked the moniker \u201cReactive Rod\u201d. It\u2019s a criticism that clearly touches a nerve. \u201cWhat I\u2019m primarily trying to do is say, 'Just how concentrated do we want the economy to be?' \u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m constantly told, 'There\u2019s not enough competition in electricity, there is not enough competition in gas, what are you doing about it?' The merger laws are crucial.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to getting the rule book changed, Sims has form. An alliance \u2013 some might see as unholy \u2013 with Barnaby Joyce and former MP Bruce Billson achieved a beefing up of the famous, and fraught, section 46 of the Competition Act, which prohibits the misuse of market power. It demonstrated Sims\u2019 significant political nous.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in Canberra,\u201d says one observer, who labels him part of the \u201cCanberra rat pack\u201d along with friends former NAB chairman and treasury secretary Ken Henry, Prime Minister and Cabinet department head Philip Gaetjens and former Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris. \u201cHe may have spent [close to] 20 years at Port Jackson Partners, but when I see Rod, I see a Canberra bureaucrat from central casting. Very comfortable in his own judgment. He\u2019s very comfortable in that environment.\u201d\n\nSims\u2019 nous for pushing for tougher laws may help explain his keen prosecution of the tech giants; he is using the zeitgeist to push for new laws over unfair practices. Those changes would not only arm him against the tech sector but also give him more scope to take on the banks, which the government is increasingly calling on the ACCC to police.\n\n\u201cWe saw this vividly in the digital platform inquiry,\u201d Sims says, \u201cwhere we identified a number of examples of conduct we considered to be detrimental to consumers and might not be effectively addressed or neatly fit under existing provisions.\u201d He points to the automatic renewal of subscriptions, platforms requiring unnecessary information and obtaining consent through long contracts most of us will never read, as examples of the gap in the law for digital players.\n\nIt is his readiness to push for new rules and regulations that sets Sims apart from his predecessor, Graeme Samuel, who was happier to let the brutal battle of competition sort things out. Competition laws, after all, are designed to protect competition itself, rather than weak players. But Sims seems driven by a concern that, in some ways, the system is broken. While he certainly believes in free markets, he also believes the post-GFC world and the Hayne royal commission have exposed a fundamental disconnect, and that explains the rise and rise of the ACCC.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there is a backlash to this disconnect where the market economy is meant to work in favour of consumers,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s why our role has grown in importance. Our role has had to increase to respond to the fact that the system is just not working as it should. Companies are not looking after their customers enough.\u201d\n\nRod Sims' father's garage in Lorne, Vic, which the ACCC chairman still calls home. Sims says his father worked \"incredibly hard\" and observers say the younger Sims shares that work ethic. Supplied\n\nFrom an early age, Rod Sims was steeped in the work ethic of small business. \u201cDad was born in Birregurra, Mum was born in Colac, grandparents were born in Winchelsea, Apollo Bay, all that area.\u201d The ACCC chairman was born and raised in Lorne, Victoria, with his three sisters. Lorne, he says, is still home.\n\n\u201cThere was a time in Apollo Bay where my grandmother ran the draper\u2019s store, my grandfather ran the bus trip from Apollo Bay to Lorne, my uncle ran the hardware store, one aunt was a real-estate agent and another a cook at the local pub. My father, with his brother, ran a general store in Lorne and then Dad set up a garage. He also ran the tow-truck company, the taxi company, so he worked incredibly hard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family later moved to Geelong but Sim\u2019s father died in a car accident when Sims was just 14, which was \u201ctough on Mum\u201d. In another tragic twist, he lost one of his three sisters when he was 27.\n\nSims\u2019 intellectual curiosity drove him to study economics at the University of Melbourne and embark on a master\u2019s degree at Australian National University, before spending a formative decade overseas focused on economic development. \u201cWhen I did economics at high school, I absolutely knew what I wanted to do. It helped me understand the world and it seemed to me this was the way to improve the world. Economics, to me, has always been the fundamental theory of public policy. It was all about \u2018What should governments do?\u2019,\u201d Sims says.\n\nFor five years, Sims worked in the Treasury Department of Papua New Guinea and ended up advising departmental secretary Mekere Morauta, who became prime minister. \u201cMy main interest was in economic development, so I wanted to work in developing countries. Where are the biggest economic problems? Where is the most poverty? It is in third-world countries.\u201d\n\nPNG is also where he met his English-born wife \u2013 international lawyer Alison Pert, a lecturer at the University of Sydney and director on the board of Opera Australia. The pair don\u2019t have children; work and public policy have been a focus of their lives. Pert\u2019s doctoral thesis on Australia\u2019s record as a good international citizen helps explain why one ACCC staffer calls the couple \u201cthe George and Amal Clooney\u201d of Australia\u2019s public policy scene. For years, the pair have hosted a pre-Christmas gathering at their Sydney home for regulators and policy wonks.\n\nSims and his English-born wife, international lawyer and Opera Australia director Alison Pert, \"the George and Amal Clooney\" of Australian public policy. Supplied\n\nAfter PNG, the young economist headed to London to work for the Commonwealth Secretariat, advising and constantly travelling to more than a dozen developing countries across Africa, south Asia and the Caribbean.\n\nHe returned to Australia in 1985 to join the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, which culminated in him working closely with Hawke as his chief economic adviser. He is just as proud of his 17 years working for Port Jackson Partners \u2013 founded by Terrey Arcus and Fred Hilmer from McKinsey. Yet he was always drawn to public-sector roles, including stints as chair of the State Rail Authority in NSW and the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of NSW.\n\nHis links to Hawke, and a role on the board of Ingeus, an international employment company founded by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Rein (Kevin Rudd\u2019s wife), make some think he's a Labor man, deep down. Asked about that, Sims says: \u201cI\u2019ve never been political in the sense that my interest is totally in public policy outcomes\u201d.\n\nWhen speaking on the record about Sims\u2019 impact, competition observers are effusive. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising the chair is seen as very powerful because competition matters involve huge disputes, the stakes are extremely large,\u201d former chairman Allan Fels says. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable the ACCC gets thrown into new areas as the economy changes and new sectors arise. You have very powerful enemies but he is very determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question of whether he is looking at the right cases will be debated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClayton Utz partner Michael Corrigan says Sims is \u201cvery articulate and capable. He\u2019s not afraid of debates and listens to people, to logical arguments, and he\u2019s prepared to change his mind.\u201d However, other competition law experts, speaking off the record, disagree. Says one lawyer who\u2019s frequently involved in merger applications, months can be spent briefing ACCC staff on a merger but once it goes to Sims, he can take a different view, making up his mind and taking an entrenched position \u201cin a nanosecond\u201d.\n\nAnother long-time observer says Sims is too obsessed with the number of industry players, just one aspect of a merger assessment. \u201cHe thinks three is better than two and four is better than three,\u201d the observer quips. Still, most agree he has set a \u201cgold standard for regulators\u201d, a feature of his enduring, and increasing, power.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s independent, has integrity, is respected and has technical nous,\u201d says another person who wants to remain anonymous. He adds that Sims is willing to litigate and lose. \u201cThe fact he is willing to have a go is what is needed by a regulator,\u201d the observer says. \u201cThe question of whether he is looking at the right cases will be debated.\u201d\n\nAn ACCC insider who works closely with Sims says he is driven by an \u201cendless intellectual curiosity\u201d. They bemoan the 2am emails staff received when, over successive years, he took their electricity and digital platforms inquiry queries with him on his annual winter break to Italy. \u201cHe treats each new inquiry or case like an athlete. He has personally taken it on himself to fix electricity prices in Australia,\u201d they say.\n\nBut for many observers, Sims is the type of roll-up-one\u2019s-sleeves person they would like to see running ASIC or APRA. The Hayne commission singled out ASIC for a failure to litigate and too great a willingness to do deals. Similarly, the Samuel review of APRA found a total lack of enforcement culture.\n\nAsked about this, Sims says the ACCC has always been a purely enforcement agency \u2013 a culture ASIC and APRA are now being asked to embrace. \u201cAPRA is a prudential entity: stop them doing it before they do it. I don\u2019t think they think of themselves as an enforcement agency. ASIC is somewhere in the middle. They have the ability to ban products, issue regulatory guides,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look at all sectors, you don\u2019t get close to any one sector. If something goes wrong, we take them to court.\u201d\n\nAfter more than four decades at the forefront of economic reform and regulation, Sims\u2019 legacy at 69 is most likely secure; however, his final few chapters remain unwritten. Some say Sims is in line to replace former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett as the next president of Hawthorn Football Club. Others say he is eager to stay on as head of the ACCC, a proposition many would resist. One competition insider warns, \u201cWhat happens in the last few years with these guys is their ego gets away from them. They start doing weird things.\u201d\n\nFormer PM Bob Hawke farewells his chief economic adviser Rod Sims (bottom right). Supplied\n\nFor Fels, that meant media being tipped off that Caltex\u2019s officers were being raided \u2013 a price-fixing investigation that ultimately went nowhere. For Samuel, it meant his scorched-earth policy of pursuing Richard Pratt for perjury. For Sims, it might mean being too ready to take companies to court. Business leaders point to the recent case launched against Medibank, which self-reported. Companies should be encouraged to come forward and work with the regulators, they argue, not blindsided by media-friendly legal action. Suing someone who dobs themselves in breaks an unwritten compact, they argue.\n\nSims says he\u2019s proud of his edict, given when he arrived in 2011, that the ACCC needed to become more comfortable losing cases as a way of testing the boundaries of the law. But if the TPG case backfires, it will stir the sentiment in the M &A club of bankers and lawyers that Sims is pushing too hard. Some argue that the ACCC needs to look internally, not call for more changes to the law. \u201cThe ACCC should not assume a loss or even a series of losses equates to a case for law reform,\u201d Minter Ellison partner Geoff Carter says.\n\nMeanwhile the ANZ case ticks away. The trial is not expected before mid-2020, yet knives are already being sharpened should the ACCC and DPP lose. The defendants are all well connected \u2013 Moscati remains in a senior role at ANZ \u2013 while Deutsche is the investment shop where Treasurer Josh Frydenberg once worked. \u201cSo many well-connected people have lost their jobs,\u201d one insider says. \u201cPeople will come after him.\u201d\n\nAll that while high electricity prices and a shortage of gas still remains critically unfinished business. And then there is the battle with the tech giants. Sims remains fearless, undaunted and even upbeat, zealous about policing competition in Australia. It\u2019s a job he sees as the culmination of his life\u2019s work.\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
