He then asked Republicans how they felt about Trump \u201csurrendering yet again\u201d to ISIS.\n\n\u201cThis is like having Bin Laden cornered in the early stages of our war in Afghanistan and letting him go,\u201d Scarborough declared. \u201cDonald Trump is actually saying we have ISIS cornered, but the Pentagon is warning us that they\u2019re coming back. And we are now going to let the most battle-hardened ISIS fighters go \u2014 \u2018not our problem.'\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHey, Marco Rubio, what do you think about that? Liz Cheney, what do you think about that? I wonder, what do these Republicans think about the fact that Donald Trump is surrendering yet again, against ISIS in Syria, his own Pentagon is saying it\u2019s trouble. His own generals are saying it\u2019s trouble. And yet, he\u2019s trusting Vladimir Putin to take care of it.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Monday, MSNBC \"Morning Joe\" host Joe Scarborough reacted to President Donald Trump announcing his intentions to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, allowing | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/scarborough-5-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
