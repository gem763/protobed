But at the moment I am the British Quiz Champion.\n\n\"It was the culmination of many many many years of hard work and I didn\u2019t think I stood a chance. But I hung on in there, didn\u2019t make many mistakes and I won by one point.\n\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve climbed an Everest. Much more so than doing it in reality.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nThe Chase star, who is getting married in December after being single for 23 years, confessed he was \"fine to be perfectly honest with you\".\n\nOn receiving his diagnosis, he said: \"It was a shock, not a massive shock because I knew that things were going wrong with my body.\n\n\"When I went to see the neurologist at the end of May, I knew the news was unlikely to be good but having started with my medication, I\u2019m just getting on with life.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nPaul also revealed how his family had inspired him to have a positive attitude.\n\n\"It\u2019s good for your health to not give up,\u201d he told Lorraine. \u201cAlso my dad didn\u2019t give up when he had a cardiac arrest in 1990, my mum didn\u2019t give up when she had breast cancer in 2008, my sister\u2019s son is severely autistic\u2026 we are a family of unwell people.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to be the one that drops out of the fight and goes, \u2018Sorry I\u2019m not quite ready for this\u2019.\n\n\"In the same way they\u2019ve all been there for me, I\u2019ve got to be there for me.\"\n\nPaul has been writing 'brutal' comedy about Parkinson's in a bid to avoid 'self-pity'.\n\nThe ITV quiz show brainbox says this novel tactic \u201chelps prevent me descending into self pity\u201d.\n\nDuring a comedy gig in Lewisham, South East London, Paul mocked his fellow Chasers and ITV bosses with scathing jokes.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPaul said: \"In 2011, I landed myself the dream job on the enduringly popular ITV quiz show The Chase.\n\n\"I am the t**t in the white suit. I have two nicknames, they are the Sinnerman and the Smiling Assassin.\n\n\"I don't mind as the other Chasers are called the Vixen, the Dark Destroyer, the Governess, the Beast.\"\n\nPaul continued: \"Anne Hegerty is called The Governess because she is bossy and cruel, and Mark Labbett is known as the Beast because he is f***ing his cousin. It is a distant cousin.\n\n\"Spare a thought for Shaun Wallace. He has been a barrister for 30 years and what do they call him? The Dark Destroyer?\n\n\"Because low level racism is still allowed on an ITV game show.\"\n\n*Lorraine airs weekdays on ITV at 8.30am", "description": "The Sinnerman spoke candidly about his future in his first TV interview since being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lorraine-TV-show-London-UK-14-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
