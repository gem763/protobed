Over the course of nearly three hours, the ten candidates exchanged blows over pivotal issues including health care, gun legislation, climate change, education and criminal justice.\n\nInterested in Democratic Party?

Add Interest\n\nAmid the multitude of topics, all eyes were focused on Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren who were facing off for the first time at the center of the stage. Despite the high stakes for two of the top-polling candidates, their matchup didn\u2019t create major fireworks, but rather continued the back-and-forth over whether Democrats should embrace a moderate party platform or move toward a more progressive stance.\n\nThe debate also featured a rare moment of unity on the heels of tragedy that took place in the border town of El Paso, Texas. Despite their differences regarding the best way to pursue gun policy reform, all of the candidates rallied around former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native.\n\nThe center stage tangle over health care\n\nThe first-time faceoff between Biden and Warren almost immediately devolved into a pile-on over health care across all wings of the debate stage. With Warren on his left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders to his right, Biden, the current top-polling front runner, was pelted with attacks on all sides.\n\nWhile Warren and Sanders questioned whether Biden\u2019s plan, which would build upon Obamacare rather than completely overhaul it, went far enough, Biden staunchly defended the former president\u2019s landmark health care bill.\n\n\u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well I\u2019m for Barack. I think Obamacare worked,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is about candor, honesty, big ideas.\u201d\n\nBiden also questioned how the two progressives flanking him on stage would pay for their plans.\n\n\u201cMy distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it,\u201d Biden said in reference to Warren\u2019s defense of a \u201cMedicare For All\u201d plan.\n\n\u201cAnd the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him halfway there,\u201d Biden added in a pivot to Sanders.\n\nBiden also argued Warren\u2019s plan would result in tax hikes for the middle class, which the Massachusetts senator didn\u2019t overtly deny. Instead, Warren took a swipe back by insisting she \u201cactually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d\n\nThe debate over \u201cMedicare For All\u201d exposed deep divides between the progressive and more moderate candidates on stage, including current Senate colleagues.\n\nSanders was put on the spot for his backing of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d by Sen. Amy Klobuchar. While Sanders claimed ownership over writing the plan, which he said would would be the most cost-effective policy for providing Americans with health care, Klobuchar insisted otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar jabbed.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nFormer colleagues face off\n\nWhile the former vice president invoked the accomplishments of President Obama on health care, he also fielded a sharp attack from one of his former administration colleagues. In a testy exchange, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro seemed to question Biden\u2019s mental fitness as he argued over the difference between automatic enrollment and opting-in for coverage.\n\nDavid J. Phillip/AP\n\n\u201cThat's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not,\u201d Castro said.\n\nAs Biden said Americans would not have to buy into coverage under his plan, Castro followed up with a claim that the former vice president contradicted himself.\n\n\u201cYou just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in,\u201d Castro shot back. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nIn fact, two minutes earlier Biden stated people would be enrolled in Medicare if they could not afford health insurance.\n\n\u201cAnyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option,\u201d Biden said, later adding, \u201cIf you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance company, from your employer, you automatically can buy into this.\u201d\n\nHarris pivots from challenging Biden to taking on Trump\n\nAfter briefly rising and falling in the polls following a headline-grabbing debate performance in June, Sen. Kamala Harris on Thursday pivoted away from the theatrics that marked her early performances and focused on targeting a rival not on the debate stage: President Trump.\n\n\u201cI have a few words for Donald Trump,\u201d Harris said, turning to speak directly to the camera. \u201cWhat you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this.\u201d\n\nThe California senator added that her campaign is focused \u201con our common issues, common hopes and desires\u201d and that she will work to unify the country and turn \u201cthe page for America.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d Harris said after calling out the president.\n\nAnd later in the debate, amid a fiery discussion on Medicare for All, Harris again used her time to address the president. \u201cAt least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign has somewhat stumbled after initially seeing a bump in polling following a blockbuster moment in the first debate when the California senator criticized Biden for his history of working with segregationists and opposing school busing.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s showing, Harris looked like a candidate trying to stretch over the primary and into a general election showdown with the president by making the case she\u2019s the most prepared to lead the Democratic Party and the country moving forward.\n\nHeidi Gutman/Walt Disney Television\n\nCandidates defend records on race, praise O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response to El Paso shooting\n\nThe issue of race in America took center stage during Thursday night\u2019s debate -- and while most of the candidates called out Trump for widening the racial divide, a number of the Democrats on stage were asked to defend their own record.\n\nABC News Correspondent Linsey Davis asked Mayor Pete Buttigieg, \u201cYou've been struggling with issues around race in your own community. You've also said that anyone who votes to re-elect President Trump is, at best, looking the other way on racism. Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?\u201d\n\nThe South Bend mayor looked to divert his response away from his record and toward Trump, saying, \u201cI believe what's deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a chance to change all of that.\u201d\n\nAnd when confronted about her record in law enforcement by Davis, Sen. Harris seemed ready to respond: \u201cI'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record.\u201d\n\nHarris went on to defend her service, promising to close private prisons and to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable. The former California attorney general added that her experience would allow her to fix the system \u201cfrom the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete,\u201d Harris said.\n\nDavid J. Phillip/AP\n\nAnother major moment: Amid the heated discussion on racial issues and gun control, candidates found a brief moment of unity Thursday night, offering support for O\u2019Rourke in his home state for his response to the recent mass shooting in El Paso which targeted Latinos.\n\n\u201cI want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. He's done a great job with that,\u201d Castro told his fellow candidate.\n\nThe former vice president also commended O\u2019Rourke for how he handled the shooting, first calling the former congressman \u201cBeto\u201d before apologizing. \u201cExcuse me for saying Beto,\" Biden said, to which O\u2019Rourke replied, \"That\u2019s all right, Beto's good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful. The look in the eyes of those people, to see those kids, to understand those parents, you understand the heartache,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAnd in one of the more passionate moments from Thursday\u2019s debate, O\u2019Rourke argued for stricter gun control by telling an emotional story of visiting with victims of the shooting.\n\n\u201cI met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa, in Midland. There weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cSo, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nButtigieg shares his personal story of coming out\n\nAll ten candidates were asked to close the debate by sharing some of their professional setbacks in order to demonstrate their ability to be resilient leaders if elected president.\n\nThe question drew a wide array of responses, including Buttigieg\u2019s personal story of coming out under the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy, before becoming an elected official in a conservative state.\n\nRobyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhen it came to professional setbacks, I\u2019d wonder whether just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life, and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently, it was an election year in my socially conservative community,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with 80% of the vote. And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated, and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning.\u201d\n\nAs the first openly gay person to run for U.S. president, Buttigieg\u2019s account offered a reminder of the historic nature of the diversity among this field of candidates.\n\nABC News' Will Steakin, MaryAlice Parks, Kendall Karson and John Verhovek contributed to this report.", "description": "Over nearly three hours, the ten candidates exchanged blows over issues including health care, gun legislation, climate change, education and criminal justice.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/democratic-debate-48-gty-jc-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
