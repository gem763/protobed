Even the aid workers don\u2019t come,\u201d said Antoine Atiou, governor of Burkina Faso\u2019s Hauts-Bassins region.\n\nThe \u201cred zone\u201d refers to the risk of jihadist attacks \u2014 a top-end warning by Western embassies to travellers wanting to visit southwest Burkina and the economic capital, Bobo-Dioulasso, once a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe impact has been brutal for local businesses. The city\u2019s hotels have emptied, its heritage sites are quiet and the souvenir shops shuttered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, hard, hard!\u2026 We haven\u2019t seen a tourist for a fortnight,\u201d said Sanou Moumouni, a guide at the city\u2019s mosque and in the historic Kibidwe district for 22 years.\n\nIn the past he could sometimes earn 100,000 CFA francs ($167, 150 euros) in two days, he said, but he has not made 5,000 francs in the last three months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m living on loans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe no longer have work because of the murderers. We\u2019re sick of it.\u201d\n\nThe north and the east of the landlocked country in West Africa endure frequent Islamist attacks, which have claimed some 600 lives in the past four years. There have also been some raids in the west.\n\nIn December 2018, an Italian man and his Canadian companion were kidnapped on the road from Bobo to the capital Ouagadougou. Last April, the Burkinabe government said it had information that the couple was still alive, but might have been taken to another country.\n\nBobo-Dioulassou itself has been relatively spared as the jihadist threat expands across poor nations of Africa\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nMinistry of tourism statistics from 2017 show that of about half a million annual visitors to Burkina Faso, fewer than 150,000 came from abroad \u2014 down 5.6 percent from 2015.\n\nThe number of nights stayed in the country by Westerners fell from 30,000 in 2012 to fewer than 15,000 in 2017. \u201cThis trend has probably sped up in 2018 and 2019,\u201d a local tour operator said.\n\n\u2013 Crafts and wonders \u2013\n\nRenowned for its traditional masks, its batik print textiles and the balafon \u2014 a West African instrument like a xylophone \u2014 Bobo attracted thousands of Western tourists.\n\nThe Lonely Planet guide, which notes the security situation currently prohibits travel, says the city\u2019s \u201ctree-lined streets exude a languid, semitropical atmosphere that makes it a favourite rest stop for travellers\u201d, adding that highlights include a \u201cthriving live-music scene and excellent restaurants\u201d.\n\nThe city itself has an array of charms, with its grand railway station, bustling market and striking Great Mosque \u2014 an undulating white-plastered mud structure studded with wooden poles that dominates the historic centre.\n\nBobo-Dioulasso is a jumping-off point to visit regional highlights like the ruined fortress of Loropeni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was also a base for exploring the Dogon country in Mali, Ivory Coast and Ghana.\n\n\u201cEveryone came through Bobo. We really were a tourist region. Now it\u2019s over,\u201d said Benjamin Ouedraogo, owner of the Watinoma hotel and president of the professional association of hotel and restaurant owners in High Basins.\n\nHe said hotels in the region only do a third of the business they did before the attacks\n\nTo avoid closing his hotel, Ouedraogo took on a second job in the building trade. \u201cWe asked for help, but state aid is a disaster,\u201d he said, explaining that the authorities rejected applications for tax rebates and preferential tariffs on water and electricity.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We subsist\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn Kibidwe, an old neighbourhood of the city near the mosque, children play in alleys and women wash clothes in the open air, but most of the shops that catered for tourists are now shut.\n\nSanon Bissiri, an artist, was quick to bring out his batik prints on spotting Western journalists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hang them every day any more, that\u2019s pointless. Since July, I haven\u2019t even sold two. All this because of those jihadists. Now I have to do masonry whenever I\u2019m wanted.\u201d\n\nBissiri used to sell his textiles to an Italian association that made regular visits.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s over. We just get by. It\u2019s my wife who meets our needs,\u201d he said. \u201cI come in to work each day on foot, six kilometres (nearly four miles). I can\u2019t afford medicine for my son with his cough.\u201d\n\nBobo\u2019s nightlife is not what it was, though the locally-brewed beer is the same.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a little activity with Burkinabe visitors,\u201d said musician Gaoussou Ben Sanou. But \u201cthere\u2019s less money, fewer dates, fewer gigs. We can\u2019t sell records\u201d.\n\nGovernor Atiou said people were reluctant to go out.\n\n\u201cAll that weighs on economic activity. Unfortunately, this is the aim of the terrorists.\u201d", "description": "Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) (AFP) \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019ve placed us in the red zone, which means the tourists aren\u2019t coming like before.
