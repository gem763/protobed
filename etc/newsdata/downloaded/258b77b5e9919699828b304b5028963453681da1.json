Episodes will air for free on PBS \u201cat some point\u201d after the episodes debut on HBO Max, Vulture reports, but WarnerMedia plans to use Sesame Street to build out its family content offerings. Sesame Street has aired on HBO since 2015 \u2014 a move that was considered controversial when the deal was struck. At HBO Max, the company is planning to launch a series of Sesame Street shows, including a live-action late-night parody hosted by Elmo. The new deal is for five years.\n\nHBO Max hasn\u2019t just scooped up first-look access to new episodes, though. WarnerMedia has also become the exclusive streaming home of Sesame Street\u2019s entire 50-season catalog. This includes episodes that have never been available to stream on demand, according to Vulture.\n\n\u201cThe cornerstone of HBO Max\u2019s extensive kids\u2019 offering.\u201d\n\nKevin Reilly, HBO Max chief content officer, told Vulture the \u201cscope of our partnership with Sesame Workshop is unprecedented,\u201d adding that it\u2019s \u201cthe cornerstone of HBO Max\u2019s extensive kids\u2019 offering.\u201d\n\nHaving children\u2019s shows is important for the streaming service, which is aimed at providing more than just prestige content for adults. HBO Max is WarnerMedia\u2019s answer to general entertainment platforms like Netflix and Hulu, and the company wants a wide variety of content aimed at various audiences. Incoming competition from Disney and Apple is a particular reason for new strategies: Disney is synonymous with kid-friendly content, and Apple has partnered with DHX Media to produce a series of originals based on Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang for its streaming platform, Apple TV Plus.\n\nThe new Sesame Street deal will go into effect in 2020, alongside the premiere of the show\u2019s 51st season. HBO Max does not have a launch date or price at this time, but it\u2019s expected to debut in spring 2020 for a minimum of $15 a month \u2014 the same cost as HBO Now.", "description": "New episodes of Sesame Street are going to stream exclusively on HBO Max as WarnerMedia shifts the popular kids show over to its upcoming streaming service.
