(Mauricio Lima/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The escalating chaos in northern Syria as Turkey presses forward with its attack on the United States\u2019 erstwhile Kurdish allies is raising fears about the fate of thousands of detainees from the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, that the Kurds have been holding in makeshift wartime prisons.\n\nWhen announcing that he had cleared the way for the Turkish military operation in northern Syria, President Donald Trump insisted that Turkey must assume responsibility for the captured Islamic State fighters and their families \u2014 then said the United States was taking custody of the most dangerous ones. But with the Pentagon preparing to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria, it is far from clear that either aspiration will happen.\n\nWhat is going on in northern Syria?\n\nThe situation is deeply complicated. Turkey has launched an invasion against Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who were the primary U.S. ally in Syria against Islamic State and who control northern Syria. Turkey has been fighting separatist Kurds inside its borders and considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists.\n\nThe presence of U.S. troops alongside the Kurds had helped to maintain a fragile peace. But since Trump told Turkey that it could begin an operation into Syria and that the United States would pull its forces back from a zone along the border, Turkey and an Arab Syrian militia have killed many Kurds \u2014 and may have deliberately fired near U.S. forces, too. On Sunday, the Pentagon announced that Trump had ordered U.S. forces out of northern Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, President Bashar Assad of Syria, backed by Russia, controls the southern part of the country and wants to retake it all. On Sunday, the Kurds apparently struck a deal with the Syrian government, but its details \u2014 and what it would mean for detainees \u2014 were not yet clear.\n\nWho are the ISIS detainees?\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces has operated an archipelago of about half a dozen ad hoc wartime detention sites for captive Islamic State fighters, ranging from former schoolhouses in towns like Ain Issa and Kobani to a former Syrian government prison at Hasaka.\n\nThe prisons hold about 11,000 men, of whom about 9,000 are locals \u2014 Syrians or Iraqis \u2014 and about 2,000 come from 50 other nations whose home governments have been reluctant to repatriate them. Scores of those men are Europeans, from countries like Belgium, Britain, France and Germany, but far more come from other nations that are part of the Muslim world, like Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen.\n\nThe Kurds also operate more than a dozen camps for families displaced by the conflict that hold tens of thousands of people, many of them non-Syrian wives and children of Islamic State fighters. These include the giant Al Hol camp about 25 miles southeast of Hasaka, where some 70,000 people have been living in increasingly dire conditions, and a camp in Ain Issa.\n\nWill ISIS members go free in the chaos?\n\nOne fear was that the Kurds are redeploying guards out of the prisons and camps to help fight the Turks, making it easier for Islamic State members to break out. On Sunday, hundreds of ISIS women and children apparently were permitted to leave a section of the displaced-persons camp in Ain Issa where they had been detained, amid Turkish airstrikes that threatened their safety. It is not clear whether any male fighters have yet escaped the prisons.\n\nThe \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d is that the Kurds are so frustrated and angered by the United States\u2019 action that \u201cthey decide to release wholesale some of the detainees,\u201d said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism on Trump\u2019s National Security Council who now heads the International Spy Museum.\n\nMight Turkey or the Assad government take custody of ISIS prisoners?\n\nThe White House said Turkey would \u201cnow be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d But Turkey has given no public sign that it has agreed to take over that headache.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Turkey has the capacity to handle securely and appropriately the detainees long held by the Syrian Kurds \u2014 and that\u2019s if Turkey even genuinely intends to try,\u201d said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama administration.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The escalating chaos in northern Syria as Turkey presses forward with its attack on the United States' erstwhile Kurdish allies is raising fears about the fate of thousands of detainees from the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, that the Kurds have been holding in makeshift wartime", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1KuURr31gu6wYHArS1ytlA--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/f4bfdd76e2af30df590eb5a91ce5c301", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
