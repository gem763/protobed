Gone were the fine lines and wrinkles, removed were the greys hairs, tossed aside were the sagging jowls.\n\nEverything was lifted, firm and beautifully toned, causing nostalgia even amongst friends and colleagues who aren\u2019t all that vain.\n\nWhile a real-life filter is (not yet) possible, there are a few wonders of the beauty world that serve a similar purpose.\n\nMen\u2019s skin can be up to 30 per cent more dense than women\u2019s, which is why we deal with greater oil production, benefit from lighter textures in our routines but also require stronger formulas that can really get right into that thicker skin.\n\nInterested in separating the poor from the powerful, we got to work testing many, many anti-ageing superheroes for men\u2019s skin that promise to pack a punch. The ones that stood out and showed your skin who\u2019s boss? All below, fellas.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

UVA & UVB rays penetrate the skin, destroying collagen, stimulating pigment and generally ruining the integrity of the epidermal barrier. That is why SPF is the crown in all anti-ageing skincare routines and Dr David Jack\u2019s is the jewel in that crown. SPF50 is combined with vitamins, minerals and hyaluronic acid to calm, support and protect \u2013 all the while gently tinting for an envy-inducing, even tone.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Ordinary matrixyl 10% + HA, \u00a39.60: The Ordinary\n\nMatrixyl is one of those words you recognise, but might not be able to place. For the last few years it has been the pinnacle of smart ageing skincare, with the first two generations \u2013 matrixes 3000 and matrixyl synthe \u20186 \u2013 combined in this formula at a concentration of 10%. Add some hyaluronic acid to that (which can draw up to 1000x its water weight into the skin) and you\u2019ve got a seriously strong serum.\n\nBuy now\n\nDrunk Elephant protini polypeptide cream: \u00a357, Space NK\n\nPeptides are the cornerstone of a good anti-ageing skincare routine, the miracle building blocks of proteins that supports the skin\u2019s natural collagen and elasticity. Millennial favourite Drunk Elephant have a heavenly, nutrient-rich cream that is as light (thanks to waterlily stem cell extract) as it is efficacious (the cream has over nine signal peptides for complete rejuvenation). If you struggle with oiliness or your skin needs some TLC after a heavy treatment, this is the one for you.\n\nBuy now\n\n111 Skin celestial black diamond lifting and firming treatment mask: \u00a340, 111 Skin\n\nA three-part (upper face, lower face and neck) mask that uses hydrogel technology and specialised blends, specific to the area they are meant for, to target lacklustre and lax skin. Having drawn a cult-following from celebrities and loved for its novelty as much as its (quite impressive) results, this is well worth adding to your routine if you\u2019ve got a spare 20 minutes or want a great selfie.\n\nBuy now\n\nGallin\u00e9e youthful serum: \u00a345, Gallin\u00e9e\n\nYouthful skin is often healthy skin, one with a strong natural microbiome (which is basically a bunch of naturally existing good bacteria). Gallin\u00e9e, leaders in the probiotic movement that has become very popular in recent years within skin, just brought out a dynamite new serum packed with probiotics, probiotics, lactic acid and fern extract all to gently cultivate your complexion. After all, a strong epidermal barrier will be less prone to sun damage, pollution and all manners of nasties that contribute to ageing.\n\nBuy now\n\nOrveda sheer brew botanical gel: \u00a3270, Orveda\n\nLight, refreshing and addictive to a fault, this intensive gel uses biotechnology to power-up its natural actives (featuring kombucha, probiotics, enzymes and glycoproteins) and saturate the skin in moisture. Purchase for the hydrating, lifting and contour effects; repurchase for the amazing way it tightens the appearance of your pores.\n\nBuy now\n\nSisley Paris firming concentrated serum: \u00a3350, Sisley Paris\n\nSpeaking of strong serums, Sisley\u2019s latest innovation is pretty damn potent (and damn expensive, to boot). A mixture of the brands classic phyto-complex with a few unusual botanical extracts help to reactivate dormant enzymes in the skins structure to combat the loss of elastin production, all the while brightening, hydrating and nourishing to the nines. As luxurious multitaskers go, this is a great one.\n\nBuy now\n\nCeraVe facial moisturising lotion: \u00a311.99, Superdrug\n\nA fascinating brand that combines ceramides (hence the Cera) and a clever delivery system called multivesicular emulsion technology that releases ingredients over a 24 hour period (hence the Ve), CeraVe have become to go-to in pharmacy skincare aisles worldwide. Ceramides basically make up all the fats composed in the upper layers of the skin, totally 50 per cent of the skins entire composition. When they are not working their best, that is when elasticity, collagen and proteins all decrease and ageing ensues. Slap on a bit of this and it will help hold back the clock, all while giving you a gorgeous glow.\n\nBuy now\n\nTata Harper elixir vitae eye serum: \u00a3257, Cult Beauty\n\nEyes are one of the first things to show your age, so it is fairly important you treat them with respect. We blink over 30,000 times a day; that kind of movement will damage anything, let alone the fragile skin around the periorbital region. Part of her \u201csupernaturals 2.0\u201d collection, this formula contains 63 high-performance ingredients that include a quadruple neuropeptide technology and enzymes for a complete bioactive experience. Expect brighter, smoother and totally enticing eyes.\n\nBuy now\n\nAllies of Skin vitamin C 35% collagen rebuilding serum: \u00a3108, Face Gym\n\nOne of the few antioxidants that can create a protective shield against photoaging damage (a fancy way of saying UV exposure), vitamin C has had its time in the metaphorical sun for some time now. While most formulas sit around 5-15 per cent, Allies of Skin has literally doubled the norm by bringing it up to 35 per cent. At this level, the miracle ingredient can help repair the skin at an almost cellular level, all while boosting collagen production and upping brightness. If your skin doesn\u2019t run on the sensitive side, give this a go for some seriously sensational results.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Men's skincare products\n\nThe reality is nothing will do for you what a good sunscreen can \u2013 after all, these products are meant to treat rather than prevent. A solid SPF, one loaded with vitamins and without that horrific tacky texture you see in so many, is key \u2013 so we\u2019ve got to go for Dr David Jack's all day long as the winner here. Following that (for those of us who can\u2019t resist the lures of the sun) the luxury, efficacy and ethics of Orveda\u2019s sheer brew botanical gel is nothing short of a youth-filter in a tub \u2013 a very chic tub, at that.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
