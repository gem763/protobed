Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\n1. Haka provides ultimate drama\n\nThe tone was set for the most spectacular theatre in sport as England faced up to New Zealand\u2019s haka.\n\nThe intensity of the moment, a gripping one made all the more compelling when England formed a V-formation in response.\n\nThe grin from Owen Farrell displayed composure and confidence ahead of an almighty battle. It framed the contest perfectly, ensuring the excitement spilled over just as the first whistle sounded.\n\n2. Fast start leaves All Blacks reeling\n\nEddie Jones\u2019s side stormed out of the blocks with a sensational 98-second spell of possession that left the All Blacks in a deep, thought-provoking huddle after conceding the lead..\n\nMagnificent offloads denied the All Blacks a chance to reset, with Kyle Sinckler and Courtney Lawes involved in the sweeping move.\n\nA bulldozer-like finish from Manu Tuilagi forced a regroup from the champions, who were forced into a sloppy start, including George Bridge\u2019s clumsy kick. This was the ideal start for England.\n\n3. High stakes match hinges on TMO decisions\n\nA game of fine margins with England surging into an early lead could not help but attract controversy and deep discussion on the TMO\u2019s decisions.\n\nFirst it was Sam Underhill, whose jubilation was rightfully short-lived. Tom Curry acted as the decoy runner, denying Sam Whitelock the chance to get to Kyle Sinckler, who utilised the basketball-like pick play to feed Underhill.\n\nThen it was Ben Youngs in the second half, another score chalked off for England, though this one was more controversial and only overturned after a microscopic spot. Nigel Owens carefully explained the ball was nudged forward in the maul, delivering a cruel blow to England.\n\nThough they would later receive a reprieve despite a stern examination from the TMO; Henry Slade\u2019s shoulder charge on Sevu Reece was deemed fair enough, despite suspicion that he may have wrapped his arm in the tackle.\n\n4. England\u2019s irrepressible fight\n\nNew Zealand were supposed to emerge for the second half like a wounded animal. England had rocked and out-rucked, even out-leapt at the line-outs Steve Hansen\u2019s side had so pointedly targeted. For each inch that Eddie Jones\u2019 side played brilliantly, they had strangled the myth of the All Blacks far from reality.\n\nBut, when the inevitable fightback came, an early charge, a quick cycling through the backline that had until then been so deflated, England acted so quickly to extinguish it. Ben Youngs cunningly won a penalty off Sam Whitelock, only for Elliot Daly\u2019s long-range kick to slice wide off the posts and leave a lingering doubt. Youngs then bundled over the tryline, only for a microscopic forward pass in the maul to suck the life out of England\u2019s roaring celebrations. Every minute closer to victory came with a caveat, but even after Ardie Savea crossed the line and the All Blacks finally stirred a true wave of momentum, England\u2019s resistance was impenetrable and united from the first minute until the last.\n\n5. England stands at gates of history\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since England last reached the final, 12 years since New Zealand started to lose. The nerves should have been on the other foot. Yet, as the match reached its conclusion and the gates of history opened, it was the All Blacks, the world\u2019s most certain side, who panicked, whose hands betrayed them, who saw the 100-plus-cap experience of Whitelock slap out at Farrell.\n\nEveryone believed England would crumble in the face of this adversity, but the fall never came and now, surely, after dethroning the champions, they are ready to carve an era of their own.", "description": "England\u00a0stunned\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0with a gruelling 19-7 victory in Yokohama to advance to the final of the\u00a0Rugby World Cup.
