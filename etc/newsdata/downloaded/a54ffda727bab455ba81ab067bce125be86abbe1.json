Then I tried to figure out how my credit card let companies buy me.\n\nYou might think my 29-cent swipe at Target would be just between me and my bank. Heavens, no. My banana generated data that\u2019s probably worth more than the banana itself. It ended up with marketers, Target, Amazon, Google and hedge funds, to name a few.\n\nOh, the places a banana will go in the sprawling card-data economy. Despite a federal privacy law covering cards, I found that six types of businesses could mine and share elements of my purchase, multiplied untold times by other companies they might have passed it to. Credit cards are a spy in your wallet \u2014 and it\u2019s time that we add privacy, alongside rewards and rates, to how we evaluate them.\n\n\n\nTech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler tracked the same purchase at Target with two kinds of credit cards: the Chase Amazon Prime Rewards Visa and the Apple Card. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nApple, branching out from gadgets, just began offering a needed alternative. The new Apple Card\u2019s best attribute is privacy (though the fashion faux pas of its white titanium has gotten more attention). Apple restrains bank partner Goldman Sachs from selling or sharing your data with marketers. But the Apple Card, which runs on the Mastercard network, doesn\u2019t introduce much new technology to protect you from a lot of other hands grabbing at the till.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler on all the entities with access to your credit card data. 'The devil\u2019s in the defaults.']\n\nWith my banana test \u2014 two bananas, one purchased with the popular Chase Amazon Prime Rewards Visa and the other with Apple\u2019s Mastercard \u2014 I hoped to uncover the secret life of my credit card data. But in this murky industry, I was only partly successful. Unlike my other recent technology experiments, such as watching what my iPhone does while I sleep, I couldn\u2019t hack into my cards to follow the data.\n\nInstead, I asked insiders and privacy advocates to help identify the types of companies that had given themselves access to my swipe for purposes unrelated to payment and preventing fraud. \u201cWhere does it end? Nobody really knows,\u201d says Ted Rossman, an analyst at comparison site CreditCards.com.\n\nI pored over these companies\u2019 privacy policies. Then I asked more than two dozen to get specific about what they actually do with our transactions. What data are they sharing and with whom?\n\nSome didn\u2019t answer. Others sent me to a Bermuda Triangle of legalese where few straight answers escaped alive. In 2019, it\u2019s hard to trust companies that don\u2019t think they owe us clarity about data.\n\n[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]\n\nWhat I learned: The card data business is booming for advertisers, for aiding investors and for helping retailers and banks encourage more spending. And there are many ways a card swipe can be exploited that don\u2019t always require a transaction being \u201csold\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d in a way that fully identifies you. Data can be aggregated, anonymized, hashed or pseudonymized (given a new name), or used to target you without ever technically changing hands.\n\nWhat\u2019s the harm? We\u2019re legally protected from fraudulent charges and unfair lending practices. But spending patterns can reveal lots \u2014 possibly enough to blackmail you. Anytime data passes to new hands, there\u2019s another chance it could get stolen. (Witness: Equifax.)\n\nAnd card data surely helps businesses but can put consumers at a relative disadvantage. \u201cThe more they know they know about you, the more opportunities there are for manipulation,\u201d says Chris Hoofnagle, a law and information professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Data can be used to model behaviors, such as figuring out exactly how many price hikes or awful experiences customers will put up with before bolting.\n\nPeople can have different views on whether it\u2019s worth exchanging data for airline miles or cash back. But how are we supposed to make informed decisions when we don\u2019t know where our data is going?\n\nSo who all can track, mine or share your transactions? Where does the Apple Card help? Let\u2019s unravel the six kinds of companies that sold me out. It\u2019s bananas.\n\n\n\nFor our privacy experiment, we bought two bananas at Target. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\n1) The bank\n\nWhen I swiped my cards, of course my banks received data. What\u2019s surprising is who they can share it with. My data helped identify me to Chase\u2019s marketing partners, who send me junk mail. Some data even got fed to retail giant Amazon because it co-branded my card.\n\nBanks have long been required to report suspicious transactions to the government. But the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also allows banks to share personally identifiable data with companies. They just have to send a privacy notice and give you the right to opt out. (More on opting out below.)\n\nWhen I used my Visa, Chase\u2019s privacy statement reserves the right to share my data for seven different kinds of reasons. The most appalling category is: \u201cFor nonaffiliates to market to you.\u201d Who are \u201cnonaffiliates?\u201d Whoever the bank darned well wants. The term just means a company not owned by Chase.\n\nChase would not tell me the specific data it shared from my card or the companies it shared it with. Instead, spokeswoman Patricia Wexler listed kinds of data Chase doesn\u2019t share \u2014 including \u201cpersonalized transaction level data.\u201d But that leaves room for lots of uses. Chase, for example, opts us in to receiving offers from partner companies based on our spending habits.\n\n\n\nMost banks format privacy statements on a page they mail you labeled \u201cFACTS.\u201d A chart lists many kinds of organizations the bank might potentially share your data with \u2014 and where you have the ability to opt out. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nThis is where the Apple Card is different. In the Goldman Sachs privacy statement, its answer to most kinds of sharing is \u201cno.\u201d Goldman still shares information with credit agencies about whether you pay your bills. But it says it doesn\u2019t feed transactions to marketers or a sister company that mines card data.\n\nCo-branded card partners get a piece of the action, too. Of course Amazon receives data when you buy products on Amazon with its card. What about other purchases? Chase says it shares information with co-brand partners \u201cat a high level only \u2014 not specific details around which merchant, and not specific items purchased,\u201d but Wexler declined to be specific. Amazon also wouldn\u2019t say exactly what it receives. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAs a co-branded partner, Apple says it can\u2019t access data about your transactions outside Apple. The details of your purchases, visible in the Wallet app, are encrypted so Apple can\u2019t see them.\n\n2) The card network\n\nThis is where Apple\u2019s advantage starts to fade. Once my banana purchase passed to card networks run by Visa and Mastercard, either might have shared them \u2014 in an anonymized form \u2014 with businesses including tourism bureaus, Google and more.\n\nThe networks, whose main business is connecting banks, have side gigs in aggregating purchases and selling them as \u201cdata insights.\u201d Visa said it allows clients to see data on populations as small as 50 people, often tied to groups in Zip codes. Mastercard wouldn\u2019t disclose its minimum group size.\n\n[An Equifax hack settlement promises a $125 payout. The truth is more complicated.]\n\nOne Mastercard program particularly irks privacy advocates. Bloomberg has reported that data from millions of Mastercards \u2014 now likely including Apple Cards \u2014 ends up helping Google track retail sales. Data goes into a double-blind system that lets the Web giant link ads people have seen back to purchases they\u2019ve made in the real world. A person familiar with the matter, who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak about it, confirmed the deal to me.\n\nThe firms wouldn\u2019t acknowledge the specific program but emphasize Mastercard scrubs identifiable information. Mastercard spokesman Jim Issokson said, \u201cMastercard is not sharing any data or insights for ad measurement purposes to any of the tech giants.\u201d Google spokeswoman Anaik von der Weid said, \u201cWe have developed advanced, privacy protective technology in this area, precisely to avoid the sharing of personal information.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Apple Card doesn't provide much more protection from retailer data gathering and sharing than other credit cards. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\n3) The store\n\nTo Target, my credit card acted as a kind of ID \u2014 each swipe helps build a \u201cguest profile\u201d about me. That\u2019s useful for learning my habits, targeting me with ads on Facebook and sharing information about me with others. It made no difference whether I paid with the Chase Visa or Apple Card.\n\nTarget says it does not \u201csell\u201d our data. But its privacy policy grants it the right to \u201cshare your personal information with other companies\u201d who \u201cmay use the information we share to provide special offers and opportunities to you.\u201d\n\nWho are these companies: Marketers? Data brokers? Other retailers? Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck wouldn\u2019t say.\n\nWhat specifically does Target share? That \u201cvaries,\u201d Reck said but added, \u201cWe provide aggregated, de-identified information whenever possible.\u201d\n\n4) Point-of-sale systems and retailer banks\n\nThe tech that helps stores track us often comes from card-swipe machines and the merchant banks that process transactions for them. Those firms gain access to your name, card number and other details and often reserve rights to share data in some form. What are they doing with it?\n\nThis is where my data trail gets particularly murky. Target wouldn\u2019t say who its so-called acquiring bank is or what restrictions it places on it.\n\nTarget also wouldn\u2019t say what data restrictions it puts on the company that makes its swipe terminals, Verifone. That company didn\u2019t answer my emails.\n\nAn experience you might have had at a coffee shop shows what\u2019s possible. Ever swipe your card and the terminal already knows the phone number or email to send a receipt? That\u2019s because the system has linked your card to a profile \u2014 and you\u2019ve volunteered those details before.\n\nSquare, one maker of those systems, says it does not \u201csell\u201d that data. But it does pass an email or phone number we enter for receipts back to the merchant. And it shares aggregated data about purchases with organizations including trade groups.\n\n5) Mobile wallets\n\nI paid for my bananas with physical cards, but smartphone-payment systems introduce even more hands on transactions. Apps can access and store not only what you buy but also where you go.\n\nGoogle Pay for Android stores transactions in your Google account. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow advertisers to target you based on that data. But Google Pay\u2019s default privacy settings, which you can adjust, grant it rights to use your personal information to allow Google companies to market to you.\n\nThe Samsung Pay app has details from your past 20 transactions, though the company says the information isn\u2019t stored on its servers. The app also delivers location-based promotions.\n\nApple says it doesn\u2019t retain transaction information \u201cthat can be tied back to you\u201d when you use Apple Pay.\n\n6) Financial apps\n\nMany free financial services are after your data. Intuit\u2019s Mint, which lets you track all your accounts in one place, uses your data to market to you in its app. Financial software maker Yodlee sells de-identified data from customers to market research firms, retailers and investors.\n\nYour email might also be a mole. Anytime you receive a receipt in Gmail, Google adds to it to a purchases database. Google says it doesn\u2019t use the contents of Gmail to target ads, but that leaves open other uses.\n\n\n\nThe Apple Card helped protect our banana purchase from some snooping but not all of it. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nOpting out\n\nIf you care about privacy, there are steps you can take to better protect your life as a consumer \u2014 but it\u2019s patchwork.\n\nPerhaps it goes without saying, but you could pay with cash. That won\u2019t help if you swipe a loyalty card ... or once businesses start using facial recognition.\n\nI plan to continue using the Apple Card, even though its rewards aren\u2019t as good as other cards. Its contracts with Goldman protect you from some bank surveillance capitalism. Apple Card also doesn\u2019t work with nosy apps like Mint \u2014 you have to access your account details through the app on your iPhone.\n\nBut I\u2019m disappointed Apple didn\u2019t build new kinds of privacy technology to help counteract all the other categories of companies using each swipe. For example, the card offered by a start-up called Privacy uses a different number for each (online only) transaction so you can\u2019t be as easily tracked.\n\n[Help Desk: How to fight the spies in your Chrome browser]\n\nBy law, credit card companies give us ways to opt out of some of their data sharing, though sharing with other financial institutions and joint-marketing partners is usually exempt. Chase and American Express have online forms you can fill out. To opt out with Citibank you have to call 888-214-0017; for Discover call 800-225-5202.\n\nThrough online forms, you can also opt out of the data-sharing programs with Visa and Mastercard. (Anyone with an Apple Card will need to do this to bolster their privacy.)\n\nEven some stores offer an out. Target says customers can call 800-440-0680 and ask to be removed from having personal information shared for marketing.\n\nMany of these companies say giving us these \u201cchoices\u201d is sufficient. That\u2019s nonsense. With data, the devil is in the defaults \u2014 companies know a vanishingly small number of people will ever adjust settings. And how can we exercise a choice if we don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening with our data?\n\nThe recent headlines about Facebook and Equifax opened a lot more eyes to how privacy affects our lives in unforeseen ways. Other businesses should take that as a warning: Data is the new corporate social responsibility.\n\nIf a company wants our trust, it\u2019s no longer good enough to say, \u201cWe care about your privacy,\u201d and point to some legalese.
