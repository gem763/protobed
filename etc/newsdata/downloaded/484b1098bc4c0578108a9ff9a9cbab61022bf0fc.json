The deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the U.S also created a challenge balancing safety with a desire to be welcoming.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRabbi Marc Schneier, founding senior rabbi of the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., said the shooting served as \u201cthe wake-up call to a new reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that the massacre that took place in Pittsburgh \u2014 that will be seen as the benchmark in how synagogue security has changed for the American Jewish community,\u201d he said.\n\nSchneier said his synagogue has \u201cexponentially\u201d increased its security force.\n\nSome smaller synagogues in Pittsburgh have taken other precautions in response to last year's attack.\n\nRabbi Chuck Diamond, who once worked at Tree of Life, said he no longer lists the addresses of his synagogue\u2019s services online.\n\n\u201cIt's certainly on all of our minds,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cAnd it's something you never get over. It becomes part of the fabric of your community.\u201d\n\nOne organization that has seen a measurable change since the Tree of Life shooting is the Secure Community Network \u2014 a nonprofit dedicated to security initiatives for the U.S. Jewish community.\n\nThe group said it has seen a significant increase in requests for security assessments and training in the wake of the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the U.S. In the 10 months before the Tree of Life shooting it received about 500 requests for assistance; in the subsequent 11, it received 3,000 requests.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offers a grant to nonprofits, including Jewish institutions like schools and synagogues, to enhance their security. The funding administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has jumped from $13 million in 2014 to $60 million in 2019.\n\nThe grants provide funding for security equipment, security exercises, and training for security personnel and nonprofit staff. As of June, the grant was expanded to fund contracted security personnel and training for nonprofit members, congregants and volunteers.\n\nSens.

So not every institution that applies gets funding.\u201d\n\nThe number of applications FEMA received for grants more than doubled from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019. Out of 2,037 applications this past fiscal year requesting a total of almost $140 million, more than 35 percent of applications were awarded funds, a FEMA spokesperson said.\n\nBut the Pittsburgh shooting was not the only deadly attack against the U.S. Jewish community in the past year. A shooter killed one person and injured three others in April at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California during a Passover service.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported 1,879 anti-Semitic attacks in 2018, the third-highest recorded year since record-keeping began in 1970. The FBI reported a 37 percent increase in hate crimes against Jews from 2016 to 2017, the most recent data available.\n\nThe Tree of Life shooter is facing 63 federal charges and the death penalty. Prosecutors recently rejected his offer to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence without release.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that people are scared, or they choose not to walk into our houses of worship out of fear,\u201d said Michael Masters, national director and CEO of the Secure Community Network. \u201cThen fundamentally, not just as a Jewish community, but as an American community, we lose some of who we are in terms of our values as an open, free democratic society.\"", "description": "Synagogues and other Jewish institutions across the U.S. have spent the past year implementing new security measures following the 2018 Tree of Life shooting in Pittsburgh that left 11 people dead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/synagoguesecurity_110218getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
