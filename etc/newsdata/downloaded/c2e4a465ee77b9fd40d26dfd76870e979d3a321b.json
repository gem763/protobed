He originally pleaded not guilty but changed his plea to \u201cnot criminally responsible,\u201d claiming that he did not have the \u201ccapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct,\u201d Maryland\u2019s equivalent of the insanity plea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, he pleaded guilty. Some experts speculate that doing so will limit the salience of the gory details of the killings going forward to the jury\u2019s consideration of his state of mind when he committed the slayings.\n\nHe has been examined by a state health department psychiatrist \u2014 who found Ramos legally sane \u2014 and mental health \u201cexperts\u201d for the defense who will argue that he is \u201cnot criminally responsible.\u201d\n\nRamos\u2019s entered plea is based on the claim that \u201cat the time of the conduct alleged in the above captioned case, the Defendant, because of a mental disorder, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, and/or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is hard to imagine a case that comprises more conscious criminal intent than the mass murder of Capital Gazette employees Rob Hiaasen, Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Gerald Fischman and John McNamara.\n\nAD\n\nThe accused, Ramos, had, as the prosecution alleges, carefully planned the attack: He had smoke grenades and a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and barricaded the rear exit of the office to prevent people from escaping. Many mass murderers do not plan such attacks so cruelly and methodically. Also, after he perpetrated the killings, he hid under a desk at the Capital Gazette office, demonstrating that he knew the act was wrong and that people would be searching to catch him.\n\nRamos\u2019s premeditation, or malice aforethought, is manifest also through time. Years ago, he had filed a losing defamation lawsuit against the Capital Gazette and had sent threats against the paper through letters and social media.\n\nAD\n\nMany people understand that there are always selected psychiatrists who are available for hire to testify as expert witnesses that an accused criminal is sufficiently mentally ill or unable to conform his or her behavior to the requirements of the law that he or she should not be held responsible for crimes. But critics have long recognized, through psychiatric mystification masquerading as medical analysis, that psychiatric testimony can convince jurors that even someone who hates someone, announces it publicly and then tries to kill that person may be successfully labeled as criminally insane.\n\nAD\n\nWhen that happens, the killer is remanded to a psychiatric institution and released as soon as the psychiatric authorities administering care convince the judge that the accused is safe to release.\n\nLet\u2019s hope in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court that Judge Laura S. Ripken and the jury hearing the case have more sophistication than that which would allow such a travesty of justice. Ramos, having now pleaded guilty to the killings, is banking on the success of his fraudulent insanity plea. It\u2019s up to the jury to decide if he is criminally responsible.\n\nThe writer is a professor of rhetoric at Towson University, specializing in political and psychiatric rhetoric, and psychology editor of USA Today Magazine.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Jarrod Ramos wants a jury to think he was not criminally responsible.", "authors": ["Richard E.
