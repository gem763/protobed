Growth remains very much on the agenda.\n\n\u201cFive years ago it was very much a skew towards old industrial and perhaps the banks. This year we see much more of a focus on tech, fintech and Asia export stories.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s boardrooms are sensing the market\u2019s growth orientation and becoming more confident in their own prospects.\n\nThis shift also reflects the fact that Australia now has more globally relevant tech companies for investors to talk to, including Appen and Afterpay, both of whom Citi has raised capital for this year.\n\nBut what\u2019s more interesting is that McLean\u2019s sense that Australia\u2019s boardrooms are sensing the market\u2019s growth orientation and becoming more confident in their own prospects.\n\nThis is manifesting in some companies starting to make selected acquisitions offshore, or at least examine them more closely. But it\u2019s also shown in the way some boards have rejected approaches from private equity, and shown a willingness to defend value.\n\nNotably, McLean believes the growth orientation is starting to translate into firms reducing the hurdle rates they will target for deals \u2013 many, including the Reserve Bank, have argued that boards have held these too high for too long given just how low bond yields have fallen.\n\nTo be clear, McLean emphasises there is \u201can appropriate level of caution around making big investment decisions\u201d. And, after the franking credits fight during the federal election, there is also a renewed sense of how highly investors value their dividends.\n\nBut even if it\u2019s early days, the tilt towards growth is welcome news \u2013 for investment bankers of course, but also for an economy that could badly do with more in the way of animal spirits.", "description": "There's a fascinating juxtaposition between capital raisings by Latitude Financial and RFG.
