That said, the \u201cD2\u201d community is well aware that there\u2019s a quicker way for their characters to reach the 900-power level provided that they have to spend some real-world cash. However, it may well seem that some players have found another way to reach that without the $20 splurge.\n\nPower up to 900 minus the $20\n\nReddit user u/AWellPlacedYeet recently made a post over on the game\u2019s subreddit telling fellow players not to pay the said amount just to get to what they call a soft cap level. The OP claims that there\u2019s an easy method for their secondary characters to reach 900 power without even spending a buck.\n\nPer the OP\u2019s post, if you have a character that has already surpassed the 900-power level mark, you can now equip your highest weapons on your secondary character.\n\nPlayers then need to head over to their collections and keep reacquiring the leveling gear until they need to get every piece of the set to bump them up to a higher level (it does not require a specific one, just pick any of the gear).\n\nOther members of the sub pointed out, however, that it\u2019s also best to hold off on claiming any of the season gear until it helps players since these \u201clevel with their characters.\u201d The OP was also reminded that the game checks at both character and inventory of every player to determine their highest level.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Per the datamined intel, it consists of two UI icons. One having the Taken King symbol, while the other is Fallen-themed.\n\nThe OP further explained that both match the Shattered Throne icon which designates a dungeon.\n\nHe added that Oryx\u2019s symbol showing up for Season 8\u2019s dungeon would be making sense since the lore around attempts to revive either him or summon his nightmare version.\n\nThe other icon seems to hint at a possible Fallen dungeon in the future. Zenthon added that this could mean that the dungeon is dealing with Variks who has been trying to rebuild the House of Judgment and lead the Eliksni reunification, competing with Mithrax and the Devils.", "description": "'Destiny 2' players have found a way to level up their secondary characters without paying $20.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Jane Flowers", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic E.
