The NFL star then did what came naturally, and plucked it out of the air with a fantastic one-handed catch.\n\nThe catch impressed everyone in the stands, who gave Howard a huge ovation, and earned the respect of the commentators in the booth, who initially weren't aware of Howard's sporting credentials.\n\nOJ Howard may be better at catching baseballs than footballs. pic.twitter.com/gkx9uiZDGs \u2014 Live Easy Sports (@LiveEasySports) October 9, 2019\n\nAn eagle-eyed producer did recognize the Tampa Bay star, however, and relayed the information to the commentators, who duly acknowledged the NFL athlete's remarkable one-handed catch.\n\nHis job may be to block pass rushers and claim short-range catches across the middle, but it's unlikely Howard will claim a better, or more spectacular, catch all season.", "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end OJ Howard produced an incredible one-handed catch in the crowd to snag a foul ball during the Houston-Tampa MLB playoff game on Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9e008c2030275b250a82e2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
