Xiaomi says the Mi Mix Alpha's screen would be made of sapphire glass, which is extremely scratch-resistant.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nChinese tech giant Xiaomi just revealed on Tuesday a new 5G concept smartphone called the Mi Mix Alpha. It has a screen that wraps almost all the way around the phone, and it looks utterly incredible.\n\nThe only thing preventing the screen from wrapping around the phone entirely is a thin ceramic strip along the back where the Mi Mix Alpha's triple-lens camera system is seated.\n\nThe Mi Mix Alpha doesn't look like a phone you'd ever want to put down on any surface for the fear of scratching it. But that's fine, because it's just a concept that no one can buy or use right now.\n\nHowever, Xiaomi appears to have thought of that, even for the concept. The company said the Mi Mix Alpha's glass is 2.88g sapphire. To be honest, I'm not sure that that means, but I do know that sapphire is designed to be extremely scratch-resistant.\n\nOh, and the Mi Mix Alpha's frame would be made of \"TC4 aerospace-grade titanium alloy\" that Xiaomi says is three times as strong as steel. Casual.\n\nThere's no telling how much this marvel costs, or even if it'll ever make it to store shelves. After all, Xiaomi itself said it's a concept. Either way, it should be a hint to all smartphone makers for what to do in the next few years. I am ready for it.\n\nCheck out the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha:", "description": "The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is only a concept, but the company even adresses your concerns about the screen's scratch-resistance.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a403b2e22af05a65012b8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
