Backed by improving sales prospects, its stock has so far surged about 50%, massively outperforming other big names, such as Google (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).\n\nBut that strong rally, which began in August, will face its first big test today when the maker of popular iPhones releases its fiscal 2019, fourth-quarter .\n\nApple Monthly Chart\n\nThe consensus revenue forecast shows that the majority of analysts have quickly adjusted their view about Apple, which had appeared for some time to be facing a grim outlook \u2014 hurt by its maturing iPhone business as users held on to their older versions and expensive models failed to gain much traction. iPhones make up about 50% of the company\u2019s total sales.\n\nGame-Changer iPhone 11\n\nBut a pessimistic case against Apple \u2014 in which the company loses its market share too quickly \u2014 isn\u2019t looking credible after the company\u2019s successful launch of the iPhone 11 last month. Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates for iPhone shipments in Apple\u2019s current fiscal year have increased by 3 million units as analysts factor in the strong reception the new models have received since they went on sale on Sept. 20, according to FactSet.\n\nBesides the iPhone, there are other positive developments that also helped remove some of the uncertainty that gripped Apple stock early this year. The U.S. and China, for example, have shown considerable progress toward resolving their trade dispute, and the two countries are likely to sign the first-phase of their pact next month. Apple has a huge stake in China where it maintains a vast network of suppliers. The company also sells a great number of cellphones to consumers in China, the most populous nation in the world.\n\nThe other catalyst fueling optimism is CEO Tim Cook\u2019s success in generating a sizeable chunk of revenue from products other than iPhones. Sales from Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment grew 48% to more than $5.5 billion in the second-quarter, showing that these products are quickly picking up the slack left by iPhones\u2019 slowing demand.\n\nOne new driver which will boost the demand for new hardware is the roll-out of Apple\u2019s fifth-generation, or 5G, phones in 2020. Wall Street\u2019s estimates for the impact of 5G iPhones on Apple are too conservative, according to Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy.\n\nEnergized by this upbeat context, Apple shares hit a record high of $249.05 on Monday. Trading at $243.29 at Tuesday's close, the stock has rebounded more 70% from its January low, pushing the company\u2019s valuation back to over a trillion dollars.\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple\u2019s current surge is consistent with our bullish view on this stock and is backed by real improvements in fundamentals. In addition, Apple\u2019s massive share buyback plan and its growing dividends, which now yield 1.25%, make this stock even more attractive for long-term investors. Today\u2019s earnings report could very much solidify this rally.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Alphabet Inc Class A, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc Class C.
