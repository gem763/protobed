Here is the definitive list", "language": "en", "text": "Embattled coworking startup WeWork has been on something of a shopping spree.\n\nBefore delaying its IPO and finding itself in the middle of a potential boardroom coup, the young startup was snapping up a wide variety of startups. According to Pitchbook data, WeWork has acquired 21 companies since 2015.\n\nThe details of many of those deals were never made public \u2014 but we know that WeWork paid about $40 million for Flatiron School, an online coding school, and that it made what's likely its biggest deal ever when it spent $500 million for a Singapore-based coworking startup called Spacemob.\n\nRead More: Meet Ron Fisher, the SoftBank executive on WeWork's board leading the campaign to oust CEO Adam Neumann\n\nMany, if not most, of those startups have fit squarely within WeWork's core coworking business.
