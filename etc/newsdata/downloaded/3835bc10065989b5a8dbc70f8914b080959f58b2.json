Before NAFTA, Florence was the Cotton T-shirt Capital of the World.\n\n\u201cThey used cotton that was grown around here,\u201d fashion designer Natalie Chanin told me, over heirloom BLTs and iced tea at The Factory Caf\u00e9, her farm-to-table restaurant located in Bldg. 14, one of 20 immense one-story former factories in an industrial park on the edge of town. Chanin is \u201ceighth or ninth generation\u201d southern and a Florence native. She remembers clearly when her hometown was the home of Tee Jays Manufacturing Co. In the early 1990s, pre-NAFTA, Tee Jays had an annual payroll of $50 million.\n\nAfter the passage of NAFTA, U.S. T-shirt production moved offshore. Local manufacturers like Tee Jays ceased operations. Florence, like much of the textile-driven South, plunged into financial and social crisis. \u201cIn 1993, 5,000 worked in this two-block radius,\u201d Chanin said. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t include all the service industries \u2014 restaurants, day-care centers, gas stations. There used to be 20 dye houses in this town. When manufacturing collapsed here, everything collapsed.\u201d\n\nNow, 25 years on, Chanin and her friend, Louisiana-born fashion designer Billy Reid, are helping Florence live up to its sobriquet of \u201cRenaissance City.\u201d\n\nNatalie Chanin.

On Court Street, the town\u2019s main thoroughfare, Reid has his headquarters and a shop \u2014 one of 11 nationwide. His signature look is what a New York Times fashion writer described as \u201cwhiskey-soaked style\u201d: Crinkly seersucker blazers, crisp linen pants, frayed work shirts, cotton chemise dresses, and high-quality selvedge jeans abound.\n\nTo staff their companies, Chanin and Reid have recruited a tribe of young urbanites \u2014 in addition to Chanin\u2019s 30, Reid has 70 employees. That influx of creative sorts has spawned a slew of happening new businesses \u2014 gastropubs, boutique hotels, a microbrewery, and Single Lock Records, cofounded by local Grammy-winning musician John Paul White. Each August, Reid throws Shindig, a three-day celebration of southern food, music, fashion, and culture, open to the public. This year\u2019s edition, held two weeks ago, included the Billy Reid spring/summer 2020 fashion show in a local gym, concerts by Jack White and Margo Price at the historic Shoals Theatre, and the premiere of Ken Burns\u2019s latest documentary, Country Music in the park.\n\nWhat Chanin and Reid are doing is known as slow fashion: a growing movement of makers, designers, merchants, and manufacturers worldwide who, in response to fast fashion and globalization, have significantly dialed back their pace and financial ambition, freeing themselves to focus more on creating items with inherent value, curating the customer experience, and reducing environmental impact. This quiet revolution is also driven by their desire to improve the quality of life for their families and their employees.\n\nSlow fashion champions localization and regionalism rather than massification. It honors craftsmanship and respects tradition while embracing modern technology to make production cleaner and more efficient. It\u2019s about treating workers well, Chanin said, and \u201cbuying from the person down the street whose face you know and love.\u201d\n\nChanin grew up around cotton fields. Her maternal grandfather worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority, her paternal grandfather was a carpenter, and both were farmers. \u201cMy mother always throws out that she picked cotton to buy her school clothes,\u201d she said with a laugh. Chanin\u2019s maternal grandmother and great-grandmother worked at the Sweetwater Mill in Florence, producing military-issue underwear. Her grandmothers sewed at home \u2014 one \u201cmade everybody\u2019s underwear, nightgowns, everything,\u201d she said \u2014 and they showed her how, too. As a child, Chanin spent hours in her grandmother\u2019s attic, playing dress-up with vintage dresses, capes, and shawls. \u201cThat\u2019s how I fell in love with clothes,\u201d she told me. She came to New York in the late \u201980s to find her place in fashion, and she didn\u2019t love much of what she found. \u201cI spent a lot of time overseas, and I saw a lot of things that I don\u2019t think are right \u2014 things that you don\u2019t want human beings to do,\u201d she said.\n\nBy 2000, she had found her signature look. She spent her days at Goodwill, buying T-shirts. She\u2019d cut them up, collage them back together, and decorate them with unusual embroideries that had exposed knots and dangling threads. An antique corset she picked up at the Twenty-Sixth Street flea market served as inspiration. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out what was the inside and what was the outside, and it had been cut away and added to,\u201d she recollected. \u201cThat\u2019s how I felt of my life at that point \u2014 inside out and upside down and sideways \u2014 so I turned the T-shirts inside out, revealing the work on the underside. And that defined our style.\u201d\n\nTo make a proper collection, Chanin needed help. She called on workshops in the Garment District. \u201cI was trying to get them to do the fancy embroideries, and nobody could understand what I was talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I realized it looked like a quilting stitch, and if I wanted to get it made as I wanted, I needed to come home to Alabama, where people still quilted.\u201d\n\nShe looked to rent a home in the countryside where she grew up. Alabama has a long history of quilting, carried on by such associations as the Gee\u2019s Bend Collective and, until 2012, the Freedom Quilting Bee. Project Alabama was born.\n\nInside the factory.

Gilhart\u2019s forte was discovering and promoting young fashion talent, and she took a chance on Chanin. Several other retailers followed, including Ron Herman in Los Angeles and Browns in London.\n\nFrom there, Chanin developed a more complete collection, with 1930s- and 1940s-style dresses and suits like Blanche DuBois wore in A Streetcar Named Desire. All were made in organic cotton or recycled materials, by seamstresses in Florence. Chanin\u2019s sales went well enough, with wholesale accounts at about $2 million. \u201cBut as we all know, building a fashion business is hard,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd building a fashion business based on artisan handwork in the U.S. is extremely difficult. Finally, in 2006, there came a point where ideas diverged and my business partner and I went our separate ways.\u201d\n\nShe decided to start over, rechristening her brand Alabama Chanin.\n\n\u201cSame people. New name,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd no more New York anything.\n\nChanin wasn\u2019t alone. The technology that made globalization easier for giants like Zara and H&M to produce and sell so much also made it possible for small towns to become fashion hot spots. The status quo was ruptured, the power decentralized.\n\nChanin buys her fabrics from Signet Mills in Spartanburg, South Carolina \u2014 her preferred is jersey made of organic Texas cotton \u2014 and she works with a local artisan dyer for her indigo pieces. Chanin comes up with the designs, and her assistants execute them. When I visited, her sample sewer was a 68-year-old, pre-NAFTA garment employee named Sue Hanback. \u201cShe essentially came out of retirement to help us,\u201d Chanin said.\n\nWhen a customer places an order online, Chanin\u2019s freelance seamstresses \u2014 about two dozen in total \u2014 bid for the job. They are all independent contractors, free to decide when, where, and for whom to work, and they build extra costs, such as supplies, utilities, health care, and other benefits, into their bid. She awards the project based \u201con timeliness or quality of work,\u201d she explained. The contracted sewer drives to Bldg. 14, picks up the kit, stitches it in a day or two, numbers and signs the finished garment, and brings it back to the Alabama Chanin HQ to be packaged and sent off to the customer. A hand-sewn double-layer organic cotton jersey dress retails for about $800; Chanin\u2019s hand-sewn organic cotton coats are almost $4,000. Of that, her sewers earn a minimum of 25 to 50 percent of the full retail price, depending on the complexity of the project.\n\nChanin does what she can to avoid labor issues that have long dogged the southern apparel industry. \u201cThere are a lot of people who ask, \u2018How do you know it\u2019s not child labor?\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve known Miss Betty now for 16 years. She\u2019s 86 years old. She only does one particular kind of work. She doesn\u2019t have any kids at her house crocheting snap covers.\u2019 And it\u2019s why we have a rule that our sewers have to all live within an hour and a half of us; you have to pick up and drop off your work yourself. If somebody\u2019s coming in and taking 50 kits a week, it\u2019s a pretty good sign that they\u2019re not doing it themselves. It\u2019s just a more personal relationship. And it\u2019s all women.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all women?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all women,\u201d she said.\n\nThe majority of her sales are online and made-to-order, usually with a three-to-six-week delivery time. When I visited her in 2016, 60 percent of her business was e-commerce; two years later, it was 80 percent.\n\nThe Alabama Chanin factory store.

We don\u2019t owe the bank. We don\u2019t borrow money to produce the collection. We invest in young people and train them well. We have a deep commitment to our community.\u201d\n\nBack before NAFTA, Chanin said, the local textile and apparel businesses \u201cwere growing the cotton; they were ginning the cotton; they were processing it.\u201d They went \u201cstraight from field to form.\u201d Reid and Chanin wanted to return to that business model, but with a modern twist: it would be organic.\n\nToday, 99 percent of all cotton is genetically modified. \u201cWe found out that there is a dearth of [organic] cottonseeds on the planet,\u201d Chanin said. Eventually, they collected enough to plant their first crop. There were doubters. \u201cWe had a drought. We didn\u2019t water. We didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Chanin said. \u201cWeeds started coming up, and the cotton still grew and thrived.\u201d\n\nThe cotton was bagged and sent to a local gin, Scruggs & Vaden, to remove the seeds. Then it was shipped to Hill Spinning Mill, a 50-year-old mill in North Carolina, to be spun into thread. The mill\u2019s machines were sanitized before the organic cotton was processed and spun, so the chemicals from traditional cotton wouldn\u2019t contaminate it. The mill owner said he had never seen such clean cotton \u2014 the result of handpicking.\n\nMuch of the Chanin-Reid cotton was woven by Green Textile (now Signet Mills) in Spartanburg, South Carolina, into cloth \u2014 about 700 yards\u2019 worth \u2014 and sent back to Florence, where it was fashioned into clothing. \u201cIt took us about a year to take the cotton through the whole cycle,\u201d Chanin said.\n\nShe gave me one of the V-neck T-shirts. Made of a soft, dense vanilla jersey that is solidly seamed, it is one of the best-made, most comfortable shirts I have ever owned. Fashion folk throw around the word modern a lot. But Chanin and Reid\u2019s throwback model of hyperlocal, responsible, compassionate fashion may be the most modern of all.\n\nFrom FASHIONOPOLIS: The Price of Fast Fashion\u2013and the Future of Clothes by Dana Thomas, published by Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.
