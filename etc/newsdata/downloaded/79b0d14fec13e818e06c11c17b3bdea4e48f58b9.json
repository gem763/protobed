Here\u2019s what the experts say you should do\n\n\"He knew that I was pregnant but decided to leave me high and dry. He left me for another woman.\"\n\nMore than half of South African kids grow up without their fathers and statistics are proving this to be true as 62 per cent of births in 2017 had no information on fathers according to Stats SA. This means that women are left to fend for their off-spring with little or no support from their partners.\n\nTshidi Mofokeng* (50) is living testimony to this after the father of her now seven-year-old son Vusi* left her while she was pregnant.\n\nShe says her baby daddy was working at the local municipality in Orkney, North West. When she fell pregnant, he started behaving weird only to find out later that he was seeing other women behind her back.\n\n\u201cHe knew that I was pregnant but decided to leave me high and dry. He left me for another woman,\u201d she recalls.\n\nShe says he didn\u2019t even bother to come check on how she was doing during the whole pregnancy. \u201cHe told himself that he would have nothing to do with the child,\u201d she says.\n\nRead more: \"My father refuses to be a part of my life, and it's like I died inside\"\n\nNow that their son has grown, he has not tried to build a relationship with his son.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never come to see him here. He probably sees him playing on the street because we live three houses away from his house,\u201d she says.\n\nHaving to raise her son single-handedly has had some financial strain on Tshidi who is unemployed. She says she has to depend on the social grants and supplement it with casual jobs if she\u2019s lucky enough to get them.\n\nShe is aware that she can\u2019t force him to be a father to his son if he doesn\u2019t want to. But, she says she wanted him to take some financial responsibility for his son.\n\nRead more: A young woman abandoned by her father asks how we can move beyond #MenAreTrash\n\nTshidi says she did try to make him support his child through the courts because he was working for the municipality. However, he stopped when his job ended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he quit or was fired from his job. But he is no longer working and so I can\u2019t take him to court for child support now,\u201d she tells Move!\n\nShe says all she can do now is to do her best in raising her son.\n\nCounselling Social Worker at Famsa Irene Motaung says the absence of a father in a child\u2019s life has quite an impact on their development.\n\n\u201cFather\u2019s participation in their children\u2019s lives reduces the chances of mental health challenges, such as depression and anxiety, including other related psychological problems.\n\nIt is also true that a father\u2019s involvement in nurturing a child leads to better emotional, academic, social and behavioural outcome for children,\u201d she says.\n\nIrene says parents ought to act in the best interest of their child. Nonetheless, she\u2019s mindful of the fact that we don\u2019t live in an ideal world.\n\n\u201cAs a primary caregiver of the child, who is also a legal guardian of the child, the mother needs to work within the best interest of the child principle. This means that the child\u2019s rights for maintenance, contact and guardianship need to take precedence over the parent\u2019s interest,\u201d she points out.\n\nIn cases where the father comes and goes, what is referred to as a \u2018yo-yo father\u2019, the mother still needs to put the interests of the child first.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the mother to understand that in terms of the South African children\u2019s law, children have a right of contact with both parents. This is even if the parents were not married or are separated or divorced,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere are special cases where a father or one of the parents can be denied contact with their child, and these cannot be decided upon by any of the parents against another. Only the court can rule on whether either of the parents is fit or not be allowed contact with their children,\u201d she says.\n\nIrene encourages parents who find themselves in this predicament to make use of Family Life Centre\u2019s service for assistance. These services include parenting skills for divorced and separated parents. They also have legal counselling services which can come in very handy under these circumstances.\n\nNot their real names*", "description": "\"He knew that I was pregnant but decided to leave me high and dry.
