Total sales and revenue for the third quarter ended September 30 fell 5.6 percent from a year earlier to $12.76bn.\n\n\"Sales in Asia/Pacific were lower across most of the region primarily due to lower demand in China, including unfavourable changes in dealer inventories, amid continued competitive pressures,\" the company said.\n\nCaterpillar's sales have improved since it managed to halt a four-year slide in 2016, but Wall Street analysts have been warning that demand in more than half of the company's end markets had peaked.\n\nChief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfie said dealers had reduced the value of the Caterpillar stock they were holding by $400m in the third quarter and were likely to cut them by another $900m in the final three months of the year - a stark contrast to an $800m ramp-up in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nThe company is seen as one of Wall Street's clearer gauges of the state of Chinese demand and its impact on big western multinationals.\n\nCaterpillar said the impact of tariffs imposed on its goods as a result of US President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing would now be lower than the $250m to $350m range it gave earlier this year.\n\nThe company also cut its 2019 expectations for profit to between $10.90 and $11.40 per share compared with a prior estimate of $12.06 to $13.06.", "description": "The machinery maker is noting the impact of the United States-China trade war on its business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/0a90bb425fb04740b8feb39acfdb413e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
