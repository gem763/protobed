The request of shoppers to not carry guns in the open applies even in states like Ohio and Kentucky where it's legal.\n\n\"This is something we've talked about for some time \u2013 it's something our customers told us would make them feel safer if we did it,\" McMullen told The Enquirer. \"We're really just listening to our customers.\"\n\nKroger CEO Rodney McMullen (right) greets Batman (3-year-old Shepherd) and Patrick Taylor of Covington to the Newport Kroger Marketplace. More\n\nMcMullen said Kroger is following the example of Starbucks and other retailers that in recent years have made similar requests of customers and agreed it effectively functions as a ban on open carry without being too heavy-handed.\n\n\"We're asking customers rather than a flat out ban,\" McMullen said.\n\nWalmart response: Walmart to no longer sell certain ammunition, ask customers to stop open carry in stores\n\nLeaving guns at home: Which stores besides Walmart, Kroger discourage open carry\n\nPressed on why not ban open carry or for that matter the carrying of concealed weapons, McMullen replied:\n\n\"How would we enforce it?\" McMullen said. \"How would we know (referring specifically to shoppers with concealed weapons).\"\n\nMcMullen's comments follow weeks of silence by the company on gun violence that has swept the country, including at Kroger stores. The retailer did not respond to The Enquirer in August when it wrote about Kroger and other stores' gun policies in the aftermath of back-to-back shootings that killed a combined 31 people at an El Paso Walmart and a downtown Dayton entertainment district.\n\nKroger officials say they're working out the details of how to enact their new gun policy and looking at \"best practices\" by other retailers.\n\nThey have not said how they will respond to customers who ignore Kroger's request not to openly carry a firearm. They have also not figured out what a customer should do if they see another shopper with a gun.\n\nThe Enquirer reported that retailers generally allow shoppers to bring weapons despite the fact that nearly half of mass shootings (45.6%) occur in business settings, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nKroger officials said they didn't want to insert themselves into the national gun debate then when feelings were still raw.\n\nBut the mass shootings have continued.\n\nMcMullen, who was at Music Hall in Over-The-Rhine Thursday being honored by Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Cincinnati, did not offer a personal opinion on guns or address a lawsuit against Kroger by the family of victims at a mass shooting at a Louisville Kroger last fall.\n\nKroger's previous policy was to defer to local and state laws \u2013 a legal stance that was criticized as a cop-out by gun-control advocates because those same laws ultimately leave it up to business and property owners to set their own rules.\n\nThat policy was challenged in a lawsuit by the widow of a man shot to death in a Louisville Kroger supermarket, claiming the retailer didn't do enough to prevent his murder.\n\nThe lawsuit against Kroger also brought to light a multitude of largely ignored victims from more than two dozen shootings \u2013 most in the last seven years.\n\nKroger's Tuesday announcement came hours after Walmart made the same request of its customers.\n\nGun-control advocates have in recent years targeted private businesses to change their firearms policies amid Congressional deadlock on the issue in Washington, D.C.", "description": "Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told The Enquirer Thursday he believes most gun owners will respect the retailer's request to not openly carry guns in stores.", "authors": ["Alexander Coolidge", "Cincinnati Enquirer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o8ejLrzeetJhUFBaH1M5Iw--~B/aD0zMDI0O3c9NDAzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/d773dda8e387a67bf6019c98f440abe8", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
