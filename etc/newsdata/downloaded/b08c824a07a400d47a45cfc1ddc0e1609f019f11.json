All this new money is moving into the space and we\u2019re not even close to peaking.\n\nIan Chillag, creator of Everything is Alive: \u201cThe fact there are people spending lots and lots of money hasn\u2019t changed the barrier of entry for anybody else.\"\n\n\u201cWhen [filmmaker] James Cameron does a podcast that gets 500 million downloads, or the next Marvel movie has a podcast with it, or my parents start listening to podcasts, then we\u2019ll reach that level. But none of those things have happened.\u201d\n\nSuch bullishness may surprise Harbinger\u2019s critics. After all, the 39-year-old has gained infamy for a public talk he has been giving since 2016 called For The Love Of God, Please Don\u2019t Start Another Podcast. He says his critics either haven\u2019t heard the talk or they\u2019ve misunderstood it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against people starting a podcast. I\u2019m against people starting a podcast just because they think they\u2019ll make a bunch of money doing it. If you want to make a podcast where you have a beer with your friends and watch rugby and spout off at each other, you should do that. But if you want to do that because you expect to get $100,000 a year and free rugby season tickets, you\u2019re screwed.\n\n\u201cShows like mine are in the 0.1 per cent in terms of number of downloads. People that are doing those numbers are amazing storytellers, geniuses in their field or celebrities with a massive audience already. I\u2019m none of those things, I just tried and got it wrong for 12 and a half years until I got it right. People are expecting to do that right away, but you have to pull a rabbit out of a hat to make a living podcasting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made work for a long time knowing it would be heard by no one,\" says podcaster Avery Trufelman. Ash Berdebes\n\nAsk other podcasters who have managed to grab that rabbit and they all tell you that passion should come before profits every time. Avery Trufelman is a producer and presenter on 99% Invisible, the popular US podcast that examines the unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world. In the last 12 months she has also created two of her own series, Articles Of Interest, about the historical and sociological impact of clothing, and Nice Try!, about how humankind has tried to create utopian communities. She has three pieces of advice she regularly gives podcaster newbies.\n\n\u201cI tell people to make it about something you love, don\u2019t ask for permission and don\u2019t quit your day job,\u201d she told me when I met her at the Audiocraft Podcast Festival in Sydney earlier this year. \u201cI made work for a long time knowing it would be heard by no one and that\u2019s the greatest gift I could give myself. You just need to learn on your own. I had to find my voice and find out what I wanted to do. And you know what? It was fun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is that although starting a podcast is relatively easy, keeping it going is difficult. By around the seventh episode, on average, most of them suffer what\u2019s known as podfade, the term coined to describe how there are longer and longer gaps between new episodes and the show eventually folds. In fact, only about 20-25 per cent of those 750,000 podcasts on your feed are actively and regularly producing new episodes.\n\nAnd with big business now moving into podcasting, some producers fear that everything will follow the money and that the truly individual, maverick podcasts will get lost in the noise and rush. Ian Chillag thinks that would be a shame, but remains hopeful. The creator of Everything Is Alive \u2013 a podcast where he interviews improv actors playing inanimate objects (a can of cola, a grain of sand, a pregnancy test) \u2013 uses the analogy of the raw, stripped-down nature of punk and the big-budget bombast of prog-rock in the \u201970s to explain why he\u2019s not too worried.\n\n\u201cPunk and Genesis co-existed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact there are people spending lots and lots of money hasn\u2019t changed the barrier of entry for anybody else. I feel like my show gets called weird and experimental a lot, which I\u2019m comfortable with, but there are thousands of people out there doing things that are weirder and more experimental, who should be getting their due. I want there to be risk-taking and I want there to be reward for risk-taking. I just want more new things out there.\u201d\n\nBut where is podcasting headed? Jordan Harbinger has some predictions \u2013 Spotify will overtake Apple as the most popular player in the market, more big podcast networks will emerge, market share will not balloon, but grow steadily year-on-year for at least another five years.\n\nAs for where we are right now in the podcast timeline, Nick van der Kolk can tell you exactly. He\u2019s the creator of Love + Radio, an award-winning podcast from Richmond, Virginia, that has earned a reputation for inventive and brave storytelling about secret lives, twisted tales and morally ambiguous characters. He likes to compare the trajectory of podcasts with the American film industry.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about this being the golden age of podcasting,\" says Nick van der Kolk.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about this being the golden age of podcasting and I think that\u2019s more accurate than they even realise,\u201d he says. \u201cThe golden age of Hollywood is basically The Birth Of A Nation until around 1960. That's when American cinema got its language and the ground rules were put in place.\n\n\u201cThere are films from that era that are great, but I've always personally gravitated more towards what's called new Hollywood, in the \u201970s and into the \u201980s with films like Taxi Driver and Bonnie And Clyde. So for me, we\u2019re now in that golden age, but what\u2019s going to come after that is the equivalent of the new Hollywood period.\u201d\n\nSo, using that Hollywood model, can he pinpoint where we are?\n\n\u201cRight now?\u201d he asks, thinking for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re in 1953.\u201d", "description": "With more than 750,000 podcasts already out there the market might seem crowded, but say insiders, there's still room for more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2498%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c7bff61e1bf547b4f6ea2007b01402fa89988674", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
