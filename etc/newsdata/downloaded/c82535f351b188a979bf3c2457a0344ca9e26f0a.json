Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency has generally been more interested in relaxing rather than strictly enforcing laws regulating pollution. Keeping water clean, in particular, has not been a priority, as the Los Angeles Times observes:\n\nEarlier this month, the agency [EPA] announced that it was rolling back Obama-era protections on wetlands and streams \u2014 regulations that environmentalists said are necessary to protect drinking water but that farmers and developers have long opposed.\n\nUnder Trump, the EPA has also delayed setting a drinking water safety standard for a class of cancer-causing chemicals, known as PFAS, that has been found in public water systems throughout the country.\n\nSo the EPA\u2019s suddenly stern attitude about water pollution in California, which it blames partly on the homeless, is pretty clearly just another front in the administration\u2019s ongoing war with the Golden State:\n\nThe Trump administration notified California officials on Thursday that it is \u201cfailing\u201d to meet federal water-quality standards, attributing this in part to homelessness.\n\nAn oversight letter addressed to Gov. Gavin Newsom alleges that San Francisco, Los Angeles and the state \u201cdo not appear to be acting with urgency to mitigate the risks to human health and the environment that may result from the homelessness crisis.\u201d\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler warned that the agency is \u201cconcerned\u201d about the state\u2019s handling of public water systems.\n\n\u201cThe agency is aware of the growing homelessness crisis developing in major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the impact of this crisis on the environment,\u201d Wheeler wrote. \u201cBased upon data and reports, the agency is concerned that California\u2019s implementation of federal environmental laws is failing to meet its obligations required under delegated federal programs.\u201d\n\nYou may recall that Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the coal industry, and also a former aide to Senator James Inhofe, author of that great environmentalist tome, The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly not a coincidence that on a recent fundraising trip to California, the president spent considerable time mocking the Democrats who govern the state and its largest cities for a homelessness crisis that he and his allies attribute to excessive regulation \u2014 particularly environmental regulation. This was his parting shot, as reported by NBC News:\n\nFrom Air Force One, Trump, who had been in California for a two-day fundraising trip, blamed the homeless population for environmental issues. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous pollution being put into the ocean,\u201d he said, noting \u201cthere are needles, there are other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco \u2014 they\u2019re in total violation \u2014 we\u2019re going to be giving them the notice very soon,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe EPA is going to be putting out a notice and you know they\u2019re in serious violation and this is environmental, very environmental,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they have to clean it up. We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d\n\nWheeler\u2019s letter indicates that Trump wasn\u2019t just trolling Californians and the homeless when he complained that homeless people keep wealthy people like himself from going about their important business. In theory, the EPA could take over enforcement of clean water rules in the state, though that would be pretty bad for clean water. But the targets of the administration\u2019s ire are pretty hot about it, as Nathan Click, Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s spokesperson, told the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cThe president is abusing the powers of the presidency and weaponizing government to attack his political opponents,\u201d Click said. \u201cThis is not about clean air, clean water or helping our state with homelessness. This is political retribution against California, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of that going on, particularly when it comes to environmental protection:\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom and other top California officials have denounced Trump for targeting the state on several fronts. In the past month alone, the administration has moved to revoke the state\u2019s long-standing right to limit air pollution from cars, began investigating an agreement with four automakers for possible antitrust violations and threatened to withhold federal highway funds if California does not do more to clean up its air.\n\nJust yesterday, California attorney general Xavier Becerra announced he was participating in a 17-state effort to stop the administration\u2019s evisceration of the Endangered Species Act. It\u2019s the 62nd federal lawsuit Becerra has launched against Team Trump.\n\nBy sheer coincidence, Wheeler\u2019s \u201cnotice\u201d to California came out the same day as a Los Angeles Times analysis of new polling data suggesting that Trump is \u201con track for the poorest showing by a Republican presidential candidate in the state since the Civil War.\u201d POTUS almost certainly could not care less. For him, the nation\u2019s largest state long ago became a hobgoblin he rattles at MAGA crowds along with lurid tales of a liberal hellscape where violent immigrants, Hollywood \u201celites,\u201d and assorted hippies run wild at the expense of the hard-working taxpayers of the heartland.", "description": "Following on Trump comments recently about the homeless population generating water pollution, EPA chief (and former coal lobbyist) Andrew Wheeler is formally rebuking the state in the latest front in the administration\u2019s war on California.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/26-andrew-wheeler.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
