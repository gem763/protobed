The student does not attend Wheaton High, and Turner declined to identify the student because the person isa minor.\n\nAD\n\nNaviance officials did not return requests seeking comment.\n\nAD\n\nThe student responsible for the online attack could face criminal charges in addition to disciplinary action by the district, school system officials said. The breach prompted the school system to reset the Naviance passwords of all Montgomery County students.\n\nIn the statement, school system officials said the district \u201cimmediately took steps to secure the platform and began an investigation to identify the unauthorized user. The threat has now been eliminated.\u201d\n\nThe accounts of 1,343 students and one parent were affected, the statement said. The information included students\u2019 names, contact information, ethnicity and gender. It also included students\u2019 highest scores on SAT, ACT, PSAT and International Baccalaureate exams.\n\nAD\n\nSocial Security numbers, banking and credit card information were not part of the breach, according to the school system.\n\nAD\n\nThe attack allegedly happened during two hours starting at 8:10 p.m. Oct. 3, according to the school system. Naviance discovered the suspicious activity at 10:14 p.m. and blocked the IP address responsible for the attack, according to the district.\n\nThe college prep company immediately reset the passwords of the accounts that were affected and alerted Montgomery County schools the next day.\n\nSchool and police officials began an investigation Oct. 7 and have identified the student they said is responsible for the breach. School system officials said they believe the information was shared with at least two other students. Police have confiscated the students\u2019 technological devices as part of an ongoing investigation.\n\nAD\n\nOn its website, Naviance describes itself as a \u201ccomprehensive college and career readiness platform\u201d that helps middle- and high school students explore college and career interests. The company, according to its website, takes \u201cvery seriously our obligations and responsibilities to act as good stewards of the student data that schools and districts entrust to us.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Hacker figured out the username and password to access information from Wheaton High.", "authors": ["Debbie Truong", "Reporter Covering Virginia Schools"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UVvfYyESULe_XKCx3pnNYYMOFTI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ENHJTZRZBUI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
