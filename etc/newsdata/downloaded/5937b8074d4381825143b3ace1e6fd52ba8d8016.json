He dodged questions about his own role and denied that Trump had requested an investigation of Biden \u2014 something the president acknowledged just days ago on the White House lawn.\n\nThe vice president said he wasn\u2019t opposed to transcripts of his own conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky being released, an idea first broached by Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have no objection to that, and we\u2019re discussing that with White House counsel as we speak,\u201d said Pence when asked if he would release transcripts of his own conversations with the Ukrainian president.\n\nReporters reminded Pence of his comments in 2016 that \u201cforeign governments cannot participate in the American political process.\u201d Pence said he stood by the remarks.\n\n\u201cBut the president himself has said that he asked a foreign government to investigate his domestic political rival,\u201d said a reporter. \u201cSo, is that OK with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d Pence said stiffly. \u201cI know that\u2019s the way [House Intelligence Committee] Chairman [Adam] Schiff characterized it in his manufactured transcript,\u201d said Pence.\n\n\u201cThe president said it on the lawn,\u201d replied a reporter, referencing Trump\u2019s call last week for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Some of the president\u2019s allies have attempted to say he was joking, but he also asked Chinese President Xi to do the same thing in a private June conversation.\n\n\u201cBut the American people should read the transcript, and they will see that the president did nothing wrong,\u201d said Pence in response. \u201cThere was no pressure. There was no quid pro quo. The president simply raised the issues of importance and interest to the American people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nVice President Mike Pence answers questions about the whistleblower and President Trump's call with the president of Ukraine.

One is that the request for an investigation of the relationship, going back to 2016, among Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings reflected Trump\u2019s determination to root out corruption, and it was only sheer coincidence that the former vice president is a leading candidate in the Democratic primary to run against Trump in 2020.\n\nThat would justify Pence denying that Trump \u201casked a foreign government to investigate his domestic political rival.\u201d Biden was just collateral damage in Trump\u2019s war on corruption.\n\nThe other defense is to subtly shift the issue from the ethics of Trump asking for Ukraine\u2019s help to the existence of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in the form of restoring American military aid to Ukraine that had been frozen on order of the White House. Hence Pence\u2019s response to a question that hadn\u2019t been asked: \u201cThere was no pressure. There was no quid pro quo. The president simply raised the issues of importance and interest to the American people.\u201d\n\nPence made frequent references to the White House releasing a transcript of Trump\u2019s July conversation with Zelensky, but that was not a transcript but instead a rough memo based on recollections of those listening in on the call. CNN reported Wednesday that as soon as the call ended, there was a scramble to contain the fallout, which eventually led to the whistleblower report and the call being concealed on a special classified server. During the call, after Zelensky mentions buying arms from the United States, Trump asks for a favor, seeking his cooperation in pursuing a debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, in cooperation with Democrats, that attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election \u2014 rather than Russia, seeking to aid Republicans, as charged in the report by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nBill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, expressed explicit concern that there was a quid pro quo being proposed, writing in a Sept. 9 text: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "\u201cThe president said it on the lawn,\u201d replied a reporter, referencing Trump's call on the White House lawn last week for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7E1kUyaxVBJwHSZ0AyBG6A--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/82f8c300-eb76-11e9-bfdf-2f40c3f4fec2", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
