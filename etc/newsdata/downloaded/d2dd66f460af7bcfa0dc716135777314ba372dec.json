The EGX platform supports Nvidia Metropolis, which can be used to build smart cities and intelligent video analytics applications.\n\nIt can also support the new Nvidia Aerial software developer kit, also announced during Huang's keynote.\n\nAccording to Huang, the critical element that will allow 5G providers to move to cloud-native infrastructure is Nvidia Aerial. The software developer kit allows providers to build and deliver high-performance, software-defined 5G wireless RAN by delivering two essential advancements: A low-latency data path directly from Mellanox network interface cards to GPU memory and a 5G physical layer signal-processing engine that keeps all data within the GPU's high-performance memory.\n\nAerial, Huang continued, allows telcos to build completely virtualised 5G radio access networks that open up possibilities to services such as smart factories, AR/VR, and cloud gaming.\n\nThe Nvidia Aerial SDK, running on the Nvidia EGX stack, brings GPU acceleration to carrier-grade Kubernetes infrastructure. The EGX stack includes an Nvidia driver, Nvidia Kubernetes plug-in, Nvidia Container runtime plug-in, and Nvidia GPU monitoring software.\n\nSee also: Medical imaging at the 'speed of light': Nvidia's Clara supercomputer\n\nHuang also touched on early adopters of the EGX Edge Supercomputing Platform, which include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics, and NTT East, as well as the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas.\n\n\"At Walmart, we're using AI to define the future of retail and re-think how technology can further enhance how we operate our stores,\" Walmart Intelligent Retail Lab CEO Mike Hanrahan said in a statement. \"With Nvidia's EGX edge computing platform, Walmart's Intelligent Retail Lab is able to bring real-time AI compute to our store, automate processes, and free up our associates to create a better and more convenient shopping experience for our customers.\"\n\nHis organisation has deployed EGX in its New York-based lab, with Walmart exploring ways for AI to further improve in-store shopping experiences.\n\nUsing EGX, Walmart said it could compute more than 1.6 terabytes of data generated each second in real time. It's using AI to alert staff to perform tasks such as shelf re-stocking, open up new checkout lanes, retrieve shopping carts, and determine produce freshness.\n\nBMW is using intelligent video analytics in its South Carolina manufacturing facility to automate inspection, using EGX to gather data from multiple cameras and other sensors in inspection lines.\n\nWhile the city of Las Vegas is using EGX to capture vehicle and pedestrian data in a bid to make its streets safer; it also plans to use the data to autonomously manage signal timing and other operational capabilities.\n\nAlso announced on Monday afternoon was the new Nvidia CloudXR SDK, which will allow organisations to create and deliver high-quality, wireless AR and VR experiences from any application based on OpenVR.\n\nThe SDK runs on Nvidia servers located in the cloud or on-premises data centres, delivering the advanced graphics performance needed for wireless virtual, augmented, or mixed reality environments, Huang said.\n\nCompanies that have their own 5G networks can use Nvidia CloudXR to stream immersive environments from their on-premises data centres\n\nEnterprises can now deliver virtual and augmented reality experiences across 5G networks to any device with NVIDIA CloudXR.\n\nFollowing on from the EGX and Arial announcements, Nvidia doubled down on its move into 5G, partnering with Ericsson, Red Hat, and Microsoft, with a spotlight on the telecommunications industry.\n\nSEE MORE", "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it will allow organisations to harness rapidly streaming data from factory floors, manufacturing inspection lines, and city streets to deliver next-gen artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and 5G-based services at scale.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/acddb4d7-ed71-4e80-a3c8-8e891f8794f7/thumbnail/770x578/3b5957b68afa7e7590cc208e81a0698b/nvidia-jensen-huang.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
