In mid-October, the New Jersey Division of Taxation reminded taxpayers why we should all be scared of giving too much power to the government, and that our elected leaders-- whether they be federal or state -- will tax whatever they can for revenue generating schemes that do not make any sense.\n\nPumpkins used for decoration are subject to Sales Tax.\n\nPumpkins used for food or in food preparation are tax free. pic.twitter.com/bZzyAVsQb1 \u2014 NJ Div of Taxation (@nj_taxation) October 15, 2019\n\nThe Trentonian blasted the NJ Division of Taxation for their \"tone deaf\" tweet:\n\nOK, three things on this \u201csecondly\u201d bit of business \u2026 1) Why are any pumpkins taxed? It\u2019s a food. 2) A-ha! But decorative pumpkins are not a food, and thus subject to tax. But why would a pumpkin seller bring this point up to a pumpkin purchaser? And if they did bring it up, why would said pumpkin purchaser cop to using the pumpkin for decorative purposes? And what about a pumpkin I use for decorative purposes, but in the carving process I decide to roast the seeds? Hmmm? THEN WHAT? And lastly, and most importantly, 3) Why in the name of Charlie Brown would the New Jersey Division of Taxation see fit to tweet out this factoid to all of their - ahem - 785 followers, which amounts to (this is the real number) .000088% of the state\u2019s population, or about one out of every 11,000 residents, meaning there\u2019s roughly 34 people in Mercer County following this account (great Twitter game, @nj_taxation, and why the hell wouldn\u2019t you capitalize the \u201cnj\u201d there? {banging head against keyboard} but anyway \u2026)\n\nIndeed, if I'm living in New Jersey, why wouldn't I just buy a cheaper pumpkin for \"eating\" and then use said cucurbit for decoration?
