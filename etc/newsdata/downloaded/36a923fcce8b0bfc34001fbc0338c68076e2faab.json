The California law could force many drivers to work more rigid hours, \u201ctaking away their ability to make their own decisions about the jobs they take and the hours they work.\u201d Uber has publicly stated that it won\u2019t comply with California\u2019s new law when it is expected to take effect early next year. The ridesharing company\u2019s top attorney said in a lengthy statement in September that Uber is exempt from the law\u2019s requirements because drivers\u2019 work falls \u201coutside the usual course of Uber\u2019s business,\u201d which it sees as providing a technology platform. The Protect App-Based Drivers & Services Act is expected to appear as a referendum next November on California\u2019s 2020 ballot.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
