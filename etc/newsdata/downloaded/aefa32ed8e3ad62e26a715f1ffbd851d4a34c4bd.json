I think I would max out at 20 years, a 20-year ceremony.\n\nHe believes he is irreplaceable (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018I think enough is enough then, I would be 77 and I might not be compos mentis by then, you never know.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite potentially leaving our screens, that doesn\u2019t mean the show can\u2019t go on without him \u2013 although it appears Alan believes he\u2019s irreplaceable with the history he\u2019s had.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve done it all,\u2019 the star protested when asked if there would be someone big enough to fill his shoes: \u2018So I think they would find it very hard.\u2019\n\nThe founder of the show continued: \u2018If you look at some of the other business programmes that are on TV, I\u2019m not sure there is such an all rounder there.\u2019\n\nShahin Hassan was the first contestant to be fired in this series (Picture: BBC)\n\nTo give him his due, he has been grafting since he left the womb.\n\nHe boasted: \u2018I\u2019ve loaded lorries, sat on the production line, produced more goods on the production line than any of these people have ever done, done my own marketing, my own advertising, buying components, getting the prices right, designing products.\u2019\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe 15th series launched last week and already saw chartered engineer Shahin Hassan fired from the boardroom.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very disappointed to leave at such an early stage \u2013 it should have been Lewis, but ultimately it was Lord Sugar\u2019s decision,\u2019 he said in the taxi ride home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Apprentice continues next Wednesday night on BBC One at 9pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
