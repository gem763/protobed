Awarded $1.5M National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant", "language": "en", "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Emerging health IT start-up OmniLife (formerly known as HealthTech Solutions) has received a notice of award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II grant totaling $1.5 million. The grant will be used to support research and development of the company\u2019s proprietary software to make organ transplant communication more efficient and effective. The NIH approved only 257 grants from over 618 SBIR Phase II applications in 2018, or just over 41 percent of those applying.1\n\nOrgan transplant communication processes are historically inefficient and rely on faxes, constant phone calls, and non-secure forms of communication. This antiquated process is under increased scrutiny as organ demand grows and allocation rules shift. OmniLife provides a solution to this communication gap with TXP Chat\u2122, a HIPAA compliant secure platform that connects clinicians and coordinators in real time to facilitate fast and efficient collaboration and communication around time-sensitive transplant events.\n\n\u201cThis follow-on funding from the National Institutes of Health validates the problem we are working to solve and increases the impact our technology can have on the transplant community,\u201d said Dalton Shaull, CEO/Co-Founder. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that each transplant happens seamlessly without high volumes of administrative work for transplant clinicians, such as phone calls, voice mail, and faxes. We are breaking down communication silos and giving transplant providers all the information they need in one place, so that they can focus on their patients.\u201d\n\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D). Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. Phase II grants are follow-on grants from Phase I and are focused on \u201cthe development, demonstration and delivery of the innovation.\u201d\n\nOmniLife, formerly known as HealthTech Solutions, Inc., is a health technology provider focused on providing solutions in organ transplantation. The company\u2019s first product, TXP ChatTM, connects clinical, medical and operational transplant professionals through a secure HIPAA-compliant mobile messaging app to simplify real-time clinical communication and coordination when time matters.\n\n1tps://sbir.nih.gov/statistics/award-data\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191023005120/en/\n\nContacts\n\nDalton Shaull, (641) 295-5367; dalton-shaull@omnilife.ai", "description": "LEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Emerging health IT start-up OmniLife (formerly known as HealthTech Solutions) has received a notice of award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II grant totaling $1.5 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20191023005120/en/751626/3/OmniLife_Horiz_Sub_%281%29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
