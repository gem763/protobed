Customers will also have access to Target loyalty programs like Target Circle and RedCard.\n\nAccording to the Target blog, Toys R Us will also open experiential retail stores in Houston, Texas, and Paramus, New Jersey, later this fall, which will also be powered by Target. If a particular toy is unavailable, a sales associate will help fulfill the order using Target.com.\n\nRepresentatives from both Target and Toys R Us did not immediately return Business Insider's request for further comment on the partnership.\n\nAs previously reported by Business Insider, Toys R Us and new parent company Tru Kids Brands will not make any money from these experiential stores \u2014 instead, manufacturers will pay for space and services and keep 100% of sales. The first two locations are opening in high-end malls, and Tru Kids Brands said it has plans to open 10 more locations in 2020.\n\nRead more: Toys R Us is officially back from the dead, but its new stores won't actually make any money selling toys\n\nThe website and experiential stores also come after Tru Kids Brands teamed with the experiential company Candytopia to open pop-up locations in Chicago and Atlanta earlier this year.
