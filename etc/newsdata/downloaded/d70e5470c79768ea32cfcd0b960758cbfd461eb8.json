They reported 30 injuries in the area from artillery fired by either the Turks or their allies from the Free Syrian Army.\n\nReuters journalists positioned near the Turkey-Syria border said they could hear machine-gun fire and artillery explosions from the vicinity of Ras al-Ain and saw plumes of smoke near the town, although they added the \u201csounds of fighting had subsided by mid-morning.\u201d\n\nCBS News reported allegations from Kurdish leaders that the Turks are using white phosphorus weapons against Kurdish civilians, although a chemical weapons expert consulted by CBS pointed out that virtually every faction in the gruesome Syrian civil war has white phosphorus, including the Syrian army, so it is difficult to determine who should be held accountable for any given deployment.\n\nThe international chemical weapons watchdog OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) is reportedly investigating allegations of chemical weapons use.\n\nThe SDF publicly accepted the terms of the ceasefire agreement, which they said they were actively involved in negotiating.\n\n\u201cAs you know, President Trump has himself worked on this. He sent a letter to Erdogan, and finally the American vice-president went and met with them. We were part of this whole process, and we can say that we were connected to the American delegation which traveled to Turkey,\u201d SDF Commander-in-Chief Mazlum Abdi said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhatever we can do as the SDF to make this ceasefire work, we will do. America has led this ceasefire, and is responsible for ensuring that it is carried out in the correct way,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdi added that people who live in the Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad areas covered by the agreement \u201cmust be able to return to their own homes and land,\u201d refuting what many see as Turkish plans to ethnically cleanse the region of Kurds. The ostensible Turkish demand is for armed Syrian militia groups Turkey sees as allied with the separatist PKK party to vacate the \u201csafe zone\u201d buffer area.\n\nAbdi described the ceasefire agreement as the product of a \u201cheroic struggle carried out by the soldiers of the SDF, Kurds, Arabs, Assyrian Christians and others, together,\u201d along with help from the outside world.\n\n\u201cEverybody, every state, apart from the client states of Turkey, apart from them, all the states of the world created pressure on Turkey so this ceasefire could be set up. As a result of this great pressure, and the struggle of our people and our soldiers, this ceasefire was achieved,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed on Friday that allegations of cease-fire violations were \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019re getting your news from. According to the news I received from my defense minister, there is no question of clashes,\u201d Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul, adding that his defense ministry believes the Kurdish militia it regards as \u201cterrorists\u201d have begun withdrawing from the region as desired.\n\n\u201cFrom this moment on, a 120-process is running. Within this 120-hour process, the YPG, the terrorist organization that you know, will leave the area, especially the region that we have designated as a safe zone,\u201d he insisted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I will meet with President Putin on Tuesday. I consider this meeting to be a separate element of this process. With these meetings, with Peace Spring, if God permits, we will bring peace to the region,\u201d Erdogan said, alluding to his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin near the end of the cease-fire period.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said late on Friday morning that he spoke with Erdogan about the alleged cease-fire violations.\n\n\u201cHe told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. He very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cToo bad there wasn\u2019t this thinking years ago,\u201d Trump mused. \u201cInstead, it was always held together with very weak Band-aids and in an artificial manner. There is good will on both sides and a really good chance for success.\u201d\n\nTrump added that the has \u201cjust been notified that some European nations are now willing, for the first time, to take the ISIS fighters that came from their nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is good news, but should have been done after WE captured them,\u201d he remarked. \u201cAnyway, big progress being made!\u201d", "description": "The Kurdish-led SDF claims Turkish forces violated the five-day ceasefire agreement announced on Thursday afternoon almost immediately.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/military-turkey-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
