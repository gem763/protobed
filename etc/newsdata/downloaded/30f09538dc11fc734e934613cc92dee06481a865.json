REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte/Files\n\nAhmed Rilwan, a journalist for the Maldives Independent who wrote about corruption and Islamist militancy, was abducted in August 2014, a year after Yameen was elected.\n\nJournalists and rights groups in the tropical archipelago say Rilwan\u2019s criticism of the government and radical Islam could have made him a target.\n\nHusnu Suood, the head of a Presidential Commission on Investigation of Murders and Enforced Disappearances, said his panel had received witness accounts from those directly involved in his murder.\n\n\u201cRilwan was murdered by radical Islamists associated with foreign jihadi groups who had earlier threatened him on several occasions,\u201d Suood told reporters in the capital, Male, late on Sunday.\n\nRilwan was murdered at sea after his abduction, Suood said, but he declined to elaborate, saying details could hamper the investigation.\n\nSuood said Rilwan was seen as a threat to the recruitment of fighters from the archipelago by Maldivian militant groups linked to Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nThe panel, appointed by President Ibrahim Mohammed Solih in November after he defeated Yameen, found the former president attempted to divert the investigation into Rilwan\u2019s abduction.\n\nBut Suood said there was no evidence to charge Yameen in connection with the abduction and murder.\n\nYameen and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, although Yameen has previously denied any involvement in the murders.\n\nMohamed Shareef, a member of Yameen\u2019s People\u2019s National Congress party, said the panel\u2019s remarks were politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThey have no evidence to link President Yameen to the disappearance, to press charges against him,\u201d he told Reuters on Monday.\n\nActivists complained of a crackdown on dissent under Yameen\u2019s government, following the abduction of Rilwan and the 2017 murder of Yameen Rasheed, a blogger who also denounced Islamist militancy and state corruption.", "description": "An abducted Maldivian journalist was murdered by Islamist militants, a panel investigating deaths and disappearances under the previous government said, in remarks that were critical of former president Abdulla Yameen.", "authors": ["Mohamed Junayd", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425319240&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810JK"}
