One ratings company downgraded the oil giant. Meanwhile, questions persist over how the initial public offering will be handled even as Saudi Aramco offers sweeteners and promises of an estimated $75 billion dividend next year.\n\nThe report by Al-Arabiya did not elaborate and cited anonymous sources for the information. However, the channel often breaks news before even the kingdom\u2019s state-run media and is widely believed to have a direct line to the Al Saud royal family.\n\nThe channel\u2019s English arm elaborated, saying that a final price for the stock will be set Dec. 4, with shares then beginning to be traded on the Riyadh-based Tadawul stock market on Dec. 11. It added that the Saudi Capital Markets Authority will make a formal announcement about the IPO plans on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Aramco IPO is a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 plan, which aims to wean the kingdom off its reliance on oil to diversify the economy,\u201d the channel said in its report.", "description": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 The long-planned initial public offering of a sliver of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco will begin this", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/5fb214_saudi-arabia-investment-forum-17538-in-oct-22-2018-file-photo-saudi-employees-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
