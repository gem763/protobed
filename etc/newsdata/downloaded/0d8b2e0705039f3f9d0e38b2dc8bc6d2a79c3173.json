In addition to claiming that Pitchford violated contracts involving both Gearbox and a separate, co-owned real estate venture, Callender also accused Pitchford of receiving a secret \u201cExecutive Bonus\u201d of $18 million from publishing partner Take Two in 2016, an advance on royalties that, Callender alleged, would have otherwise gone to Gearbox employees.\n\nThe lawsuit also contained Callender\u2019s claim that Pitchford had left a USB drive containing sensitive corporate documents and what the suit described as Pitchford\u2019s \u201cpersonal collection of \u2018underage\u2019 pornography\u201d at a local restaurant. Pitchford would later tell his side of the story on an episode of his magic podcast The Piff Pod, saying that the \u201ccam girl\u201d video he downloaded was of the \u201cbarely legal\u201d variety, or featured a woman who was 18 years old.\n\nThe most lurid of Callender\u2019s accusations was that Pitchford and his wife regularly hosted parties in which \u201cadult men reportedly exposed themselves to minors,\u201d a claim that Gearbox denied in a statement to Kotaku shortly after the original report.\n\nThe court hasn\u2019t yet published a document saying that it accepts the joint motion of dismissal, but it\u2019s looking like that\u2019s just a formality at this point, since the scheduled court dates for these lawsuits have now been cancelled on the docket of the District Court of Dallas County. The parties also requested the case be dismissed \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d a legal term that means it can\u2019t be revisited at a future date. For now, it seems, the whole litigious saga is over.", "description": "The messy legal battle in which Gearbox Software and its CEO Randy Pitchford have been embroiled with the company\u2019s former lawyer Wade Callender for almost a year has come to an end, with both sides agreeing to apologise, drop the matter and never speak of it again....", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/upm7wvjfkkpfd6x1romj.jpg"}
