It\u2019s a fascinating link, to say the least. But as summer approaches, it might be an important thing to keep in mind. Here\u2019s how this particular study went and what it means for you\u2026As you may know, the body\u2019s circadian clock (or rhythm) is the 24-hour internal clock that tells you when to wake up, be alert, get drowsy, and go to sleep. The circadian clock is your body\u2019s central clock (located in a tiny region of the brain\u2019s hypothalamus) and it controls many other peripheral clocks. These peripheral clocks govern the rest of your cells\u2014and I mean each and every cell, from your brain and liver cells to your fat and skin cells, and everything in between. The central clock is responsible for keeping all the peripheral clocks in sync with the Earth\u2019s rotation. The circadian clock also controls a host of body functions. According to this study, \u201cThe direct and indirect targets of the circadian clock encode key regulators of many, if not most, biological processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation, and response to therapeutic treatment.\u201d Research has shown that the circadian clock even plays a role in skin biology and aging. In addition to processes like the hair growth cycle, it regulates how the skin responds to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It does this in part by controlling the release of an enzyme called XPA, which is involved in the repair of your DNA. XPA levels are higher during the daytime hours and significantly lower at night. In fact, the skin is more likely to develop a tumor overnight because the release of reparative XPA is so low in the evening hours. Despite all these links between the circadian clock and skin that researchers\n\nUnlimited access to food\n\nEarly daytime feeding\n\nMidday feeding\n\nEarly night feeding\n\nLate night feeding\n\ndo know about, less is known about outside factors that influence the clock/skin connection. For instance, fasting has been shown to change factors related to the circadian clock, but whether or not the time you eat affects the skin has never been examined\u2026until now. Researchers took it upon themselves to investigate whether food intake/restriction can change the skin\u2019s \u201cdaily clock.\u201d In other words, could eating at times that go against your internal clock affect your skin, and if so, how? They divided mice into five groups and fed each of them on different schedules:The results showed that the mice that ate only during the day (which is not typical for them, considering they are nocturnal) sustained more skin damage when exposed to UVB radiation. (the sun\u2019s UVB rays burn the superficial layers of the skin and are involved in the development of skin cancer.) Part of the explanation for this is that the enzyme XPA shifted its normal daily cycle and was less active during the day\u2014which is when it is usually at its peak. On the other hand, mice that ate at night (as they usually do in nature) did not have altered XPA cycles, so they were less likely to suffer UVB sun damage. The researchers wrote, \u201cThis work shows that time of feeding is an important regulator of skin function\u2026 Our results indicate that timing of food intake has a more pronounced influence on skin biology than previously recognized, representing a modifiable regulator of skin health.\u201d While it\u2019s still too early to know if this discovery applies to humans, researchers believe that what time of day or night you eat may very well:\n\nShift the phases of your skin\u2019s circadian clock;\n\nAlter the release of enzymes (like XPA) and other genes that usually function during the daytime hours; and\n\nCause significant changes in your skin.\n\nThis study provides further proof that messing with your body\u2019s internal clock can have far-reaching consequences. Another example of this is the health dangers posed by nightshift work. The body innately wants and needs sleep at night when it\u2019s dark. If this doesn\u2019t happen every night as it should, the repercussions can be disastrous. Long-term nightshift work, and the corresponding shift in circadian rhythm, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, depression, infertility, and cancer. In the case of this study, the solution is pretty simple: Curb your late-night snacking. I know this can be hard to do if you get a craving for something sweet. But one suggestion I give my patients is to brush and floss their teeth right after dinner. After putting forth the effort to floss, especially, most people decide it\u2019s not worth it to eat again. It also helps to include a good amount of protein in your dinner. One study found that eating high-protein meals during the day cut cravings by 60 percent and the hankering for a late-night snack by 50 percent. If the craving just won\u2019t die, make yourself a hot cup of green tea (unsweetened, of course) or drink a tall glass of water. Sometimes the body confuses thirst for hunger, and drinking something stops the hunger pangs. If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s becoming more and more clear, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t trick your body into going against its innate internal clock. So instead of fighting your circadian rhythm, try to live your life in accordance to it. Your health will be better for it.\n\nReferences", "description": "Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center recently .09/02/2019 3:00:32AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
