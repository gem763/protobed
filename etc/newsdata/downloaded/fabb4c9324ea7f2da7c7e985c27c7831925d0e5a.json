Pramila Jayapal was acting chair of a House Judiciary Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee meeting at which former ICE Director Tom Homan was testifying. Republican Rep. Andy Biggs offered Homan some of his time to respond to \u201canything\u201d he had heard during the lengthy hearing. Homan took the opportunity to address comments made by Rep. Jayapal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to respond to acting chairman Jayapal and your comment about the Trump Administration moving money around for more detention beds,\u201d Homan said. He continued, \u201cI\u2019d like to remind you under the Obama Administration we did that most of the years he was president. We moved money around DHS, it\u2019s called reprogramming. We did that under the Obama Administration and I don\u2019t remember any hearings on that.\n\n\u201cAnd also, I\u2019d like to remind you that under the Obama Administration, I mean you\u2019re quick to point out, the cages were built under the Obama Administration. I was there. Family detention, we had 100 family beds under the Obama Administration, we built 3,000 more. So when there was a surge in FY-14, FY-15 on the border, Congress was quick to give all the money we needed the detention facilities, transportation contracts. We reprogrammed money the majority of the years he was president. That was fine.\u201d\n\nWhen Homan was finished, Rep. Jayapal replied, \u201cSince you addressed some comments at me I\u2019ll just say that I didn\u2019t like it under the Obama administration either.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut being honest with the American people,\u201d Homan interjected.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Jayapal said, banging her gavel.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t point out faults in the Trump administration when it happened under the Obama administration,\u201d Homan said as Jayapal banged the gavel again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s dishonesty,\u201d Homan said. Bang!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic and it\u2019s sad,\u201d Homan concluded.\n\nRep. Jayapal then reminded Homan that he had testified in favor of an Obama administration border effort in 2016.\n\n\u201cMay I respond to that?\u201d Homan asked.\n\n\u201cNo, you may not,\u201d Jayapal replied.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Homan said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just a warm-up to what happens in the second half of this clip. Rep. Jayapal asked Homan to \u201crespect the chair\u2019s authority\u201d and when he interrupted again and called the hearing a \u201ccircus\u201d she shouted his name and slammed the gavel down repeatedly.\n\nThe cynical part of me thinks Homan is doing this, at least in part, because Corey Lewandowski got favorable reviews from the White House for not showing much respect for his congressional interrogators at a recent hearing. Homan did appear on Fox & Friends this morning to recount his appearance.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democrats\u2019 treatment of ICE, including claims that detention centers are \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d has made this such a partisan circus that it\u2019s impossible to fault Homan for saying so. Rep. Jayapal, it should be noted, was the co-sponsor of an \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d bill last year, so that may be one reason there appears to be no love lost here on either side.\n\nBelow is the highlight reel.
