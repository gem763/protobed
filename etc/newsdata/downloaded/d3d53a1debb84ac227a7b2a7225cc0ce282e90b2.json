Usually black in color, the nevus can be flat but can also be raised or bumpy. Excessive hair growth on the nevus is also common.\n\nMINNESOTA MAN CONTRACTS RARE FUNGAL INFECTION THAT KILLED HIS DOG LAST YEAR\n\n\u201cAffected individuals may feel anxiety or emotional stress due to the impact the nevus may have on their appearance and their health. Children with giant congenital melanocytic nevus can develop emotional or behavior problems,\u201d the National Library of Medicine states.\n\nThose born with the condition are at a higher-than-normal risk for melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Congenital melanocytic nevus is extremely rare, occurring in about one in every 20,000 newborns in the U.S.\n\nLuna\u2019s mother, Carol, told South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency, she was in \u201ccomplete shock\u201d when her now almost 7-month-old daughter was born, noting it took several days for doctors to determine what the marking was caused by.\n\n\u201cMy last ultrasound before the birth had revealed nothing abnormal,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 35-year-old mom said she has sought advice from numerous doctors across the country, from Florida to New York, as well as in Boston and Chicago.\n\n\u201cThe doctors in the US kept giving me different advice, I felt so lost, and didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, noting many recommended laser treatments.\n\nA surgeon-oncologist in Russia, Dr. Pavel Borisovich Popov, saw Luna\u2019s story in a local paper and reached out to Carol and her husband, 32-year-old Thiago Tavares, in the hopes of helping the young girl.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks I\u2019m crazy to go to Russia, but I have done a lot of research and gained advice from several doctors and I really think that this is the best option for Luna right now,\u201d Carol told SWNS. \u201c[The doctor] said he had some options for Luna that weren\u2019t available in the USA yet.\u201d\n\nIn the hopes of bettering their child\u2019s condition, Carol said she plans to travel to Krasnodar in southern Russia to meet with Popov. Her husband plans to stay in Florida to manage day-to-day responsibilities.\n\nAfter an evaluation, Popov will perform six to eight surgeries on Luna over the next 18 months in the hopes of bettering her nevus. SWNS did not make clear what the surgeries will entail or why the treatment is considered innovative.\n\nEach procedure is expected to cost $25,000, according to the outlet. An online fundraiser has been created for the family in the hopes of offsetting the high costs.\n\nTo date, roughly $32,000 of the $98,000 goal had been raised.\n\n\u201cIt will be a huge relief if it works for Luna,\u201d Carol said, noting she hopes the surgeries are completed before her daughter begins school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to get bullied. People ask if it\u2019s contagious and say really mean things,\u201d she said. \u201cOne time we were at church, and a girl sitting next to us said to her mother, 'Wow, look at her. What a monster.'\"\n\nMEDICAL STUDENT WITH RARE DISEASE FINDS POSSIBLE CURE FROM STUDYING HIS OWN BLOOD SAMPLES\n\nThough the various comments have angered Carol, she now treats each situation as a learning opportunity.\n\n\u201cNow, I answer with the education I have regarding the condition,\" said Carol. But, she noted, \u201cSometimes I still get mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will teach her how to deal with some bad comments and bad people,\" the mom added. \"She is really strong. I need to prepare her.\u201d", "description": "A Florida toddler who was born with a marking on her face that resembles a\u00a0 \u201cBatman\u201d mask will soon travel to Russia in the hopes of receiving an innovative treatment for a rare skin condition.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
