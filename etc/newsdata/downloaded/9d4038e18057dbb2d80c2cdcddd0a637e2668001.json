Period.\"\n\nHe said it would be a \"terrible example to set to the rest of society\".\n\n\"The only form of Brexit which we will have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed,\" he said.\n\n\"Surely, in 2019, in modern Britain, in a parliamentary democracy, we - parliamentarians, legislators - cannot in all conscience be conducting a debate as to whether adherence to the law is or isn't required.\"\n\nHe called it \"astonishing\" that \"anyone has even entertained the notion\".\n\nIf the government comes close to disobeying the Act, the MP said that Parliament \"would want to cut off such a possibility and do so forcefully\".\n\n\"If that demands additional procedural creativity in order to come to pass, it is a racing certainty that this will happen, and that neither the limitations of the existing rule book nor the ticking of the clock will stop it doing so,\" he added.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Boris Johnson has said he would rather 'die in a ditch' than seek a further Brexit delay\n\nHe also compared any attempt to shun the law over the extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - with a bank robber excusing their crime by giving their stolen cash to charity.\n\n\"One should no more refuse to request an extension of Article 50 because of what one might regard as the noble end of departing from the EU as soon as possible, than one could possibly excuse robbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards,\" he said.\n\nThe law forcing the PM to seek a delay unless MPs vote for a deal or no deal received royal assent on Monday, the final day that MPs sat in this session.\n\nParliament was prorogued for five weeks in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, but the new law passed by MPs could extend that deadline.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Johnson insisted the UK \"will be ready\" to leave the EU by the current deadline without an agreement \"if we have to\".\n\nIn response to the publication of the government's Yellowhammer document, an assessment of a reasonable worst-case scenario in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Johnson reiterated it was \"the worst-case scenario\".\n\n\"In reality we will certainly be ready for a no-deal Brexit if we have to do it and I stress again that's not where we intend to end up,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nMr Bercow has announced he will stand down as Commons Speaker and MP at the next election or on 31 October, whichever comes first.", "description": "The Speaker is also warning the government not to ignore laws passed by the House of Commons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14CB8/production/_108767158_c5cd0800-9a3b-4702-93ae-003989e068ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
