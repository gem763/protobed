Period.\"\n\nHe said it would be a \"terrible example to set to the rest of society\".\n\n\"The only form of Brexit which we will have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed,\" he said.\n\n\"Surely, in 2019, in modern Britain, in a parliamentary democracy, we - parliamentarians, legislators - cannot in all conscience be conducting a debate as to whether adherence to the law is or isn't required.\"\n\nHe called it \"astonishing\" that \"anyone has even entertained the notion\".\n\nIf the government comes close to disobeying the law, Mr Bercow said that Parliament \"would want to cut off such a possibility and do so forcefully\".\n\n\"If that demands additional procedural creativity in order to come to pass, it is a racing certainty that this will happen, and that neither the limitations of the existing rule book nor the ticking of the clock will stop it doing so,\" he added.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Boris Johnson has said he would rather 'die in a ditch' than seek a further Brexit delay\n\nThe new law could force a Brexit delay beyond the current 31 October deadline by requiring the prime minister to request an extension to the UK's EU membership.\n\nThis would be done by making him write to EU leaders to prolong talks under Article 50 - the part of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU.\n\nThe law forcing the PM to seek a delay unless MPs vote for a deal or no deal received royal assent on Monday, the final day that MPs sat in this session.\n\nParliament was suspended - or prorogued - in the early hours of Tuesday and is not scheduled to return until 14 October.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the government would abide by the law, but would \"test to the limit\" what it requires of ministers.\n\nMr Bercow said: \"One should no more refuse to request an extension of Article 50 because of what one might regard as the noble end of departing from the EU as soon as possible, than one could possibly excuse robbing a bank on the basis that the cash stolen would be donated to a charitable cause immediately afterwards.\"\n\nSir Bernard, who chairs the constitutional affairs select committee in Parliament, said the Commons should \"adapt itself\" to a new role for the Speaker.\n\nHe accused Mr Bercow of launching a \"personal attack\" on the prime minister, insisting this would have been \"unthinkable 10 or 15 years ago\".\n\nThe current position allows the occupant \"unregulated and untrammelled power\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"It's a kind of majoritarian dictatorship position,\" he added.\n\nAnother Leave-voting Conservative MP, Michael Fabricant, said Mr Bercow had brought the office of Speaker into disrepute:\n\nHowever, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Bercow was simply \"exercising his proper role, which is to protect the right of Parliament\".\n\nHe said a \"sizeable number\" of MPs across all political parties were against allowing the PM to \"push us into a no-deal Brexit\".\n\nSuch an outcome would be \"against the will of Parliament, and I actually think against the will of the people as well,\" he added.\n\nYellowhammer warnings\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Johnson insisted the UK \"will be ready\" to leave the EU by the current deadline without an agreement \"if we have to\".\n\nIn response to the publication of the government's Yellowhammer document, an assessment of a reasonable worst-case scenario in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Johnson reiterated it was \"the worst-case scenario\".\n\n\"In reality we will certainly be ready for a no-deal Brexit if we have to do it and I stress again that's not where we intend to end up,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nMr Bercow has announced he will stand down as Commons Speaker and MP at the next election or on 31 October, whichever comes first.\n\nThe House of Commons has confirmed an election to choose his successor will take place on Monday 4 November.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House\n\n'No reason to be optimistic'\n\nThe Speaker's warning came as the EU's chief Brexit negotiator told political leaders in the European Parliament on Thursday that he could not say whether contacts with the UK government would result in a deal by mid-October.\n\nMichel Barnier, in a speech to MEPs, suggested that negotiating a new withdrawal agreement remained uncertain despite discussions between Mr Johnson's team and the EU.\n\n\"I cannot tell you objectively whether contacts with the government of Mr Johnson will be able to reach an agreement by mid-October,\" he said.\n\n\"While we have previously reached an agreement, as far as we can speak, we have no reason to be optimistic.\"\n\nHe added: \"We will see in the coming weeks if the British are able to make concrete proposals in writing that are legally operational.\"", "description": "The Speaker says MPs will show \"creativity\" to avoid being bypassed, but is accused of being \"politicised\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n77lp.jpg"}
