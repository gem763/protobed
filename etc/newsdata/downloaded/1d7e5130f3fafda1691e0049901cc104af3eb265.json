(AP) - When Genevieve Gaignard creates a photograph, she says she tries to present new ways of \u201caddressing and unpacking\u201d the issues surrounding race, class and gender - and she\u2019s the subject of her own work.\n\n\u201cSo often, these topics are avoided because we don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Gaignard, formerly of Wendell. \u201cI use myself as the subject of my work to address my own experiences and curiosities as a biracial woman.\u201d\n\nGaignard said she \u201cplays with stereotypes as a way to confront the ways in which we cast judgment on people that often don\u2019t truly speak to that person\u2019s story and identity.\u201d\n\nThe local artist, who grew up in the Quabbin region and currently lives in Los Angeles, said there are different entry points to her work and the audience brings its own experiences when viewing it. She\u2019s typically dressed in vintage clothing in her photos. In one called \u201cGlow Up,\u201d for instance, you see her silhouette in front of an illuminated cross, while in another called \u201cExtra Value (After Venus),\u201d she stands in front of an American flag holding fast food.\n\n\u201cThere are no rules as to what you are supposed to walk away with, but my hope is that it challenges and shifts people\u2019s perspectives in a positive way,\u201d she said.\n\nGaignard, 30, said it became clear to her what she wanted to address in her art while she was attending the Yale University School of Art.\n\nShe said in 2012, she was living in Wendell and working at its country store while doing photography. She had taken photography classes at Greenfield Community College and wanted to attend Yale, but couldn\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s when friends, family and community members came together to hold \u201cYale or Bust,\u201d and raised enough (more than $16,000 - the program cost more than $32,000) for her to attend the two-year graduate program.\n\n\u201cThe event was held at Wendell Town Hall,\u201d said the 1999 Ralph C. Mahar Regional School graduate. \u201cBeing a professional artist wasn\u2019t on the horizon after I finished high school and took classes at GCC. And now, here I am.\u201d\n\nGaignard said she was a baker in her early career, which was just another form of artistry. Now, she\u2019s a photographer - her true passion - and also does mixed media and installation art.\n\n\u201cDuring my time at Yale, I was drawn to the students that were making work about their \u2018black experience,\u2019 and quickly realized that I, too, had a story to share about what it is to be black in America,\u201d she said. Her mother is white and her father is black. She said her perspective is that of a biracial woman seen most often as white, though.\n\n\u201cI feel there is real importance in including my perspective to the conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nGaignard focuses on photographic self-portraiture, sculpture and installation to explore important social issues. She said her childhood was marked by a \u201cstrong sense of invisibility,\u201d during which she was never sure if her family was white enough to be white or black enough to be black.\n\nShe said she \u201cpositions her own female body as the chief site of exploration - challenging viewers to navigate the powers and anxieties of intersectional identity.\u201d\n\nHer influences include Billy Stewart, John Waters and the provocative artifice of drag culture. She said she uses \u201clow-brow pop sensibilities to craft dynamic visual narratives,\u201d and uses humor, persona and popular culture to \u201creveal the ways in which meeting and mixing of contrasting realities can feel much like displacement.\u201d\n\nGaignard has a master\u2019s degree in photography from Yale and a bachelor\u2019s degree in photography from the Massachusetts College of Art. She exhibits throughout the United States, and has shown at Studio Museum in Harlem, N.Y., the California African American Museum in Los Angeles and the Houston Center for Photography in Texas. In 2017, her work was included in the Prospect.4 Triennial in New Orleans. Her work is in permanent collections in Harlem, California, Miami, New York, Seattle and Durham, N.C.\n\nHer work has been reviewed by major publications, and nine of her photos were recently featured in Vogue Italia Magazine for Gucci.\n\nGaignard said she has a \u201cunique process\u201d when creating her art.\n\n\u201cThe unique thing about my process is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily require me to go into the studio every day,\u201d she said. \u201cI spend a lot of time out in the world collecting vintage objects, and in that process, I get inspired for my next creations.\u201d\n\nGaignard said the objects that she is drawn to give a feeling of nostalgia - a concept she likes to incorporate in her practice.\n\n\u201cI would also say that I spend a lot of time observing others,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she drives around Los Angeles and sees a wide array of \u201cunique individuals\u201d who inhabit it.\n\n\u201cI start to think about how I can turn myself into these characters for my photographs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat then brings me back to the gathering process to find the clothing and wigs to take on this new form. Hair and makeup are such key signifiers that define how we see a person. My characters often challenge the expectations of femininity put upon us by society. I\u2019m interested in the performative aspect of \u2018stereotyped\u2019 femininity, which begs to be deconstructed. I want there to be a breakdown of what we perceive as perfection, because that\u2019s more like real life.\u201d\n\nShe said there\u2019s another layer to her work - the process of titling each piece.\n\n\u201cOften multi-faceted, my titles are a play on what is in the \u2018scene,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cUsing a reference, metaphor or pun adds another entry point into the work, and it challenges the viewer to see things in a different way.\u201d\n\nGaignard said she will most likely return to New England someday, but probably not in the near future. She said she misses the landscape very much.\n\n\u201cI feel like I can pause and reflect on where I\u2019ve been and what I have accomplished over the years, and I can get clarity on what I need to create next when I\u2019m there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also special to be closer to my family and friends. I look forward to making New England my base in the next few years.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2OTIuid\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Greenfield, Mass.)
