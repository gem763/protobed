But maybe not the way \u2018The Shop\u2019 had hoped.", "language": "en", "text": "The clip seemed designed to go viral: singer-rapper Lil Nas X earnestly responding to a question about his decision to come out just as he found fame with his country-trap hit, \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record-breaking 19 weeks.\n\nThe exchange unfolded on an episode of \u201cThe Shop,\u201d which aired on HBO Tuesday night, and is produced by LeBron James\u2019s digital brand, Uninterrupted. And it did go viral \u2014 but perhaps not in the way the show\u2019s creators had hoped.\n\n\u201cThe Shop\u201d features a rotating roster of sports figures, entertainers and business executives having frank discussions in a barbershop-like setting. Tuesday\u2019s episode also featured retired NFL star Rob Gronkowski, Cleveland Cavaliers player Kevin Love, Portland Trail Blazers shooting guard C.J. McCollum, Power 105.1 shock jock Charlamagne tha God and comedian Kevin Hart. The freewheeling conversation included such topics as mental health and why some athletes are more successful than others.\n\nWhen the discussion turned to Lil Nas X\u2019s industry-disrupting hit, the room filled with praise (\u201cYou won,\u201d Charlamagne told him) and questions \u2014 about why the song wasn\u2019t embraced as country music and whether the newcomer feels pressure to top the success of his debut single. Then Paul Rivera, an entertainment marketing exec and co-creator of the series, noted that on the heels of that success, Lil Nas X \u201cfelt it was important to make an announcement recently.\u201d\n\n[Lil Nas X came out of the closet on the last day of Pride Month. He let his lyrics tell the story.]\n\n\u201cHe said he was gay! So what?\u201d Hart piped to echoes from the show\u2019s other guests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about who cares. That\u2019s actually my question,\u201d Rivera continued. \u201cWhy did he feel it was necessary to come out and say that?\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s, like, being forced,\u201d Lil Nas X began. \u201cIt\u2019s just that knowing, like growing up, I\u2019m growing up to hate this sh--.\u201d\n\nThe camera flashed to Hart, who appeared puzzled. \u201cHate what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHomosexuality, gay people. Come on now, if you\u2019re really from the hood, you know,\u201d Lil Nas X said. \u201cFor me, the \u2018cool dude with the song\u2019 \u2014 on top of everything \u2014 to say this any other time, I\u2019m doing this for attention in my eyes. But if you\u2019re doing this while you\u2019re at the top, you know it\u2019s for real, and it\u2019s showing it doesn\u2019t really matter, I guess.\"\n\nThough the conversation did not appear contentious, the one-minute exchange prompted a strong reaction on Twitter, where some users slammed Hart for appearing to question whether homophobia was an issue. (Some accused him of \u201cgaslighting.\u201d) Lil Nas X, meanwhile, was praised for his measured response to the comedian, who notably stepped down from hosting this year\u2019s Oscars ceremony amid outcry over his past use of homophobic language \u2014 in a number of old tweets and a 2010 stand-up routine.\n\nAlthough several of the guests shared the clip, it did not appear on the timelines of the social media-savvy artist or Hart, who \u2014 as the Associated Press reported \u2014 was seriously injured in a car accident over the weekend.\n\nLil Nas X is a gift. He continues to be courageous and wise. But putting him in a situation to be gaslit by known homophobes about his choice to come out is terrible. pic.twitter.com/AAsGSlzmb0 \u2014 Frederick Joseph (@FredTJoseph) September 4, 2019\n\nThe emotional and intellectual labor that lil nas x had to expend by explaining, not only the effects, but the existence of homophobia to men older than him is more than disheartening.\n\n\n\nRemember, gaslighting is violence. pic.twitter.com/aO0jhYZ3LF \u2014 zellie (@zellieimani) September 4, 2019\n\n\"He said he was gay. So what!\" Kevin Hart knows exactly what the \"so what\" is here and why a young black boy would closet his sexuality until he believed it was safe. Why not simply listen, give @LilNasX the space and deference to tell his own story... https://t.co/8nY9cHPftP \u2014 G O L D I E. (@goldietaylor) September 4, 2019\n\nRivera moved on to ask whether professional athletes have the freedom to publicly address their sexuality. \u201cAbsolutely not. Because you would see it more in the NFL and the NBA,\u201d Charlamagne said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it more in music, you\u2019ve seen it more in entertainment. You don\u2019t see it really in the sports world.\u201d\n\nMcCollum and Love agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s the stigma, or idea, around a sport\u2019s locker room,\u201d Love added.\n\nBut Hart wanted to return to the subject of Lil Nas X. He raised his hand, joking that he knew the show\u2019s editor would cut to him.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to say is Lil Nas X, in no way should you ever have to defend \u2018but guys, this is what I am.\u2019 That\u2019s not it. It\u2019s \u2018guy\u2019s, this is what I\u2019m going to do. My reason for doing this is because I know I do this well.\u2019 When you have a voice, and you simply say this, there is no back and forth about what this is. Nothing else needs to be said.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when all of that sh \u2014 gets started about, \u2018but he\u2019s not,\u2019 \u2018but they said,\u2019 you now don\u2019t give a f--- because your sentence is already written,\u201d Hart added.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the exchange was at all edited for the episode. HBO directed questions to Uninterrupted \u2014 a representative for the platform did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Washington Post.\n\nHart did not directly address his Oscars fallout on Tuesday\u2019s episode but seemed to allude to the controversy when Uninterrupted CEO Maverick Carter asked him about comedians being increasingly criticized for their material. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d the comedian quipped before taking a large swig of his wine.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned as a guy that\u2019s experienced it firsthand: you can\u2019t ignore people. For the first time in our world and our generation, we get to listen to people,\u201d Hart said. \u201cToday\u2019s times gives everybody the opportunity to go ' I feel,' \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I this.\u2019 You can\u2019t ignore it because then you\u2019re not of the people. It doesn\u2019t mean that you have to change \u2014 you\u2019ve got to understand and you\u2019ve got to acknowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo as a comedian, some choose to say \u2018I hear you\u2019 and some choose to say \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m going to be me,\u2019 \u201d Hart continued. \u201cThe choice that overall, I think, eventually, we\u2019re coming to, is understanding. As a man, as a person of the people, I don\u2019t want to separate white, black, gays, non-gays, fat, skinny, global. How do I make all these people laugh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get to [a] space \u2026 where you go \u2018if my job is to make people happy how am I doing it?\u2019 And if I\u2019m not doing it the way people think I should, how do I let people know that my gesture overall is to do that,\u201d he concluded.\n\nHart was then asked if his comedy had changed as a result of the increased feedback he referenced.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. Because I\u2019ve grown as a comic,\u201d he said, noting that he is not \u201ca malicious comedian\u201d and that much of his material has focused on himself and his family. \u201cSo it hasn\u2019t altered me, but I\u2019m more conscious.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFrom TikTok smash to Billboard record-breaker: How \u2018Old Town Road\u2019 gamed the system and won the summer\n\nHow \u2018The Breakfast Club,\u2019 home to brash hosts and irate rappers, became a one-of-a-kind campaign stop", "description": "A clip of the exchange prompted some to accuse Hart of \"gaslighting\" Lil Nas X.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
