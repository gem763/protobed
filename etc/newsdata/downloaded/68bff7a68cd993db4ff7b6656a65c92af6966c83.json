The footage was taken on the same day as Hong Kong announced a ban on face masks.\n\nA video published by Ruptly on Friday shows a JPMorgan private banker shouting to a group of journalists \u201cWe are all Chinese.\u201d But before he is able to enter his office building, a masked protester pounces on him, punching him repeatedly on the shoulder, neck and head.\n\nHunched over against a wall, the banker is later seen being escorted to safety by a group of colleagues.\n\nJPMorgan circulated a memo to its employees about the incident, reassuring them that \u201cadditional security\u201d had been put in place but advising \u201cnon-essential employees\u201d to work from home over the weekend.\n\nThe unsettling footage was taken on the same day that the city\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced that she would invoke a British colonial-era emergency law to impose a temporary ban on face masks. The move follows chaotic clashes between demonstrators and police that occurred on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nLam warned that violent protesters \u2013 almost all of them masked \u2013 were \u201cdestroying the city\u201d and that authorities could not allow the situation to get \u201cworse and worse.\u201d\n\nThe ban, which will be put into effect on Saturday, applies to all types of face coverings and will be enforced for all public gatherings, even ones which have been officially sanctioned by the government.\n\nDating from 1922, when Hong Kong was a British colony, the Emergency Regulations Ordinance allows the city\u2019s chief executive to issue temporary laws without parliamentary approval. Lam said the ban meant that Hong Kong was \u201cin a state of serious public danger\u201d but stressed that the threat did not yet warrant a formal state of emergency.\n\nAlso on rt.com Hong Kong police defend use of live fire during protests, say officers\u2019 lives were in danger\n\nCountless videos and photographs document how masked protesters have destroyed public infrastructure, set fires, and assaulted bystanders and police alike.\n\nTuesday\u2019s unrest marked the first time that police used live fire against the demonstrators, after a masked mob surrounded and assaulted a riot cop. The officer fought back, shooting an 18-year-old student in the chest from close range. The student was hospitalized and remains in a stable condition.\n\nThe months-long protests were originally against a now-abandoned extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be transferred to mainland China. In recent weeks, the demonstrations have taken on a broader \u2013 and increasingly violent \u2013 anti-China sentiment.\n\nLike this story?
