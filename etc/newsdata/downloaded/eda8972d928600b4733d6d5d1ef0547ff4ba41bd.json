That's something I won't have to put up with anymore.'\n\n\"Don't say that,\" Daniel responded, but as a tear trickled down her face Sinead admitted: 'Silver linings. We're on the home stretch,'\n\nThe episode ended on a sombre note, as Daniel held their son close and said: 'I know we are.'\n\nHard: After being told that she had just weeks to live, Sinead was sick during a family picnic, and she finally told Daniel that her death was imminent\n\nEmotional: Despite trying to keep it together for his wife, Daniel couldn't hide his own emotions, as viewers will see Sinead pass away next week\n\nViewers were on the brink of tears as they rushed to social media to reflect on the heart-wrenching moments.\n\nOne posted: 'So heavy going but so exceptionally portrayed! A story that needs telling, that's for sure. Superb acting.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Sinead makes me cry, I still want to hug her [sic],' while a third added: 'I love Sinead, Daniel and baby Bertie scenes. I'm gonna cry at next weeks episodes. @KatiexMcGlynn & @Rob_Mallard are phenomenal with this storyline.'\n\nDistraught: Emotional viewers took to social media through their tears to praise soap bosses for tackling the issue storyline, while also admitting they struggled to watch the sad scenes\n\nOne fans also posted: 'Sinead and Daniels scenes are so sad. Talking about such small things we take for granted, makes you realise how lucky you are.'\n\nAnother added: 'Sinead is so brave ''we're on the home straight'' my heart goes out to her and Daniel, even tho it's a story.'\n\nNext week Corrie fans will say goodbye to Sinead, as she passes away in a scene that is expected to leave viewers in tears.\n\nBut her final days are not without drama, as a devastated Daniel kisses Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) in the midst of trying to drink away his pain.\n\nWhile he does come clean to his wife before her passing, she forgives him before dying peacefully with son Bertie at her side.\n\nCoronation Street continues on Friday at 7:30pm and 8:30pm.
