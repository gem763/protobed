When we are deprived of oxygen, there is a rise in the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). This then boosts the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. The researchers found that when oxygen levels drop, a protein known as HIF increases. In normal conditions, HIF is broken down quickly and easily. But when there is a lack of oxygen the protein builds up and binds to segments of DNA near the gene for EPO. The discovery could prove crucial in a wide-range of fields, from treating diseases to foetal development and exercise. In cancer, tumours can hijack the oxygen regulating process and trigger the development of new blood vessels, making it easier for the cancer to grow. This is an area that is under investigation for new ways to treat and cure the killer disease. Forcing the body to make more red blood cells could also be a method to treat anaemia.\n\nThe discovery described a fundamental physiological process that explains how animals can thrive in some of the highest altitudes on Earth.\n\nBut the findings could also prove crucial in a wide-range of fields, from treating diseases to foetal development and exercise.\n\nIn cancer, tumours can hijack the oxygen regulating process and trigger the development of new blood vessels, making it easier for the cancer to grow.\n\nThis is an area that is under investigation for new ways to treat and cure the killer disease.\n\nForcing the body to make more red blood cells could also be a method to treat anaemia.\n\nSir Paul Nurse, director of The Francis Crick Institute, and other experts have today praised the trio of scientists for their prize-winning research.\n\nHe said: 'These discoveries are based on innovative experiments, highly imaginative mechanisms, and a total dedication to absolute rigour.'\n\nProfessor Bridget Lumb, president of The Physiological Society, said: 'This year\u2019s Nobel Prize puts physiology front and centre. It shines a light on the vital research carried out by physiologists.\n\n'Cutting edge physiological research such as this is improving our understanding of how our bodies work and thereby helping keep us healthy.\n\n'Thanks to this research we know much more about how different levels of oxygen impact on physiological processes in our bodies.\n\n'This has huge implications for everything from recovery from injury and protection from disease, through to improving exercise performance.'\n\nThe prize was given to the trio of scientists by the Swedish Academy, which is made up of 18 members who are elected for life.\n\nIt was set up by prize founder Alfred Nobel who decided that the awards for physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be decided by separate bodies.\n\nThe other winners of this year's Nobel Prizes are to be announced over the next week and will include two literature laureates and the coveted Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nEvents began on today with the award for physiology or medicine. The physics prize is handed out Tuesday and the following day is the chemistry prize.\n\nThis year's double-header Literature Prizes will be awarded Thursday and the Peace Prize will be announced on Friday.\n\nThe economics prize - officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel - will be awarded on Oct. 14.\n\nThe 2018 literature prize was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy.\n\nThe body plans to award it this year, along with announcing the 2019 laureate.", "description": "Sir Peter Ratcliffe and US researchers William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza received the coveted award for their findings on\u00a0how cells  adapt when oxygen levels drop.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline", "James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19390410-0-image-a-4_1570444491923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
