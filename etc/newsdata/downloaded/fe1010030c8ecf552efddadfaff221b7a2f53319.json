Her pagan preaching on the campaign trail is highly unusual in American politics, and even probably uncomfortable for many political observers. Her proposal for a U.S. Department of Peace reads as if Williamson had just returned from a Peyote trip in the deserts of the American southwest.\n\nWhile her stances on policy make Williamson as left as they come, endorsing a Green New Deal, a universal basic income, single-payer health care, and reparations for slavery, her message of love and unity is refreshing in a toxic political environment where discourse is becoming impossible around the dinner table with those who disagree.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Justice", "Thefederalist.Com Marianne-Williamsons-Message-Love-Unity-America-Needs"], "top_image": ""}
