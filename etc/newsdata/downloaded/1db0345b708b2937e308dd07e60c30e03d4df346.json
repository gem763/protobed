We have been working diligently to bring the sandwich back to our restaurants soon, as we know our guests are anxiously anticipating its return,' Restaurant Brands International Inc, Popeyes' parent company, said in a statement.\n\n'As soon as we're ready to announce a date, we will let the world know!'\n\nPopeyes' CEO Guillermo Perales told WSJ that the sandwich will return to 150 locations - out of 2,600 total - in early November.\n\nPopeyes is credited with kicking off this summer's so-called Chicken Sandwich Wars when it introduced the offering in mid-August.\n\nThe sandwich sparked a fierce debate between Popeyes and Chick-fil-A fans that quickly expanded as other chains reminded customers of their existing versions and introduced new variations.\n\nOnline hysteria over the sandwich led to long lines at many Popeyes locations as sales dramatically eclipsed the company's expectations.\n\nPerales said some franchise owners initially hoped to sell more than 60 sandwiches per day, but some stores went through 1,000 instead.\n\nPopeyes responded to the explosive demand by limiting chicken sandwich supplies to franchises after the launch, but it wasn't enough to stop the sell-out.\n\n'People were very upset,' Perales said. 'A lot of people are asking and asking.'\n\nThe chain set mouths watering by putting up posters teasing that the sandwich would be back soon.\n\nIt has also been running a social media campaign inviting diners to Bring Your Own Bun and create their own sandwich out of chicken fingers.\n\nOnline hysteria over the sandwich led to long lines at many Popeyes locations as sales dramatically eclipsed the company's expectations and stores sold out\n\nPopeyes announced that the sandwich has sold out 14 days after it was released on August 12\n\nPopeyes has been running a social media campaign inviting diners to Bring Your Own Bun and create their own sandwich out of chicken fingers\n\nThe cheeky marketing tactics came as many customers grew irate over the wait.\n\nIn late August, an irate Popeyes customer climbed through a drive-thru window before brawling with three employees when he learned the sandwich was sold out.\n\nVideo and images of other Popeyes restaurant fights emerged online as well.\n\nIn early September, a group of diners at a Texas Popeyes tried to storm the local eatery at gunpoint after they were told there were no more chicken sandwiches left.\n\nA restaurant worker was able to lock the front door in time to prevent the group entering the chain, and they soon fled from the scene with empty stomachs.\n\nAnd Craig Barr, of East Ridge, Tennessee filed a $5,000 lawsuit against the fast food chain alleging false advertising' and 'deceptive business practices' by the company because he couldn't get his hands on their famous chicken sandwich.\n\nHe claims to have spent 'countless hours' driving around in an attempt to buy the sandwich.\n\nBarr claims while traveling to one location on Highway 58 he cracked a wheel rim costing him $1,500 and now he 'can't get happy,' Times Free Press wrote.\n\nThe civil case happened as Jose Cil, CEO of Restaurant Brands International, who own Popeyes, announced that he never expected the sandwich to 'break the internet' to CNN.\n\n'I have this sandwich on my mind. I can't think straight. It just consumes you,' Barr said. 'It's totally deceptive. Who runs out of chicken? It's a big fiasco. Someone has to stand up to big corporate.'\n\nIn his desperate bid to get one of the brioche, chicken and pickle sandwiches, he claims to have paid a man from Craigslist $25 for the food.\n\n'I got scammed,' he told Free Press.\n\nBarr blamed the corporation for getting 'everyone gassed up on them' and then running out.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed with Hamilton County court who scheduled a date for October 28 in Chattanooga.", "description": "Sales of the star sandwich came to a screeching halt at stores across the US two weeks after its August 12 launch when the fast food chain blew through three months worth of ingredients in a fortnight.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/17840850-0-image-a-26_1572207383312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
