(Elise Amendola/AP)\n\nMedicare is not free.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news.\n\nThe premiums alone can run thousands of dollars a year, and you can go broke if you get stuck in a hospital long enough.\n\nMedicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older, won\u2019t pay anything for a skilled nursing facility past 100 days, and the co-payment for days 21 through 100 will cost you $13,640.\n\nAnd finally, Medicare pays zero toward long-term care.\n\n\u201cThere are several myths about Medicare, and the first is that it is free,\u201d said consultant Diane Omdahl, adding that the coverage does not take care of all medical needs. \u201cPeople just think Medicare is going to be a cure-all. That\u2019s really, really wrong.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s plenty of free help available. And even with its cost and coverage limits, Medicare is a good deal for most older people.\n\n\u201cIf I am paying health insurance based on my age in my early 60s, it\u2019s astronomically expensive,\u201d said Robert Spicknall, an employee benefits broker and adviser for the Virginia State Bar Members\u2019 Insurance Center. \u201cIf I am one of those people, I can\u2019t wait to get to 65 because Medicare is heavily subsidized by the federal government and much cheaper than private insurance.\u201d\n\n[This investment guarantees monthly checks for the rest of your life. But there\u2019s a downside.]\n\nCount me among those who are not eager to turn 65.\n\nI turned 64 last month and started researching Medicare in anticipation of joining the program\u2019s 60 million users. I knew next to nothing about it. I still know next to nothing about it. But I am learning.\n\nI naively thought that I could present a Medicare card to whatever doctor, hospital or pharmacy I chose and get the service or drugs I required. That is not the case.\n\nPlease consider this column the first of many bites at the Medicare apple. The subject is so massive and complicated that it is best approached piecemeal.\n\nThere are a number of personal considerations to factor in when formulating your approach to Medicare, starting with your health, wealth and lifestyle.\n\nThere are also things to know upfront. This is not easy stuff, and the stakes are high. You can make big mistakes, potentially putting your life on the line.\n\n[Paying for college comes down to managing expectations, for both parent and child]\n\nFor example, Original Medicare (Part A and Part B only) has no out-of-pocket maximum. Translation: There is no limit to what you might have to pay for certain services such as an extended hospital stay or chemotherapy.\n\nThere are enrollment timing rules. You have a seven-month window to enroll in Medicare, beginning three months before your 65th birthday. If you do not enroll within that window, you may be looking at higher costs and fewer options forever.\n\nAs with everything about Medicare, there is an asterisk attached to enrollment: If you have group insurance through a company with 20 or more employees, you do not have to enroll during the initial eligibility window.\n\nThe entry points for Medicare are Medicare.gov and the Social Security Administration (SocialSecurity.gov).\n\n[Arthur Cashin, wise to the ways of Wall Street]\n\nYou can make contact in one of three ways: phone, online or in person.\n\n\u201cYou enroll . . . and they send you a card,\u201d Spicknall said. \u201cThe key is to be on top of it.\u201d\n\nMy head is spinning from the various options, risks, combinations, fees, deductibles and premiums that are part of Medicare. There\u2019s Medicare, Medicare Advantage, prescription drug coverage and Medigap. Some you get through the federal government. Some you buy from private insurers. Some are a combination of both.\n\nYou will need help navigating the system. \u201cNobody knows this stuff themselves,\u201d Spicknall said. \u201cPeople rattle off terms like Part A and Part B, and Medicare and Medicaid, but there are few who really know.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Medicare.gov and the Social Security Administration, there are other sources of free help. A national network of State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs) has trained counselors to offer local, personalized assistance to Medicare enrollees and their families.\n\n[Saving for retirement is hard. Knowing how to spend it down is harder.]\n\nSHIPs can help answer questions about coverage, premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, or complaints and appeals. They can also advise you on joining or leaving a Medicare Advantage plan (similar to a health maintenance organization), any other Medicare plan or prescription drug plan.\n\nA friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid said he and his wife had good luck with the SHIPs. \u201cWe found our session very informative and productive,\u201d he said.\n\nHis one tip: Once you have a counselor on the telephone, don\u2019t let them go. \u201cNever rely on anyone to call you back who assures you they will,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHaving whacked our way through the brush with machete and pith helmet to enroll my wife,\u201d he said, \u201cI am in a much better position to deal with \u2018the process\u2019 that has so many moving parts and different entities when I am eligible in June. I honestly don\u2019t know how others deal with this.\u201d\n\n[Why you, too, should be \u2018a saver \u2026 and a buy-and-hold investor\u2019]\n\nIf you enroll but don\u2019t get it right the first time around, you can tweak your Medicare coverage once a year during open enrollment. The annual sign-up period runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.\n\nI asked Omdahl to provide some Medicare CliffsNotes to ease the process. Here are the highlights:\n\n\u25cfTiming is everything.\n\nThree months before your 65th birthday, start thinking about whether you want to enroll in Medicare. You will want to enroll in Medicare if you are retiring and will no longer be covered by your employer\u2019s insurance plan.\n\n\u25cfMedicare is not free.\n\nEveryone must pay Part B (medical services and supplies) insurance premiums, $135.50 a month in 2019.\n\nThere are also premiums for additional coverage: the Part D prescription drug plan, Medigap policies to supplement Medicare insurance, and some Medicare Advantage plans. (Part A, hospital insurance, is generally premium-free, according to the Medicare website.)\n\n[How to survive in volatile markets: Go live your life]\n\n\u25cfSome people pay more.\n\nHigher-income beneficiaries pay more for Parts B and D. This is known as the \u201cincome-related monthly adjustment amount,\u201d or IRMAA. IRMAA can add as much as $400 a month to your Medicare premium costs.\n\n\u25cfLower premiums do not mean lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe average Medicare Advantage premium is $29 a month. Zero-premium plans, which charge no more than regular Medicare Part B, also are available to most beneficiaries. However, these plans come with additional co-payments for health-care services.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans put a limit on out-of-pocket costs. Medicare sets a maximum of $6,700 a year for in-network services, those performed by participating doctors and other providers. Some Medicare Advantage plans offer lower limits.\n\n\u25cfMedicare pays nothing for long-term (custodial) care, whether provided in a facility or in the home.\n\nLong-term care comprises a range of services to meet health- or personal-care needs over an extended period. Most of this care involves assistance with personal tasks, such as bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or a chair, moving around, and using the bathroom. Medicare does not pay for these services. There is a 70 percent chance that someone turning 65 today will need long-term care services in their remaining years.\n\nLike I said, I am not eager to turn 65.", "description": "People 65 and older are preparing to make their health-care and prescription drug choices for 2020 through the federal program.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area", "October At Pm", "Thomas Heath Is A Local Business Reporter", "Various Companies Big", "Small In The Washington Metropolitan Area.
