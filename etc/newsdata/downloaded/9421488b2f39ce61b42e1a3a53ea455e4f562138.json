Here\u2019s why.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nPlease, don\u2019t fall for the hype around credit cards that give you cash back. The psychology behind this perk is all about getting you to spend more money.\n\nThere\u2019s been so much buzz lately about the newly introduced Apple Card. In particular, Apple touts the card\u2019s \u201ccompelling cash-back rewards program.\u201d\n\nOkay, let\u2019s look at Apple\u2019s cash-back feature.\n\n\u25cf Customers will receive 2 percent back every time they use Apple Card with its mobile wallet Apple Pay.\n\n\u25cf Card carriers get 3 percent cash back if they use the card for purchases made directly with Apple \u2014 including at Apple Stores, apple.com, the App Store, the iTunes Store and for Apple services.\n\n\u25cf Apple recently announced card users would also receive 3 percent cash back when they use the Apple credit card with Apple Pay for Uber and Uber Eats.\n\n\u25cf For purchases made with the physical titanium card, customers will get 1 percent back.\n\nGetting cash back seems like a win/win situation for credit issuers and consumers.\n\nLenders get money from merchants when consumers use their cards (although many businesses are passing along the processing fee either directly or in higher prices). If a cardholder doesn\u2019t pay off the bill in full, the card issuer collects interest. The variable interest rates on the Apple Card as of Aug. 2 ranged from 12.99 percent to 23.99 percent, according to the company.\n\nConsumers love cash back offers, boasting that they get free money for purchases they had planned to make anyway. I\u2019ll concede you may be actually getting a reward if your charges are for necessities. But are they?\n\nCash back is the most popular type of rewards credit card, with 49 percent of U.S. adults carrying at least one such card, according to a recent CreditCards.com report.\n\nBut let me burst your cash-back bubble.\n\nIf you spend $1,299 on a 13-inch MacBook Pro at the Apple store using the new Apple Card, you get $38.97 back. If you need the computer, that\u2019s a decent bonus.\n\nBut wait. You aren\u2019t ahead financially if your purchase is more of a want than a need. If you\u2019re upgrading your perfectly performing iPhone 8 to the new iPhone XS Max model, which has a retail price of $1,099, yes, you\u2019ll get $32.97 back. However, you\u2019ve spent $1,099 on something that wasn\u2019t a necessity.\n\nApple wins.\n\nYou lose.\n\nYou could have used the money to boost your emergency fund or reduce what you owe on your student loans.\n\nWhat if you invested the money instead?\n\nFor instance, you could take the $1,099 and invest it in a low-cost growth index fund. Instead of charging things on your Apple Card, you could invest the value of those purchases \u2014 let\u2019s say $5,000 each year \u2014 into an index fund. If the fund ended up with an annual return of 6 percent after 10 years, you could have $68,213.43, assuming all of your annual investments happen at the beginning of the year, according to the investment returns calculator at Bankrate.com.\n\nMinus your invested capital, you\u2019ve earned $17,114.43 (after a tax rate of 15 percent). Contrast this with cash back of $1,038.97 over 10 years from the computer you bought along with other purchases you made with the card through Apple Pay, earning 2 percent back.\n\nOf course, investing means putting your money at risk. But based on past stock market performance, you\u2019ll get more return for your money from the stock market. Let\u2019s say you invest in an index fund that seeks to track the investment performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, an unmanaged benchmark representing the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies. In the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a total return of 11.20 percent, according to investment research firm Morningstar.\n\nNeed I remind you that the cash back feature is a fool\u2019s errand if you don\u2019t pay your credit card off every month? According to the Federal Reserve in 2016, half of families with credit card debt had at least $2,300 of credit card debt carrying over month-to-month, while on average families with credit card debt had $5,700 of debt.\n\nThe average credit-card rate ranges from about 18 percent for people with good credit to about 25 percent for consumers with a lesser credit history, according to Ted Rossman, an industry analyst for Creditcards.com.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to pay these high rates in exchange for 1 percent, 2 percent or 3 percent in cash back, airline miles or hotel points,\u201d Rossman said. \u201cIf you have credit-card debt, you need to forget about rewards and prioritize your interest rate.\u201d\n\nIs a cash-back credit card worth it?\n\nFor many people, it\u2019s not. You might be overspending to get the reward. Or, the money you think you\u2019re earning won\u2019t come close to the cash you\u2019ll pay out if you don\u2019t pay your card off every month.\n\nIn the credit-card industry, nothing is really free.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.\n\nTo read previous Color of Money columns, go to wapo.st/michelle-singletary.", "description": "It\u2019s easy to convince yourself that you are getting free money while you shop.
