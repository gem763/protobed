It's natural in some cases. However, in the modern world, inequality in terms of human development is a manmade phenomenon. In India, the gap between the haves and have not is unfathomable to such an extent that at times talking about is rendered inconsequential. But, the reports that come time to time make us realise that the increasing bay of inequality is a ticking time bomb.\n\nreuters\n\nThe index released by UK-based charity Oxfam International's 'Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI), India is 147th among 157 countries on their commitment to reduce inequality which also shows how colossal the problem is and government\u2019s claims of massive changes in people\u2019s lives are just talks.\n\nOxfam also described India\u2019s commitment to decrease inequality under, \"A very worrying situation\" because India is a home to over 1.3 billion people.\n\n\"Oxfam has calculated that if India were to reduce inequality by a third, more than 170 million people would no longer be poor,\" the index notes.\n\nDon't Miss\n\n\"Government spending on health, education and social protection is woefully low and often subsidises the private sector. Civil society has consistently campaigned for increased spending,\" it adds.\n\nDenmark making huge efforts, while India fuelling inequality\n\nWhile India ranked 147th out of 157 countries, Denmark topped the list in reducing inequality. According to the Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index developed by Oxfam and Development Finance International, Nigeria, Singapore, India and Argentina are among the countries where the governments are fuelling inequality.\n\nCountries like South Africa, Namibia and Uruguay are taking strong measures to reduce inequality.\n\nThe US lacks commitment, others western countries are doing better\n\nThe US lacks the commitment to reduce the gap between their population, the report said. The other western countries, however, are doing better. The top ten include Germany (2nd), Finland (3rd), Austria (4th), Norway (5th), Belgium (6th), Sweden (7th), France (8th), Iceland (9th) and Luxembourg (10th).\n\nInequality in India can be seen from outer space https://t.co/JKlfHKwVBj pic.twitter.com/whedaIlPGw \u2014 The Star, Kenya (@TheStarKenya) May 27, 2018\n\nAmong rich countries, USA showed a lack of commitment towards closing the inequality gap.\n\nChina doing better than India\n\nChina does better in terms of ranking and it\u2019s placed at 81st on the list which means it\u2019s doing its bit better than India.\n\nreuters\n\nRegarding China, the report said it \"spends more than twice as much of its budget on health than India, and almost four times as much on welfare spending, showing a much greater commitment to tackling the gap between rich and poor\".\n\n\"What's most striking is how clearly the index shows us that combatting inequality isn't about being the wealthiest country or the one of the biggest economy. It's about having the political will to pass and put into practice the policies that will narrow the gap between the ultra-rich and the poor,\" Matthew Martin, Development Finance International's director, said.", "description": "But the reports that come time to time make us realise that the increasing bay of inequality is a ticking time bomb.
