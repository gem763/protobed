So he's had to play loads more football than I'd hoped.\n\n'Marcus is a centre forward who can play left, right and as a No 10. He wants to be able to play all the positions.'\n\nIt remains unclear how many additions the Norwegian manager wants to make in January given United's disastrous start to the 2019-20 season.\n\nMandzukic is believed to be available at around \u00a310m and would represent a short-term option in attack given he turns 34 in May at the end of the current campaign.", "description": "Manchester United's pursuit of Mario Mandzukic looks to have been handed a major boost with the striker reportedly ready to lower his wage demands to seal a move away from Juventus.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20061034-0-image-a-21_1571787049634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
