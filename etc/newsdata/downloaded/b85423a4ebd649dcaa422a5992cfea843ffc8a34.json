About mid-way during the campaign, he prevailed upon Labor HQ to poll the electorate, fearing it would fall.\n\nChisholm, like many of his Queensland counterparts, was worried right from the outset of the campaign that Labor was going to bomb north of the Tweed. Longman fell to the Liberals on election day, rounding out a miserable performance for Labor in Queensland and vindicating those fears.\n\nAs Labor rebuilds and recalibrates in the wake of that loss, Chisholm, who keeps a low public profile, made another salient observation on Wednesday.\n\nLead narrows\n\nApropos of nothing in particular, he took to Twitter to post an advertisement Labor began running in July 2007, just four months before the election that saw off the Howard government.\n\n\"Remember the time Kevin Rudd ran this TV ad during the 2007 Federal election campaign,'' Chisholm said of the commercial in which Rudd posed in a boardroom high above the Brisbane CBD and brazenly badged himself an economic conservative.\n\n\"The last time Labor won majority government. Kevin Rudd: Economic Conservative,'' Chisholm tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRudd, as this column detailed in May last year, filmed the ad because when a federal election approaches and there is a real prospect of dumping a Coalition government, the polls tighten. Why? Because voters are inherently cautious about handing the economy back to Labor, regardless of what shape it is in.\n\nRudd estimated that inherent reluctance was worth 2-to-3 percentage points off Labor's the two-party-preferred vote.\n\nThe ad went to air when Labor's lead was entrenched at 56 per cent to 44 per cent. On election day, that lead narrowed to 52.7 to 47.3.\n\nBefore the last election, the Coalition was lagging Labor by two or three percentage points. It banked on a similar closure as the federal election approached.\n\nOne could argue that the polls were not wrong, but that Labor did not start the 2018 campaign with a big enough buffer.\n\nLabor swings too far\n\nChisholm's reminder about where Labor needs to be positioned economically if it is to have a chance at the next election coincided with growing internal push by his friend and shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers and leader Anthony Albanese, to drag Labor back to the centre right.\n\nIt passes strange that Labor ever deviated from this path. After its thumping loss in 1996, Labor foolishly deserted the Hawke/Keating economic legacy because of the personal unpopularity of Keating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a classic case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Ever since, Labor has waxed and waned on economic philosophy and before the last election, it swung too far towards tax and spend.\n\nAs Keating remarked afterwards, some of the tax increases were wrong, especially the plan to increase the top marginal tax rate.\n\nThe revenue to have been raised from tax hikes should have been dedicated to lowering other taxes, not just increased spending.\n\nThe current recalibration is a delicate exercise internally because many who point to the narrowness of the May 18 loss, the other factors involved such as the unpopularity of Shorten and the crappy campaign.\n\nNegative gearing\n\nThey say the party should stick to the policies. This will not happen.\n\nSome policies will be junked but not all. There are - and will be - more robust internal discussions to be had.\n\nNegative gearing will be an interesting one. Labor's plan to restrict future negative gearing to new properties did it no harm at the 2016 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt became a negative in 2018 because the real prospect Labor might win rekindled scrutiny and fear campaigns. And the election coincided with greed-fuelled panic over a slump in property prices.\n\nThat turned out to be little more than an aberration and the market is going gangbusters again. Prices are once more absurd and if housing affordability is front and centre at the next election, negative gearing curbs may once again prove popular.\n\nWhile these policy arguments are to be had, the main thrust inside Labor is to skew economic philosophy back towards growing the pie rather than eating it.\n\nIn the last term of government, there were few voices inside Labor advocating a growth agenda, as well the need to work with business, not against it. Albanese was one, Chris Bowen, who worked the boardrooms assiduously, another. Both conspicuosly shied away from the \"top end of town\" language and it was Bowen who proposed the Australian Investment Guarantee to stimulate business investment, a policy the Coalition is about to pilfer. There were a few others, but not many, not publicly anyway.\n\nLabor faces credibility gap\n\nLast month, Albanese told caucus that ensuring fairness and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\"The Labor Party is the party of fairness, but we achieve fairness by making sure we have an economy that's growing,'' he said.\n\nChalmers is now making the same case. He did so in a keynote speech last weekend and has been making it to business as he blitzes boardrooms - 42 last month alone - to rebuild relations with the sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a relief to those of his colleagues who feels Chalmers needed to move out from under the shadow of his mentor Wayne Swan, who is very much in the camp of policy retention.\n\nOf course, the Coalition has always been of the view that a growth agenda is paramount. Morrison's mantra throughout the campaign was you couldn't fund essential services without a growing economy.\n\nLabor faces a credibility gap as it again shifts gears but feels if it starts now, by the time of the next election, a key Coalition strength would have at least been negated.", "description": "Labor threw out its Keating legacy and has struggled on the economy ever since.
