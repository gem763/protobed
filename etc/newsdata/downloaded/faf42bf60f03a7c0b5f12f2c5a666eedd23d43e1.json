All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines collectively cancelled more than 1,000 flights scheduled for Saturday, both domestic and international. Multiple airports throughout the country, including those serving Tokyo, Osaka and Sendai, also cancelled flights.\n\nRailway operators suspended service throughout the Tokyo region, as well as bullet train service between the capital and Osaka and between Osaka and Fukuoka, on the island of Kyushu. Trains are expected to resume running on Sunday morning.\n\nTokyo Disneyland was shut, its first weather-related closure since a snowstorm in 1984. The retail giant Seven & I Holdings said it would shut 124 outlets in the Tokyo area. Some 700 Lawsons convenience stores across the country also closed.\n\nIn Tokyo, where the streets had quietened and public transport services ground to a standstill by Saturday afternoon, tannoy announcements were made across the city recommending residents to stay indoors.\n\nMany department stores in and around the capital decided to halt trade for the day. Evacuations were also ordered in Kawasaki, one of the main districts forming the Greater Tokyo Area.\n\nBut as a city used to typhoons and built to withstand their effects, central Tokyo was fully prepared for the storm, with its effects eventually subsiding one hour before midnight.\n\nGeorge Beadle, a visiting England fan, said on Saturday morning he was struck by the initial sense of calm within the capital. \u201cEven this morning in torrential rain the supermarkets and shops are still open with people cycling down the road,\u201d he said from his accommodation in Shinjuku. \u201cThe only difference seems to be a shortage of water and breads in the supermarkets.\u201d\n\nJustin Moyse, who has spent the last seven years living in Tokyo, admitted it was rare for the city to find itself in the path of such a major storm.\n\n\u201cIn Tokyo the Japanese are very vigilant about these kind of natural disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are actually quite proactive and wary. It is rare for such a powerful typhoon to come straight through Tokyo.\n\n\u201cEven in Tokyo winds this strong can cause damage to windows and cars.\u201d\n\nThe greatest level of destruction was expected away from the central cities and storm-proof areas. The Chiba Prefecture, which lies to the east of Tokyo, remains particularly vulnerable, having yet to fully recover from the effects of Faxai which damaged buildings and left 900,000 people without power.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning the region was subject to a tornado, with one man killed after his car was flipped in high winds.\n\nSome supermarkets had ran out of bottled water and batteries by Friday afternoon, after officials advised residents in the area to prepare supplies for up to three days.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, also forced the cancellation of two matches at the Rugby World Cup \u2013 England\u2019s clash with France and New Zealand\u2019s encounter against Italy \u2013 while the Pool A decider between Japan and Scotland remains on red alert.", "description": "Japan is waiting to count the costs of the destruction wrought by Typhoon Hagibis after the storm, the strongest to hit in six decades, battered the country\u2019s main island with torrential rain and violent winds, leaving two people dead and forcing thousands to flee their homes.
