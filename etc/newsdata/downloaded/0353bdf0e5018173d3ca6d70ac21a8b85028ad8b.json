There\u2019s a handful, approximately three.\u201d\n\nA little bit later, Baier reiterated Herridge\u2019s point, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t see eight times Joe Biden being mentioned. I count three, tangentially. So some of the early reporting may have been something different.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the White House\u2019s own talking points distributed to allies (and inadvertently some Democrats) claimed it was a \u201cmyth\u201d that Trump \u201curged President Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Biden\u2019s involvement in securing the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor eight times,\u201d instead emphasizing that the president \u201creferred to Biden in only one exchange.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only Trump talking point that Baier seemed to repeatedly echo.\n\nA common refrain among the president and his allies has been that the transcript never explicitly spells out a quid pro quo expectation on Trump\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cTo the president\u2019s point, you don\u2019t see a direct quid pro quo in the language tying this to that,\u201d the Special Report anchor at one point declared. Trump, in turn, approvingly tweeted Baier\u2019s exact words as part of his ongoing social-media campaign to downplay the seriousness of the allegations related to Ukraine.\n\nFox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts echoed the same talking points as Baier on the absence of a direct quid pro quo, claiming \u201cthat language, or even that suggestion, exists nowhere in this document.\" Similarly pleased with Roberts\u2019 assessment, the president tweeted video of his on-air comments.\n\nOther ostensibly \u201cstraight-news\u201d anchors seemed to run interference for the president by using interviews to raise claims attacking Democrats while downplaying the actual controversies at hand.\n\nDaytime news anchor Harris Faulkner, meanwhile, interviewed Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel. Instead of asking any questions about the transcript, Faulkner floated questions about an RNC anti-impeachment fundraising initiative and asked McDaniel to respond to an opinion column by Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen. The column deflected from the ongoing scandal by arguing that Democrats are guilty of a \u201cdouble standard\u201d on Ukraine\u2014shockingly, both agreed with his assessment.\n\nIn kicking off an interview with Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX), America\u2019s Newsroom co-anchor Bill Hemmer dismissively claimed that it was just \u201cthe left\u201d that were \u201csuggesting the transcript is not a complete transcript, it\u2019s a bunch of notes put together, that\u2019s what the allegations are.\u201d\n\nBut the memo itself, however, specifically states that the transcript is \u201cnot a verbatim transcript\u201d and is based on the notes and recollections of officials assigned to listen to the call.\n\nAnd at Trump\u2019s Wednesday press conference in New York, Fox Business Network reporter Kristina Partsinevelos helped the president deflect from the mounting scandal by asking about how \u201cmarkets reacted positively\u201d to his comments on China, further proclaiming: \u201cI want to talk about markets because I\u2019ll leave it to everybody else to talk about impeachment.\u201d\n\nAnd even prior to Wednesday\u2019s release of the memo, Fox News reporter Ed Henry (the network\u2019s former chief White House correspondent) uncritically provided a hefty dose of pre-emptive spin from the White House itself.\n\nWhile hosting The Daily Briefing last week, Henry began a panel discussion by revealing \u201cnew reporting\u201d on the whistleblower complaint that was ultimately just the airing of anonymous and vague spin from the White House.\n\n\u201cI just got off the phone, before the show, with a senior administration official who reached out and said the following,\u201d he reported. \u201cFirst thing, \u2018the media needs to\u2014better be careful with this,\u2019 this official told me. Saying \u2018there is no there there\u2019 in terms of the substance of an alleged deal the president cut with the Ukrainian president.\u201d\n\nAppearing on Hannity several nights later, Henry once again credited a \u201csenior administration official\u201d as relaying to him the news that the whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine scandal has a \u201cpolitical bias in favor of a rival political candidate of President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Fox hard-news reporter declared that the call\u2019s transcript would reveal no \u201csmoking gun\u201d and be \u201cnowhere near as inflammatory as some in the media have suggested.\u201d adding that the senior official did warn that a \u201cfew words in the transcript that will raise eyebrows and political headaches for the White House.\u201d\n\nThere were, however, a handful of Fox News anchors who offered more laser-focused coverage of the president\u2019s request for a foreign power to tip the scales of a U.S. election.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith seemed to criticize some of his pro-Trump Fox News colleagues who have pushed the misleading counter-narrative that Biden sought the ouster of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor because he was probing a company the ex-veep\u2019s son was involved with.\n\nLater in the day, Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace asserted on-air that there is \u201csome meat on the bones\u201d of an impeachment inquiry, both \u201cin terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call.\u201d\n\nAnd later that evening, Martha MacCallum grilled White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley about the timeline of aid to Ukraine and why Trump would bother to ask another country to assist with undermining anl election rival immediately after the conclusion of the Mueller probe on 2016 election interference.\n\n\u201cWhy, one day after the Mueller albatross is lifted off the president\u2019s back, and he\u2019s free to move on with the rest of his presidency, does he get on the phone with the president of Ukraine and start talking about Biden and the next election?\u201d MacCallum asked.\n\n\u201cWhy would he do that? It just seems to fly in the face of any good sense whatsoever.\u201d", "description": "Transcripts released Wednesday showed the president asking Ukraine to investigate Biden, but if you watched Fox News, you\u2019d likely think it\u2019s the Democrats who\u2019ve overstepped.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona", "Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569449363/190925-barragona-tani-fox-tease_xjvjqw", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
