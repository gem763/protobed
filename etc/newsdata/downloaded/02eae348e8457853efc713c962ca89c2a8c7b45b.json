A Philadelphia jury has ruled that Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals must pay $8 billion in punitive damages over an antipsychotic drug linked to the abnormal growth of female breast tissue in boys. A law firm for the plaintiff released a statement Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, saying the companies used an organized scheme to make billions of dollars while illegally marketing and promoting the drug called Risperdal.

They also said the plaintiff's attorneys failed to present any evidence of actual harm.\n\n\"This decision is inconsistent with multiple determinations outside of Philadelphia regarding the adequacy of the Risperdal labeling, the medicine's efficacy, and findings in support of the company,\" Johnson & Johnson said. \"We will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict.\"", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A Philadelphia jury on Tuesday awarded $8 billion in punitive damages against Johnson & Johnson and one if its subsidiaries over a drug...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/wire-19468838-1570581174-184_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
