A judge then signed the divorce order in April, legally dissolving his marriage.\n\nIn May, Nixon's wife found out about the secret divorce and called the police. Authorities investigated the situation, finding that the 51-year-old had managed to forge his wife's signature and even faked a notary's approval on the paperwork.\n\nPolice filed a motion to vacate the order a few weeks later, essentially reinstating Nixon's marriage to his wife. They announced earlier this week that he was wanted in connection to the crime.\n\n\"[Nixon's wife] advised that her husband filed for divorce and completed the entire proceedings without her knowledge or consent and that the court had already completed all hearings and filed the final divorce decree,\" the post read.\n\nNixon now faces up to 10 years in prison if he is found and convicted. As far as his marriage goes, no new divorce proceedings have been filed.", "description": "A Texas man is wanted by police after he allegedly filed for and completed divorce proceedings against his wife without her knowledge.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HdS8xGoNpHmLkTbncwUlEw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/490x321+177+44/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/898ceb40-dbdd-11e9-bd63-eb79ca3d9d2d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
