The new documentary about the brothers, which debuted on Netflix on Oct. 18 following a successful festival run, gradually unspools the consequences of a decision made by Marcus, suddenly the holder of all of his brother\u2019s memories, to paint a picture of a happy life\u2014withholding the reality that their mother had abused the boys throughout their childhoods.\n\nShot in a studio space built for the brothers to confront, for the first time, the emotional distance brought on by the secrets Marcus kept, the film offers a strikingly intimate portrait of the now middle-aged twins coming to terms with the facts of their lives.\n\n\u201cIt played out like a psychological thriller. And yet it was true,\u201d Ed Perkins, the film\u2019s director, tells TIME. \u201cI was fascinated by the themes of brotherhood, the blurring of fact and fiction, memory and the question of who we are if we lose our memory.\u201d\n\nBetween Alex and Marcus lie decades of guilt, confusion and deep sadness over what\u2019s remained unsaid. As the men explain in the film, after 18-year-old Alex woke up from his coma unable to remember anything, from his own name to where he was, he returned home with his family to start rebuilding his identity.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Imagine how scary that would be,\u201d Marcus says in the film. Back home, Alex encounters a life that he\u2019s told is normal, with Marcus filling in all the details: he tells him where to sleep, where to eat, where to go to the bathroom, and so on. Alex relies completely on Marcus to tell him about what happened in their lives, and to bridge the gaps with childhood photos and TV shows that offer ideas about how normal families function.\n\nYears pass as Alex grows close with his family without really questioning signs that others might see as suspicious. The twins, for example, live in a shed on their family\u2019s property, and they don\u2019t have keys to the main house. Their father is stern and distant, while their mother remains in denial that her son has lost his memory, particularly of her role in his life.\n\n\u201cWhat you might ask is, \u2018Surely you realize this is not how other people live?'\u201d says Perkins. \u201cBut that was all he knew. Try and put yourself in his shoes. You wake up and you have absolutely nothing, no memories at all, no reference point for anything. The only thing you have is that bond with your brother.\u201d\n\nAlex believes their family is \u201cnormal\u201d until after his mother\u2019s death, when he finds hidden in her belongings a photograph of him and Marcus as boys, showing them from naked the neck down, with the strip of the photograph containing their faces cut off. He asks Marcus if they were abused as children, which Marcus confirms without providing any additional details.\n\nAnd so, Alex\u2019s life, already complicated by his lost memories, descends further into a mystery that goes unresolved until the third act of Tell Me Who I Am, when Marcus faces his brother and lays bare the details of the trauma they experienced. Marcus explains in the film that he chose to hide their mother\u2019s extensive sexual abuse of the boys in an attempt to protect his brother. This repression also felt like a way to protect himself, pushing away the pain of confronting his trauma.\n\nThe Lewis brothers wrote about their experience in a book of the same name published in 2013, but left out the details that make the final act of the film\u2014the moment of confrontation between the brothers\u2014so emotional. Perkins says the scene in which the brothers come to a full understanding of what happened in their lives came after years of him getting to know both men and gleaning that Marcus \u201cknew deep down he hadn\u2019t given his brother what he really needed.\u201d\n\nThe director says he spent about three years just getting to know the men before beginning any filming. \u201cWe were able to spend a lot of time just building a relationship of trust, and that\u2019s been so helpful to creating an environment where they felt they could have conversations in a way they hadn\u2019t before. It\u2019s been a real journey. There were a number of times when Alex and Marcus pulled out of the project.\u201d\n\nIn Perkins\u2019 view, after speaking at length with both men, Alex needed his brother to give him all the information so he\u2019d know who he really was. Marcus, according to Perkins, agreed to have the crucial conversation, eventually saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be silent anymore.\u201d\n\nToday, Perkins reports, Marcus and Alex, \u201clive incredible and emotionally rich lives. They\u2019re amazing fathers and husbands. It\u2019s very inspiring for me to see people who have gone through more than you\u2019d wish on anybody and yet resolutely refuse to be defined as victims. I really hope audiences are left with a feeling of hopefulness.\u201d\n\nTell Me Who I Am is a difficult watch that includes graphic details about child sexual abuse. But Alex and Marcus\u2019 story is a testament to the relief that can come from speaking horrors out loud. Both men had lost the undefinable psychological bond said to connect identical twins in the \u201cgulf of understanding between them,\u201d according to Perkins.\n\n\u201cNow, they\u2019ve got that bond back,\u201d he says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything between them anymore.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "The new film explores who we are when we lose our memory\u2014and how an identity can be reconstructed.", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tell-me-who-i-am-netflix-doc.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
