The fleeting moment of dissonance revealed what has emerged as an informal rule of thumb among Republican senators who consider themselves foreign policy experts, with wide latitude to weigh in and potentially influence a president who has far less experience on the subject than they do. They are willing to break with Mr. Trump on matters of international affairs \u2014 but only when they believe there are no domestic political consequences for doing so\u2026\n\n\u201cMany of us have been dealing with this for a decade or two decades, and I think there are a lot of visits to the area and a lot of discussions that stand behind our views on these issues,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who had previously counseled the White House on the necessity of maintaining forces in Syria. \u201cThis is an area where it has been a consistent concern that leaving those places would create bigger problems than staying.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cForeign policy has always been Trump\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heal with Senate Republicans,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former staff adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican who faulted the president\u2019s Syria decision \u2014 but not his comments about China and Ukraine. Mr. Conant said Republicans were also driven by their view that Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy missteps were more damaging, requiring a more forceful response than his day-to-day incendiary statements.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Republicans-Trump-Syria.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
