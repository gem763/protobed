That\u2019s the lowest level since the government began keeping track in 1959, topping the previous low set in 2000. (Figures are adjusted for historical purposes.)\n\nFemale-headed households were the only major kind of family to experience a significant decline in poverty in 2018, the Census said. They represent about 18% of the American population that lives in families for a total of nearly 47 million.\n\nThe improved financial well-being of female-headed families also lifted some 649,000 children above the poverty line last year, the agency said.\n\nRead: Share of Americans with health insurance falls for first time since Great Recession\n\nThese families benefited from the strongest labor market in decades. Job openings hit a record high earlier this year, the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low and wages rose at the fastest pace in a decade.\n\n\u201cMore people from female-householder families found full-time, full-year employment in 2018 than in 2017, particularly among blacks and Hispanics. This led to higher incomes and fewer adults and children in poverty for these groups,\u201d Census researchers John Creamer and Abinash Mohanty wrote.\n\nThe financial gains reaped by America\u2019s least well-off families has been cited repeatedly by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for the central bank\u2019s willingness to keep interest rates low. The Fed cut rates in July and is poised to do so again next week, largely because of low inflation and worries about collateral damage from the U.S. trade war with China.\n\n\u201c\u201cPeople who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job market is the best anyone can recall,\u201d Powell said in a speech last month in Jackson, Wyo.\n\n\u201cOur challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind.\u201d", "description": "The poverty rate of people living in female-headed households fell in 2018 to the lowest level on record, thanks to a strong labor market offering more job...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GD643_single_ZG_20180213110445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
