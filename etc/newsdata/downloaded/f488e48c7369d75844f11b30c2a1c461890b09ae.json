The Jaguars, according to ESPN, are expected to move Ramsey and are seeking at least a first-round pick in return.\n\nBut NBC Sports Washington reported the Redskins won\u2019t be among the teams on the pursuit.\n\nThe Redskins could certainly use a talent like Ramsey in the secondary, but there are various reasons why they are likely opting against a trade. First, Washington isn\u2019t in a position to give up high draft picks in the midst of an 0-2 start to the season. The team also traded away its 2020 second-rounder in April when they traded back into the first round for pass rusher Montez Sweat.\n\nBeyond possibly unwilling to surrender the assets required it would take to trade for Ramsey, any team acquiring the two-time Pro Bowler will likely have to pay him.\n\nThe fifth overall pick in 2016, Ramsey has watched as others in his draft class \u2014 Jared Goff, Carson Wentz and Ezekiel Elliott \u2014 receive large extensions and has been open in his demands for a new contract. The 24-year-old showed up to training camp this year in an armored truck, a not-so-subtle metaphor for his contractual situation.\n\nRamsey also has a history of clashing with coaches and management. He was suspended one game last season for lashing out at a reporter for filming a practice fight between defensive end Dante Fowler and defensive tackle Yannick Ngakoue.\n\nDespite the drama, Ramsey has consistently performed at a high level since coming to the NFL. He was an All-Pro selection in 2017, the season in which the Jaguars made the AFC Championship.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
