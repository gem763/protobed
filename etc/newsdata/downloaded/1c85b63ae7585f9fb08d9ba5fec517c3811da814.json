More\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook in the early hours Monday saw the downfall of one of the biggest names in travel but some of its smaller brands continue to live on.\n\nThrough a series of mergers and acquisitions, it had built up a mini-empire of tour operators and airlines that once stretched over the globe with outposts in North America and India.\n\nIn recent times, however, the key divisions outside the UK were in central Europe and Scandinavia and some of these businesses are still doing business \u2014 at least for the moment.\n\n\u201cThey are separate legal entities set up in their respective jurisdictions,\u201d said Joanna Kolatsis director at legal consultancy Themis Advisory.\n\nA similar situation happened when XL Leisure Group collapsed in 2008 and XL Airways France continued operating (ironically, the airline sought bankruptcy protection on the same day Thomas Cook went under.)\n\nProfitable Businesses\n\nAccording to its most recent annual report, Thomas Cook had tour operators in 14 different European countries as well as four separate airlines.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s Nordic businesses, including the brands Ving, Spies, Tj\u00e4reborg and Globetrotter, faced initial disruption on Monday, but were up and running on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have been a separate legal entity here in the Nordics but owned by Thomas Cook plc for the last 10, 11 years but we have been profitable here in the Nordics for many decades and we have been very profitable this year,\u201d Fredrik Henriksson, head of communications at Thomas Cook Northern Europe, told Skift.\n\nAt group level, Thomas Cook was weighed down by considerable debts. Yet operationally in some markets it was profitable.\n\nIn 2018, its Northern European business made an operating profit of $118 million (\u00a395 million) and its Continental European business $91 million (\u00a373 million). Both of these are \u201cunderlying\u201d figures, i.e. they strip out some one-off items, but it still shows that both were in OK shape.\n\nHenriksson said the liquidators of Thomas Cook plc \u201cwould look at finding a new owner.\u201d Earlier this year, private equity firm Triton Partners, which owns tour operator Sunweb Group, approached Thomas Cook about buying the business and the Scandinavian airline, which is also still running, and it is logical to think it would rekindle its interest.\n\nWho Wants to Buy an Airline?\n\nAnother subsidiary looking for a new home is German leisure airline Condor. Flights are operating as normal and it has managed to secure commitment for a $419 million (\u20ac380 million) bridging loan from the German federal government and the state of Hesse \u2014 pending European Union approval \u2014 to help see it through winter.\n\n\u201cCondor is an operationally healthy and profitable company, which will also post a positive result in the current year. Because our liquidity was used up by our insolvent parent company for the seasonally weaker booking period, we need this bridge financing for the winter. The commitment is an important step in securing our future,\u201d said CEO Ralf Teckentrup.\n\nCondor claims it is in the black, making an operating profit of $47 million (\u20ac43 million) in 2018 with an increase expected this year. Lufthansa, Condor\u2019s former owner, expressed an interest in buying it earlier this year.\n\n\u201cCondor has achieved positive results over the last few years and has proven that we can maintain an excellent position in the market. This distinguishes us from cases such as Air Berlin and Germania. The interest of other market participants in our company also underlines our attractiveness,\u201d said Teckentrup.", "description": "The collapse of Thomas Cook in the early hours Monday saw the downfall of one of the biggest names in travel but some of its smaller brands continue to live on.
