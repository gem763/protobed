He also, unprompted, brought up the Democrats who want him impeached, and even blamed Pelosi for new Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib saying at a party earlier this week that Democrats would impeach the \u201cmotherfucker\u201d Trump. (It is unclear why Trump would think Pelosi was responsible for this.)\n\nTrump proceeded to tell the room he was too popular to impeach.\n\nAlong with saying the word \u201cfuck\u201d at least three times throughout the meeting, the president bizarrely stated that he did not want to call the partial government shutdown a \u201cshutdown,\u201d according to the source. Instead, he referred to it as a \u201cstrike.\u201d (Many of the federal employees affected by the weeks-long shutdown have been working without pay. That is essentially the opposite of a strike.)\n\nDuring the course of this meeting, the Democrats in the room were visibly shaking their heads in exasperation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was one of the Republicans in the room. An aide to McConnell did not provide a readout of the meeting\u2014citing office policy\u2014but noted that the senator rarely talks in such sessions.\n\nAnother person familiar with the meeting disputed that Trump said \u201cfuck\u201d three times, though conceded he said it once.\n\nThis third source contended that the president \u201cdidn\u2019t bring up impeachment unprompted,\u201d but did so in the \u201ccontext of how he wants to work together\u201d with Democratic lawmakers and how impeachment efforts would be counterproductive to that. The source added that the little that McConnell did contribute included calling on Democrats to work this weekend on a solution to the shutdown impasse.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment as of press time. But according to one source familiar with the meeting, Schumer did press the president to reopen the government before continuing negotiations on a border wall. Otherwise, the Senator suggested, the president was effectively using government employees and shuttered government agencies as leverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s for leverage, but I\u2019m not going to get a deal unless I do this,\" the president replied, according to the source.\n\nThe Democrats in the room shook their heads, the source said, as if to say \"so, you\u2019re doing it for leverage\u2026\"", "description": "The president also dropped three f-bombs and claimed Democrats wanted him impeached.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Stein", "White House Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1546649344/trumpeee_fvyfy8", "published_at": "2019-01-05"}
