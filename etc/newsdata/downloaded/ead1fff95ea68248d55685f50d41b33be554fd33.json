Larsa joined Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian for a girls trip, and the show portrayed her as being super into partying and meeting \"some guys from Miami,\" while Kourtney just wanted to be chill. Plus, there was drama between Larsa and Poosh COO Sarah Howard, who also wanted to have a more chill time.\n\nAnyway, now poor Larsa is getting fully dragged by KUWTK fans. Comments range from \"Why is Larsa Pippen always around? As we\u2019ve seen before, she\u2019s nothing but a mean girl who starts drama. Don\u2019t have a good feeling about her,\" to \"Ew @larsapippen is THAT woman on a girls trip #KUWTK she needs to act her age.\"\n\nWhy is @larsapippen Larsa Pippen always around?

You were being a bully and a mean girl. @kourtneykardash was too nice to tell you, but we will!

Cuz all I heard was you \u201cdidn\u2019t wanna kill kourtneys vibe\u201d just own up to the fact that you were rude and were being a \u201cbully\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 \u2014 Sean (@Officialseand93) October 21, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Khlo\u00e9 jumped in to say Larsa \"is a great friend to Kourt and she has a great heart. Sarah and her are simply different people. But both are good souls.\" And people are accusing her of doing damage control since everyone's coming for Larsa:\n\nDamage control tweet because everyone is trashing larsa haha \u2014 Jake (@Jake9537) October 21, 2019\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nView photos Photo credit: Giphy More\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "RIP her mentions.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0hBY9lTJXvOXkT3TdBHc0w--~B/aD0zMDI7dz02MDU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/61e5cde67a28b545387b8fcb3cd97811", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
