Protest should be peaceful.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Quim Torra is welcomed by a policeman upon his arrival in Barcelona.

They want us to fall for their provocations and feed a violent spiral.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region.\n\nThe conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party want firm and immediate action.\n\nThe PP leader, Pablo Casado, has accused S\u00e1nchez of \u201ca lack of foresight\u201d and called for the activation of the national security law, which would bring the Catalan regional police force under the control of the central government.\n\nAlbert Rivera, the leader of the Citizens party, said \u201cthe government needs to act now or we\u2019re going to see a lot of awful problems\u201d.\n\nCatalonia has returned to the top of the political agenda as Spain prepares to go to the polls for the fourth time in as many years on November 10.\n\nAlthough S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialist party won the most votes in April\u2019s general election, it proved unable to form a government, triggering a fresh vote.\n\nThe last election was called after Catalan pro-independence parties joined forces with their bitter enemies in the PP and Citizens to torpedo S\u00e1nchez\u2019s national budget.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s opponents accuse him of being too beholden to the Catalan pro-independence parties who supported his successful bid to throw the PP out of office with a vote of no confidence.\n\nHowever, the acting prime minister has repeatedly said he will not allow a referendum on Catalan independence and warned that the Spanish constitution must be respected.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Quim Torra says people trying to damage reputation of independence movement", "authors": ["Sam Jones", "Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ef6c894209de7e3983d679237ade7cc363fdbe/0_118_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1266829f940ecbfe372835a324d3775b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
