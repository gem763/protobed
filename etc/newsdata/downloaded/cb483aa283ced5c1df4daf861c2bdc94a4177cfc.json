You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNumber one: Trump is unpopular. Historically so. The current President of the United States is the most unpopular president of the United States in modern history. Sometimes the resilience of support among his diehardsobscures what would otherwise be patently obvious: Trump does not enjoy widespread support among the voting populace.\n\nNumber two: Trump is a criminal. He\u2019s not even trying to hide it anymore. The no quid pro quo argument originally put forward regarding the Ukraine/Biden investigation scandal has quickly morphed into OK so it was quid pro quo but everyone does it get over it.\n\nThe implications of point one \u2014 Trump\u2019s widespread unpopularity \u2014 do not augur well for his chances in the upcoming election. Head to head polls, even from his favorite source, Fox News, regularly show him losing by wide margins to the likeliest Democratic contenders.\n\nIn a scenario where Trump loses, the implications of point number two are magnified many times over. Former personal attorney Michael Cohen is in jail. Former Director of National Intelligence Michael Flynn is in jail. Former campaign chair Paul Manafort is in jail.\n\nCurrent President Trump is not in jail, shielded from the consequences of his sloppy, brazen, pervasive, breathtaking criminality by the protections afforded by his office. The Mueller report, for instance, laid out multiple instances of obstruction of justice. Only an internal memo ruling that sitting presidents cannot be indicted stood between Donald J Trump and a criminal referral.\n\nCitizen Trump will not enjoy these additional barriers. Donald Trump knows this. Panic has clearly set in. It\u2019s in the tweets. It\u2019s in the unhinged press conferences. He\u2019s in a tight spot.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to guess where this goes next. Trump has evinced time and again a brutal, animalistic survival instinct. The flailing escalation of desperation emanating from the White House provides the blueprint.\n\nPresident Trump is currently testing the limits of the public, the opposition party, and his enablers within the GOP. In the midst of an impeachment inquiry for self-dealing behavior, he\u2019s doubled and tripled down, even attempting to host the G7 at a Trump resort (before being reined in.)\n\nThus far, Republicans have chosen blind loyalty to Trump over the oaths of office they all swore. The question is not whether he\u2019s guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. He has admitted to the crime in full view of the world. The real question is how pervasive the blithe acceptance of criminality and autocracy is within the Republican Party.\n\nBecause make no mistake, the Republican Party is complicit to the hilt in this administration\u2019s criminality. Beyond those with obvious liability, including Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Attorney General Barr, the depths of culpability in the Republican Party have only been hinted at with each new revelation.\n\nTwo of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s associates were arrested last week trying to flee the country, indicted in a campaign finance scheme which saw millions of dollars funneled from shady Russian sources into GOP coffers, including Trump, Governor Ron Desantis of Florida, former Senator Pete Sessions and others.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty 4/19 Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/19 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/19 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d. AP 11/19 Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. AFP via Getty 12/19 Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement. Reuters 14/19 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Florida-based businessmen and Republican donors Lev Parnas (pictured with Rudy Giuliani) and Igor Fruman were arrested on suspicion of campaign finance violations at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC on 9 October. Separately the Associated Press has reported that they were both involved in efforts to replace the management of Ukraine's gas company, Naftogaz, with new bosses who would steer lucrative contracts towards companies controlled by Trump allies. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts. Reuters 15/19 Kurt Volker The former US ambassador to NATO was appointed special envoy to Ukraine, and is thought to have played a role in linking Giuliani with Ukraine officials. He resigned just before giving evidence to Congress, which had subpoenaed him. After his testimony it emerged that he had apparently told Giuliani that he was being fed false information about the Bidens from Ukrainian officials.

She was abruptly recalled from her post in May 2019 amid claims that she was not co-operating with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s unorthodox activities in Ukraine. In the Ukraine phone call Trump refers to her as \u201cthe woman\u201d and \u201cbad news\u201d and hints darkly at some sort of retribution, saying: \u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d Subpoenaed to give evidence to Congress.
