He said that many of the accidents could be avoided through a change in driver behaviour.\n\n\n\n\"The taxi industry, which carries 70% of the passengers in our province, should take the lead in the campaign for road safety. I believe an intervention from women operators could give us a lasting solution. At the moment, we are losing 40 people across all our roads in the country daily, and this situation has to be arrested,\" Mamabolo said.\n\n\n\nMamabolo also invited renowned singer and actor Abigail Kubeka, who was assaulted, allegedly by a taxi driver after a collision in Soweto earlier this month.\n\nREAD: Legendary actress, musician Abigail Khubeka allegedly assaulted by taxi driver\n\nMamabolo condemned the violent attack on Kubeka and was joined by the women in the industry in offering an apology.\n\n\n\n\"We have made many strides in changing the industry over the past few months. It is true that we will not solve all the problems at once. But we were disappointed and shocked to find out about what had happened to Mama Abigail.\"\n\n\n\nThe seminar is part of the department's Transport Month programme, which seeks to promote Gauteng as the city region of smart mobility.\n\n\n\nAs part of this ambitious plan, the department has prioritised road safety, decongesting the road network, depolluting the roads and finding smart technologies to improve the transport sector.", "description": "Women in the taxi industry can only be empowered through the transformation of the taxi business, says Gauteng Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/393acf323baa411a8f629c5479210c14.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
