Col. Alexander Vindman, a key impeachment witness, saying \u201cthat\u2019s just not who we are as a country.\u201d\n\nLeading up to Vindman's closed-door testimony on Tuesday, some of Trump\u2019s allies questioned Vindman, who is a Ukrainian-American immigrant, over his patriotism, suggesting that he may have a greater sense of allegiance to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear them necessarily defending the phone call itself, but they seem to be grasping at all these extraneous items,\u201d Warner said referring to Trump\u2019s allies. \u201cI wish we would just stick to the facts \u2014 let the facts be presented.\u201d\n\nBut Warner cautioned lawmakers to take impeachment proceedings one step at a time, saying he believes Democrats\u2019 decision to open up impeachment proceedings to the public will help ease tensions between the parties.\n\n\u201cWe all will take a deep breath and think that at the end of the day that we took an oath to defend the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing more serious than an impeachment proceeding and I hope both sides will come in with an open mind.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a new House resolution on impeachment procedures, which includes an outline for how upcoming public hearings will be conducted.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the resolution Thursday.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Sen.
