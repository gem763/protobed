(AP) - Well, this isn\u2019t quite how the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets expected to start the season.\n\nBoth are coming off opening losses and look to avoid going 0-2 with a Monday night matchup loaded with juicy story lines, surprising twists and a slight hint of desperation.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s only Week 2.\n\n\u201cI think every game is a must-win game,\u201d Jets running back Le\u2019Veon Bell said, \u201cbut obviously this game holds a lot of weight to it.\u201d\n\nThe Browns didn\u2019t live up to the preseason hype that had some making them potential Super Bowl contenders.\n\nInstead, Cleveland committed 18 penalties - the most by the team since 1951 - in a 43-13 loss to Tennessee that put early pressure on first-year coach Freddie Kitchens.\n\n\u201cI feel a lot of confidence with this team that we\u2019re going to get all the haters and naysayers out of here,\u201d cornerback Denzel Ward said, \u201cso I hope everybody\u2019s all gone now and we\u2019re just focused on us.\u201d\n\nWell, most of the Browns, that is.\n\nWide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. returns to MetLife Stadium for the first time since being traded by the Giants in March. But that\u2019s not even the biggest headline.\n\nNeither is all the attention on his expensive watch.\n\nBeckham spiced things up Thursday when he called out former Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams - now in the same role with the Jets - and said the coach instructed players to hurt him in a preseason game in 2017. He sustained a severe ankle injury when Cleveland\u2019s Briean Boddy-Calhoun cut his legs out, something he says \u201cchanged my life forever\u201d because he says it led to other injuries.\n\n\u201cJust got to watch out for the cheap shots and the dirty hits and all the things that he likes to teach,\u201d Beckham said.\n\nWilliams, of course, is facing the Browns for the first time since leading them to a 5-3 record after taking over when Hue Jackson was fired - and then losing out to Kitchens for the vacancy.\n\n\u201cObviously, he has a chip on his shoulder about this game,\u201d Jets safety Jamal Adams said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out there and play for him. He\u2019s going to be all riled up.\u201d\n\nAdam Gase was plenty fired up this week himself after the Jets blew a 16-0 third-quarter lead last Sunday in his debut for New York and lost 17-16 to Buffalo.\n\nWILD WEEK FOR JETS\n\nKicker Kaare Vedvik was waived after he missed an extra point and a 45-yard field goal, and Sam Ficken was signed to replace him.\n\nSecond-year defensive lineman Nathan Shepherd was suspended six games for two violations of the NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers.\n\nThey swung a rare trade with New England, acquiring wide receiver Demaryius Thomas for a 2021 sixth-round draft pick.\n\nWide receiver Quincy Enunwa was lost for the season with his second neck injury in just over two years.\n\nAnd, then, the capper of \u2018em all: Quarterback Sam Darnold was diagnosed with mononucleosis, likely sidelining him for several games. That means it\u2019ll be Trevor Siemian starting against Baker Mayfield, who appears OK after needing X-rays on his hand Sunday, and the Browns on Monday night.\n\n\u201cI guess maybe I\u2019m messed up,\u201d Gase said, trying to put a positive spin on it all. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Great, let\u2019s go. Trevor is up, let\u2019s go find a way to win the game.\u2019\u201d\n\nNEW YORK STATE OF MIND\n\nBeckham dismissed any extra motivation in going back to his old, New Jersey stomping grounds.\n\n\u201cIt is just another game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is. \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 in the lights. Just trying to get wins.\u201d\n\nBut Beckham is an entertainer and loves the big stage, so he\u2019ll undoubtedly try to put on a performance with the rest of the league watching.\n\nAnd speaking of watching, Beckham said he\u2019ll sport the Richard Mille-designed watch: \u201cif I want to wear it, I\u2019ll wear it.\u201d The league told the Browns that Beckham is violating their policy on \u201chard objects.\u201d\n\nBAKER & THE JETS\n\nMayfield has fond memories of the Jets. He made his NFL debut against them last season, coming off the bench in Week 3 and leading the Browns to a 21-17 win to end Cleveland\u2019s 19-game winless streak.\n\nFollowing the game, fans streamed from FirstEnergy Stadium singing, \u201cBak-er, May-field,\u201d feeling the Browns had finally found their franchise quarterback. Mayfield took off from there, setting the league rookie record with 27 touchdown passes while leading Cleveland to a 7-8-1 record.\n\nBELL TOLLS\n\nBell had a solid return in his first game action in nearly 20 months. He rushed for 60 yards on 17 carries and caught six passes for 32 yards and a TD in his Jets debut. He also caught a pass for a 2-point conversion.\n\nThe star running back sat out practice Wednesday and had an MRI on a shoulder, but it came up clear and he should play against the Browns.\n\nHEARTBROKEN BROWNS\n\nIt was an emotional week for the Browns following the tragic death of defensive end Chris Smith\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nPetara Cordero, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s daughter last month, was struck by a car as she stood on a highway roadside Wednesday. She was a passenger in Smith\u2019s Lamborghini, which blew a tire and spun out. The 26-year-old Cordero had exited the car when another car, driven by a 47-year-old woman who admitted to police she had been drinking, smashed into her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation,\u201d guard Joel Bitonio said. \u201cYou forget about things when you\u2019re in this building, sometimes the outside world you forget. We love this game and this game does a lot for us, but football comes second to a lot of things sometimes. We\u2019re trying to pick Chris up and his family, his little baby and all those things. We\u2019re thinking about him every chance we get.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Withers contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Well, this isn't quite how the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets expected to start the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/bills_jets_football_46282_c0-194-4631-2894_s1770x1032.jpg?d83da9526e94199626f17fb8a0f056784e19b050", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
