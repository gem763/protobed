Millions of lives will be saved!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump this week said the unfolding fight between Turkey and Syria is \u201cnot our problem,\u201d though he dispatched Mr. Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to push for a cease-fire in the wake of his decision to pull dozens of U.S. troops from a key buffer zone in northeastern Syria.\n\nLawmakers from both parties in Washington are fuming over the decision, saying it gave Mr. Erdogan the green light to attack U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters.\n\nThe president denies the charge, though even his GOP allies fear Mr. Trump blundered and left a vacuum in the Middle East for Russia and Iran to fill.\n\nU.S. lawmakers fear a lot of damage has already been done and that it will be difficult to regain American credibility in the region.\n\nEarlier Thursday, video released by Turkish media showed Mr. Pence and Mr. Erdogan looking stiff and stern-faced before their meeting.\n\n\u201cThank you for seeing me,\u201d an unsmiling Mr. Pence said to Mr. Erdogan in a handshake greeting.\n\nA second Turkey flag was placed behind Mr. Pence\u2019s chair \u2014 instead of an American one \u2014 during the bilateral, which lasted well over an hour.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
