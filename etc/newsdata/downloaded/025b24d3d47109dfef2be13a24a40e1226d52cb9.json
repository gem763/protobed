Her first taste of major league baseball in the US was as a guest of cable television pioneer and America's Cup winner Ted Turner.\n\nWith the first pitch of the new ABL season just weeks way, Mr Vassallo is confident better resourcing and an improved game-day experience for fans will at least get the sport to first base in 2018-19.\n\n\"We have gathered a fair war chest at Perth Heat,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have got involved in something that was going to be under funded from the start.\n\nEileen Bond, the ex wife of Alan Bond, has joined Rory Vassallo in investing in new baseball team the Perth Heat. Richard Wainwright\n\n\"We think it is a very undervalued sport in Australia and this is only the beginning.\"\n\nMr Vassallo, who turned 35 on Thursday, is not so sure some of the players in the childcare industry where he made his fortune won't strike out.\n\nHe said problems in the industry had a lot less to do with government policy tinkering than with investors not understanding the business and opening centres on top of one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Vassallo started from the bottom in childcare after dropping out of high school at 15 and spending time as an apprentice welder.\n\nIt is four years since he sold 22 centres to ASX-listed G8 Education for $65 million, but he never really left the industry and the number of centres he has built or owns is slowly creeping up again alongside investments in fitness centres.\n\nOversupply has been blamed for a fall in profits across the childcare sector despite the government introducing a new and more complex subsidy system in July.\n\n\"Childcare has always been a tough business and policy changes don't necessarily make it any easier. In fixing one problem, they usually create another one,\" Mr Vassallo said.\n\n\"Childcare is not cheap and affordability is always going to be an issue. The only way to make money in childcare is if you are good at it. If you are not good at it, you can lose a lot of money fast.\n\n\"It doesn't help when every five minutes there is another childcare centre opening up around the corner or in the same street as others.\"\n\nEven with oversupply emerging as an issue, Vassallo was being presented with about five proposals a week to build new centres.\n\n\"Only one in five gets even a second look,\" he said.\"I personally would not build a childcare centre unless there is clear demand and we've got some pretty good software when it comes to those decisions.\"", "description": "Young Rich lister Rory Vassallo isn't surprised he raised a few eyebrows by teaming up with the late Alan Bond's former wife Eileen to buy into a reborn Australian Baseball League.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.8939%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_895%2C$x_396%2C$y_500/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4e636d5a2b989328bd71131f3f8b8771ded8600c", "published_at": "2018-10-26"}
