Still, many expect the Treasury to gradually increase its bill sales if only to resolve future budget shortfalls set to widen from next year.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s purchases create a lot of extra demand and should increase the market\u2019s overall capacity for bills. Treasury would be smart to take advantage of the situation while they can,\u201d wrote Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist for Jefferies.\n\nIn early October, the Fed announced it would buy $60 billion of bills every month at least through the second half of 2020, as part of its strategy to expand the balance sheet and soothe funding problems in money markets.\n\nThis comes as the federal government is expected to rack up trillion-dollar fiscal deficits beginning from 2019. The U.S. Treasury said Monday it expected to borrow $352 billion in the fourth quarter, which is $29 billion lower than previously estimated.\n\nInvestors say the Treasury Department is reluctant to ramp up issuance of certain bond tenors in an opportunistic fashion, as it wants to avoid causing sharp changes in the average maturity, or the duration, of the outstanding government debt.\n\n\u201cA pillar of Treasury\u2019s debt-management policy has been to operate in a \u2018regular and predictable\u2019 manner. Thus, changing its auction calendar on short notice and without consulting its primary dealers or the TBAC would be out of character with Treasury\u2019s deliberate approach to debt management,\u201d wrote analysts at JP Morgan, referring to senior executives\n\nThey added that the widening deficits also means the Treasury will not want to shrink the size of its auctions for longer-term bonds in favor of bill sales.\n\nJP Morgan projected that the government\u2019s borrowing needs were $500 billion greater than the amount of financing the current configuration of debt auctions could deliver in every year between 2021 and 2025.\n\nAnother concern is that if the Fed raises rates in the future, the central bank may end up financing its debt at higher rates, said Steven Zeng, a Deutsche Bank strategist.\n\nSenior executives at Wall Street firms who are part of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), which helps consult the government on how to borrow funds from the market, have recommended for bill issuance to avoid surpassing around 25% to 33% of outstanding annual sales.\n\nZeng forecasted the U.S. Treasury to sell less than $200 billion of bills in 2019 and 2020 each, between 14% to 17% of annual issuance. Once accounting for the Fed\u2019s debt-buying, net issuance could even turn negative next year, starving private investors who may want to purchase bills.\n\nMarket participants have also complained the Fed may have to source beyond Treasury bills if it wants to increase the balance sheet at the central bank\u2019s desired pace. It\u2019s why some say that the Fed should widen its debt-buying program to coupon-bearing bonds that carry maturities of more than a year.\n\nMark Cabana, head of short-term rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the lack of bills circulating in the secondary market meant primary dealers were buying bills at Treasury auctions and directly handing it back to the U.S. central bank often on the same day, instead of the Fed\n\nSee: He warned the Fed might lose control over a $2 trillion interest-rate market \u2014 Now he says it might happen gain", "description": "Analysts say the U.S. Treasury Department is unlikely to ramp up bill issuance dramatically soon", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU227_treasu_ZG_20191029125615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
