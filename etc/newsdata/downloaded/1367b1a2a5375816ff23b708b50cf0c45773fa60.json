Listening to podcasts without any audio dramas like watching TV without ever trying Game of Thrones or Arrested Development or Orange Is the New Black. And while the medium is about to explode with spinoffs of existing franchises, there are already dozens of great original shows to try. Here are some of the best.\n\nComedy\n\nLet\u2019s start with the funny ones.\n\nVictoriocity: Steampunk adventure comedy\n\nA detective and a journalist run around a sci-fi Victorian London solving the murder of an inventor. If you\u2019ve ever read Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy or Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novels, then you will love this show. It\u2019s good for anyone who likes genre fiction and arch British jokes. Unlike Hitchhiker\u2019s, the plot is surprisingly meticulous.\n\nMission to Zyxx: Improvised space parody\n\nA diplomatic space team fails mission after mission. I hesitate to call Zyxx a parody of Star Wars and Star Trek, because it stands on its own much better than \u201cparody\u201d implies. There\u2019s a Bojack Horseman vibe to this show, where the whole world follows a mad kind of logic. While the show is made up on the spot, it\u2019s then heavily edited and cinematically sound produced. We interviewed the creators about their process last year.\n\nThe Offensive: Snappy workplace sitcom\n\nThis is Veep but for the management team of an English football club. This is mainly a show about people insulting each other in very clever ways. While many references lean on a little knowledge of footie or of British culture, I still love it even as a sports-phobic American.\n\nGay Future: Wacky dystopia\n\n\u201cThe year is 2062 and everyone is gay.\u201d This show is buck wild. Lightly framed as Mike Pence\u2019s failed Divergent ripoff, Gay Future follows the \u201cstraight resistance\u201d against President Clay Aiken. The sound design and soundtrack are a treat, and the story and acting are like a cartoon for adults.\n\nThe Amelia Project: Brief interviews with hideous people\n\nThe Amelia Project helps people fake their deaths. Each episode, a different client explains their situation and plans their demise and their getaway. This is a short, lighthearted show that\u2019s getting more sophisticated in its second season.\n\nTraffic Therapy: Straightforward sketch comedy\n\nSketch shows are inherently hit-or-miss, but the hits on this will make you wish they each had their own series. My favourite sketch, from the pilot, features a James Bond obsessed with nicking the hotel toiletries.\n\nHello From the Magic Tavern: Goofy fantasy-world chat show\n\nThis is like Comedy Bang! Bang! set in Middle-Earth. Earth-man Arnie Niekamp co-hosts with a shapeshifting badger and a wizard, and guests play every kind of being you\u2019ve ever met in a fantasy story: elves, skeletons, cult acolytes, talking birds, trolls, Conan the Barbarian types. Most episodes just have characters shoot the shit. But in its third season, the show is following more of a plot. There\u2019s also a B plot about an inter-dimensional space bunker.\n\nMusicals\n\nPodcasting is perfect for musical theatre.\n\nOff Book: The Improvised Musical: Broadway musical parody\n\nMusical improv is super hard, and half the jokes on this show are funnier because they could never work in a scripted story. But the other half are funnier because it\u2019s insane that someone thought them up on the fly. Best episodes include the pilot \u201cShrugging Destiny\u201d with Paul F. Tompkins, the all-star episode \u201cCats 2,\u201d and (currently behind the Earwolf Network paywall) \u201cAlways Sad, Always Happy\u201d with Will Hines.\n\n36 Questions: Earnest musical romance\n\nA three-act musical stars Hadestown\u2019s Jessie Shelton and Spring Awakening\u2019s Jonathan Groff as a couple in crisis after one of them is caught lying about her past. They use the famous \u201d36 questions to fall in love\u201d to get reacquainted. It\u2019s like a quirkier, wider-eyed Last Five Years.\n\nA Twilight World of Ultimate Smoothness: Late-night radio parody\n\nThis six-episode series is presented in real time as a sexy late-night radio show with an unsexy host. Between bits of story, there are real bedroom classics with lyrics like \u201cYou can see inside me, will you come inside me? Do you wanna ride inside my love?\u201d Meanwhile the host is trying to date his listeners and offload branded terry-cloth robes.\n\nDrama\n\nWhile some of these shows are funny, the human drama is more important than the laughs.\n\nEarth Break: Post-apocalypse personal drama\n\nJenny Slate does some of the best acting in an audio drama, some of the best acting in anything at all, as a woman stranded after an alien invasion. There are a ton of post-apocalypse audio dramas, but none are this emotionally gutting. This show can terrify you, and it can make you cry.\n\nWelcome to Night Vale: Weird horror dramedy\n\nEach episode is a community radio broadcast from a creepy desert town populated by angels, ghosts, doppelg\u00e4ngers, talking dragons, and secret police, narrated by a host who treats it all as normal small-town stuff. H. P. Lovecraft based his horror on the idea that whatever is utterly foreign to you is terrifying. This show \u2014 one of the older and most famous audio dramas \u2014 does the opposite. We interviewed the team about their live tours last year.\n\nBreaked: Witty theatrical one-act\n\nThis standalone half-hour piece is like GIRLS or Fleabag but way gayer. It\u2019s about a young woman trying to puzzle out which of her behaviours are the results of her bipolar disorder, and which are her own damn fault.\n\nForest 404: Cyberpunk dystopia\n\nIn a dark urban future, a young archivist hears the sound of a thriving forest, and goes on a mission to find what the hell she\u2019s just listened to. Minority Report, Blade Runner, and 1984 influence this BBC sci-fi tragedy. The sounds are exquisitely engineered, as is the theme song by electronic artist Bonobo.\n\nWithin the Wires: Alt-history drama\n\nEach season of this thoughtful, artful show tells a different story in a different format, but all set in the same fictional universe where the nation-state no longer exists. In season 1, you\u2019re listening to meditation tapes with an ulterior motive. In season 2, you\u2019re on audio tours of various art museums and galleries. In season 3, you\u2019re getting dictaphone messages from your boss in the New World Order\u2019s government. And in a supporters-only season, you\u2019re hearing pilot announcements while being smuggled around the world.\n\nThe Truth: Artsy, quirky anthology\n\nSometimes you get a comedy, sometimes drama, sometimes genre fiction. A lot of the show is recorded on location, with a fresh \u201cin the room\u201d sound design that pops out against the usual \u201cfour people in a podcast studio\u201d setup. The cast includes one-time performers and series regulars, and occasionally one story stretches across multiple episodes.\n\nThe Shadows: Intimate mumblecore romance\n\nThis is the most innovative use of the podcast format I\u2019ve ever heard. Kaitlin Prest, creator of the docu-podcast The Heart, builds a challenging love story out of half-real, half-improvised conversations. The show is incredibly intimate, sometimes sexy, sometimes cringe-inducing. If you like Joe Swanberg, Greta Gerwig, Eternal Sunshine, and the Modern Love column, this show will thrill you.\n\nAssorted\n\nThere really are tons of shows. If you run out of the above, try these:\n\nFind more\n\nWhile I am always correct about everything, tastes are subjective, and you\u2019ll find many more recommendations and audio drama reviews here:\n\nI have left out so many shows.
