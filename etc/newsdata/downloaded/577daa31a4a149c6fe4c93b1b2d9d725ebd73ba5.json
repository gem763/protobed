(AP) \u2014 The U.S. Naval Academy is investigating a report that a noose was hung on academy property on the 56th anniversary of the March on Washington.\n\nNaval Academy Superintendent Vice Adm. Sean Buck said in a statement Friday that the noose was found in a construction zone off-limits to staff.\n\nBuck said while it\u2019s possible the noose was part of a hoisting system to complete ductwork, the academy will investigate it because it \u201ctakes all allegations of race hate very seriously.\u201d\n\nCarl Snowden is chairman of the Caucus of African-American Leaders.
