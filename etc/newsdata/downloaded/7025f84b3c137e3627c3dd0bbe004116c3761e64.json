Not-for-profit M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) has waged a running battle in public with J&J over its $400 price tag for a six-month course for bedaquiline.\n\nMSF has argued that bedaquiline could be produced and sold at a profit for 25 cents per day, and that the price of treatments for drug-resistant TB should be no higher than $500 for a complete treatment course.\n\nBut Stop TB Partnership says costs of other regimens for extremely drug-resistant TB range from $2,000 to $8,000 for courses of at least 20 months.\n\nTB Alliance in April granted a license to U.S. drugmaker Mylan NV to manufacture and sell pretomanid as part of certain regimens in high-income markets, as well as a non-exclusive license for low-income and middle-income countries, where most tuberculosis cases occur.\n\nStop TB Partnership said it would start supplying the regimen following World Health Organization's guidance on using the drug. Mylan, however, said it will also sell the drug directly to countries.\n\nPrices in low-income countries would be in-line with the price offered through GDF, but would be decided on a case by case basis where the drug is not supplied through GDF, it said.\n\nThe drug will be available in bottles of 26 tablets, with a six-month treatment requiring seven bottles.
