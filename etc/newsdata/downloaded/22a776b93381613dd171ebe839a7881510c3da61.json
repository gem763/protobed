I Still Owned Manhattan.", "language": "en", "text": "That was nearly 20 years ago. I had a decent string of roles Off Broadway, and I could say I lived the dream. But as I recently stood at the corner of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, I realized I could no longer read the signs. Was I at 43rd or 45th Street?\n\nSquinting, I tried the flow-of-traffic trick, but I\u2019d gotten turned around. Was I on Fifth, which goes down, or Sixth Avenue, which goes up? Everything around me was an increasingly panicked blur.\n\nThe morning rush of Midtown swirled around me as I tried to get my bearings. In that moment of disorientation and anxiety, power-walking New Yorkers bumping into me from what felt like all sides, I took a picture of the street sign with my phone and blew it up. I still couldn\u2019t tell where I was.\n\nYou are vulnerable when you can\u2019t see. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I \u2014 of all people \u2014 could never bear watching a blind person feel her way down the sidewalk in New York City. Now I was that person.\n\nNo amount of quick thinking could reverse the truth. My good eye had gone bad. I had one last hope that I dreaded: another cataract surgery.\n\nIt\u2019s a peculiar thing to be able to re-experience a childhood trauma as an adult. The terror is the same. The growing sense of claustrophobia is just the same. But now, I had nothing left to lose. I couldn\u2019t see, and an unsuccessful surgery would mean only that I would continue not to see.\n\nWhen I entered the operating room, I had 20/200 vision, which meant I saw the world through frosted glass. a blur of shapes and colors. I could no longer read or fill out the medical release forms. I was blind.", "description": "After a lifetime of poor vision, a woman learned to navigate the blur of New York City by memory and mental tricks. Then things got worse.
