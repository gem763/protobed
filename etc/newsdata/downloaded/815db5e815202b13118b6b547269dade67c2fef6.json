Even the specs are largely the same; there\u2019s still 16GB of flash storage and 3GB of RAM. But Nvidia is making two big changes here: a new Tegra X1+ processor that replaces the standard X1 chip on the old model, which it promises is \u201cup to 25% faster.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a new bundled remote control, with an odd triangular design, motion-activated backlit buttons, a built-in remote control locator, and just straight-up more buttons for media control (including a customizable menu button).\n\nAs part of the refresh, the new Shield TV Pro also checks off a few more boxes for content: it now supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Digital Plus surround sound, in addition to Dolby Atmos (which the old Shield TV also supported). And the new processor enables what Nvidia is calling \u201cAI Upscaling,\u201d which the company says offers \u201ccrisper, clearer, video enhanced to 4K resolution in real-time.\u201d\n\nAnd like the old Nvidia Shield TV, you\u2019ll still be able to use the Shield TV Pro as a Plex Media Server, a SmartThings hub, a 4K Chromecast device, and control it with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. It\u2019ll also still run Android TV, meaning the same wide variety of apps and games will be available, as will Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now game streaming service.\n\nAccording to the Amazon listing, the Nvidia Shield TV Pro will cost $199.99 and will be released on October 28th.", "description": "The fan-favorite Nvidia Shield TV streaming box is getting a new refresh soon in the form of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro, which will bring a faster Tegra X1+ processor and a new remote, according to a now-removed Amazon listing that revealed the new product a few days ahead of an apparent October 28th release date.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5kKfPzJdU-1fK1c7UhevoPH6zZk=/0x145:1280x815/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19295983/shield.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
