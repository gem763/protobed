You could go after the game in the fight in the corridors you would know they would not leave you alone \u2013 this was the type of players I had at the start.\n\n\"They were ready to go to war with you, you could be in the trenches with them.\n\n\"Afterwards the second generation of players who had as well exceptional charisma. We speak a lot about the first generation but the other defence of Lauren, Campbell, Toure and Ashley Cole were exceptional with Lehmann in goal- they were characters.\n\n\"At the end of the day when you look back you feel when you get that right \u2013 the personalities \u2013 you are ready to go anywhere in the world. These teams had charisma.\"", "description": "2003-4 title-winning team was Gunners' finest says former boss - but he also praises another generation of Arsenal heroes", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569489.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ARSENAL-SOCCER-TEAMS-HENRY-VIERA-AND-MANAGER-WENGER-CELEBRATE-ENGLISH-PREMIER-LEAGUE-WIN-IN-LONDON.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
