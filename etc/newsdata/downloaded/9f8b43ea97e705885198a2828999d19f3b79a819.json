It sounds just like a story Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha would sign on to, and we\u2019re glad she did.\n\nParallels can be drawn between this comedy-drama and Chadha\u2019s 2002 hit. Instead of chasing a football career, the film\u2019s protagonist, Javed Khan (Viveik Kalra), dreams of being a writer \u2013 which his father, of course, disapproves of. And instead of being obsessed with David Beckham, it is Bruce Springsteen that fuels Javed\u2019s passion.\n\nJaved lives with his immigrant parents and two sisters in the London suburb of Luton. It\u2019s 1987 and life is looking pretty grim for the 16-year-old. While his family struggles to make ends meet, Javed must also contend with the racism of his classmates and neighbours.\n\nVideo of BLINDED BY THE LIGHT Trailer (2019)\n\nHis world is turned upside down, however, when his new friend Roops (Aaron Phagura) introduces him to \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Springsteen\u2019s music sparks an awakening in Javed that gives him the courage to pursue his passion. If you weren\u2019t a Springsteen fan before, you will be by the end of the film.\n\nBlinded by the Light tells an uplifting tale of family, friendship, and the power of music. You\u2019ll walk out of the cinema with your faith in humanity restored.", "description": "This heartwarming film from the director of 'Bend It Like Beckham' will restore your faith in humanity", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/c6945524-e041-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires171153.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
