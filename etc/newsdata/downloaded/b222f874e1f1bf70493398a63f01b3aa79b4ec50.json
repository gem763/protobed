International also rose 0.3% to $58.91.\n\nAlso supporting oil prices today were reports that OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \"will do whatever (is) in its power\" to sustain oil market stability beyond 2020.\n\nWeekly crude inventories data from the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe reports have been delayed one day because of a U.S. government holiday.\n\nWhile not a directional driver for the oil markets today, concerns over fresh troubles in U.S.-China trade negotiations returned.\n\nReports this week said Beijing now wants the U.S. to rollback tariffs before agreeing to purchase as much as $50 billion of American agriculture products under the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal touted by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTension between the two sides escalated further after the U.S. House passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act overnight.\n\nIt would require an annual review of whether the city is sufficiently autonomous from Beijing to justify its special trading status under U.S. law.\n\nChina has vowed to retaliate if the U.S. passed the act.\n\nMeanwhile, reports of an explosion at Saudi Arabia\u2019s Sasref refinery were cited as a tailwind for oil prices. The blast, caused by a gas leak, revived worries over supply disruptions after the Sept. 14 attack on the kingdom\u2019s gigantic Abqaiq oil processing facility that temporarily knocked out half of daily world crude output.", "description": "Oil Prices Rise Amid Brexit Hope, But Worries Over China Limit Gain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2J0AZ-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
