They say it's time to chip away at a formula has led to a multibillion-dollar underinvestment in fast-growing Colorado's schools and roads.\n\nTABOR requires that proponents go to the ballot to let voters decide.\n\nOpponents say it's just a first step to weaken or eliminate a safeguard that's allowed the private sector to fuel Colorado's robust economy and has kept state government growth in check. They're hoping that voters' insistent refusal to raise most taxes at the polls since 1992 will hold true Nov. 5.\n\n\"This is a rehearsal for future efforts to repeal TABOR,\" said Michael Fields, the face of the \"No on CC\" campaign as executive director of the conservative nonprofit Colorado Rising Action.\n\n\"The one thing standing in the way of those who want to grow government are the taxpayers. Most Coloradans don't like having their power over taxes curbed.\"\n\nCarol Hedges, executive director of the liberal Colorado Fiscal Institute, says a tax code unique among the states in that it's written into the state constitution, rather than in statute, cannot adapt to rapid economic changes or meet the needs of a growing and aging population.\n\n\"We tend to put principles and values in state constitutions that don't change over time,\" said Hedges, whose institute estimates that Colorado's state taxes per $1,000 of income rank a lowly 45th among U.S. states. \"Is tax policymaking at the ballot a viable tool for addressing the challenges of a growing state?\"\n\nProposition CC asks voters if the state can keep revenue in those years when it has a surplus and is required to return that money to taxpayers. Any excess revenue would be allocated to transportation and transit, K-12 schools and higher education. Supporters say an annual audit would ensure the funds are spent properly.\n\nColoradans voted in 2005 to let the state avoid tax refunds for five years. The new ballot question would make that change in tax law permanent.\n\nTABOR requires that government at all levels get voter approval for tax hikes, bonding or revenue retention. Many local municipalities have done so to fund school districts and public safety.\n\nTABOR also sets an annual state income limit that can trigger tax refunds based on a formula that involves population and inflation. Many Democrats say that prevents Colorado from taking advantage of good economic times to fund schools \u2014 hundreds of which are on four-day weeks \u2014 and an aging, and increasingly congested, road network.\n\nLegislative economists estimate the state stands to refund $264 million in fiscal year 2019-2020 and $143 million in 2020-2021. Anticipated individual refunds next year could range from $20 to $62.\n\n\"This is not an assault on TABOR,\" House Speaker KC Becker argued during a recent debate, insisting Proposition CC doesn't raise taxes. \"If we want a top-notch state, we need to make the investments in our infrastructure.\"\n\nVoters approved TABOR in 1992, an idiosyncratic election year in which Colorado also chose a Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 Bill Clinton \u2014 for the first time since 1964. Colorado's population was 3.5 million then. It's approaching 6 million today.\n\nFiscal conservatives nationwide celebrated TABOR as another landmark in a tax revolt dating to California's property tax-slashing Proposition 13 in 1978.\n\nEfforts to duplicate TABOR failed elsewhere, however, though several states adopted limits on spending or revenue collection in their constitutions.\n\nMore than $3 million has poured into the campaigns for and against Proposition CC, including monetary and in-kind contributions from the Koch brothers-founded Americans for Prosperity on the \"no\" side and Colorado billionaire Pat Stryker, a liberal political donor, on the \"yes\" side.\n\nWith TABOR itself potentially on the table \u2014 the Colorado Fiscal Institute and others have proposed a 2020 ballot measure to repeal it \u2014 Proposition CC will gauge how far Colorado has turned to the left, said Dick Wadhams, former state Republican Party chair.\n\nHe noted that Democrats' 2018 triumphs were tempered by voters' rejection of new taxes for transportation.\n\n\"It's a tough sell,\" he said. \"I think Colorado voters are comfortable with the idea that the power to raise taxes should reside with voters and not with the Legislature or the governor.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
