Why would they come and attack an innocent person, Mum? Why?'.\n\nHis parents, Peter and Freda Mulla, said they had been advised to 'move out of the area' following the attack, although they did not say who by\n\nGadi Mulla, 15, from London, was stabbed when he was on the way home from football practice after wandering into the wrong area\n\nGadi survived the stabbing attack, which took place while on his way home from football at 8pm in Canning Town (pictured, the crime scene)\n\nGadi survived a knife attack in July of this year, having accidentally wandered into the wrong area at the wrong time.\n\nHe was approached by a group while he was on his way home from football practice, who demanded to know where he was from.\n\nHe said: 'I just froze, I didn't know what to say. I don't even remember him stabbing me [in the neck]'.\n\nGadi continued: 'I was bleeding, I was bleeding, and then I saw lots of blood pouring out. I was just holding it tight, squeezing it.'\n\nThe attack happened after Gadi wandered into the wrong area at the wrong time on 13 July this year (pictured, the crime scene where Gadi was attacked)\n\nOfficers were called to Ripley Road in Canning Town at around 8pm to reports of a stabbing, the Metropolitan Police said, but no arrests were made following Gadi's attack.\n\nHe recovered in hospital after the attack, with his grateful family by his side.\n\nHis mother Freda said she was left devastated by what had happened, saying: '[I thought] Please let him be alive, please let him be alive.\n\n'I was praying for him to survive with all my energy. Those were my feelings as a mother.'\n\nGadi recovered in Royal London Hospital after the attack, which he said had left him feeling 'paranoid' and frightened at night\n\nFreda said she was devastated by what happened, and had put all of her energy into praying that Gadi would recover from the attack\n\nMeanwhile father Peter said they'd been advised to leave London, but did not mention who by, explaining: 'So they are saying the best thing to do is to move out the area.'\n\nGadi revealed he was haunted by the attack, which he said had left him 'angry' and 'paranoid', especially at nighttime.\n\nHe said: 'I can't sleep well at night because sometimes I'm still up because I'm paranoid. Or just like...I think about it and I don't want to sleep.'\n\nLater, he admitted: 'I just get frustrated sometimes. And I'm just angry, like...why me?'\n\nThe fifteen-year-old revealed he was haunted by the attack, saying he had been left 'angry', 'frustrated' and 'paranoid'\n\nAnd while his father said the attack had left the family keen to move away from London to get some 'peace of mind', Gadi said he was 'completely against it'.\n\nThe fifteen-year-old revealed he was unwilling to leave his life and friends behind, saying: 'I have football and I have school. It's not like they targeted me.'\n\nBut when his mother asked how he knew that, Gadi questioned: 'Why would they come and attack an innocent person, Mum? Why?'\n\nData released by the BBC shows London has 16 of the 25 worst-hit areas for knife crime rate in the country, with rural Cornwall and Norfolk the areas with the lowest number of incidents.\n\nThe family were left in disagreement over whether they should move out of London, with Gadi insisting they should stay put\n\nThe age with the largest number of both victims and suspects is the 25 to 34 years old bracket, with 18 to 24-year-olds the second hardest hit.\n\nThe number of homicides in 2018/19 increased slightly to 701 offences from 693 in the previous 12 months, excluding terror attacks.\n\nHowever, the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased by 9 per cent in the last year, to 260 offences.\n\nBy May, there had already been 100 fatal stabbings this year in England and Wales, according to BBC research.\n\n", "description": "Gadi Mulla, 15, was stabbed on the way home from football practice in Canning Town, East London in July this year.
