Plus, you can prep most of the meal ahead of time and still have a chance to relax on your holiday and hang out with your guests.\n\nChef Ryan Scott\n\nCheck out their best tips and full recipes below and share your favorite on social media with \"GMA\" this Labor Day weekend.\n\nItalian Slider Party Hoagie\n\nChef Ryan Scott\n\nChef Scott shared a few suggestions for what make this versatile recipe so simple and special.\n\nSlide your patties into the freezer: Usually it's best to pull out a large hunk of meat to take the chill off of it for at least 45 minutes before it hits the grill. But with sliders, like the ones in Scott's hoagie, you want to put a quick chill on them for at least 45 minutes to an hour in your freezer. Sliders can overcook quickly, so putting them in the freezer for at least an hour allows you to get that perfect pink medium rare on your screaming hot grill.\n\nSeason and clean the grill with an onion: Cut an onion in half and wipe it across the grates, it will perfume the grill and clean it at the same time.\n\nInterchange ingredients easily: Scott said you can swap out the protein with pork patties, grilled chicken breast or even shrimp. \"This recipe is a vessel for you to change it to whatever you like,\" he said.\n\nTechnique tip: Choose a high quality Italian dressing that only has oil, vinegar, and seasoning in the ingredients list. You can make your own of course, but store bought is great for saving time as long as you choose the right brands. Also, when shopping for your bread, try to find a baguette that is on the softer side, not a super crusty loaf. The sandwich will eat a lot easier that way!\n\nSwap Option: If you don\u2019t like olives, try sun dried tomatoes or roasted garlic for the aioli; Mediterranean flavors that go great with the Italian dressing, peppers and provolone.\n\nWhy I love this recipe: I love a good sub, and this one is perfect for sharing on game day, or for any big gathering. The Italian flavors make this different from your usual sliders, and the sheer size of the thing is super impressive!\n\nServing Size: 6-8\n\nTotal cook time: 35 minutes, prep 15, active 20\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the olive aioli\n\n1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives\n\n1/3 cup mayo\n\nPinch ground black pepper\n\n1/4 tsp garlic powder\n\nFor the hoagie\n\n1 pound ground beef\n\n1 24-inch long soft baguette or long skinny hoagie (you can also use 2 foot-long hoagie rolls)\n\n1 pack thin sliced pancetta (about 6-8 slices)\n\n4 slices provolone cheese\n\n2 cups shredded romaine lettuce\n\n4-8 pepperoncinis, stem removed and sliced in half lengthwise\n\n1 ripe tomato, sliced thin\n\n1 tablespoon Italian dressing\n\nDirections:\n\nTo make the olive aioli chop the olives by hand or in a food processor until chunky. Add the mayo, garlic powder and pepper, mix to combine and set aside.\n\nTo make the slider hoagie start by dividing the ground beef into eight equal parts and shape each one into a patty. Set onto a sheet pan and put in the freezer.\n\nSpread the pancetta slices on a parchment-lined sheet pan and put in a 375 degree oven for five to seven minutes to crisp up. It will look like small, delicate bacon. Set aside.\n\nSplit the baguette or hoagies horizontally. Butter or oil the inside and toast in the broiler or on the grill.\n\nTake the raw sliders from the freezer. Coat them with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook them on a hot cast-iron, grill pan or outside grill on high heat for three to four minutes on each side for medium rare/medium. Put a half slice of provolone on each slider and melt in thebroiler or on the grill with the gas off and lid closed for one minute.\n\nSpread the olive aioli on the bottom half of the toasted bread. Arrange the sliders on top of the aioli, snuggled right up against each other (eight sliders should fit exactly on one standard length baguette). Top the burgers with crispy pancetta, tomato slices, and sliced pepperoncinis.\n\nIn a small bowl, toss the shredded lettuce with the Italian dressing. Top the sliders with a mound of dressed lettuce and put the top half of the toasted bread on top. Use frilly toothpicks to secure the sandwich, using one per slider patty.\n\nSlice off the servings by the slider, or two for the hungry guys and gals!\n\n\n\nPotato Salad Dog with Crushed BBQ Potato Chips\n\nABC News\n\nDoug Adams, the chef and partner of two popular Portland eateries, Bullard and Abigail Hall, shared his top tips for an amped up hot dog.\n\nUse a high-quality hot dog: Adams said he likes Olympic Provisions, which is local in Portland, but there are many other brands that are all-natural.
