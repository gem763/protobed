Most recently, the company acquired Fox Restaurant Concepts which includes North Italia and will not only diversify the real estate footprint but help drive growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Tower said Cheesecake Factory continues to focus on off-premise dining and accounts for 16% of sales today. This represents an opportunity to contribute 1% to 2% to same-store sales over the next few years from improved consumer awareness, potential new partnerships, and growth from digital.\n\nManagement continues to test TV commercials in 12 markets and Tower said this suggests an openness to tools that was \"previously shunned\" to drive growth. In fact, Cheesecake Factory spends the least amount on marketing among casual dining chains and a successful ad campaign could support same-store sales growth and potentially grow traffic over time.\n\nPrice Action\n\nShares of Cheesecake Factory traded higher by 2.14% Friday at $40.49.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nWells Fargo Cuts Cheesecake Factory's Price Target On Lower Outlook, Higher M&A Risks\n\nRaymond James Is Hungry For Cheesecake Factory And Chili's\n\nLatest Ratings for CAKE\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Upgrades Market Perform Outperform Aug 2019 Maintains Neutral Aug 2019 Maintains Market Perform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CAKE\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
