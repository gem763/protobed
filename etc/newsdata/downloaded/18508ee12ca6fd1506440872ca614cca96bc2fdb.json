Photo: Rich Pedroncelli/AP/Shutterstock\n\nOver the past two weeks, protesters have flooded the California state capitol to oppose a bill that restricts the medical exemptions parents have been using to avoid vaccinating their children. The outcry comes four years after state lawmakers eliminated personal-belief and religious exemptions for public-school attendees, which were the most common workarounds used to get kids enrolled without having them vaccinated. The anti-vax movement has been ridiculed widely. Critics lambast its adherents for willfully exposing other people\u2019s children to preventable diseases \u2014 like the measles \u2014 often based on dubious medical beliefs, like that vaccines cause autism. But amid their subsequent claims to victimhood and oppression, anti-vaxxers had largely avoided marching in major cities singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d and chanting, \u201cNo segregation, no discrimination, education for all!\u201d while carrying signs that read, \u201cWelcome to Nazifornia.\u201d\n\nUntil now.\n\n\u201cThis is misappropriation of a movement [the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s] that really is not over and proves to be challenging to overcome,\u201d Assemblywoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a Los Angeles Democrat and member of the California Legislative Black Caucus, told Politico of the mostly white women protesters\u2019 antics in Sacramento this week. \u201cThe whole conversation around vaccinations is actually one about privilege and opportunity. It\u2019s a personal choice. It\u2019s a luxury to be able to have a conversation about medical exemptions and about whether or not you think your child should be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nIncreased skepticism about vaccines \u2014 and fear of their alleged side effects \u2014 has since 2001 helped quadruple the percentage of American children under 2 years old who haven\u2019t had any, according to the Washington Post. Research shows that in California, personal-belief exemptions were claimed overwhelmingly by well-off white people before being outlawed. This is supported by both anecdotal evidence and news reports, including the notorious 2014 Hollywood Reporter investigation that uncovered school vaccination rates in several of Los Angeles\u2019s whiter and wealthier neighborhoods, including Beverly Hills and Malibu, comparable to those in South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s newest and least-developed economies.\n\nBut the California protests, which were in response to Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s signing Senate Bill 276 into law on Monday, were equally notable for following a pattern in which white Americans equate their milder and often totally unrelated struggles to those endured by black Americans. People ranging from CNN anchor Chris Cuomo to former Maine governor Paul LePage have likened their personal travails \u2014 being called \u201cFredo\u201d and \u201cracist,\u201d respectively \u2014 to black people\u2019s being called \u201cnigger.\u201d Editorial cartoonist Glenn McCoy famously equated U.S. secretary of Education Betsy De Vos\u2019s testy Senate-confirmation process with Ruby Bridges desegregating an all-white New Orleans public school in 1964. At the root of this pattern is an inability to distinguish the wages of broad inequality from those of personal insult. Those who indulge the comparisons think the best way to illustrate the seriousness of their cause is to compare it to far more serious ones. But they succeed mostly in persuading observers of the opposite \u2014 that in the grand scheme, what they\u2019re going through really isn\u2019t that bad.", "description": "A new California vaccination law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom has drawn mostly-white woman protesters equating themselves with the civil-rights movement, chanting, \u2018No segregation!\u2019 and singing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 in the last two weeks.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/19/19-anti-vaccine-protest.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
