The state of one reflects on the other. Yet, there is a third dimension \u2014 the soul. In fact, the soul is that part of each one of us which is indestructible. So, how can we be complete without taking the soul into account? In my view, a beautiful person is one who values herself physically, mentally, emotionally and most importantly spiritually. When I talk of the spiritual aspect, I am not talking of the good and the bad, sin and virtue. I am referring to the inner Self or inner consciousness.\n\n\n\nNow the question arises \u2014 is imbibing spirituality in entrepreneurship possible? There are a wide range of perspectives. One aspect is that it is simply giving importance to personal values of honesty, integrity, and good quality work. Others say it is treating your co-workers and employees in a responsible, caring way. For some, it is participating in spiritual study groups or using prayer and meditation at work to reduce work-related stress.\n\n\n\nAnd for others, it is making their business socially responsible, its impact on the environment, serving the community and creating a better world.It is widely known that encouraging ethics and spiritual values in the workplace leads to increased productivity and profitability as well as employee retention; it improves a brand\u2019s reputation. Increasingly, business leaders are encouraging spirituality as a way to boost employee loyalty and enhance their morale, and reduce their stress levels.However, many people still think that spirituality and entrepreneurship are two ends of the spectrum that can never meet. A successful entrepreneur is always motivated by dreams, rather than having a sole motivation of merely acquiring wealth. It is important to have a dream as an entrepreneur, because that is the starting point. It is even more important to believe in that dream. Translating your dreams into reality is what entrepreneurship is all about. It needs inner strength which will only come from a spiritual bent of mind.You have one life to live and you should make the best use of your creativity and personal qualities. Faith in one\u2019s own abilities, a great entrepreneurial trait, is also an integral part of spirituality.Entrepreneurship in itself can be a spiritual journey, because it deals with expressing one\u2019s dreams and creativity. For this, our dreams and innovations should be guided by our spiritual values. This helps leaders in developing their inner mind, intuition and sometimes, even a sixth sense. These qualities, in turn, help them arrive at the right decisions and take correct actions. It is a kind of empowerment, because it gives confidence and a positive attitude to a leader. A positive mental attitude always gave me courage to take bold and visionary decisions, and also to cope with failures and setbacks.In fact, adversity has never shaken my spiritual strength or my faith in God. I have felt the presence of a higher consciousness in these times of duress. I felt it even more when I lost my only son. I had faced grief and loss before, but the depth of this loss was impossible to fathom and reconcile with. I surrendered totally to God; it gave me strength and I emerged stronger from this tragedy and adversity.For me, entrepreneurship was never only about making profits. What we call corporate social responsibility today is simply the fact that we must think beyond immediate profits, shares and dividends; it is a long-term commitment towards employees, the community at large and the environment.I always wanted to make a positive contribution by providing free beauty courses for the speech, hearing and visually impaired, as well as acid attack survivors. Today, I can say with conviction that this initiative has remained the nerve centre of my entrepreneurial journey. I have always felt that those who cannot pay are actually paying, because they pray for me and prayers are a commodity that cannot be bought. Prayers come straight from the heart. They buffer you against life\u2019s unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances. Above all, prayers give you spiritual strength and resilience to face life.I feel grateful to the Almighty that I have had this opportunity to pay back in a small way what I have received in plenty. \u25a0", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/746951-1350-420-5/spirituality-in-entrepreneurship.img", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
