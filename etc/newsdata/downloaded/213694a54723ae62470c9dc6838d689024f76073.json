Copywriting is experiencing a renaissance \u2014 and training like The Complete Digital Copywriting Master Class Bundle can launch new careers now.\n\nWhen you hear someone is embarking on a career as a writer, it immediately conjures romantic images of epic novels, larger than life characters and Hemingway-esque adventure. Sure, some writers have their heart set on crafting the Great American Novel. But more importantly, every writer wants to be read.\n\nAnd for every writer with visions of becoming the next Stephen King, there are dozens of writers earning healthy paychecks fashioning the words that we actually encounter every hour of every day all around us.\n\nCopywriting is more than advertising taglines and \u201cMad Men.\u201d In fact, with the explosion of digital media over the past two decades, opportunities to build a thriving and lucrative career as a copywriter are more plentiful \u2014 and more attainable \u2014 than ever.\n\nWhat is a Copywriter?\n\nCopywriting is the alchemy of art and science used in assembling just the right words that will persuade potential customers to take action and actually buy a product or service. So at its heart, you can say copywriting is actually a hyper-specialized form of sales. But instead of selling to one man or woman who picks up their phone, answers their door or walks into your storefront, a copywriter\u2019s job is to sell their product\u2019s message to hundreds, thousands, even millions everywhere via advertising, social media, web content and more.\n\nConsider this: according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 14.5 million Americans work in sales or a sales-related occupation. Meanwhile, the department puts the number of Americans paid to write for a living at just over 100,000.\n\nAnd with so many salespeople and so few writers out there, did we mention that the services of qualified copywriting specialists have never been in greater demand?\n\nBut while the market is awash with possibility for enterprising copywriting talent, being a man or woman who can use words to connect with an audience and motivate action in 2019 requires an even more acute skill set than past generations ever dreamed.\n\nThe Conundrum of Modern Copywriting\n\nThat\u2019s because Americans have become increasingly savvy about how and when they\u2019re being sold to. And they\u2019re demanding more.\n\nThose old school 200-to-300 word web posts constructed as click bait don\u2019t cut it anymore. Over the past five years, OrbitMedia found the length of an average blog post has risen from about 800 words to more than 1,150 words each. They also take more about an hour longer to compose. But there are riches for those who put in the work\u2026because the longer a copywriter works on a blog post, the higher the percentage who report \u201cstrong results\u201d from their efforts.\n\nSo if more time spent equals better results, how are the most successful copywriting talent able to invest their time where it belongs, in the work? That doesn\u2019t come from having writing talent. It comes from an expert-level understanding of the copywriting industry, how each facet of that industry operates and an almost innate knowledge of what messaging works \u2014 and what doesn\u2019t \u2014 with a 2019 audience.\n\nBecome a Copywriter\n\nUnderstanding copywriting like the back of your hand requires the right training from the ground up.
