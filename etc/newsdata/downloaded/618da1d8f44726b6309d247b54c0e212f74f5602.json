A former firefighter, Laws said he was catching children who were being dropped from the window above, before getting a shot in a beleaguered Eagles wide receiver Nelson Agholor.\n\nRead more: A hero at the scene of a Philadelphia fire says he caught babies being thrown from windows \u2014 and dropped a burn on Eagles' Nelson Agholor\n\n\"I see a guy hanging out the window screaming that his kids was in there, things like that.

By that time the ladder truck was pulling up,\" said Laws.\n\n\"My man just started throwing babies out the window and we was catching them, unlike Agholor, and his mishaps.\"\n\nLaws was an immediate hit with Philadelphia fandom, not just for his heroic act, but for feeling the need to remind the world of Agholor's recent struggles.\n\nIn the Eagles' Week 2 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Agholor let the game-winning touchdown pass slip right through his hands. Then on Sunday, hours before Laws' comments, Agholor again had a few painful drops that proved critical as the Eagles lost to the Detroit Lions at home.\n\nDespite his criticism, Agholor had nothing but love for Laws, and in a tweet, invited him and his family to come to an upcoming home game as his guests.\n\nWhile Agholor's big drops have come at poor moments for the Eagles, he's been productive thus far for the team, stepping up with 18 catches for 168 yards and three touchdowns on the year after injuries took DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffrey out for the past two games.\n\nShould the Eagles injury woes continue, fans might not scoff at the idea of having Laws and his sure hands in for a tryout.\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into Week 4\n\n'I would trade me for that': Former Dolphins lineman Laremy Tunsil told the team they should trade him after seeing what the Texans offered them in return\n\nTop 14 waiver-wire pickups for Week 4 of fantasy football\n\nLamar Jackson embarrassed a defender with a simple juke", "description": "Nelson Agholor had nothing but love for Hakim Laws, who criticized the Eagles wide receiver for his drops while speaking with a local news reporter.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a70572e22af13963751ee-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
