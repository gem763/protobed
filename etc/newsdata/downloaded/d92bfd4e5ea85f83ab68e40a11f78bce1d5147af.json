(Bob Ross Inc.)\n\nHis soothing voice swaddled you like a cozy blanket.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make mistakes, we make happy accidents,\u201d Bob Ross calmly reassured viewers while crafting his signature landscape paintings on \u201cThe Joy of Painting,\u201d his long-running PBS show. Now, those \u201chappy accidents\u201d that made the late artist a household name will get a rare showing in Purcellville, Va.\n\n\u201cHappy Accidents: An Exhibit of Original Bob Ross Paintings,\u201d opening Tuesday at the Franklin Park Arts Center, marks the largest display of the artist\u2019s work on the East Coast. Twenty-four original paintings from Ross\u2019 memorable show will be hung for the world to see at the center, located 50 miles from D.C. in Loudoun County.\n\nSo, how did Ross\u2019 paintings end up in a small Virginia town, anyway? Turns out, they\u2019ve been in the area for a while now \u2014 Bob Ross Inc., the company that houses his artwork and distributes his products, is based nearby in Fairfax County. The corporation\u2019s president, Joan Kowalski, and Franklin Park Arts Center\u2019s managing director, Elizabeth Bracey, are members of Loudoun County\u2019s Art Advisory Committee. After learning that the Smithsonian National Museum of American History had acquired some of Ross\u2019 works in March, Bracey asked Kowalski if she could exhibit some of Ross\u2019 paintings at her center.\n\n\u201cI realized that they had never done an exhibit like this before, so this is something really tremendous,\u201d Bracey says. \u201cJoan was saying to me that it\u2019s fitting to have this exhibit in a small gallery. It just fits Bob Ross.\u201d\n\nDespite Ross\u2019 irrefutable influence on pop culture and his sizable cult following, both of which are still going strong 24 years after his death, his creations have seldom been displayed in public. So, naturally, when free timed tickets for the exhibition went live last month, the demand was intense. Weekend passes were claimed within a couple of weeks, and spots at the one-day painting workshops \u2014 led by a certified Bob Ross instructor \u2014 filled up in about six hours.\n\n\u201cWhen he did his classes and his TV show, he was more about helping other people realize their artistic potential,\u201d Bracey says of Ross. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really ever see himself as a famous artist, like an Andy Warhol or Monet. So having an exhibit of his work was never something that he had wanted to do as a priority or something that he had planned.\u201d\n\nThe arts center\u2019s exhibition features paintings from the 1993 seasons of \u201cThe Joy of Painting.\u201d For each episode of his show, which originally ran from 1983 to 1994, Ross would paint his featured piece three times: The first version was done prior to the taping for Ross to use as a reference while on camera; the second was the painting Ross worked on during the taping; and the third was painted and photographed in various stages of completion for Ross\u2019 series of instructional books. In each case, the best of the three was chosen for display.\n\n\u201cHe loved painting nature as opposed to people,\u201d Bracey notes about Ross\u2019 artwork. \u201cHe was in the armed services, and was stationed or had training in Alaska, and he was very inspired by the landscape there.\u201d\n\nOnce the timed tickets to the exhibition are gone, that\u2019s it \u2014 Bracey says the arts center has no intention of expanding its schedule. (There are waitlists for times that are currently at capacity.) Each timed entry will be generally limited to around 60 people to ensure that everyone gets to view Ross\u2019 serene paintings in peace \u2014 which is most likely what the calm, cool and collected artist would have wanted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me the emotional connection that people have with him and with the show,\u201d Bracey says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people in their 70s and 80s all the way down to teenagers and college students. I have learned even more about him through this experience myself.\u201d\n\nFranklin Park Arts Center, 36441 Blueridge View Lane, Purcellville, Va.; Tue. through Oct. 15, free.", "description": "\"Happy Accidents\" at the Franklin Park Arts Center in Purcellville, Va., features works created by the late, beloved artist for his memorable PBS series \"The Joy of Painting.\"", "authors": ["Stephanie Williams", "Stephanie Is A Freelance Journalist Covering Music", "Art", "Culture For The Washington Post.
