Parker says this is what the Americans her group say they want, despite reports that Medicare For All enjoys a 51percent approval rating from adults.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your traditional polling,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThis is the largest ever market research health care study. \u201cThis provides a message for the Republicans to run on as far as what the American people want. And they were very clear: they do not want one size fits all health care. They want personalized health care. They want choice.\u201d\n\nJCNF\u2019s framework, like the RSC\u2019s, also offers ideas to lower the cost of drugs and insurance premiums. But its main \u2014 and arguably most important \u2014 focus is on increasing choice in health care.\n\n\u201cImagine ordering your computer online, you decide the options on it you want and you order exactly what you want based on your needs,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThe research came back with three clearly-defined desires: repair, restore, and improve the doctor-patient relationship, remove bureaucrats from the health care process for patients, and increase choice so costs will come down.\u201d\n\nProponents of Medicare For All might say that Parker\u2019s market research got it wrong \u2014 that Americans actually do favor Medicare For All or some sort of government-run health care. But there\u2019s evidence to suggest that this may be because most people don\u2019t understand what Medicare For All would do \u2014 and how much it would cost.\n\nThe latest survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation asked adults about Medicare for All and found 51 percent support it, 46 percent oppose it. At first glance, that looks like a just-big-enough majority to be a winner in November 2020, although it\u2019s worth noting this sample is of adults, not registered voters or likely voters. But the same survey also revealed that a majority of Americans are still seriously misinformed about how Medicare for All would work. 55 percent of respondents believed that people who get insurance through their jobs would keep those plans, and the same percentage believed that people who bought their own insurance would keep those plans. A separate question found that 40 percent said they thought private insurance would still be the primary way that Americans would get coverage under Medicare for All. 54 percent said that individuals and employers would continue to pay health insurance premiums.\n\nKatarina Lindley, a direct primary care physician in Texas, originally from Croatia, remembers well the socialized medicine she grew up under in Yugoslavia and says when attempts to treat everyone under a government-run health care scheme means higher costs and lower quality. She\u2019s seen it first hand, she says.\n\nLindley is very supportive of any idea that restores the doctor-patient relationship, she says, both on behalf of doctors who will be unburdened by the hours of billing related to bureaucratic requirements and patients who have better and quicker access to physicians.\n\n\u201cOne of the first building blocks is restoring the patient/physician relationship,\u201d Lindley said. \u201cAnd i think once you do that everything else will fall into place. There\u2019s no easy fix in medicine, but I still believe the free market will adjust and allow for different ways for medicine to be practiced and patients and physicians will both be happy.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans in Congress begin to take the ideas of both the RSC study in the house and JCNF\u2019s market research in the Senate, put them together into sister bills that move health care away from one-size-fits-all, then Trump\u2019s prophecy that the GOP will become the party of health care will surely come to pass. And the American people will own a stake in the process.\n\nSarah Lee is a freelance writer and policy wonk living and working in Washington, DC.", "description": ".10/24/2019 20:32:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Sarah", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/280/b8a2fc66-5fdd-4dc7-8cf5-60d58e7eb599.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
