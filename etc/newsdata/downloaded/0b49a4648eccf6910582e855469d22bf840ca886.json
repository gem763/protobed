He loved his car.\"", "description": "Frome College teacher Anna Kirsopp-Lewis, 34, was weeks away from giving birth to a second son when she was hit by Porsche driver Ian Barton", "authors": ["Ben Mitchell", "Image", "Pa", "Somerset Live Ws", "Solent News", "Photo Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717498.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Anna-Kirsopp-Lewis-inquest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
