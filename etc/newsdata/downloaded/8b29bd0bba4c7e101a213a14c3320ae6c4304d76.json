Several, like Ms. DePiero, have attended more than 50 Trump rallies.\n\nShe keeps going because she trusts only the president to deliver her the news. \u201cHow else would I know what\u2019s going on?\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Trump has hosted more than 550 ticketed campaign events since 2015, at least 70% of which include his trademark rallies, according to Republican officials. These rallies form the core of one of the most steadfast political movements in modern American political history, a dynamic that has reordered the Republican Party.\n\nRandal Thom shows a \u2018Front Row Joes\u2019 bracelet and pin in Cincinnati in late July.

Somewhere between 5% to 10% of attendees have been to multiple events, the officials said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS To what lengths would you go to see a political candidate you really liked? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cYou go to the rallies, and he basically tells you that you don\u2019t have to put up with \u2018the swamp\u2019 and those kinds of people,\u201d said Saundra Kiczenski, a 40-year-old Walmart worker from Michigan who has been to 29 rallies. \u201cBecause of him I decided not to pay for Obamacare, not pay the fine. And what happened? Nothing. Before, the quiet me would have paid the fine. But Donald Trump told me that we have a voice, and now I stand up for myself.\u201d\n\nThe Trump rally die-hards\u2014a few dozen men and women who have been to more than 10 rallies\u2014are almost exclusively white. Many are recently retired with time on their hands and little to keep them tied to home. A handful never had children. Others are estranged from their families.\n\nSeveral of those with jobs live paycheck to paycheck, but constantly offer strangers a cold beverage, sandwiches or their last cigarette.\n\nSome rely on disability payments, like Cynthia Barten, or cut lawns in Missouri, like her husband, Ken Barten. Others sell secondhand items in Kentucky like Jon French, or find odd jobs such as clearing rocks from farmland in Minnesota, like Randal Thom. Kevin Steele quit his job and plans to finance his travels to Trump rallies with the remaining $120,000 from an inheritance.\n\nThe group includes Trump aficionados, who have spent decades keeping tabs on his history of political flirtations, tabloid melodrama and star turns on reality television. A surprising number voted for Barack Obama at least once, caught up in the Democrat\u2019s charisma and fed up with Republicans over foreign adventurism and growing national debt.\n\nLibby DePiero, a retiree from Connecticut, has attended more than 50 Trump rallies.

Photo: Cheryl Senter for The Wall Street Journal\n\nRally regulars stay connected through Facebook and text messages, pinging one another to see who is attending the next rally, who can carpool and who wants to split a hotel room.\n\nMs. DePiero broke up a 700-mile drive to the Cincinnati rally on Aug. 1 by spending the night with Becky Gee, a northeast Ohio dairy farmer she met at a previous Trump rally. She stayed with Barbara Bienkowski in Maryland (they met at Trump Hotel in Washington earlier this year), on her way to the Greenville, N.C., rally on July 17 and stayed in Myrtle Beach, S.C., with Dale Ranney, another Front Row Joe, on the way home.\n\nTwo regular rallygoers have already married, and divorced.\n\nAll of them describe, in different ways, a euphoric flow of emotions between themselves and the president, a sort of adrenaline-fueled, psychic cleansing that follows 90 minutes of chanting and cheering with 15,000 other like-minded Trump junkies.\n\n\u201cOnce you start going, it\u2019s kind of like an addiction, honestly,\u201d said April Owens, a 49-year-old financial manager in Kingsport, Tenn., who has been to 11 rallies. \u201cI love the energy. I wouldn\u2019t stand in line for 26 hours to see any rock band. He\u2019s the only person I would do this for, and I\u2019ll be here as many times as I can.\u201d\n\nFor many Front Row Joes, the Trump era marks their political awakening. Among the first Americans to identify the resonance and endurance of Mr. Trump\u2019s political appeal, they are reveling in the victory. Like Mr. Trump on stage, each recounts the Election Night triumph without any prompting.\n\nIn Orlando, Fla., Trump fans sat in a field adjacent to Amway Center in June, about to get soaked by the second downpour in as many days. Still, they wore sunglasses and smiles as outdoor speakers pumped out \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d and \u201cHurts So Good.\u201d Head shakes and patronizing laughs greeted questions about which Democrat might beat Mr. Trump.\n\nPresident Trump arriving at a rally in Manchester, N.H., in mid-August.

The chant erupted as Mr. Trump was criticizing Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.). Three days earlier, Mr. Trump had tweeted that Ms. Omar and three other liberal congresswomen, all women of color, should \u201cgo back\u201d to unspecified countries. The four women are American citizens and three of them were born in the U.S.\n\nBefore the rally, more than a dozen supporters said they would never use that racist language to denounce minorities. Inside Williams Arena, many participated in the chant that mirrored it. \u201cIt was like a tornado when \u2018send her back\u2019 started. I was looking around and people were loving it,\u201d Ms. DePiero said.\n\nThe regulars who arrived early at rallies\u2014often before campaign officials or local law enforcement\u2014hurried to set up tents and organize their belongings. The Bartens, who drove their Dodge minivan seven hours from St. Louis to be first in line in Cincinnati, unfolded a table and set down a deep-cycle military battery, a camp stove for turkey melts, a string of LED festoon lights and a half-empty pack of Edgefield cigarettes.\n\nThey mingled until doors opened, then rushed to the front row on the arena floor. But not necessarily center-stage.\n\nLibby DePiero and husband, Brian, head to the VIP section of President Trump's campaign event at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, N.H. Photo: Cheryl Senter for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSome, like, Shane Doyle, prefer the side where Mr. Trump first appears from behind the curtains. \u201cBack in the primary, I used to like being the first one when he came out, because he would sign all my stuff,\u201d said Mr. Doyle, a 24-year-old machinist from Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nJust before midnight on the eve of the Cincinnati rally, about two dozen fans lounged in lawn chairs or leaned on metal bike racks, scrolling through their phones and sipping from cans of Coors Light. A soft brown blanket covered Ms. Barten and her 12-year-old granddaughter, who slept sitting up in her camp chair.\n\nThe 57-year-old Air Force veteran\u2019s disability check is reduced by $5 every month by an automatic donation to the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not rich by any means,\u201d Ms. Barten said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what: When we\u2019re rich in our hearts with our country and our president, we\u2019re richer than anybody.\u201d\n\n\u2014Elise Cho contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michael C.
