Meanwhile, of-the-moment rapper DaBaby gets deeply personal on \u201cIntro.\u201d Sabrina Claudio makes moody magic with Julia Michaels on \u201cTruth Is.\u201d Electric Guest prove they have a sound of their own on the infectious \u201cMore.\u201d And C\u00e9line Dion keeps coming through with soaring anthems, releasing a trio of new songs ahead of a world tour.\n\n\u201cStack It Up,\u201d Liam Payne feat. A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you get an email from Ed Sheeran in your inbox. When it happens, artists tend to take notice. That was the case for Payne, who worked with Sheeran on this catchy new tune \u2014 a follow-up and \u201cbrother\u201d of sorts to his first solo single, 2017\u2019s \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d as Payne told TIME. \u201cStack It Up\u201d sees Payne hit his musical sweet spot, which falls somewhere between pop, R&B and hip-hop with a deeply catchy beat; this time, he\u2019s added in New York rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie for contrast. As for the content of the tune? \u201cIt\u2019s about the journey of making money together with someone, and how nice it can be to give somebody everything and want to work hard for them,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe lyrics are from the perspective of someone from a \u201cworking-class background, who\u2019s got a really big dream but it just seems a world away at the moment.\u201d (See: \u201cWanna be livin\u2019 it up in VIP.\u201d) It\u2019s a relatable character for Payne, who was launched to superstardom as a teen with boy band One Direction but comes from humble roots himself. \u201cStack It Up\u201d is the first taste of Payne\u2019s debut solo album, which he says mixes references from Justin Timberlake\u2019s Justified, Chris Brown and Usher\u2019s 2001 album 8701. (\u201cI\u2019ve cried about several women to that album,\u201d Payne admitted.) In the meantime, \u201cStack It Up\u201d should satisfy his fans\u2019 autumnal bop craving.\n\n\u201cIntro,\u201d DaBaby\n\nThis year, it\u2019s seemed like North Carolina rapper DaBaby has been living the good life: his star has risen in hip-hop following the release of a successful debut album in the spring, Baby on Baby. And if his verses are anything to go by, he\u2019s seemed to be having a lot of fun while getting tapped by artists like Lil Nas X and Post Malone for features, thanks to his distinctive flow. But \u201cIntro,\u201d a new song off his upcoming sophomore album, shows another side of the fast-talking artist. He starts things off bluntly, explaining that at the same time his career was hitting its zenith this year, he got the news his dad had been found dead. It\u2019s arrestingly honest. \u201cLet\u2019s raise our kids right, let\u2019s watch the sh-t we teach \u2019em,\u201d he insists sincerely. \u201cI ain\u2019t rappin\u2019, I\u2019m preachin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\n\u201cTruth Is,\u201d Sabrina Claudio\n\nSabrina Claudio casts a veritable spell on \u201cTruth Is,\u201d the title track off the Puerto-Rican/Cuban singer\u2019s upcoming collaborative album, due in early October. Over intimate guitar, Claudio spills her heart in a voice that manages to be both breathy and deeply resonant. Co-written with sad-pop magician Julia Michaels, it\u2019s a tenderly self-reflective bit of dreamy R&B-pop. \u201cI don\u2019t even get jealous when you mention other women,\u201d she says confidently at first \u2014 and then turns right back around. \u201cTruth is I\u2019m dishonest, \u2019cause I\u2019m always scared to get too deep,\u201d she admits, her voice breaking a little into a whisper. The production builds and soars, but never overtakes her hums and intonations, staying warm and close to the heart.\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d Electric Guest\n\nIndie duo Asa Taccone and Matthew Compton have been behind some seriously bright earworms in the past few years \u2014 like Portugal. The Man\u2019s \u201cFeel It Still\u201d and Carly Rae Jepsen\u2018s \u201cFeels Right.\u201d Now the L.A.-based pair are making a new play as a front-and-center act, doubling down on their pop sensibility. \u201cMore,\u201d off their upcoming third album Kin out in October, has their signature light touch. It\u2019s a retro-inflected electro-pop tune that rings sweet and sincere. Taccone\u2019s lilting falsetto is a comforting topline over bouncy, catchy production.\n\n\u201cLying Down,\u201d C\u00e9line Dion\n\nThe amazing thing about C\u00e9line Dion is that as her career has continued, she\u2019s reinvented herself just enough to stay relevant while maintaining the timeless sound that has made her a long-term star. \u201cLying Down,\u201d one of a triplet of new songs released by the iconic Canadian vocalist, is an unabashedly dramatic turn that should play well in concert format, given Dion\u2019s penchant for bold production and set pieces. (She just launched a world tour, too.) Written in part by well-known French DJ David Guetta and perennial hitmaker Sia, it\u2019s got a bombastic, reach-for-the-stars chorus (see: Sia\u2019s \u201cChandelier\u201d and all of her other big hits) and a melody begging for a club remix. But really it\u2019s Dion who\u2019s the star here, as she turns material that could be run-of-the-mill pop into a display of vocal virtuosity.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "New music from Liam Payne, DaBaby, C\u00e9line Dion, Sabrina Claudio and Electric Guest should make your weekend playlist.", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/liam-payne.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
