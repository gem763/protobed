Manny Bermudez doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree, but he sees those measuring points a little different than most.\n\n\u201cBeing in the gym, training with other people, I know there\u2019s better people than me out there,\u201d Bermudez told reporters at a Wednesday media session. \u201cI know there\u2019s people that are tougher. I there\u2019s this, that, this, so I kind of grew up already, knowing what it\u2019s like not always coming out on top. So for me, it\u2019s just another day. You can pull yourself back together and get back in that win column, continue to perform.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that big of a deal.\u201d\n\nBermudez was undefeated in his professional career prior to an August decision loss to Casey Kenny at UFC 241. It also ended an impressive run of three consecutive submission wins under the UFC banner. Still, the 25-year-old said he didn\u2019t put too much emphasis on the setback. After all, as many fighters will tell, MMA careers are often about the journey as a whole rather than too much focus on any individual moments.\n\n\u201cIn this sport, it\u2019s not about staying undefeated forever,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about just being perfect. I think a lot of fighters get into this because they got their butts kicked sometimes or because they grew up with challenges \u2013 and I think that\u2019s a part of the sport, overcoming challenges and being able to step up and being able to recover, adapt and improve.\u201d\n\nBermudez (14-1 MMA, 3-1 UFC) will get the change to showcase his growth at Friday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 at TD Garden, when he meets fellow Massachusetts native Charles Rosa (11-3 MMA, 2-3 UFC) on the night\u2019s ESPN2-broadcast preliminary card.\n\nDespite the two sharing a similar home base, the pair have not crossed paths in their training. Bermudez took that as a bit of an opportunity to boast that he\u2019s the real local favorite, with Rosa training at Florida\u2019s famed American Top Team.\n\n\u201cHis nickname\u2019s \u2018Boston Strong\u2019 right, what\u2019s he doing in Florida?\u201d Bermudez joked.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a big moment for Bermudez. His undefeated record is gone, but not many fighters carry that very far into their pro runs. He\u2019s also moving up to featherweight following a pair of 140-pound catchweight contests.\n\nIt\u2019s not do or die. His back isn\u2019t against the wall. But one only wants to suffer so many setbacks.\n\nStill, Bermudez said he didn\u2019t have to look very far to gather some inspiration for this contest.\n\n\u201cJeremy Stephens is on this card, and he\u2019s a guy I reference to a lot because he\u2019s had plenty of ups and plenty of downs, and he\u2019s a guy that I think would be tough for anybody to be fighting,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cHe\u2019s a veteran of the sport, and I think to become somebody like that, you have to go through the wins, you have to go through the losses. You have to get hurt. You have to fight through injuries and all of that stuff. I think it\u2019s a part of growing.\u201d", "description": "It's often said in MMA that you learn more from losses than wins, but Manny Bermudez sees those measuring points different than most.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/manny-bermudez-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
