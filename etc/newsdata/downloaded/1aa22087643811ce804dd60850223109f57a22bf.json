(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nDaniel Hudson, one of the few relievers the Washington Nationals trust late in games, will not be on the active roster for Game 1 of the National League Championship Series. The veteran right-hander will begin the series on the paternity list after he flew from Los Angeles to Phoenix to be with his wife, Sara, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s third child, a daughter, who arrived in the early hours of Friday morning, according to Manager Dave Martinez. Everything went \u201cgreat,\u201d a person with knowledge of the situation told The Post, and Hudson chose to spend an extra day with his wife.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss him today,\u201d Martinez said Friday afternoon. \u201cI told him \u2026 \u2018Hey, family\u2019s always first.\u2019 I mean, I get it, I understand. The timing didn\u2019t work out like we thought.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old expects to be back for Game 2 on Saturday. The player designated to be deactivated whenever he returns is Wander Suero, a right-handed reliever Manager Dave Martinez leaned on throughout the season (his 78 appearances led the team). The Nationals kept two long men, Javy Guerra and Austin Voth, ahead of Suero because of the longer, best-of-seven series.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re better off with having Guerra,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI mean, if we have to use Voth for a couple innings tonight or the next day, he might be down for a day, so \u2014 or two. So having Guerra is important.\u201d\n\nHudson\u2019s absence is important. He and left-hander Sean Doolittle are the two relievers on whom Martinez relies the most. Martinez will likely use Tanner Rainey in Hudson\u2019s high-leverage role if the situation dictates Friday night, though any save opportunity would likely fall to Doolittle.\n\nRainey, a 26-year-old right-hander with a high-90s fastball, earned Martinez\u2019s trust in the seventh inning of Game 5 of the NLDS in Los Angeles. He entered and retired both the hitters he faced. Martinez complimented Rainey\u2019s body of work over since September started, when he allowed two runs in 9\u2153 innings of work while posting a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 14-3. The free passes are what hurt Rainey in the past, but if he has put those issues behind him he could be a big boost for a Nationals bullpen in Hudson\u2019s absence.\n\nRead more about the Nationals:\n\nNationals\u2019 playoff march feels more and more like Capitals\u2019 Stanley Cup run (no jinx)\n\nThe Capitals remain all-in on the Nationals\u2019 magical playoff run\n\nNationals finally break through to NLCS on Howie Kendrick\u2019s 10th-inning grand slam\n\nBoswell: Howie Kendrick keeps the party going, and the Nats are dancing into the NLCS\n\nClayton Kershaw, of all people, let the Nationals back into Game 5\n\nSvrluga: For heroic Nationals, ghosts of playoffs past are busted in Game 5", "description": "The right-hander chose to stay with his wife one extra day after she gave birth to the couple's third child early Friday in Phoenix.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "October At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RFqeEnOQds299uUhF-K-l6B6x-w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KYSDG7XJOII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
