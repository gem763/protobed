Rep. Devin Nunes, may yield time to Intelligence Committee staff, totaling up to 45 minutes each when counted up with their own questions. Rank and file members are limited to five-minute question periods.\n\nNunes could propose minority witnesses, but it\u2019s up to Schiff to grant access and determine whether the potential witness is \u201crelevant to the investigation.\u201d\n\nIf Schiff concurs, Nunes could also issue subpoenas for witnesses, and is authorized to seek the production of \u201cbooks, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers and documents.\u201d\n\nIf Schiff denies a proposed action by Nunes, he could appeal to the full committee, where Democrats hold a 13-9 edge in membership -- essentially guaranteeing that Democratic rule will dominate the process.\n\nAs chairman, Schiff is also authorized to post electronic copies of transcripts of depositions conducted by the Intelligence Committee, although the transcripts could include redactions of classified and sensitive information.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee is directed to issue a report to the Judiciary Committee on its findings as well as any potential recommendations.\n\nThe resolution \u201cauthorizes the Committee on the Judiciary to conduct proceedings relating to the impeachment inquiry,\u201d including such procedures \u201cas to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel.\u201d\n\nLike the rules for public hearings at the Intelligence Committee, the resolution authorizes Judiciary to \u201cpromulgate additional procedures as it deems necessary for the fair and efficient conduct of committee hearings,\u201d consistent with procedures and rules of the House. It also gives the Judiciary ranking Republican, Rep. Doug Collins, the power to subpoena, but that power is subject to the approval of Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler.\n\nA quartet of Democratic chairs leading the impeachment inquiry explained that the resolution will provide a pathway forward to hear from witnesses in an open hearing, set the parameters of the process and establish authorization to release deposition transcripts, transfer evidence to judiciary, and provide the president with \u201cdue process.\u201d", "description": "House Democrats on Tuesday posted the text of a resolution laying out the process for the public phase of the impeachment inquiry, a measure Speaker Nancy Pelosi has primed for a full House showdown vote on Thursday.
