It\u2019s not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night at the European council meeting on 17th of October.\n\n\u201cSo if the UK does have meaningful proposals, changes that they would like to suggest to the withdrawal agreement or to the joint political declaration more particularly, we really need to see them in advance so that they can be worked through and worked up in advance of the EU summit.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nOfficially the EU still maintains that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened, but Varadkar\u2019s comments, taken in conjunction with other remarks made in recent days, indicate a softening of this hard line.\n\nTwo weeks ago Ireland\u2019s EU commissioner, Phil Hogan, said if improvements to the withdrawal agreement that could seal a deal were needed, they would be considered.\n\n\u201cThere are constitutional issues that are already in the withdrawal agreement that might have to be improved upon if this is a request that\u2019s made. Of course we can look at it.\n\n\u201cAlso we have to have the north-south dimension in the context of the Good Friday agreement and if there is oversight needed there I\u2019m sure we can look at it,\u201d he said.\n\nTalks between UK officials and the commission continued in Brussels on Wednesday but EU diplomats took it as significant that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, was not in attendance.\n\n\u201cI suppose they will keep on turning up and we will continue to engage but even trying to gather what the UK wants to talk about in these talks is difficult \u2013 even that needs political sign off and it seems difficult to get,\u201d said one EU source.\n\n\u201cPeople have been saying for ages that we might have to wait until after the Conservative party conference for new proposals \u2013 but, really, will it make a difference? The gap between the two sides is so large. And it is just weeks now until the summit. It seems certain that the UK will seek an extension, and there isn\u2019t a majority for a deal in parliament.\u201d\n\nAnother informed source said there was some expectation that Johnson would come up with a plan for the border that involved little more than a \u201csurgical\u201d insertion to the withdrawal agreement, but that had not happened.\n\nFocus has centred on a potential Stormont lock, giving the devolved assembly a say on any regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and Ireland. However sources said this was unlikely to be enough to seal a deal.", "description": "Leo Varadkar says government must submit plans in writing before EU summit in October", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb695203de7816f16759b6954f69dc6739bac9e/0_18_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6f3b44a3a67a88ff9a78f174762dca3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
