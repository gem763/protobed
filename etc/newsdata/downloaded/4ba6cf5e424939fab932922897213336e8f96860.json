Picardo said his government has put together a plan that details every step he and his closest Cabinet colleagues would take in the days leading up to and immediately after a no-deal outcome.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for the morning after if that eventuality were to come to pass,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery minute of my day, of the deputy chief\u2019s day, and the day of most officials would be planned from 48 hours before a hard Brexit and to the immediate actions that we would be making in the run-up and in the minutes after a hard Brexit occurs.\u201d\n\nFront-runner Picardo is standing once again as the candidate of a coalition between his party, the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party, and the Liberal Party. This coalition has ruled Gibraltar since the 2011 election.\n\nPicardo\u2019s GSLP/Liberals coalition is set for another landslide win, according to a poll carried out for the Gibraltar Chronicle, which predicts 10 seats out of 17 for the coalition, six for the Gibraltar Social Democrats and one for Together Gibraltar.\n\nSpanish threat\n\nAnother concern is the possibility of a right-wing coalition government after an election in Spain next month. Politicians in the two most right-wing parties in the country regard the U.K. territory on the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula as a colony and see Brexit as an opportunity to regain some degree of sovereignty over The Rock.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement included a section on Gibraltar that covered citizens\u2019 rights, cooperation on environmental issues, police, customs, and the movement of tobacco and other products. But in the event of a no-deal Brexit, such a cooperation agreement would no longer be valid. It is unclear what a no-deal scenario would look like in Gibraltar, but its government is preparing for hours of delays at the border. Unlike the rest of the U.K., Gibraltar is out of the EU customs union.\n\nSpaniards are going to the polls for the second time this year on November 10. Support for the far right and nationalist party Vox \u2014 which is calling for a gradual process to make Gibraltar part of Spain \u2014 is growing, according to POLITICO's Poll of Polls. The conservative Popular Party, with whom Vox could form a coalition, demands joint U.K.-Spanish control over Gibraltar (an option rejected by 99 percent of Gibraltarians in a referendum in 2002).\n\nPicardo said he is ready to deal with whatever government wins November\u2019s vote in Spain, but added: \u201cI have very little to say to those whose political discourse reminds me more of what was said in Central Europe in the late 1930s than what we should be saying to each other in the 21st century.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do hope that whichever government may be and whatever political conception, they will understand that what is in the interest of both parties in this part of the world is that we should get on with each other.\u201d\n\nPicardo said the European Commission has unfairly taken Spain\u2019s side in the Brexit negotiations. \u201cWe were surprised that the Commission should decide to support Spain in some of the things they have said and in the way it has expressed itself,\u201d he said, without giving examples.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the Commission, in my view, should\u2019ve been neutral and should\u2019ve been supportive, and Spain and the Commission should\u2019ve been generous in the way that they dealt with the people who most supported the European project in the way we voted in that referendum [96 percent of Gibraltarians backed Remain in the U.K.\u2019s 2016 vote].\u201d\n\nNo-deal no plan?\n\nOne of the pillars of Picardo\u2019s campaign is Gibraltar\u2019s preparedness for a no-deal Brexit. His reassurances were put to the test by the U.K. government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer dossier, which sets out plans for a no-deal exit from the European Union and was leaked to the Times newspaper in August. The Gibraltarian chief minister dismissed the document as \u201cmassively out of date.\u201d\n\nThe document said Gibraltar is underprepared for a no-deal Brexit and that it has not invested in sufficient \u201ccontingency infrastructure\u201d despite the Brexit deadline being delayed from March to the end of October. The dossier warned that \u201cprolonged border delays over the longer term are likely to adversely impact Gibraltar\u2019s economy\u201d and reported concerns that the territory \u201cwill not have passed all necessary legislation for no-deal.\u201d\n\nPicardo\u2019s political opponents have seized on the document. Keith Azopardi, the leader of the center-right party Gibraltar Social Democrats and a former deputy chief minister of Gibraltar, accused the government of conducting \u201csuperficial and token discussions with the opposition without sharing any documents\u201d on Brexit preparations in their manifesto. The GSD manifesto pledges tax incentives for businesses after Brexit and cuts to income tax rates.\n\nSPAIN NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nAlso running is Marlene Hassan Nahon, founder of the left-wing party Together Gibraltar, which supports a second Brexit referendum in which her party would campaign to remain in the EU. Neither candidates responded to a request for an interview.\n\nAs Brexit looms closer, the chief minister is using his contacts in Brussels to make the case against a no-deal departure. Picardo described his relationship with Josep Borrell, Spain\u2019s former foreign affairs minister who will soon be in charge of the EU's foreign affairs, as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201crespectful\u201d despite \u201cmany political disagreements\u201d over Gibraltar\u2019s status.\n\nBut Picardo\u2019s views on Brexit are \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to those of Ann Widdecombe, the Brexit Party MEP for South West England, who represents Gibraltar in the European Parliament. Widdecombe supports the U.K. leaving the EU without a deal and says Gibraltar is ready for that outcome, partly thanks to their \u201csheer \u2018can do\u2019 attitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a no-deal Brexit is going to deliver a blow to anybody\u2019s economy. I think it is actually going to enable us to boom and to do very nicely,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Thursday's election, Picardo will continue in campaign mode, this time for a second Brexit referendum, which he said is necessary to legitimize the decision to leave the EU made by the British people almost three years and a half ago.\n\n\u201cIf anybody says they don\u2019t want to see a second referendum, they\u2019re running scared of the truth, because with all the facts in front of them the British people may likely reach a completely different conclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be nowhere to hide for those who lied to the British people in the 2016 referendum.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
