Athletics Correspondent in Doha\n\nOut of the sandstorm of a quite miserable World Championships came a magnificent ray of red, white and blue light.\n\nOne at a time, the seven women who had strained to stay in its glow faded into the dark until Dina Asher-Smith was all alone, a British woman on top of the world.\n\nAnd so she went for a little dance. She danced on the track, she danced to the stands and then she danced her way back with a Union flag.\n\nA 200 metres gold medal for her, a gold medal for her country and a golden cloak for a team and organisation that has found itself coated in something far more mucky in the past 48 hours.\n\nA 200 metres gold medal for her, a gold medal for her country and a golden cloak for a team and organisation that has found itself coated in something far more mucky in the past 48 hours\n\nThe 23-year-old Brit obliterated the field to win in a national record 21.88sec, finishing 0.34sec clear of American sprinter Brittany Brown and third-placed Mujinga Kambundji of Switzerland.\n\nAfter adding gold to the 100m silver she won on Sunday, Asher-Smith is targeting a hat-trick of medals in the 4x100m relay, and beyond that success at the Tokyo Olympics next year.\n\nHolding back tears last night, she said: \u2018I am getting all emotional. This means a lot. I am really happy. I will enjoy this one and use it as motivation to get into the big one next year.\u2019\n\nTwo years ago, at the previous World Championships staged in her home city of London, Asher-Smith had placed fourth. But she and her coach, John Blackie, never lost faith. \u2018My coach and I knew I could do it,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Normally I am so chatty and full of energy, but I am lost for words. Everyone said, \u201cYou are the favourite\u201d, but you still have to go and do it and you have to perform. I was focused on that. I have dreamt of this and now it\u2019s real.\u2019\n\nFor the embattled souls at UK Athletics, the national governing body, this will come as a shiny relief. The Alberto Salazar mess will not be easily cleaned, but for now, maybe only for a night or two, they can celebrate a world-beater in British colours.\n\nSome perspective at this point: this was not an Olympic-class final. Indeed, the joke was that Asher-Smith could transport an egg on a spoon with both feet in a sack and still beat those runners lined up against her with a half-decent dip.\n\nBut there are no explanations carved into gold medals. And now Britain has one, a first for these championships and a first in history for any of their female short-range sprinters. Across 100m and 200m, at an Olympics or a World Championships, it had never happened before.\n\nOn Sunday, with her 100m silver, she had become Britain\u2019s first female medallist at the distance since 1960. Here she broke new ground entirely.\n\nThe bare detail of the race is this: they were beaten by the bend. From the blocks Asher-Smith was out quickest and the gap only grew, through those first two steps that accelerate a sprinter to 50 per cent of their top speed, through the tricky, balance-test of a drive phase around the corner and finally through the straight run for home. By the time she was done, she had gone from A to B 0.01sec quicker than the national record she had set in winning European gold last summer.\n\nThe margin to second? Brown took silver with a personal best of 22.22sec and Kambundji of Switzerland was third in 22.51.\n\nThis cemented beyond doubt Asher-Smith\u2019s position as the leading lady of British sport. She burst into tears as she tried to explain it. And they flowed more heavily when she spotted her mother Julie.\n\n\u2018This means so much. I was tired because it has been a long champs, but I woke up today thinking, \u201cThis is it\u201d. Suddenly the tiredness disappeared.\u2019\n\nIt will obviously be far more difficult in Tokyo next year. Asher-Smith knows that, and so does everyone else. In truth, a woman who had no need for luck found plenty in the desert, such was the incredible misfortune to befall the world\u2019s other elite sprinters.\n\nIt started with Shaunae Miller-Uibo being told the schedule would not permit her to run both the 200 and 400m.\n\nGiven she is the Olympic champion at the latter, she skipped the former, in which she is unbeaten. She is used to trailing the smaller Asher-Smith off a bend, but she almost always gets to the line first.\n\nIrrespective, that still left a world-class field until, in some kind of order, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce opted against running and Dafne Schippers, Marie-Josee Ta Lou and Blessing Okagbare fell to a mixture of injuries and disqualification.\n\nBy the semi-finals, only the Olympic champion Elaine Thompson stood as a serious obstacle. And then she withdrew with an Achilles problem.\n\nBut what was it Arnold Palmer used to say? \u2018The more I practice, the luckier I get.\u2019 Asher-Smith deserves a gold without caveats. And she has one, a star like no other in a team that badly needed one.", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith, 23, clinched a historic gold medal after powering to 200m victory at the World Championships.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline", "Riath Al-Samarrai For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/21/19224156-0-image-a-19_1570047885202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
