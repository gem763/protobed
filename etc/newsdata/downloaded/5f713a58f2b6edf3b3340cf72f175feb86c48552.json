Whatever happens to President Trump Donald John TrumpWhistleblower filed Trump complaint after going to CIA general counsel: report Trump campaign, GOP raise M after Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry New York Times Opinion hits Trump in Star Wars-themed video MORE is far less important than what happens to the structure of our federal government. If we\u2019re going to have a sustainable democracy, we cannot have a White House with unlimited power to mow down norms and laws.\n\nOne casualty of the law-eroding phenomenon \u2014 thus far \u2014 is the whistleblower complaint identifying, among other things, Trump\u2019s July 2019 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. We now know from the White House\u2019s release of summary notes of that conversation that Trump asked Zelenskiy to dig for dirt on his political rival, Joe Biden Joe BidenWhistleblower filed Trump complaint after going to CIA general counsel: report Trump campaign, GOP raise M after Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry New York Times Opinion hits Trump in Star Wars-themed video MORE, and his son, Hunter. The notes indicate that this conversation occurred after the Ukrainian president mentioned his country\u2019s need for nearly $400 million in promised military aid that Trump was personally blocking.\n\nTo date, we have seen the summary notes \u2014 with ellipses. But as of Wednesday afternoon, only select members of Congress had seen the whistleblower complaint \u2014 and only after a rare, bipartisan and unanimous resolution in the Senate calling for its release. The complaint itself was publicly released last night, on the eve of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph McGuire\u2019s scheduled testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters in Congress have cried foul that the disclosure of private conversations between the president and world leaders sets a dangerous precedent. Critics of the move also claim Biden is a bad actor because he shouldn\u2019t have been talking to the Ukrainians about foreign policy under President Obama when his son was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump backers are also making the argument that the notes don\u2019t expressly show a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 as if the only thing problematic about a president\u2019s pressing a foreign leader to drum up opposition research on a political opponent would be if he simultaneously threatened to withhold large sums of money promised by the U.S. Senate that the country needed in order to stave off pro-Russian separatists.\n\nThis is all a decoy, folks. Don\u2019t take the bait.\n\nCongress never even asked for the notes. The White House gave them over willingly, making a kerfuffle around a drama of its own creation. If a bad precedent was set regarding the confidentiality of presidential conversations with foreign leaders, that is Trump\u2019s fault entirely. All Congress asked for was the whistleblower report that it is squarely entitled to under federal law. That handoff should have happened weeks ago. But the White House said no.\n\nThe statute states that the DNI \u201cshall\u201d turn the complaint over to Congress if the intelligence agencies\u2019 inspector general (IG) deems it credible and a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe law does not allow the DNI to pass it on to the Department of Justice for a veto, which \u2014 bizarrely \u2014 is what happened here. DOJ then wrote a memo making the tortured argument that the president\u2019s dealings are somehow not related to \u201cintelligence activity\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and blocked the handoff.\n\nWe are now hearing complaints from Trump defenders of a biased whistleblower \u2014 whose identity we do not know (for good reason).\n\nAll of these distractions are beside the point. This is not about the whistleblower \u2014 whom the IG found credible \u2014 or Joe Biden. It\u2019s not about Hunter Biden, and it\u2019s not about whether a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d is laid out in unmistakable language in the notes of a conversation that the White House took upon itself to make public in an effort to stem the tide of impeachment.\n\nIt\u2019s about the sanctity and integrity of the office of the presidency \u2014 nothing else.\n\nDuring McGuire\u2019s testimony, Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Huntington Ingalls Industries \u2014 Intel chief defends handling of whistleblower complaint | Complaint alleged attempt to cover-up Ukraine call | US to send 200 troops to Saudi Arabia | Senate confirms Joint Chiefs No. 2 Democratic chairmen: Trump's 'treason' comments constitute 'reprehensible' intimidation Democrats see whistleblower report as smoking gun MORE (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, walked through the checkmate that this presidency has created in terms of accountability. Essentially, DOJ concluded that the whistleblower law\u2019s requirement that the complaint go to Congress does not apply to the president, because he sits above the intelligence apparatus, and the FBI declined to investigate the matter once McGuire handed it to DOJ. That means nobody in the executive branch \u2014 by this president\u2019s account \u2014 can investigate him. Congress is it, folks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCongressional Democrats appear to have finally realized that pulling the impeachment lever is necessary to secure the integrity of the office of the president \u2014 regardless of what happens to Trump. Nervous talk of losing seats in \u201cred\u201d states has dissipated. And House Democrats seem to have accepted the potential inevitability that, if an obstreperous Senate won\u2019t exercise its impeachment prerogative regarding this president, so be it. The Executive Office of the President as we know it will outlive Trump \u2014 but only if \u201cWe the People\u201d preserve it. As Schiff said today in closing the session, \u201cThis is democracy.\u201d\n\nKim Wehle is a former assistant U.S. attorney and a former associate independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation.
