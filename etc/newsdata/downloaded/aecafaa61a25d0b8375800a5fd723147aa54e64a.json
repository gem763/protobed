It will become the home for some of the company\u2019s most popular shows, including \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cThe Office.\u201d\n\nThat means both will be leaving Netflix, although not for several months after Peacock launches. As Disney DIS, +0.38% , AT&T\u2019s T, -0.40% WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal prepare to debut their streaming services, they have been taking some of their TV and movie deals away from Netflix, the most popular streaming service. That augurs a future where consumers will have to hunt for their favorite shows and films among lots of different services. WarnerMedia for example on Tuesday also announced that HBO Max, its upcoming streaming service, will have the U.S. rights to \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d Netflix on Monday said it\u2019s adding Seinfeld.\n\nPeacock, like HBO Max, is launching in April, after Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, which come out this November. NBCUniversal on Tuesday did not announce a price. The service will have ads.\n\nPeacock\u2019s lineup will include series like \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u2018\u2019Will & Grace,\u201d and \u201cCheers,\u201d although those won\u2019t stream exclusively on Peacock, as well as original new movies and shows including reboots of \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d and \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d and a new comedy series from \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cParks and Rec\u201d creator Mike Schur.
