He understood that Botham Jean\u2019s brother, for his own sake, may have needed to embrace Amber Guyger that day she received a 10-year sentence. He also felt strongly that comforting a white woman who killed an unarmed black accountant in his own apartment wasn\u2019t going to move society in the direction it needed to go.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think this whole act of forgiveness has gotten black people where they are in this country right now,\u201d he says on a recent evening. \u201cWe\u2019re expected to forgive someone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat courtroom hug, no matter how you view it, forced an important conversation on the grayness of black-to-white forgiveness. It encouraged people to think, some perhaps for the first time, about how something seemingly healthy could also prove harmful. But on the day of the sentencing, Williams didn\u2019t have to think about where he stood on the issue. A week earlier, he had made his opinion known in a very personal and public way. He wrote a Medium piece about an encounter with a white man in his Maryland neighborhood.\n\nIn that piece, Williams did not hold back. He named the man, described him as saying \u201cdumb n-----\u201d during a parking garage encounter and characterized the man and his adult daughter as wanting \u201cforgiveness for using the worst racial slur in the English language, even if their apology was not sincere.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe and his daughter apologized for the sake of apologizing but couldn\u2019t understand why I was upset,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cThey used a vile racial slur and expected me to roll over and say \u2018yessir massa\u2019 when they offered an apology.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMedium has taken the post down, but I saw it shortly after it was published. So did many other people. Several media outlets ran stories about the incident and linked to a video that Williams took when he later saw the man and his daughter talking to a Montgomery County police officer. In the video, when Williams questions them about the slur, they seem to acknowledge it.\n\nWilliams\u2019s decision to publicly write about the incident, as you might expect, has drawn both praise and condemnation. Some people have applauded him for standing up to racism. Others have sent him messages filled with racist epithets and angry words for identifying the man and, as a result, exposing him to public scrutiny.\n\nAD\n\nBecause the Medium post is no longer up, it would be easy for us to pretend it never existed. We could talk instead about incidents that have happened elsewhere in the past that feel more comfortable to scrutinize because they are further from us in distance and time. But Williams\u2019s recent decision to write about a man who shares his neighborhood, and the responses it evoked, hit on an important question that warrants discomfort: When it comes to racism, is forgiveness ever appropriate, or is that gift a blood diamond that benefits too few at the cost of too many?\n\nAD\n\nI spoke to Williams recently because I wanted to understand what went into his decision to publicly share his experience. I also tried to interview the man who was named in the Medium piece but was unable to reach him. Several social media accounts for him have since been closed and phone messages were not returned. For that reason, I\u2019m not identifying him here.\n\nWilliams, whose father is white and whose mother is black, spends a lot of time thinking about race. He is working toward a doctorate from Walden University in social psychology, with a focus on racism and prejudice.\n\nAD\n\nEven so, he says, he had never heard a white person call someone the n-word up close \u2014 until Sept. 21.\n\nOn that day, as he tells it, he and his wife, who is black and Muslim, were in her SUV waiting to exit a garage when the man, who was carrying his grandson, walked in front of them. Williams says the gate had gone up, but his wife was waiting for a mechanical arm to lift and had her foot on the brake when he heard the man say, \u201cDumb n-----.\u201d Any other word and Williams believes he would have flipped him off and not done anything more.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, he got out of the passenger side and confronted him. Williams says the man then called him \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201ctrash.\u201d During their confrontation, Williams took a photo of the man, which he later used to track him down on LinkedIn. In his anger, he says, he sent the man a message through that platform, warning him that the next time he calls someone that slur, he should \u201cmake sure they can\u2019t find you or know where you live.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWilliams says when he returned home that night on his motorcycle after picking up medical supplies for his 1-year-old daughter, who was born premature, he saw the man and his daughter talking to a police officer. That\u2019s when he pulled out his phone and started recording.\n\nA few days after that, he wrote the Medium piece.\n\n\u201cWhen does it stop?\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the Jim Crow South anymore. We\u2019re supposed to be in post-racial times, but that is not where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeople of color are expected to just take these insults and move on, he says, but they carry long-term consequences. They cause stress and high blood pressure. After the incident, he says, his wife was experiencing daily panic and anxiety attacks, and she no longer wanted to stay in Gaithersburg, fearing the man would recognize her car or face.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes I would find her crying,\u201d Williams says. \u201cOther times it manifested in her not going to sleep or eating.\u201d\n\nWilliams also points to broader societal problems that come with the automatic expectation of forgiveness. In his piece, he highlighted several authors who have written on the issue, including Stacey Patton who wrote \u201cBlack America should stop forgiving white racists\u201d for The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cWhen black forgiveness is the means for white atonement, it enables white denial about the harms that racist violence creates,\u201d Patton wrote. \u201cWhen black redemption of white America is prioritized over justice and accountability, there is no chance of truth and reconciliation. It trivializes real black suffering, grief, and the heavy lifting required for any possibility of societal progress.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilliams says he believes in holding people accountable for racist actions and hopes more people will speak up, instead of just moving on. At the same time, he doesn\u2019t want to see the man lose his job. He also doesn\u2019t want to spend any more time focusing on the ordeal. He has four children and says he has lost moments with them because of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I went through this whole thing unscathed,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wish I wouldn\u2019t have had to go through this at all.\u201d\n\nHe recently changed his name on his social media accounts because so many hateful messages kept finding him. He shared many with me. They are filled with unprintable insults. They also show why that courtroom hug, and the even more controversial one that followed it from the judge, a black woman, should give us pause. They should spark uncomfortable conversations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think you over-reacted,\u201d reads one message sent to Williams. \u201cSomeone called you a n-----, so what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very weak and dispiccable,\u201d reads another. \u201cGrow up \u2026 nobody owes you any respect and you decide to do this, you total loser.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a word,\u201d reads a third one, \u201cshouldn\u2019t be said, but then there was an apology.\u201d\n\nRead more from Theresa Vargas:", "description": "The incident happened just weeks before Brandt Jean embraced his brother\u2019s killer, former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, at her sentencing.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Zbgfp5fcFrDhrlOlFcpTPrGMhAM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HJFGTVXKX4I6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
