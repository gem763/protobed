If anything, it will be even more difficult for the Astros to escape Soto\u2019s image, because he is certain to be a nightly fixture in their dreams \u2014 a nightmare of a hitter, blasting screaming drives to all parts of Minute Maid Park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was the key guy we couldn\u2019t control tonight,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cHis bat-speed is electric. \u2026 He\u2019s calm in the moment. Clearly, this is not too big a stage for him. He was the difference in the game. He\u2019s got that \u2018it\u2019 factor. He\u2019s got fast hands. He\u2019s got no fear.\u201d\n\nThey are facing another week of this nightmare, give or take a few days, and the outlook for the Astros, who don\u2019t even have a lefty to face him late in games, is less than brilliant. If Soto could destroy the consensus best pitcher on the planet at this moment, Astros ace Gerrit Cole, the way he did Tuesday night, what is he going to do to the rest of their pitchers?\n\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s really talented,\u201d Cole said after allowing a titanic homer to Soto in the fourth and a two-out, two-run double in the fifth that accounted for the winning margin in the Nationals\u2019 victory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros, among the most data- and video-driven organizations in the sport, thought they had a solid game plan for pitching to Soto \u2014 getting a measure of confirmation in the first inning, when Cole struck him out on a 99-mph four-seam fastball, his hardest of the night, at the upper edge of the strike zone.\n\nBut in the fourth, Cole went back upstairs with a 1-0 fastball, and Soto crushed it. The drive sailed atop the train tracks high above the facade of the stadium in left-center, Soto\u2019s opposite field, an estimated 417 feet away. A \u201ctip-your-cap situation,\u201d as Cole put it, and because Soto is just the fourth player to hit a home run in the World Series before turning 21, that ball is headed to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nUnderstand: Cole\u2019s four-seamer was literally the best pitch in baseball in 2019, at least as measured by FanGraphs\u2019 pitch-values metric, which values that pitch as having saved 36.2 runs above average this season. (The second most valuable pitch was teammate Justin Verlander\u2019s slider at 33.4.) According to Statcast data, Cole got 253 swings-and-misses with his four-seamer this season; no other pitcher in the majors got more than 200 with that pitch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGerrit Cole throwing a high fastball up and away \u2014 that\u2019s not easy to [hit],\u201d Hinch said.\n\nAsked whether he had ever seen a left-handed hitter hit a ball to that part of Minute Maid Park, Maldonado thought he probably had once or twice. But had anyone done it against Cole?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think nobody\u2019s ever done that.\u201d\n\nThe next time Cole faced Soto, with runners on first and third in the fifth inning and the Nationals leading 3-2, the at-bat evolved, over the course of six tension-building pitches, into an epic confrontation with an equally epic result.\n\nHaving been burned on his fastball by Soto\u2019s massive homer the inning before, Cole conspicuously stayed away from it this time \u2014 and also stayed away from the strike zone, throwing three straight breaking balls, a slider and two curves, for balls. Twice, Soto performed his patented \u201cSoto Shuffle,\u201d sweeping his spikes through the dirt of his batter\u2019s box with theatrical force and glaring out at Cole.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the fourth pitch, Cole threw another slider that Soto, who appeared to be taking all the way on 3-0, took for a strike, and on the fifth, he unveiled for the first time his change-up. Soto swung through it, then nodded slowly toward the mound.\n\nBy this point, Cole had shown Soto every pitch in his repertoire, and when he went back to the slider, throwing it on the lower third of the plate, Soto lashed it into left for a two-run double.\n\n\u201cThe wrong location to the wrong guy,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cThat was pretty much the game. \u2026 The only pitch that bothered me, that wasn\u2019t that good, was the slider. That was the at-bat of the game. We were trying to get a strikeout. That guy\u2019s good. He\u2019s really good. He\u2019s been amazing, what he\u2019s done for a young guy like that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros also dropped the first game of the American League Championship Series at home to the New York Yankees, but this feels more damaging, and the situation more desperate. For one thing, the Yankees beat Zack Greinke in that Game 1, the Astros\u2019 No. 3 starter, and not the great Cole \u2014 who pitched (and won) Game 3, and who would have started Game 7 had it been necessary.\n\nAD\n\nAnd for another thing, the Yankees simply didn\u2019t have a hitter who worried them the same way Soto does. For the most part, the Yankees\u2019 hitters could all be pitched to, at least to a certain degree \u2014 from dangerous but strikeout-prone sluggers such as Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez to brilliant young second baseman Gleyber Torres, who paced the Yankees offense but didn\u2019t dominate the series.\n\nThose Yankees hitters have something else in common: They are all right-handed. The Yankees\u2019 lineup was heavily weighted to the right side \u2014 with few left-handed threats \u2014 which made it relatively easy for the Astros to deploy a roster consisting of only right-handed pitchers.\n\nAD\n\nIt might have made sense for the Astros to add a lefty to their roster for the World Series specifically for the purpose of facing Soto late in games \u2014 as the Los Angeles Dodgers did with specialist Adam Kolarek and the St. Louis Cardinals did with Andrew Miller, with varying degrees of success.\n\nAD\n\nBut the Astros didn\u2019t really have similar options. The lefty relievers who finished the regular season with them, Framber Valdez and Cionel Perez, were not seen as legitimate candidates for the postseason roster and were sent home after the regular season ended. Wade Miley, a veteran left-handed starter, was given some consideration \u2014 but he struggled down the stretch and wasn\u2019t seen as possessing the skill set necessary to serve as a lefty specialist to face Soto.\n\n\u201cWe have our roster, and I love our roster,\u201d Hinch said before the game. \u201cAnd I love the fact that we have some righties who do very, very well against lefties. \u2026 When you look at Soto as an example, he handles left-handed pitching and he handles right-handed pitching. Giving him different looks at critical moments in the game is a challenge in its own right. The fact that we don\u2019t have a lefty to give them one of those looks is just a reality that we\u2019ve dealt with for a long time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut one can only wonder what the Astros are thinking now \u2014 now that they have faced Soto, and now that he has cost them a World Series game, and now that he has moved from the fronts of their brains, where he lives in video images and data-backed game plans, to the back, where he will live in their dreams for the next week or so.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The American League champions were determined not to let Juan Soto beat them, but the Nationals\u2019 slugger obliterated those plans with a powerful World Series debut in Game 1.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t1R5jgfaG53QK_0sSFAMlP6jfg4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOIFTJXVJUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
