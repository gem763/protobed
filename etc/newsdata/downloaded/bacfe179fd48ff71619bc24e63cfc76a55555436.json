The allegation was made public by Variety, based on Ronan Farrow\u2019s soon-to-be released book Catch & Kill. Brooke Nevils, the colleague in question, says Lauer allegedly invited her back into his hotel room (after she initially came by to pick up her press credentials), pushed her against the door, kissed her, then pushed her onto the bed and anally raped her.\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils told Farrow. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d According to Farrow, Nevils said that she \u201cwept silently into a pillow\u201d and \u201cbled for days\u201d in the aftermath.\n\nAfter Nevils\u2019s allegation came to light, Lauer\u2019s former Today show colleagues Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb \u2014 who are now the programme\u2019s co-anchors \u2014 reacted on air, saying they were \u201cdisturbed to [their] core\u201d by the accusation. \u201cWe support her and any women who have come forward with claims,\u201d Guthrie said of Nevils.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLauer reacted, too, in a lengthy letter published in full on Wednesday by Variety, which was lengthy, indignant, and shockingly tone-deaf (more on that in a minute).\n\nOf course, issuing a denial is Lauer\u2019s right. Harvey Weinstein has done it. Kevin Spacey has done it. Luc Besson, the influential French director currently facing a rape allegation of his own, has done it. Those denials usually come in the form of a short statement \u2013 rarely more than one or two sentences. They\u2019ll use words such as \u201cabsolutely\u201d and \u201ccategorically\u201d. They\u2019re usually not very interesting, because, well, people accused of sexual misconduct usually deny it.\n\nLauer\u2019s letter, however, was remarkable both in length and tone. It was also his first public statement in two years, with his last one dating back to 2017, when he was fired from his job as a Today show co-anchor due to alleged \u201cinappropriate sexual behaviour in the workplace\u201d. Back then, Lauer did release a statement, which \u2013 unlike Wednesday\u2019s letter \u2013 seemed to show contrition. \u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry,\u201d he said. \u201c...Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterised, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.\u201d\n\nThe letter issued by Lauer on Wednesday shows an entirely different side of him. In it, Lauer alleges that he and Nevils had an \u201cextramarital affair\u201d, which he characterises as such: \u201cWe engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual.\u201d\n\nLauer disputes Nevils\u2019s account, adding: \u201cThere was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner. At no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent.\u201d Throughout the letter, he makes a point to describe how he has attempted to atone for his \u201cinfidelity\u201d and makes mention of \u201cpain and embarrassment\u201d his behaviour has brought to his family. But as he discusses the alleged affair, Lauer makes an apparent attempt to shift the narrative in order to paint Nevils as a jilted ex-lover out for revenge.\n\n\u201cI admit, I ended the affair poorly. I simply stopped communicating with her. Brooke continued to reach out,\u201d he writes. \u201c... However, being upset or having second thoughts does not give anyone the right to make false accusations years later about an affair in which they fully and willingly participated.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s last paragraph is the final nail in the coffin for what Nevils has since described as \u201ca case study in victim-blaming\u201d. It goes like this: \u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations. They have avoided having to look a boyfriend, husband, or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated.\u2019 They have done enormous damage in the process. And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nIf you believe Nevils, then Lauer\u2019s letter is indeed a sinister instance of victim-blaming. And if you don\u2019t believe her, or if you have doubts, or if you\u2019re not too sure what to make of the latest developments, well \u2013 there\u2019s still no denying that the letter doesn\u2019t look good for Lauer.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s really hard to see Lauer\u2019s final paragraph and his proclamation that he\u2019s done protecting those women with \u201cthe shelter of [his] silence\u201d as anything other than threatening. In fact, the whole idea that one would be vindicated in attacking a group of women because of a single woman's allegation reeks of misogyny. Not to mention the fact that Lauer appears to find it perfectly legitimate to jump from one specific case (Nevils\u2019s allegation) to what he describes as a wider phenomenon (the \u201cwomen\u201d, plural, with whom he says he has had those extramarital relationships) is reflective of what seems to be a strangely \u201cus versus them\u201d approach to gender relations (though I should probably state for legal reasons that I, thankfully, do not reside in Lauer\u2019s brain).\n\nLauer\u2019s letter has received mixed reactions on social media. Some appear to have been swayed by it. Others have joined the \u201cf**k that guy\u201d side. It remains difficult to see how Lauer might have thought that this letter, written in this specific tone, would show him as he wants to be perceived (i.e. as a man who has done bad things and is trying to atone for them). Even if you take concepts such as respect, kindness and victim-blaming out of the equation \u2013 even if all you consider is optics \u2014 well, the optics aren\u2019t stellar, to say the least.\n\nAs it stands, the Lauer letter will likely make #MeToo history for all the wrong reasons.", "description": "Earlier this week, Matt Lauer was accused of\u00a0raping a former NBC colleague\u00a0in 2014 at the Sochi Winter Olympics.
