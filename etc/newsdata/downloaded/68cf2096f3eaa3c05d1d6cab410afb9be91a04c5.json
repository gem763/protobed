Instead they are paid at what was the going rate on the day they emigrated.\n\nThe letter to Coffey refers to comments made last month by her predecessor in the post, Amber Rudd, that the move to protect UK pensioners in Europe was to honour people who \u2018helped make our country the success it is\u2019.\n\nThe MPs write: \u2018The same must be said about the half million UK pensioners living outside the UK and EU whose pensions are frozen, who include military veterans, former nurses and teachers. Many have served the UK in its darkest hours and are now being plunged into poverty because their State pension continues to reduce in value year-on-year.\u2019\n\nThe two-tier pension system that has existed for decades is based on geography, and depends on which countries have a reciprocal arrangement with the UK. It is an issue that many pensioners were unaware of when they moved.\n\nThe 666,000 who live in Europe and a handful of countries further afield, such as the US, Jamaica and the Philippines see their payments regularly uprated.\n\nBut 528,000 have their pensions frozen, the vast majority of them living in Commonwealth countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nSecond World War veteran Anne Puckridge, 94, is a stark example of the iniquity of the system. The former intelligence officer in the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service moved to Canada in 2001 to be closer to her daughter and so receives \u00a372.50 a week, the going rate at that time. Had she moved to the US, she would now be receiving \u00a3129.20 a week.\n\nThere are 43 MPs from all major parties fighting for justice for overseas pensioners. Their letter adds: \u2018We wholeheartedly agree that those who \u201chelped make our country the success it is\u201d must receive the full pension to which they are entitled. It is perverse, unjust and wrong that this pension is not universal to all UK pensioners.\u2019", "description": "More than 40 MPs are calling on the Government to overturn an enduring injustice affecting State pension payments to half a million UK nationals living overseas.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
