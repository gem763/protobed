(WSCE) to supply technology and equipment for the plant and EPCM Bonisana to install the pipeline and manage the interface.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to seeing Renergen and WSCE making liquid natural gas and liquid helium in South Africa a reality,\u201d said the company in an official statement.\n\nThe U.S government\u2019s Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) approved a $40 million loan in February this year to provide capital for the project after the company announced it had discovered reserves of up to 11% helium concentrations in the Free State province.\n\nThe project is planned to be operational from 2021, with a planned daily production of 645.3 tonnes of LNG and 350 kg of helium.\n\nHelium is used, among other things, to cool superconducting magnets in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, as a lifting gas in balloons and airships, as a gas to breathe in deep-sea diving and to keep satellite instruments cool.", "description": "Energy company Renergen said on Monday it had commissioned South Africa\u2019s first commercial liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquid helium plant, the Virginia Gas Project.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
