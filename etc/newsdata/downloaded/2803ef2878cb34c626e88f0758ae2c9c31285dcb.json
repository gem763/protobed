REUTERS/Manuel Seoane/Files\n\nMorales, widely known simply as \u201cEvo,\u201d has helped lift many out of poverty since he came to office, and even changed the country\u2019s name to the Plurinational State of Bolivia to honor its diverse ethnic groups long treated as second-class citizens.\n\nBut the left-leaning former coca farmer faces a rising tide of dissatisfaction, even among the indigenous groups he has most visibly supported, as he bids for an unprecedented and contentious fourth term in elections on Sunday.\n\nMost polls show his main rival, Carlos Mesa, closing the gap on Morales, posing the fiercest electoral challenge yet to Latin America\u2019s longest continuous standing leader.\n\nMorales, often seen clad in colorfully embroidered alpaca wool suits, is counting on the backing of Bolivia\u2019s more than 4 million indigenous people as he looks to extend his presidency to a potential 19 years - in defiance of term limits and a local referendum in 2016 that voted against him running.\n\nHowever, many of the Aymara are split over Morales. Allegations of cronyism and lavish projects - including a $34 million, 28-floor presidential palace in La Paz - have created a sense of unease about him losing touch with the working people.\n\n\u201cIndigenous ideologies haven\u2019t really been translated to politics,\u201d said Yolanda Mamani, 34, an Aymara radio presenter with a popular show \u201cBig Mouth Chola\u201d, a reference to the indigenous women often clad in iconic wide dresses and bowler hats who have gained more prominence under Morales.\n\nMamani, who was born in the region around high-altitude Lake Titicaca and migrated to the city of El Alto near capital La Paz when she was 9 years old, said she felt the president\u2019s image was more an act than real substance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a fashion show of folklore, as if the indigenous were just clothing,\u201d she said.\n\nSonia Quispe, 27, a media producer who speaks and writes Aymara dialect, said she felt differently.\n\n\u201cIn these 13 years of Evo Morales government I believe the most humble people have benefited, the farmers that live off the land,\u201d she said, adding that while Morales wasn\u2019t perfect, only he could keep driving the process of change in the country.\n\n\u201cThere are many problems and issues to be fixed but I believe in him.\u201d\n\nOne recent issue that has hurt Morales has been forest fires that raged though the farm-belt region of Santa Cruz. Morales closed his election campaign out there on Tuesday, and violent clashes broke out between protesters and police.\n\nIn her La Paz office, lawmaker Mercedes Marquez spoke highly of Morales despite some of the headwinds he has faced. She said he had championed the rights of indigenous people after years of repression and humiliation.\n\nThe 60-year-old member of Congress, who worked as a seamstress and trader before getting into politics, pointed to steady economic growth under Morales, one of the most reliable in a volatile region, helped by a natural resource boom.\n\n\u201cWe have gas at home, modern educational units, paved streets, football pitches, aid for children, adults and mothers, a new healthcare system, zero illiteracy, a fight against poverty, cable cars, and modern markets,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI support the re-election of Evo Morales and (vice president) \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera. If not them, then whom?\u201d\n\nIn his colorful events salon, venues locally known as \u201ccholet,\u201d Jhonny Segales, said the success of most Aymara people was down to hard work and not any help they got from Morales.\n\n\u201cPeople here are like that, always working, gathering, saving, this is the spirit we have,\u201d said Segales, wearing a smartly tailored brown jacket and on-and-off his phone on business calls.\n\nFamily members from The Untouchables fraternity who organised preste celebrations, stand in the street with gifts they received from guests in La Paz, Bolivia November 20, 2016. REUTERS/Manuel Seoane/Files\n\n\u201cThis government hits our growth with very unequal tax policies,\u201d said Segales, who though disillusioned by the government said it had started well when Morales first came to power.\n\n\u201cHow can they say they rule for the poor but spend millions on luxury? When they came to power in the first elections they did good things but I see now it was only to get our sympathy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis government is not for all people or for the poor as they say, but only really for the people who support it.\u201d", "description": "Bolivian leader Evo Morales came to power in 2006 with a pledge to champion marginalized indigenous groups including his own important Andean tribe the Aymara, which helped carry him to the presidency.", "authors": ["Manu Seoane", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441854843&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G113", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
