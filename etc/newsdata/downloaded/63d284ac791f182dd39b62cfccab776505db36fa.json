They voted that the current Joint Managing Conservatorship should be replaced by a Sole Managing Conservatorship, but that Mr. Younger should not be that person. Judge Kim Cooks will read her ruling on possession, child support, and Dr. Georgulas\u2019 other requests at 1:30 p.m. CST on Wednesday. Mr. Younger and Dr. Georgulas were in court last week fighting over custody and decision-making abilities for James and his twin, Jude. Mr. Younger argues his ex-wife is \u201ctransitioning\u201d James against the boy\u2019s will. Dr. Georgulas, who brought the lawsuit, was asking Mr. Younger\u2019s possession schedule be altered to decrease overnight stays and to force his visits with the boys to be supervised. Dr. Georgulas brought the original modification suit to the court and did not request a jury trial. Mr. Younger, in his counter-petition, asked for a jury trial. Since Mr. Younger requested the jury trial, the jury ruled on his specific request for Sole Managing Conservatorship and the judge ruled on all other aspects of the petition as brought by Dr. Georgulas. She was also asking that Jeff be forbidden from calling his son James \u2013 his given and legal name \u2013 and that he be prohibited from bringing James around people who do not \u201caffirm\u201d James as a \u201cgirl.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, #ProtectJamesYounger started trending on Twitter. As HotAir's Jazz Shaw pointed out, this court case will most likely require intervention by a higher court to be stopped, but the larger point this was ever allowed should indicate that society has seriously \"fallen down the rabbit hole.\"\n\nWe don't let children under the age of 18 get a frigging tattoo. If a school nurse gives a seven year old an aspirin without a parental consent form they can be fired. But THIS IS OKAY???? \u2014 Jazz Shaw (@JazzShaw) October 22, 2019\n\nThe Daily Wire's Matt Walsh blamed Republicans in part for their failure to take transgender ideology pushed by leftists more seriously over last half decade.\n\nI have been saying literally for five years that Republicans need to make opposition to radical left wing gender theory a top campaign issue. It\u2019s important and every sane human in the world would stand behind them on it.\n\n\n\n#ProtectJamesYounger \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 22, 2019\n\nConcerned Americans sent thousands of tweets with the hashtag #SaveJamesYounger.\n\nThis is a very scary case! So a 7 year old boy will now be transitioned into a girl. How far will this suicidal madness go in western society? #ProtectJamesYounger https://t.co/CuNrdIi3sr \u2014 Obianuju Ekeocha (@obianuju) October 22, 2019\n\nIt absolutely disgusts me that a liberal judge ruled that a father can\u2019t prevent his 7 year old son from \u2018transitioning genders.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat a crazy world we are living in.\n\n\n\nThis is child abuse.#ProtectJamesYounger \u2014 Alex Bruesewitz (@alexbruesewitz) October 22, 2019\n\nIn a website created by the father, Jeffrey Younger makes his case for why James clearly does not think he is a female:", "description": ".10/23/2019 5:36:24AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/222/709b42e4-68ae-496a-95ca-06c76144c1d5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
