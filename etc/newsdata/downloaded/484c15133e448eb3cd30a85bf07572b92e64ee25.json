Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said withholding funding was \"absolutely appropriate.\" (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A string of U.S. diplomats and national-security officials mapped out during the last two weeks for the House impeachment inquiry how President Donald Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate his political rival began months earlier than a key July 25 call and raised alarms across the government.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Europe voiced disappointment after learning May 23 that the president delegated Ukraine policy to his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, rather than rely on professionals at the State Department.\n\nTrump\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, who caught wind of Giuliani\u2019s back-channel effort, said that trading military aid to Ukraine for an investigation of corruption would be \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nAnd John Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, called Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d that would blow up routine diplomatic efforts, according to a former National Security Council official.\n\nThe efforts culminated in the call July 25 between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump acknowledged urging an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter by releasing a summary of the call. \u201cIt sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said to Zelensky about the Bidens.\n\nMick Mulvaney: Mick Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up aid to pressure Ukraine, then rows back\n\nBiden, a leading Democratic presidential contender in 2020, has denied wrongdoing. Ukrainian officials have said there was no basis for allegations against the Bidens.\n\nWitnesses before the three House panels \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 focused the impeachment spotlight on a central question: Was Trump justified in withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of corruption, or did that demand qualify for removing the president from office? The answer among lawmakers broke down sharply along partisan lines.\n\nTrump insisted he was absolutely justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine. Republican lawmakers defended Trump for fighting corruption while not explicitly demanding an investigation of the Bidens in exchange for military aid during the call.\n\n\u201cI am personally of the opinion that our country should absolutely be working together to go after corruption, and the Biden family scheme in Ukraine is one that my constituents have an issue with, the president of the United States has an issue with, we have an issue with,\u201d Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., said Tuesday.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announces that the G7 will be held at Trump National Doral on Oct. 17, 2019.

Mulvaney later issued a statement denying any quid pro quo exchanging military aid for an investigation. But in front of reporters, Mulvaney said trade-offs are common in diplomacy.\n\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters, in a message the Trump campaign began selling Friday on T-shirts.\n\nNASA: Trump calls NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch to congratulate them on first all-female spacewalk\n\nBut House Democrats said Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation \u2013 while naming the Bidens as targets \u2013 at the same time he withheld military aid could be grounds for impeachment. The administration\u2019s defiance of congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony could also be grounds for impeachment as examples of obstruction of justice.\n\n\"The reality is, as much as there's a lot of focus on a quid pro quo, I just want to remind everyone, you do not need a quid pro quo,\" Rep. David Cicilline said. \"The United States asking a foreign leader to interfere in an American presidential election is illegal, un-American, unpatriotic and in it of itself constitutes grounds for impeachment.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called Mulvaney's admission \"a phenomenal breach of the president's duty to defend our national security.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., joins Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., right, at a news conference as House Democrats move on depositions in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, at the Capitol in Washington, Oct. 2, 2019.

Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\nFollowing is a summary of highlights from the past three weeks of impeachment events:\n\nTexts outline diplomatic concerns\n\nKurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, told the House inquiry Oct. 3 that Trump was skeptical in a May 23 briefing that Ukraine was serious about fighting corruption and deserved robust U.S. support.\n\n\"He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of 'terrible people,'\" Volker said. \"He said they 'tried to take me down'.\u201d\n\nTexts between U.S. diplomats questioning Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy were released as part of Volker\u2019s testimony.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, asked in a text message Sept. 1 to Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\n\"Call me,\" Sondland texted back.\n\nTaylor texted again Sept. 9: \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nSondland later said he called Trump before responding that the assertion was \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland said in a text message.\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, leaves a closed door meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 16, 2019, after testifying before congressional lawmakers as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nAmbassador opposed Giuliani's role\n\nSondland testified Thursday that Trump seemed uninterested in Ukraine policy and told the ambassador to consult with Giuliani instead.\n\n\"It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president's mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\" Sondland said. \"Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president's personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.\"\n\nSondland said he wasn\u2019t aware that corruption investigations were targeting the Bidens or that military aid was withheld, but he said both steps would have been wrong. Sondland said he didn\u2019t participate in the July 25 call and only learned the details when the summary was released Sept. 25.\n\n\"Let me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong,\" Sondland said. \"Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\"\n\nUS Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, center, arrives for a joint interview with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 17, 2019.

Republican lawmakers said Trump has the authority to name or remove any ambassadors representing the country.\n\nPompeo disputed allegations that he failed to defend career diplomats such as Yovanovitch.\"I protect every single State Department employee,\" Pompeo told The Tennessean. \"It\u2019s one of the reasons that we asked the House of Representatives to stop their abusive prosecutions where they won\u2019t let State Department lawyers sit with our employees. That\u2019s not fair.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets the media in Rome, Oct. 2, 2019. Pompeo confirmed that he was on the telephone call between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president that is the subject of an impeachment inquiry. \"I was on the phone call,\" Pompeo told reporters in Rome.

But they were arrested at Dulles International Airport clutching one-way tickets to Germany and were charged with campaign-finance violations. They pleaded not guilty on Thursday.\n\nU.S. counterintelligence agents have been examining Giuliani\u2019s business dealings with Parnas and Fruman since at least early 2019, according to a Manhattan lawyer, Kenneth McCallion, who has represented several Ukrainian clients.\n\nGiuliani: Federal investigators have been looking into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine since early 2019\n\nTrump denied knowing the two men, despite hosting them at the White House. Giuliani declined comment on their arrest.\n\nIn a related move, House investigators set a Friday deadline for documents from Energy Secretary Rick Perry because he urged Trump to call Zelensky. The House panels also cited reports that Perry suggested Ukraine to remove board members from a state-owned energy company and replace them with Parnas and Fruman.\n\nBut the White House notified lawmakers Oct. 8 that it wouldn\u2019t cooperate with subpoenas because the House hasn\u2019t authorized the impeachment inquiry. The Energy Department notifies the House inquiry Friday it wouldn\u2019t comply with the subpoena \u201cat this time.\u201d\n\nPerry announced his resignation Thursday, saying he would leave office later this year.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/impeachment-witnesses-describe-how-president-trump-dealt-ukraine/4022832002/", "description": "Witnesses in House impeachment inquiry called President Donald Trump's Ukraine policy \"crazy\" under personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Published A.M.
