Then, back in Washington, President Trump tweeted: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nIt soon became apparent, as Mr. Trump confirmed Sunday morning, that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State, was dead.\n\nThe story of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments is also one of American intelligence gathering, military force and astonishing warfare technology. The special operations forces who landed in Barisha, Syria, already knew the tunnels under Baghdadi\u2019s compound were mostly dead-ends. Troops brought robotic military equipment to help chase him through the tunnels, but didn\u2019t need it, the president said. And Mr. Trump said he and his national security team watched much of the evening unfold via video streamed into the White House Situation Room.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State, died in a U.S. raid in northwestern Syria, President Trump said Sunday. U.S. special operations forces targeted Baghdadi in a raid near Idlib, officials said.\n\nThe hunt for Baghdadi has been an American national security priority ever since the U.S. and its mainly Kurdish allies captured the militants\u2019 last desert holdout in eastern Syria in March.\n\nOne former member of Islamic State who was held at a counterterrorism prison in northern Syria told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that, while incarcerated, he was interrogated by Americans and asked about the whereabouts of senior commanders, including Baghdadi. The 18-year-old former fighter said he didn\u2019t know the leader\u2019s whereabouts but that other prisoners were asked the same questions.\n\nDuring the past few weeks, U.S. officials said, the search came into sharper focus as intelligence revealed Baghdadi\u2019s location. \u201cWe had him scoped,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president said the U.S. relied mostly on its own intelligence to find the ideological leader of Islamic State. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need very much help,\u201d he said.\n\nBut an official in the Iraqi National Intelligence Service said the agency had provided the U.S. with the coordinates of Baghdadi\u2019s location based information gathered from captured associates of Baghdadi\u2019s. Turkish and Kurdish military leaders also said they had intelligence concerning Baghdadi.\n\nU.S. officials wouldn\u2019t say how much the influx of intelligence helped, but lawmakers praised the cooperation. \u201cWe can never do this stuff alone\u2014we have to have allies and friends,\u201d said Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas) a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nOn Saturday night at roughly midnight local time, U.S. special forces conducted a raid in the remote town of Barisha in the Syrian province of Idlib. It is the last territory controlled by neither President Bashar al-Assad's government and its allies nor the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The site was identified in intelligence reports provided by Turkey just 48 hours before. U.S. forces have not been active in the area previously. A resident of a nearby village estimated the population to be around 3,000, with about 1,000 displaced people from other parts of Syria having moved there in recent years. Social media has shown the location of the attack to be outside the village.

The leader of a group responsible for beheadings, rapes and the displacement of thousands of people had become skilled at remaining undetected: He stockpiled large amounts of cash, frequently changed locations and avoided using cellphones, Mr. Trump said.\n\nBut Baghdadi didn\u2019t relocate, and U.S. officials received additional confirmation on his location. The mission was on.\n\nOn Friday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper delayed his return trip to Washington from Brussels so he could call in to a secret meeting of top military officials taking place in a secure Pentagon facility known as the \u201ctank.\u201d At that meeting, top officials were putting the final touches on a plan to go after the Islamic State leader, according to U.S. officials.\n\nOn Saturday at 5 p.m. in Washington, Mr. Trump entered the White House Situation Room with Vice President Pence and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, among others. He said the decision to approve the mission\u2014whether to put \u201ca large number of brilliant fighters\u201d at risk \u2014 was difficult.\n\nRussia, Turkey, Iraq and Syria were given advance warning that U.S. troops would be in the area, but weren\u2019t told why, Mr. Trump said.\n\nA U.S. command and control base had been set up in Erbil, Iraq, to allow military officials to oversee the operation, a U.S. official said. Before midnight Iraq time Saturday, eight U.S. military helicopters loaded with U.S. special-operations force team members, equipment and military dogs left from western Iraq.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi was last seen publicly in a video released in April.

Along the 70-minute flight, Mr. Trump said, they were fired upon by \u201crandom people.\u201d U.S. officials said they were most likely local fighters unaware of the larger mission.\n\nThe helicopters retaliated, repelling the fire.\n\nWhen they reached the compound where Baghdadi was hiding, the helicopters landed and the troops stormed the building, engaging fighters on the ground, U.S. officials said. The president said they blew a hole through a wall in the compound and the troops were greeted by a round of gunfire.\n\n\u201cThey blasted their way in, and then all hell broke loose,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Trump said there were many casualties on Baghdadi\u2019s side, while declining to say how many died.\n\nAmid the firefight, a U.S. military dog chased Baghdadi who attempted to escape through a series of tunnels along with three of his children, Mr. Trump said. Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest at the end of one closed-end tunnel while \u201cwhimpering, crying and screaming all the way,\u201d the president said. The president declined to say how he knew Baghdadi was whimpering.\n\nAlthough the tunnel caved in on Baghdadi and the three children, troops were able to collect DNA samples which were tested on-site by lab technicians traveling as part of the missions. Some of pieces of Baghdadi\u2019s body were \u201cbrought back\u201d by U.S. troops, the president said.\n\nA field analysis on the remains in the tunnel provided for a preliminary conclusion that the person who died there was Baghdadi. A conclusive analysis was completed overnight, corroborating that conclusion.\n\nThe troops were in the compound for about two hours in all, Mr. Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we heard was the war plane carrying out the final airstrikes,\u201d said a resident in the Syrian town of Sarmada, near the site of the raid, who identified himself only as Sharif.\n\nEleven children were captured from the compound where Baghdadi died, along with a small group of adults, Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump declined to say how many adults were apprehended, adding only that there were more dead than alive.\n\nThe special forces then boarded the helicopters for a flight away from the area. When the helicopters safely landed, the president posted his provocative and cryptic message on social media at 9:23 p.m.\n\nVideos shared by local activists and said to be from the aftermath of the operation showed a charred vehicle, dead bodies and a demolished house. The Wall Street Journal couldn\u2019t verify the footage independently.\n\nWrite to Michael C. Bender at Mike.Bender@wsj.com, Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.com and Nancy A.
