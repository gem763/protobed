Retail sales, consumer confidence and jobs data metrics remained at high levels, even as manufacturing, investment and CEO confidence stumbled.\n\nSome economists are even bullish on the state of things.\n\n\"There is no denying that elevated uncertainty is bad for investment, but our tracking of global fixed capital formation finds little sign of lasting damage, at least at this stage,\" Institute of International Finance economists Robin Brooks and Jonathan Fortun said in a recent note.\n\n\"If we combine this relatively benign global growth picture with material easing from key central banks, it paints a picture that arguably looks quite constructive for risk assets.\"\n\nBe smart: Economists almost never see recessions coming. Ahead of the global financial crisis, economic leaders from the Fed, Treasury Department and major ratings agencies gave no warning of what was to come.", "description": "None of the economic organizations are expecting a recession, this year or next.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/bQ5bNNrJk6-RUE4F4e6tdoSLHPk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/20/1568979979953.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
