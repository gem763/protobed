Murphy oversees Eastern State\u2019s tour program and says that many people are \"coming here to learn about criminal-justice reform, social justice, to hold discussions and dialogues about, really, the shortcomings of our criminal-justice system.\u201d\n\nEastern State Penitentiary opened in 1829, and its architecture and design have \u201cbeen copied by prison architects all over the world,\u201d Murphy says, making it \u201carguably history\u2019s most influential prison.\u201d\n\nThe prison museum operates as a \u201cstabilized ruin,\" meaning its deterioration is controlled while still remaining safe for visitors to enter.\n\nWhile there are no plans to restore the recognized National Historic Landmark, the site hosts an annual haunted-house fundraiser, which covers about 66 percent of the museum\u2019s operating budget. These funds are used to pay the bills, preserve the landmark and fund daytime public programming.\n\nMurphy says \u201cTerror Behind the Walls\u201d is one of the largest and highest-rated haunted houses in the United States.\n\nOnce the museum closes to the public, technical and production teams have about an hour to flip the switch to the lights off, turn on the fog machine and get the music rolling for the haunted house. Actors in masks and costumes jump out at visitors from cells; neon lights and clowns line one of the cellblocks; and loud shrieks echo through the darkness. The production brings 300 staff members onto the set every night.\n\nMurphy explains that while the haunts may bring people in, the penitentiary\u2019s important history is what leaves a lasting impression.\n\n\u201cA lot of people come here because of its reputation as a site of paranormal activity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, and we encourage people to come for whatever their interests are.\"\n\nBut, he continued, the museum hopes visitors think critically about our criminal-justice system: \"There\u2019s more work to do there.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to pack like a paranormal investigator on a ghost hunt\n\n7 spooky under-the-radar places to visit, according to a ghost hunter\n\nTell us what you think of By The Way", "description": "The former prison aims to educate visitors on criminal-justice reform \u2014 with a few Halloween scares along the way.", "authors": ["Taylor Turner", "Video Editor", "Producer Focusing On Travel", "Taylor Turner Is A Video Editor", "Producer For", "The Way", "The Washington Post S Travel Initiative.
