Both were down 0.7%.\n\nLate on Friday, the United States and China outlined the first stage of a trade deal and suspended this week\u2019s scheduled U.S. tariff hikes. But existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both sides said much more work was needed before an accord could be agreed.\n\n\u201cThe oil market is taking a cautious stance as to what comes next given that the thorny issues of industrial policy, intellectual property rights, technology transfer among others were not addressed,\u201d BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian said.\n\nBrent and WTI rose more than 3% last week, their first weekly increase in three.\n\nA good portion of their gains came after the United States announced on Friday it was deploying more troops to Saudi Arabia, and after an Iranian oil tanker was attacked in the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cWhile the market waits for potential responses from the Iranians, the continued inability of geopolitics to sustain price gains is a testament to the state of concerns over demand,\u201d JBC analysts said in a note.\n\nThere are also worries that further escalation along the Syrian and Turkish border could affect output or exports from Iraq, providing more support for oil prices.
