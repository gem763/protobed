Upset because I\u2019ve beaten it! What an amazingly entertaining game it is and the perfect antidote to today\u2019s bloated, games as a service monstrosities. Anyone worried that it\u2019s not long enough to justify the money, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the perfect length and at around 15 hours plus several more to 100% it I felt far more satisfied upon finally finishing it than I have with anything else for a long time.\n\nIt\u2019s cheeky attitude and uncomplicated gameplay may seem simplistic at first but those dungeons are hard! Much harder than anything in Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and certainly more than any other modern game with their \u2018press this to win\u2019 attitude to puzzles. I was absolutely convinced that the seventh dungeon was completely impossible at least three times, and that there must be something wrong with my copy, but in the end I beat it and the feeling of satisfaction was immense.\n\nIt worked so well I immediately wanted something else from the same era but I\u2019m a bit torn. A Link To The Past seems too obvious at the moment so I think it\u2019d be more interesting to see Oracle of Seasons and Ages or The Minish Cap. My memory of the two Capcom games is that they weren\u2019t as good as regular Nintendo ones but I honestly can\u2019t remember them very well. But a double remake with both, and the aborted third game, would be very interesting to me.\n\nWhat do others think? I want to see more 2D Zeldas, not just the 3D games.\n\nKurt", "description": "The Friday Inbox wants to know what happened to the new Batman game teases, as one reader backs Brie Larson as Samus in a Metroid movie.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DweTzqMXcAAYZ4e-9577_1570139649.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
