As the Guardian reports, Johnson became heated after the Labour Party leader asked him to disclose information regarding the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit documents.\n\nCorbyn said Johnson was, \u201cdesperate, absolutely desperate to avoid scrutiny,\u201d which prompted the new prime minister to make the outburst. While the term may sound strange to us non-Brits, Johnson\u2019s schoolyard name-calling resulted in Twitter users labeling him as misogynistic, sexist, and homophobic.\n\nI'm no lip reader, but is this: 'Call an election, you great big girls blouse'? pic.twitter.com/9eyBNuzcuA \u2014 Ned Simons (@nedsimons) September 4, 2019\n\nWhat even IS a big girl\u2019s blouse?\n\nAside from being a commonly worn women\u2019s garment, British people have used the term \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d as an insult, usually directed toward a man, and implying he is a coward, weak, or effeminate. Or, as my British friend told me, \u201cit\u2019s the equivalent of calling a man a pussy or a wimp.\u201d\n\nAmanda Montell, author of Wordslut: A Feminist Guide to Taking Back the English Language, says that the phrase may be \u201cabout 50 years old,\u201d and is basically a synonym for a \u201csissy or a cowardly man with a low pain threshold.\u201d And, in case you\u2019re wondering, it\u2019s not a blouse that belongs to a big girl, but more like a girl\u2019s blouse that\u2019s big, according to an old article from BBC America.\n\nWhere did the phrase come from?\n\nIt may have originated during the late \u201860s from a British comedian named Hylda Baker. Montell says its earliest written record was in a 1969 episode of the British sitcom Nearest & Dearest in which a character (Baker\u2019s) insults another by calling him a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse.\u201d She says it popped up again later in 1986 in a piece for The Guardian when a writer named Stephen Bierley explicitly associated the term with femininity in a negative way, saying a soccer team had been \u201cplaying like big girls\u2019 blouses ever since.\u201d\n\nAussies apparently use the term, as well; there was even an Australian sketch comedy show called Big Girl\u2019s Blouse that aired in the mid-\u201990s.\n\nDo people even use the word still?\n\nMaybe \u201cover-promoted rubber bath toys\u201d like Boris Johnson do. In fact, it might be one of his favorite phrases, as the Guardian says Johnson called Labour\u2019s election campaign chief a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in 2017, and also used the term back in 2007. My British friend (who is real) says she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cused loads in the modern day,\u201d but it\u2019s definitely a commonly known slur.\n\nSo-called world leaders repeatedly making immature, tasteless, and offensive insults? No, that doesn\u2019t sound familiar at all.\n\nStay in touch.
