Not long ago, a busker with a mic and a giant white tuba was booming a tune near the Dupont Circle Metro station. From a distance, I briefly gawked at the tuba. I thought other people would do the same. Then I saw that their eyes were in fact glued on me. Frankly, sometimes I just want to pick up a few tacos in peace. But other times are for rocking the difference \u2014 in a dress, on the bus, at the job and in changing hearts, minds and policies.\n\nSo I eagerly approached Keah Brown\u2019s essay collection, \u201cThe Pretty One: On Life, Pop Culture, Disability and Other Reasons to Fall in Love With Me.\u201d That frothy title has fight and pain in it. Brown, 27, is a debut author with cerebral palsy who is working to change how people with disabilities are viewed \u2014 when we are included at all \u2014 in popular entertainment and society generally.\n\nBrown was already an accomplished freelance journalist and writer when she created the hashtag #DisabledandCute in a Twitter post in February 2017. It went viral, leading to an agent and this book. Her recent magazine writing includes a cover profile of Brie Larson for Marie Claire UK and a cover story on disabled models in the fashion industry for Teen Vogue. She watches TV, writes and interviews people while sitting on her bed or at a desk at home in western New York, where she lives with her mother, sister and brother.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind being an inspiration if it is for a valid reason, such as admiring how many slices of pizza I ate, an essay or an article I wrote, my clothing choices, or how quickly I can learn the lyrics to songs,\u201d Brown writes in the introduction. \u201cAs long as the inspiration doesn\u2019t come with pity or self-congratulatory pats on the back, I am all for it.\u201d\n\nBrown is emotionally honest \u2014 sometimes devastatingly so \u2014 but knows to put readers at ease first with relatable-girlfriend charm and playful, fizzy humor. She makes the opening essay, \u201cCan We Sit for a Sec?,\u201d a half-joking paean to seats where she can rest: \u201cMy longest relationship has been with chairs,\u201d she begins. \u201cWe are very happy together, committed and strong, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.\u201d In \u201cYou Can\u2019t Cure Me, I Promise It\u2019s Fine,\u201d she conjures up an imagined Disability Be Gone! mart that sells quack cures.\n\n[A romance novelist struggled with Asperger\u2019s. Now she writes about love on the spectrum.]\n\nWhen the subject is pop culture, Brown\u2019s sharp writing achieves the Venn diagram center of her interests. \u201cBlack people with disabilities are all but invisible. We simply don\u2019t exist\u201d in TV and in movies, she writes in \u201cPop Culture & Me: A (Sometimes) Unrequited Love Story.\u201d She dreams of living in Los Angeles, \u201cemployed in a writers\u2019 room of a show that I love with the ability to create a nuanced disabled woman who experiences the full spectrum of emotion but ultimately loves herself and doesn\u2019t make disability her every waking thought.\u201d\n\nBrown identifies herself as a disabled black woman, a proud feminist, a sister, daughter, aunt, niece, friend, and cousin and a human being.\n\n\u201cWe are free from the expectations of others when we choose to be fully who we are and choose how to label ourselves,\u201d Brown says in \u201cIs This Thing On?\u201d Down to earth and fun, she is fluent in terms such as intersectionality, representation and marginalization: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough about comfort and accessibility,\u201d she points out. \u201cThe conversation hasn\u2019t fully hit mainstream spaces, because they operate under the assumption that it is never an issue for anyone occupying space in the rooms where conversations about inclusion and representation happen.\u201d As for the etiquette around adults staring, she comments dryly: \u201cNo one wants to feel like an animal at the zoo on display without choice, not even those animals at the zoo.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author Keah Brown. (Katelyn Shufelt Photography)\n\nEven as Brown delves into race, feminism, rom-coms and red carpets, it is her personal experience of life with disabilities that ties this collection together, giving it an authoritative immediacy, a beauty.\n\n\u201cI grew up hating mirrors,\u201d she writes. \u201cMy happiness and joy are still relatively new because I started embracing them only four years ago.\u201d Her cerebral palsy affects the right side of her body; she also has chronic migraines, seasonal depression and anxiety.\n\nTasks such as \u201cclasping pants, opening bottles, zipping jackets, carrying more than one thing at a time and balancing myself\u201d are daunting for her, she explains in \u201cFreedom of a Ponytail.\u201d Doing her own ponytail became a mission after she graduated from college. She studied YouTube tutorials, then practiced in secret in tears for weeks. \u201cIt was one of the first times I did not give up on myself even in the midst of all my self-loathing at my first failed attempt,\u201d Brown writes. \u201cLooking back, I can see that it was a monumental decision, because it was so different from who I was otherwise at the time.\u201d On a Wednesday in April 2016, she finally mastered the ponytail: It felt \u201clike a revolutionary act, a celebration of disability and of me.\u201d\n\nIn the title essay, Brown muses, \u201cas a disabled person, living in a disabled body, I am not supposed to be beautiful, but I have been proving people wrong all my life, so why stop now?\u201d With this engaging and necessary collection, she asks us to think from a deeper place \u2014 and gets me to totally smile.\n\nDiana Michele Yap is a freelance writer in Washington.", "description": "Brown\u2019s essay collection \u201cThe Pretty One\u201d brings an emotional honesty to a subject too often ignored.", "authors": ["Diana Michele Yap"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2GpWnjGFqZTUgHvcsOQPwjubQWQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GA5KKVF224I6TOWWMCPXLP6ZP4.jpg"}
