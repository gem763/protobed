The cause of the crash hasn\u2019t been determined, police said.\n\nAD\n\nPolice identified the pilot as Julius Tolson Jr., 58, of Laurel, and his passenger as Michael Garrah, 57, of Columbia. Both are listed as \u201cother owners\u201d of the plane in the Federal Aviation Administration registry.\n\nAD\n\nA message to Tolson at a phone number in public records wasn\u2019t returned. Contacted at the scene, Garrah declined to comment.\n\nThe plane\u2019s registered owner, Derrick Early of Greenbelt, said he didn\u2019t know what caused the aircraft to go down.\n\n\u201cAccidents like these, there\u2019s an official investigation into it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the goal is to figure out what happened.\u201d\n\nEric Diprospero, 31, of Baltimore said he was headed to work in Annapolis with a colleague when \u201cout of nowhere a plane appeared in the middle of the highway, and we struck it very hard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was in front of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a split-second thing where it skidded right across the middle of the highway, and there was no time to react.\u201d\n\nDiprospero said that he was grateful for the fast response of authorities and that he and his co-worker suffered only minor cuts and bruises.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just probably a miracle, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been involved in a vehicle-plane crash before.\u201d\n\nThe white and maroon aircraft sat on its belly in the inner median of the highway as ambulances and police cruisers swarmed the scene. What appeared to be the plane\u2019s shorn-off wing was crumpled several yards away next to a silver sedan with a smashed front end and its doors flung open.\n\nAD\n\nFrom the archives: His F-16 lost its engine, then caught fire over Washington before crashing. And he lived to tell about it.\n\nPrince George\u2019s Fire Department spokesman Mike Yourishin said such plane crashes occur occasionally in the area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting our lucky stars it wasn\u2019t worse,\u201d he said.\n\nMaryland State Police and the FAA are handling the investigation, he said.\n\nCatherine L. Harvey was one of several residents and motorists who stopped along an overpass to take photos and observe the scene. Harvey, who has lived in Bowie for 12 years, stepped out onto her porch after hearing the ambulances and then headed to the overpass.\n\nAD\n\nShe wasn\u2019t surprised that the plane had crashed nearby. Another one had crashed into the woods along the highway about three years ago, she recalled.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. 50 is \u201cpretty smooth and easy,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nerve-racking when you come to the airport because of things like this, so I find myself looking up when I\u2019m driving because I know the planes are coming in and going out.\u201d\n\nResidents Randy Smith and James Eason, standing on the overpass with Harvey, agreed.\n\n\u201cIn the morning going down this way, it slows down about there,\u201d Smith said, pointing to the wreckage below. \u201cBack in the evening, it slows down. It\u2019s kind of like a Bermuda Triangle.\u201d\n\nEason said that his home is under a flight path for the airport and that crashes involving pilots in training are a constant worry. Eason said Thursday\u2019s crash was at least the third he can remember in his seven years living in the area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA woman at the office of Freeway Airport declined to comment on the crash. A website for the airport said it has been \u201coffering flight instruction, pilot services and aircraft maintenance in the Baltimore-Washington area for over 50 years.\u201d\n\nIt touts itself as \u201cone of the few rural areas left in Maryland\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County\u201d to offer \u201can ideal and relaxed atmosphere for flight lessons.\u201d\n\nSeveral lanes were closed as emergency crews worked at the scene Thursday. Delays on U.S. 50 extended for more than a mile in each direction.\n\nFrom 2017: Small plane crashed near airport in Bowie\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "The crash occurred near Freeway Airport in Bowie, authorities said.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "Justin Wm.
