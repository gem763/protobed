Martucci, one of the academics, in a presentation at a security conference over the summer.\n\nCLI reports usually look like a giant blob of text, and are mostly ineffective when shown to a non-technical manager, he added.\n\nThe other main downside to CLIs was the steep learning curve that kept many new users away. Since firewalls are highly sensitive systems, many users choose to use GUIs because they were much clearer about the actions a user is taking. Simpler interfaces eliminate mistakes were a new sysadmin could accidentally expose networks to attacks due to a misunderstood CLI parameter.\n\nImage: Voronkov et al.\n\nAs for GUI strengths, usability was the primary reason cited by most respondents. In hindsight, it is pretty hard to get things wrong in a firewall GUI.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of graphs and statistics is also a bonus feature that can also help many users spot anomalies and threats faster -- in opposition to having to stare at hundreds or thousands of lines of text.\n\nHowever, GUIs were not perfect either. The downside that most sysadmins cited was that firewall GUIs could not be automated to perform tasks in the absence of a human operator. Furthermore, some firewall GUIs lacked fine-grained controls, eventually needing that sysadmins use a CLI to perform certain actions.\n\nImage: Voronkov et al.\n\nThe survey was carried out by a three-man research team from the Karlstad University in Sweden. Academics asked system administrators who manage firewalls on a daily basis to answer 15+ questions part of an online survey.\n\nRespondents were invited to participate in the survey via the /r/sysadmin subreddit, the SysAdmins.ru forum, and various system administrators' mailing lists. From the 516 participants who started the survey, only 303 answered all questions.\n\nFor the full results, ZDNet readers can check out the \"System Administrators Prefer Command Line Interfaces, Don't They?
