Violent arrests of protesters have drawn international attention.\n\nSaturday's planned demonstrations include yet another \"stress test\" of the airport aiming to disrupt transport links to Chek Lap Kok, built in the dying days of British rule on reclaimed land around a tiny island of the same name and reached by a series of gleaming bridges.\n\nAn anti-extradition bill protester walks near a burning barricade in Hong Kong on Friday.

The train would not stop en route, on the Kowloon peninsula. Bus services could also be hit, it said.\n\nThe measures are aimed at avoiding the chaos of last weekend, when protesters blocked airport approach roads, threw debris on the train track and trashed the subway station in nearby Tung Chung in running clashes with police.\n\nProtesters also occupied the arrival hall last month, halting and delaying flights, amid a series of clashes with police.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under the \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is its internal affair. It has denounced the protests, warning of the damage to the economy and the possible use of force to quell the unrest.\n\nIn addition to calling for a withdrawal of the extradition bill and the release of those arrested for violence, protesters want an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality, retraction of the word \"riot\" to describe rallies and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\nThe protests have presented Chinese President Xi Jinping with his greatest popular challenge since he came to power in 2012.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters plan to block one of the world's busiest airports on Saturday after a night of violence in which police used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up crowds, the latest clashes in 14 weeks of unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5274600.1567820435!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hongkong-protests.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
