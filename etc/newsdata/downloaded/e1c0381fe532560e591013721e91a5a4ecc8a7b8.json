Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nFacebook\u2019s approach to political speech comes under fire\n\nOn Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg gave a speech at Georgetown University about his vision for free speech and expression in the digital age \u2013 taking a stance that many Democrats see as dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg told tech policy reporter Tony Romm ahead of the speech. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nZuckerberg has come under fire in recent months for allowing politicians to post misrepresentations and lies to Facebook \u2014 a decision that has sparked criticism from Democrats ahead of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been under pressure to take more action against that content,\u201d Romm says. \u201cBut on the flip side, Zuckerberg has been pressured to ensure that Facebook is still the free-flow, free exchange that made the site what it\u2019s become today, used by more than 2 billion people around the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nCummings, 68, remembered as \u2018a leading tower of character and integrity\u2019\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), best known for his principled stands on politically charged issues in the House, his calming effect on anti-police riots in Baltimore and his forceful opposition to President Trump, died at a hospice center in Baltimore on Wednesday. He was 68.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of powerful anecdotes and stories about how Chairman Cummings did his own thing, with little regard for what most of the caucus thought was best,\u201d reporter Jenna Portnoy says. \u201cHe was certainly an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but he voted his conscience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressional reporter Paul Kane says it\u2019s not yet clear who will succeed Cummings as the head of the House Oversight Committee, which has a big role to play in the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a generation of members of the Congressional Black Caucus who have lived lives that are really just heroic in a way,\u201c Kane says. \u201cThose voices are powerful. They just have a different level of moral clarity, moral authority. And I don\u2019t know who those next leaders will be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nA battle between local traditions and global outrage in Japan\n\nDolphins captured by fishermen from Taiji, Japan, have supplied aquariums across the world for decades \u2013 in the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Thailand, Russia and elsewhere. They\u2019ve been purchased by the U.S. Navy for mine detection and other tasks, fueling the region\u2019s economy in a way that the slaughter of dolphins for meat doesn\u2019t match.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 2015, public outcry after the release of a documentary about Taiji\u2019s dolphin hunt led the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums to prohibit its members from acquiring dolphins captured by drive hunts such as Taiji\u2019s and brought foreigners to Japan to protest the island\u2019s cultural traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTokyo bureau chief Simon Denyer visited Taiji at the beginning of the hunting season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018Setu\u2019 is a common surname in Taiji that refers to the harpoon in the whaling boat,\u201d Denyer said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t want to give up a tradition which their ancestors have been carrying for a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Tony Romm examines what Facebook sees as its role in policing speech ahead the 2020 election.
