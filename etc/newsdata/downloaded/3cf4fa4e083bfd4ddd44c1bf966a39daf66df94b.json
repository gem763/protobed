Australian real estate investment trusts \u2014 an investment product pioneered here \u2014 have been a top performer, still delivering 4-5 per cent yields.\n\nWith risk-free 10-year government yields down to 1 per cent or so, there is still a fair bit of \u2018\u2018margin compression\u2019\u2019 left to push commercial property prices even higher.\n\nSure, this includes \u2018\u2018stupid money\u2019\u2019, says veteran money man Trevor Loewensohn. That only matters if short-term refinancing forces you to sell during a downturn, suggests Darren Steinberg, chief executive of Dexus, Australia\u2019s biggest office landlord.\n\nMr Steinberg says he\u2019s been offered 20-year debt at just 2.7 per cent \u2014 long enough and low enough to ride out any storm.\n\nEven with the soft economy, underlying demand for office space remains solid. Ironically enough, that\u2019s partly because of the mountain of compliance and risk work being forced on financial institutions following the royal commission. It\u2019s also because of the expanding urban workforces of Google, Atlassian and other tech companies.\n\nIt will surely unwind when interest rates exit their lowest levels in history. But that\u2019s probably not for the next couple of years at least. In the meantime, the Reserve Bank\u2019s lower-for-longer guidance is even pushing housing prices back up.\n\nMr Frydenberg welcomes this because the \u2018\u2018wealth effect\u2019\u2019 should encourage people to shop more. And prices could keep rising because the slump in housing construction is likely to lead to shortages in a year or two.\n\nRisk-averse banks, emboldened regulators and suffocating development red tape will ensure that supply lags population-driven demand.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, how that plays out with a household sector already heavily in debt and constrained by modest wages growth. Sooner or later, even cheap money has to be repaid.", "description": "While much of the economy remains subpar, it's boom time for much of commercial property.
