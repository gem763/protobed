Kamala Harris made their case to major donors behind closed doors in two meetings in New York on Friday, telling them they were working on defining the California Democrat with a more refined core message.\n\nIn the first meeting with a broader group, Ms. Harris\u2019s sister and campaign chairwoman, Maya Harris, along with media consultant Jim Margolis, were questioned by some donors on the senator\u2019s stagnant poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary. The Harris aides talked up Ms. Harris\u2019s key endorsements in early states, appeal to young voters and their view of the vulnerability of former Vice President Joe Biden \u2019s poll numbers, people familiar with the meetings said.\n\nThe advisers in the second meeting, with a smaller group of top donors, focused more on the need for voters to know Ms. Harris better\u2014and on the campaign\u2019s strategy to accomplish that through clearer messaging of her values and policy positions, the people said.\n\nThe meetings in Manhattan drew dozens and included donors from the finance, media and legal industries, among others.\n\nThe advisers also discussed the dynamic of the coming third Democratic debate, with all of the top contenders on stage Thursday in Houston, as a welcome change from the last debate, when the lower-tier candidates focused attacks on the higher-polling candidates on stage\u2014Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden\u2014putting them on the defensive. They also acknowledged that a repeat of her first debate performance would be tough.\n\nThe leading Democratic candidates look likely to share the same stage at the next presidential debate, after Tom Steyer failed to get the support needed to qualify, according to two polls.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nSome of the donors said they\u2014and others they had talked to\u2014could shift some of their support to Mr. Biden if Ms. Harris\u2019s poll numbers didn\u2019t start trending upward.\n\nAlready, there are about 100 donors who have given $2,800\u2014the maximum individual contribution per election\u2014to both Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think Kamala Harris can improve her standing in the 2020 Democratic field? Join the conversation below.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s donors and those close to her campaign said they have been surprised by the resiliency of Mr. Biden\u2019s support, especially among African-American voters in South Carolina, which they had seen as a state she could carry, but which has struggled to get a footing in.\n\nA spokesman for Ms. Harris didn\u2019t respond to a request to comment.\n\nSome of her backers also criticized the emphasis on national polls, which aren\u2019t reflective of early-state standing.\n\n\u201cShe remains stably and securely in the top five,\u201d said Sue Dvorsky, an influential Iowa activist who endorsed Ms. Harris last month. \u201cA lot of things are going to happen in the next six to eight weeks, and within that top tier, there\u2019s a lot of fluidity.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign is ramping up its organization in Iowa and South Carolina in particular, and aides believe a strong performance in those states would give her the needed momentum going into Super Tuesday, where her delegate-rich home state of California is up for grabs.\n\nBy Labor Day, Ms. Harris had made nine trips to South Carolina and eight trips to Nevada\u2014the most of any of the top-tier candidates to those states. After not investing as much time in Iowa as other candidates, Ms. Harris made 17 stops on a five-day bus tour across the state in mid-August, her seventh trip there.\n\nUnlike other candidates such as Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who are relying mostly on online, small-dollar donations, Ms. Harris hasn\u2019t been as successful with her online fundraising and has had to work to maintain her support among wealthy donors to keep up with the top contenders\u2019 quarterly hauls.\n\nDuring her bus tour across Iowa, Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign invited some top supporters to the state where they received a tour of her bus, people familiar with the visit said. Campaign aides also updated the donors on their plans for renewed investment in Iowa and took them canvassing, the people said.\n\nAfter her bus tour, Ms. Harris participated in several high-dollar fundraisers in late August, including with celebrities in Los Angeles and wealthy Democrats in the Hamptons in New York state and Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts, explaining her position on Medicare-for-all at least one of them.\n\nShe has a mix of low- and high-dollar fundraisers scheduled through September including in Los Angeles, Greenwich, Conn., and Nashville, Tenn., according to invitations reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThroughout a mixed summer for her campaign\u2014that began with a big boost when she went after Mr. Biden in the June debate and ended with continued skepticism over her health-care plan and a return to her pre-first debate standing in polls\u2014Ms. Harris has been keeping major donors in the loop and in some cases allaying concerns.\n\nSome donors even heard directly from Ms. Harris by phone in the days following the second debate in July, when she was forced to defend herself repeatedly from both more progressive and moderate candidates on stage, people familiar with the calls said.\n\n\u2014Chad Day contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com and Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com", "description": "Top advisers to Sen.
