The company did not disclose specific details on the planned investment.\n\n\u201cIt will enable the business to accelerate its ambitious growth plans,\u201d Peel Ports said in a statement.\n\nWork has already begun on the second phase of Liverpool2 to provide additional capacity for the expected increase in volumes, the company said.\n\nLiverpool and the wider northwest area account for about 70% of Peel Ports\u2019 overall profits.\n\nTiL\u2019s container terminals business is active in 29 countries and handles 45 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) annually, an MSC Group report showed.\n\nMSC, the world\u2019s second-biggest container line, this year launched a service between the Mediterranean and Canada including a Liverpool stop.\n\nThis is in addition to a separate service from Liverpool to New York that began last year and is run jointly with the world\u2019s No. 1 player Maersk Line (MAERSKb.CO).", "description": "Privately owned Peel Ports has formed a joint venture agreement with Swiss shipping line MSC's Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) to develop Liverpool's container facility.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431974343&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J11S", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
