Amid the bloodbath, utilities -- perceived as safer -- have fared better than others. While the sector is up 17% for the year, it masks strong winners and losers within it. Renewables in particular have outperformed, given that many European governments are looking to boost spending on tackling climate change.\n\nGovernment policies globally are increasingly supporting net-zero carbon targets, underpinning the growth ambitions of utilities including Orsted, RWE, Enel (MI: ), SSE (LON: ) and EDPR, which are poised to benefit from structurally growing capex pipelines, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) says. The analysts estimate renewable players will enter a \u201cgolden age\u201d with investments doubling from current levels to 60 billion euros per year.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: ) analysts are on the same page and said back in August that \u201cclimate champions\u201d will benefit from an unprecedented growth to 2030, a call they reiterated last week after the announcement of the German climate package. They forecast a 9% to 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for those stocks. In a highly fragmented renewable market Goldman has a clear preference for six utility plays: RWE (MI: ), Oersted (CSE: ), EDP (SIX: ), EDP Renovaveis (LS: ), Enel (MI: ), SSE (LON: ) and Iberdrola (MC: ). They see the \u201cpioneering\u201d German plan to act as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the rest of the world.\n\nValuation could put off investors, though. Orsted and EDPR are the two largest pure-play stocks of the sector but they\u2019re also the most expensive. Overall, analysts on average are struggling to find some upside for renewables after the recent rally. UBS analysts turned cautious on Orsted and Iberdrola (MC: ) last month, saying fundamentals are no longer supportive. They prefer other players including Enel (MI: ) and RWE.\n\nSome caution might also be needed on German utilities as the government allocated less money in its budget for closing coal-fired power plants than the companies that own them expected.\n\nClimate change remains the number one ESG issue for investors, according to BofA. They estimate $70 billion of assets are tied to ESG strategies in the U.S. alone, while $3 trillion of assets currently use climate change and carbon footprint as one of the ESG criteria in their investment process.\n\nAmong European countries gearing up spending on tackling climate change, Germany already announced it will spend more than 100 billion euros to reduce carbon emissions between 2020 and 2030, with half of the amount in the first three years.\n\nWith 77 countries now committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, and 87 large companies with a similar pledge, BofA analysts estimate there may be a need to triple the current capacity of renewable projects, as over 75GW of green power purchase agreements (PPA) should be generated.\n\nRenewables might be one of the few beneficiaries from the German package, because the country may not commit to much more fiscal spending beyond this new \"green\" deal, according to Deutsche Bank (DE: ) economists.", "description": "Green Utilities Are Starting to Outperform", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic7afedf5d6b1afb208630f1644b11de5b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
