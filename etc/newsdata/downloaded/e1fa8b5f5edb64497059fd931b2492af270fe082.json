(Courtesy of Alice Stewart)\n\n\"That is Supreme Court nominations, that is religious liberties, rolling back federal government regulations, and a lot of what he is doing with regards to the economy,\" she said.\n\n\"If he continues to to enact that legislation and those policies, I will continue to support him,\" she said. \"But that doesn't mean I'm going to support what he's currently doing in Syria.\"\n\nStewart thinks that voters \"will look at the totality of this president, and the overall record,\" as he seeks re-election in 2020.\n\nSeveral high-profile Republicans have spoken out against Trump's Oct. 7 decision, which has allowed Turkey to launch a major offensive against the Kurds in the region.\n\nSpeaking on TV's Fox & Friends last week, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that: \"This impulsive decision by the President has undone all the gains we've made, thrown the region into further chaos.\"\n\nHe warned it could give defeated ISIS fighters being detained in the region \"a second lease on life.\"\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Liz Cheney also called it a \"catastrophic mistake.\" On Monday morning, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade said on air that \"the president must realize he made a huge mistake.\"\n\n....Kurds may be releasing some to get us involved. Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly. Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nNicholas Fandos, a congressional correspondent for the The New York Times, told The Current that prominent Republicans may be more willing to break rank with Trump on Syria than on other issues, because foreign policy currently doesn't resonate with voters as strongly as issues like taxes and healthcare do.\n\n\"There's less risk for them sticking their neck out and crossing the president on foreign policy, than there would be on domestic issues,\" he said.\n\nDisplaced Syrians sit in the back of a truck in the Syrian border town of Tel Abyad, on Oct. 11.
