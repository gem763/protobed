Now I've gone from being too fat to move to being weak and undernourished.\n\n\"I thought the operation would give me the life I'd dreamed of - but it turns out I couldn't have been more wrong. I could barely eat any food. Whatever I did manage to swallow made my stomach turn. I felt sick all the time.\n\n(Image: Kimberley Wall/ Cavendish Press)\n\n' 'I completely regret having the gastric bypass. I wish I'd never done it. It's just such a shame that I had to get to this point to realise that I was happier when I was overweight.'\"\n\nMiss Wall's mother Muriel Stephenson told the Heywood inquest her daughter had gained the weight over about 18 years, ultimately reaching about 23 stone.\n\nShe at first loved the effects of her 2008 gastric bypass operation, which saw her weight plummet in the first year.\n\nHer mum said: \"She loved the fact she lost so much weight but she could hardly eat anything.\n\n\"It would just be a couple of spoonfuls and then by that stage she had had enough and she was also often sick.\n\n\"As time went by she became more and more depressed, paranoid and worried about everything. She was living on her own with her children and some days she was unable to would get them off to school and would spend the day in bed. She never managed to eat very much - although she loved food. \"\n\n(Image: Kimberley Wall/ Cavendish Press)\n\nOver the last couple of years [she] was very frail and could hardly walk or get out of bed.\"\n\nMiss Wall was repeatedly admitted to hospital over a six year period before being referred to see a specialist.\n\nHowever her mother told the inquest she struggled to get any answers over what was causing the pain.\n\nShe said her daughter needed carers who came in to help with food and she was taking antibiotics: \"The hospital thought she had an eating disorder but we strongly disagree with that.\n\n\"She wanted to eat but couldn't manage to. She was admitted again in the August and was very ill with pains. She was frail and confused and she weighed around five stone. \"\n\nMiss Wall was about to be discharged when her blood pressure dropped suddenly and she was transferred to intensive care.\n\nShe improved and was sent home, but then collapsed and was readmitted and put on 24/7 oxygen.\n\nHer mum recalled: \"At 1.30am we got a call from the hospital to say she had deteriorated and that we should go but she had died before the family where able to get there.\"\n\nMiss Wall's GP Dr Richard Darling told the inquest there were initially questions about whether she could have Crohn's disease but that was ruled out and bipolar disorder was not evident.\n\n(Image: Kimberley Wall/ Cavendish Press)\n\nShe was referred for counselling for depression and anxiety symptoms, but deteriorated and was referred to the Gastroenterology department as she suffered nausea and abdominal pain after eating.\n\nHe was sure she had no eating disorder, and she began to see gains after being prescribed food supplements, the inquest heard.\n\nMr Darling said: \"I always felt the problem was as a result of her surgery and that was consistent with what Kimberley was saying.\"\n\nMedical expert Dr Khurshid Akthar, a consultant surgeon, told the inquest the bypass procedure has complications and risks.\n\nIt seemed likely Miss Wall had suffered from malnutrition following her surgery, he said.\n\nRecording a narrative conclusion the coroner Matthew Cox said: \"We've have had little information about the operation itself as those who treated her are not here to give evidence. But there are risks as well as benefits to the procedure. Kimberly's problem with nutrition is a rare but recognised complication of the gastric bypass surgery.\n\n\"Given the extent of the problems Kimberly went on to suffer she had problems with anxiety and depression and this exasperated the eating difficulties. It is clear to to me the source of her problem was investigated thoroughly over the years.\"", "description": "Rochdale mum Kimberley Wall, 44, at first loved the weight loss that followed her gastric bypass operation- but then she became malnourished", "authors": ["Sophie Wheeler", "Image", "Kimberley Wall", "Cavendish Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574798.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
