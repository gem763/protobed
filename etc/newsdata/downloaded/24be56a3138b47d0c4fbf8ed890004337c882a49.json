Like many things in economics, it comes down to supply and demand. When the global supply of savings is high relative to the global demand for funding to invest in new capital, the price of savings is going to be low.\"\n\nBut he says he hears the complaints.\n\n\"What about the savers, have we forgotten about them? I am reminded of this daily as people write to me telling me how the already low deposit rates are affecting their income.\n\n\"The many people who write to me saying how low interest rates are hurting their finances serve as a constant reminder of this. But, importantly, the board also recognises that monetary policy still works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It works to support employment, jobs and income growth across the economy. In doing so, these decisions will promote the collective economic welfare of the Australian people, which we need to remember is the ultimate goal of monetary policy.\"\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison also doesn't buy into the pleading from big banks that lower profits would hamper economic growth more than if the banks cut rates and provided a stimulus to housing.\n\nHe accused the banks this week of \"profiteering\" after not passing on the Reserve Bank's full 25 basis point interest rate cut.\n\nThe pressure is also coming from competition regulator chairman Rod Sims, who has been angling for a new \"deep dive\" inquiry into the pricing power of the big four.\n\nLabor MP Matt Thistlethwaite said: \"The problem with banking in Australia at the moment is that in terms of the mortgage market, 80 per cent of the mortgages are held by the big four banks.\n\nThis week Liberal MP Tim Wilson sent questions to the big four as well as Bank of Queensland and others about how they were passing on the interest rate cuts.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem of a low interest rate environment: deposit holders are squeezed, listed banks are squeezed on profitability, as are those relying on dividends and if full rate cuts aren\u2019t passed through, stimulus is contained,\" Mr Wilson said.", "description": "A home loan borrower who also has an average shareholding in a bank would be at least twice as better off if the bank passed on all three of this year's 25 basis point cuts than if it did not.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2606%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1d6a07c0de2f897f6c16b107d8f7c97c26477422", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
