REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nBrien, an Army and Air Force veteran, said the withdrawal, which opened the way for a Turkish offensive that displaced thousands of people and led to the escape of some Islamic State militants, contributed to his recent lack of faith in his party\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy.\n\nIt is a feeling that appears to be growing among the Republican rank and file this year.\n\nAccording to an Oct. 18-22 Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll, only about half of all Republicans - 54% - said their party has a better plan than Democrats, independents or others for dealing with Syria. That is down 12 points from a similar poll that ran in April.\n\nAt the same time, 65% of Republicans said their party had the better plan for managing the United States\u2019 so-called \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d down 10 points from the April poll.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who announced the withdrawal after a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, has defended his decision as part of an effort to draw down military operations overseas \u201cwhere our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA.\u201d\n\nYet the national online poll of 4,082 adults in the United States found that 51% of all Americans felt that the country is better off \u201cwith U.S. military forces stationed in the Middle East,\u201d while 29% did not.\n\nMore Americans seemed to want the United States to become involved in international peacekeeping than several years ago. Thirty-five percent of adults strongly agreed in the poll that \u201cAmerica is NOT the world\u2019s policeman.\u201d That is down 12 points overall from a similar poll that ran in 2013.\n\nThe poll also showed that 75% of Republicans approved of the way that Trump was dealing with the Islamic State (ISIS), which is down by about 8 points from April.\n\nThe Trump administration did not return a request for comment on the Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nBrien, who took the poll, said his criticism of the Republican Party\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy is grounded in his general disapproval of Trump. Unlike former Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, Brien said he thinks Trump simply lacks the personal skills needed to work with America\u2019s global neighbors to achieve common goals.\n\n\u201cTrump just seems to be out of his depth and out of touch on everything,\u201d Brien said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to understand why he shouldn\u2019t try to make money off his position of president.\u201d\n\nWhen the poll asked which political party has a better plan for handling the \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d Brien answered \u201cnone.\u201d\n\nAnn Dahlheim, 67, a Republican who lives outside of Washington D.C., said she thought independents were better than anyone right now at leading the country.\n\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats can\u2019t agree on anything, much to my disgust,\u201d Dahlheim said. \u201cWe need some fresh new ideas.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 3 percentage points.\n\nTo see the entire poll, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2payExP", "description": "When Terry Brien, 64, reads about American troops pulling out of northern Syria, the Republican data manager from Colorado seethes at \u201cone of the biggest mistakes that we\u2019ve made in a very long time\u201d in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Chris Kahn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444834012&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0S8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
