Phil Gavin told media during an update just after 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nHe said police are still gathering details and hope to release more in the future.\n\nIt's not clear when the children were supposed to be returned, or why there was a gap between the 25th and when the missing persons report was filed.\n\nPolice say the family previously lived in the Toronto area and still has family and friends there, so it's possible MacDermid is headed that way.\n\n\"We're asking the public to be alert for these people and if anyone has information we're asking them to contact their local police as soon as they can,\" said Gavin.\n\n\"Our primary concern is locating [and] ensuring the safety and welfare of these children.\"", "description": "Niagara police are searching for a father who is believed to have abducted five children.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305080.1569966834!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ian-macdermid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
