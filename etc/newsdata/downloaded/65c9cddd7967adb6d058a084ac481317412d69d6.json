(GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle)\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2014 For 15 years, planetary scientist Steve Squyres\u2019 life revolved around Mars, with good reason. He was the principal investigator for one of the longest-running NASA missions on the surface of another world, executed by the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity.\n\nIf anyone has a sense of the lay of the land on the Red Planet, it\u2019d be Squyres. So what does he think of the idea of setting up permanent cities on Mars?\n\n\u201cMy take on this one is no, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Squyres said here today at Penn State University during the ScienceWriters 2019 conference.\n\nHe\u2019s not opposed to sending people to Mars. Far from it. \u201cHuman research base? Absolutely, as soon as possible,\u201d Squyres said. It\u2019s even possible that super-rich tourists will want to travel to Mars and back, he said.\n\nBut based on the problems that Spirit and Opportunity encountered during their longer-than-anticipated operating life on the Red Planet, plus Squyres\u2019 experience as a researcher in Antarctica and Norway\u2019s Svalbard archipelago, he isn\u2019t convinced Mars can ever be a place to raise a family.\n\n\u201cAntarctica is international territory,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to build a home, if you want to go homesteading, set up shop, build a community, build a town, nobody\u2019s going to stop you. \u2026 And yet, nobody does it. Why? Antarctica is a terrible place, it really is. And Mars is just so much worse.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that although Mars\u2019 surface temperatures can get as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the equilibrium temperature is about 80 below zero. The predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere is less than 1 percent as dense as Earth\u2019s, and the powdery rust-red dust gets everywhere.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you, when the first astronauts come back from Mars, and people say, \u2018What was it like?\u2019 \u2014 the first thing that they will say is, \u2018I hated the dust.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt was the dust that finally got to Opportunity, a little more than a year ago, when a global dust storm turned off the lights on the solar-powered robot. Spirit had frozen up years earlier \u2014 and after months of trying unsuccessfully to re-establish contact with Opportunity, Squyres and his colleagues declared an end to the marathon mission in February.\n\nAfter Opportunity; Squyres had hoped to win NASA\u2019s support for a sample return mission to a comet. But his proposal lost out in June to the Dragonfly mission to Titan, one of Saturn\u2019s moons. Then another opportunity opened up: Just last month, he left his longtime post at Cornell University to become chief scientist at Blue Origin, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 space venture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very fortunate to be in the job I\u2019m in right now,\u201d Squyres said. \u201cBlue Origin started off with rocket engines and small space vehicles, but as we\u2019re moving toward the first flight of New Glenn, as we\u2019re moving toward Blue Moon, as we\u2019re moving toward a human landing system as part of the Artemis program, and as we start to fly all kinds of payloads on even New Shepard, what we\u2019re finding at Blue Origin is that what we do begins to intersect with science in many, many different ways.\u201d\n\nAll those intersections provide opportunities for a chief scientist. For example, the New Shepard suborbital spaceship can be used to prepare the way for moon missions. \u201cWe can spin the capsule,\u201d Squyres said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do that on an upcoming flight and get simulated lunar gravity \u2014 11 rpm and you get one-sixth G.\u201d\n\nIt just so happens that Squyres\u2019 views intersect with Bezos\u2019 views when it comes to going to the moon vs. sending settlers to Mars. \u201cMy friends who say they want to move to Mars or something \u2026 I say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you live in Antarctica for a year first, because it\u2019s a garden paradise compared to Mars,\u2019 \u201d Bezos said in 2017.\n\nAnd that means Squyres\u2019 perspective runs counter to SpaceX founder Elon Musk\u2019s view that a million settlers can be transported to Martian cities, starting well before NASA\u2019s current target date of the mid-2030s for crewed exploration missions to Mars and its moons.\n\nSquyres didn\u2019t mention Musk or SpaceX, but he noted that privately held companies tend to have more leeway than government-led space programs.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very likely that sooner or later we will have a confluence of events where some organization will have both the means and the will to put humans onto the [Martian] surface, to go and stay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given the enormous diversity of human opinions and life experiences out there, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have a hard time finding not just willing people, but people who are sane and capable, and good crew members who will do their jobs to the best of their abilities.\u201d", "description": "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2014 For 15 years, planetary scientist Steve Squyres' life revolved around Mars, with good reason.
