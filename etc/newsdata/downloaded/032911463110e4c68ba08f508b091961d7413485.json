Add 2 1/2 cups boiling water, push the tamarind into the water, and let soften for 5 minutes. Break the tamarind up with a fork, and let sit another 15 minutes to soften. Mash up the tamarind again, then pour everything through a fine-mesh strainer into another mixing bowl, pressing and mashing the solids in the strainer to extract as much jammy tamarind pulp as possible. (Don\u2019t forget to scrape off the underside of the strainer, where the pulp will collect.) Whisk together the resulting tamarind sauce, then transfer to a measuring cup \u2014 you should have about 2 cups. If necessary, add water to make 2 cups.", "description": "This is the soup that made me like vegetables when I was growing up You always measure sinigang by sourness, which is so much a part of our cuisine \u2014 layers of acid coming from vinegar, fresh citrus, tamarind and unripe fruits Here, sour is a power move, hitting you all the way at the back of your tongue", "authors": ["Angela Dimayuga", "Lidey Heuck", "Colu Henry", "Sam Sifton", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Melissa Clark", "Amanda Hesser", "Julia Moskin", "Alison Roman", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex3-sinigang/merlin_160617930_eb0d7451-be2a-41c8-bd77-f51f990456e9-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
