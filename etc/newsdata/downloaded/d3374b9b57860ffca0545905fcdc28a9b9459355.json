The median monthly payment was $160, the report noted.\n\nChildcare costs can be a significant financial burden, even for those who are done with college. One month of care at a child-care center now averages about $850 and the prices keep climbing, according to one recent analysis.\n\nStudent parents accounted for 22% of the entire college student body during the 2015-2016 school year. Parents on campus are typically older, an average of 33 years old, compared to their childless counterparts, who average 24 years old. Almost three quarters (71%) of student parents are mothers, the report said.\n\nJust over half of undergraduate student parents (52%) dropped out during the 2003-2004 school year, compared to the 32% of students without kids who dropped out.\n\nThe GAO report didn\u2019t delve into why so many colleges are skipping the mention of money for childcare. But it did note that those who don\u2019t advertise the funding don\u2019t disburse many child-care allowances. GAO officials interviewed staff at seven colleges that didn\u2019t advertise. \u201cJust two of them reported that they had provided any dependent care allowances in recent years,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe watchdog office has spotted other gaps on college campuses. Earlier this year, a GAO report said approximately two million students might not be aware they\u2019re eligible for food stamps.", "description": "More than 20% of the U.S.\u2019s college students are parents.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR307_baby_c_ZG_20190913155656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
