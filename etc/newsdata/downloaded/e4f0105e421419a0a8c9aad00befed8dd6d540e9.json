But Hershey's sales volume in North America fell 0.2%.\n\nLike other food companies, Hershey needs the price hikes to offset the higher costs it faces for ingredients and shipping. Last summer, it told retailers it would raise prices on its key candy bars, mostly taking effect early next year.\n\n\"We will see an immediate drop in volume initially as consumers adjust, and they will adjust to the price point over a period of about a year,\" Chief Executive Michele Buck said in a Thursday interview. Hershey is ramping up its advertising to help drive consumer demand and awareness, she added.\n\nIt's not clear how that strategy will play out, however, partly because the company can't control what consumers pay, which is decided by retailers.\n\nNorth American retailers raised Hershey's prices by 4% on average in the latest quarter, while the prices Hershey charged them rose just 1.5%, according to the company and third-party analysts.\n\nMs. Buck said that while retailers are adding to final price tag consumers end up paying to capture higher margins themselves, she expects that gap will shrink in coming months. Hershey's pricing plans are \"exactly on track,\" she said.\n\nIf retailers continue bumping up pricing, however, the impact on sales volume in coming months could be worse, according to analysts.\n\nShares in Hershey were down 2.9% in morning trading.\n\nThe maker of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Twizzlers and Milk Duds has also acknowledged that the candy aisle is getting more crowded, and people are eating more salty snacks, driving Hershey to diversify its business. In September, Hershey bought protein-bar company One Brands.\n\nLast year, Hershey bought the owner of SkinnyPop popcorn, Amplify Snack Brands Inc., and the maker of Pirate's Booty cheese puffs.\n\n\"Having a wider portfolio...allows us to be relevant for more times during the day and for more, different consumers,\" Ms. Buck said in the interview.\n\nOn Thursday, the company reported total sales of $2.13 billion for the quarter, up about 3% from a year earlier and slightly above the average forecast of analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nHershey reported a profit of $325.3 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with $263.7 million, or $1.25 a share, the year earlier.\n\nThe company's profit, following adjustments, rose to $1.61 a share, 1 cent higher than the consensus estimate, from $1.55 a year earlier.\n\n--Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 12:13 ET (16:13 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
