He looked to be loving life as he looked on at the game, wide eyed.\n\nGaten, who quickly became one of the most beloved members of the cast, is set to go it alone with his new Netflix show Prank Encounters.\n\nIt looked to be an exciting match (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThe premise of the show, which \u2018takes two complete strangers on the surprise ride of a lifetime\u2019, was first announced back in June, but aspects of that description \u2013 namely how the two people who are pranked in each episode are apparently portrayed as jobseekers \u2013 were criticised online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the series was branded \u2018disgusting\u2019, Netflix responded to the backlash.\n\n\u2018The pranks in Prank Encounters are spooky, supernatural, and over the top, and everyone had a great time,\u2019 they told Metro.co.uk in a statement.\n\nThe Rangers scooped up the victory (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018All participants came in with the expectation this was a one-day, hourly gig and everyone got paid for their time.\u2019\n\nGaten went on to address the controversy in a video, clarifying that none of the participants in the show were \u2018promised a part-time or full time-job, and everybody was compensated\u2019.\n\nSince, the trailer for the series has dropped, showing spooked participants getting a real fright from the show\u2019s devious set-ups, including a murderous, animated teddy bear and a Freddy Krueger-type character staging a home invasion.\n\nAs for whether it\u2019ll prove the naysayers wrong, only time will tell.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
