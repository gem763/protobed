No explanation.\n\nThis could be a new relationship -- just a few dates in, or a long-standing friendship or romantic relationship. It's something that has happened since the beginning of time, but the term has gained traction in the American lexicon over the past several years -- mainly because of online dating and its predominance in our society.\n\nHere, we address seven concerns related to the act of ghosting so that you can avoid becoming a victim.\n\n1. Why do people ghost?\n\nBecause it's easier for them than handling the emotions and conflict of a tough conversation or breakup.\n\nSometimes people who ghost think it's the kinder thing to do -- until it's done to them.\n\nBut it's usually meant to avoid a potentially painful situation.\n\n2. Why is it so painful?\n\nIt's the ultimate use of the silent treatment.\n\nNot only do you have to remain silent when you're ghosted (because you've most likely been blocked on phone, text and social media) but you have no opportunity to ask questions and gain clarity.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n3. Do people ghost more now than before?\n\nGhosting is nothing new, but it's more common now because we don't feel like we have a lot to lose if we are only connected to someone digitally.\n\nIn the past, we would want to make sure we didn't burn bridges because of common friends, family members, etc.\n\n4. Are there signs to watch out for telling me that I'll be ghosted?\n\nSometimes yes, sometimes no. Some red flags that you're with a ghoster could be:\n\n- If this person has told you that they've ghosted others.\n\n- If they have a track record of ending relationships badly.\n\n- If their behavior with you is flaky and inconsistent.\n\n- If they haven't been as responsive to you as they used to be, and communication is slower/less frequent (either digitally and/or in real life).\n\n5. Sometimes there is zero warning about the impending ghosting.\n\nI've heard the craziest stories of best friends ghosting each other after eight years of constant friendship -- with not so much as an argument.\n\nWhen a person just vanishes, we are left feeling punched in the face. We worry first whether they're laying in a hospital bed unable to communicate and later, we worry what we might have done to wreck the relationship.\n\nGhosting or social rejection activates the same brain pathways as pain -- and it hurts.\n\nIt can also make you feel dumb and thinking such things as, \"How could I not see this coming? How did I think we were so much closer than we were?\"\n\nIt also leaves you hanging -- was it something you did, something you said, you have no cues or clues as to what happened -- and it can be damaging to our self-esteem.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n6. Is it ever OK to ghost?\n\nYes, if any of the following are true:\n\n- If you are afraid of the person's reaction.\n\n- If they've been abusive or violent, and you need to cut off contact.\n\n- If they can not respect boundaries that you've drawn.\n\n7. If you've been ghosted, the best thing to do is to know the following:\n\n- Being ghosted says nothing about your worthiness or ability to be a good partner or friend.\n\n- The ghoster didn't have the courage to deal with conflict and discomfort.\n\n- The ghoster wasn't capable of being in a healthy, adult relationship.\n\n- Don't shut down to all relationships because someone left. Keep your heart available and open to good people, and don't let the ghost spook you out of love or friendship.\n\nSmart Dating Academy ran a survey on social media last week, and 92% of respondents had been ghosted, and almost 66% had ghosted someone (friend or romantic partner).\n\nMost of us will ghost someone or be ghosted, and as painful as it is may be, know that it happens to everyone, and do the work to get yourself back to a positive, self-confident place again.\n\nBela Gandhi is the founder and president of the Smart Dating Academy, a coaching agency that helps clients \"make dating fun, inspiring and focused\" in their pursuit of a meaningful relationship.
