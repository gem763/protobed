The wireless industry has become increasingly promotional, and Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael is calling for 359,000 postpaid phone net additions, second only to T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS, -0.38% and up from 295,000 a year ago.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from Verizon's report:\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet project $1.24 in adjusted earnings per share for Verizon, up slightly from $1.22 in the year-earlier quarter. According to Estimize, which crowdsources projections from hedge funds, academics and others, the average estimate calls for $1.25.\n\nRevenue: The FactSet consensus models $32.7 billion in quarterly revenue for Verizon, while the Estimize consensus calls for $32.8 billion. A year prior, Verizon posted $32.6 billion in revenue for its third quarter.\n\nStock movement: Verizon\u2019s stock has gained following five of the company\u2019s past 10 earnings reports. It\u2019s up 8.3% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.17% has risen 15%. Of the 26 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Verizon, nine have buy ratings and the other 17 have hold ratings. The average price target listed is $61.33, less than 1% above recent levels.\n\nWhat else to watch for\n\nVerizon\u2019s results are expected to provide some indication of initial demand for Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL, +1.34% iPhone 11 family that launched toward the end of the third quarter. Wells Fargo\u2019s Jennifer Fritzsche is expecting \u201csolid postpaid phone volumes\u201d in part due to \u201cgross adds and upgrades\u201d for the new Apple devices, as well as due to promotional activity in August that gave more choices and line discounts to those who got unlimited plans.\n\nThough Fritzsche is looking for higher volumes, she also thinks there could be some dilution in average revenue per user as a result of some trade-downs to cheaper unlimited pricing levels. \u201cOver time, the price plans should incentivize more of the ~50% of customers on metered plans to upgrade to unlimited,\u201d wrote Fritzsche, who rates the stock at outperform with a $65 target price.\n\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey\u2019s Greg Miller believes that Verizon\u2019s recent promotions were meant to boost the company\u2019s base of unlimited subscribers ahead of the company\u2019s 5G launch. Verizon\u2019s progress with 5G may be in focus during the company\u2019s conference call amid some questions on Wall Street about its readiness for that transition, but Miller has confidence in the carrier\u2019s positioning.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that AT&T T, -1.13% is adding as much as 50% more wireless capacity in many markets under its \u2018one touch\u2019 program, we continue to believe that Verizon remains well-positioned to transition to a 5G platform generating similar share gains relative to the past,\u201d wrote Miller, who has a buy rating and $68 target on the stock. \u201cEven though fixed 5G service roll-outs are likely to happen later that initially expected, due to the equipment unavailability and continued technology hurdles, we believe the technology will prove to be sound and become a competitive differentiator for the entire industry.\u201d\n\nVerizon has been the weakest performer of the four major U.S. carriers so far in 2019, but Cowen\u2019s Synesael sees room for the company to start gaining some traction again. \u201cConsidering how much the stock has underperformed the overall market year-to-date (up 8.1% versus the S&P 500 SPX, +0.28% up 19.9%), we believe earnings could serve as a momentum catalyst into year end (despite some investors already viewing this as a crowded trade),\u201d he wrote.\n\nSynesael rates the stock at market perform with a $60 target.", "description": "Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s Friday morning earnings report comes as the company is getting more aggressive in its attempts to bring in new customers.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM341_verizo_ZG_20190627123913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
