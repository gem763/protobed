According to the latest report from the CDC, released earlier this month, STIs are at an all-time high in the United States. There are many reasons for this: people aren\u2019t using condoms, there have been loads of financial cuts to sexual health programs, and, of course, that classic gag about sex education being absolutely terrible in this country. Regardless of these contributing factors, STIs are rampant; and so perhaps it\u2019s time for us all to brief ourselves on how to politely tell a partner that you\u2019ve just been diagnosed with one.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of public health and general human decency to disclose your STI status to new partners, and there are non-awkward ways to go about this. (Also, anyone who is a jerk to you about an STI is a jerk, in general.) But recent partners also need to know if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with an STI, even if you never plan to have sex with them again.\n\nJustin Lehmiller, a research fellow with the Kinsey Institute, told VICE that the best thing is to be direct and upfront. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to do a little bit of research first, so that you understand the STI in case your partner has any questions about it,\u201d Lehmiller said. He also offered up a basic script to follow (feel free to copy/paste, this is a public service):\n\nHi, I was recently diagnosed with [INSERT STI] and my doctor thinks it\u2019s essential that my previous partners get tested for this, in the interest of protecting their health. It\u2019s possible that you may not have any symptoms, but should still be tested, to be safe.\n\nSee? Easy. It would be difficult, even, to insert assholery into this sort of simple dialogue. And yet many have tried, because\u2014thanks to previously mentioned horrible sex education, there\u2019s still a lot of undue stigma surrounding STIs.\n\nThe worst thing you can do, according to Lehmiller, is to go into the conversation like it\u2019s some sort of forensic investigation to discern the origin story of the STI, or to approach your partner with defensiveness or blame. \u201cWhen somebody contracts a cold or the flu or something like that, we don't get obsessed with figuring out who gave this to us,\u201d Lehmiller said. \u201cThe key thing is just that you share the information, not that you're figuring out who to blame for it.\u201d\n\nOn that note, here are some phrases to avoid when disclosing STI status to a former partner:\n\n\u201chey, I just tested positive for [INSERT STI]...think you may have given it to me\u201d\n\n\u201cremember me lol??? u gave me [INSERT STI], u fuck!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cHi...so i just tested positive for [INSERT STI]...i\u2019ve only had sex with like, two people without a condom in the past month and you\u2019re one of them...it could\u2019ve come from anywhere, you should probably get tested tho...because maybe...you did this to me\u201d\n\n\u201cu gave me herpes, i hate u\u201d\n\nAnd so forth. There\u2019s no need to apologize or go full whodunit; the only thing that matters, from a health perspective, is that everyone who could possibly have come in contact with the STI gets tested and treated for it, Lehmiller said. So, you know, basically just be chill about it. All adventurous blah blah, you get it. As Lehmiller said, the best thing to consider when having this conversation is basically...the golden rule: If it were you receiving this news from a former partner, how would you want to be told?\n\nFollow Hannah Smothers on Twitter.", "description": "Just be nice, but if you're nervous, here's a handy script.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db2117c040663009245d58e/lede/1571951613653-A-genderqueer-person-looking-at-their-phone.jpeg?crop=0.8465xw:0.6496xh;0.096xw,0.3395xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
