Encourage strong passwords\n\nMs Luff suggests that parents should talk to their kids about how to create a good password.\n\nShe explained: \u201cTalk to them about why it\u2019s important to develop a strong password - more than eight characters long, with a mixture of numbers and symbols, as well as upper-case and lower-case letters.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Caiaimage)\n\n\u201cIf creating, storing and remembering unique passwords becomes difficult, you can also consider using tools such as Google Password Manager or Safari\u2019s suggested password feature.\u201d\n\n2. Work on best practices as a family\n\nDiscussing best practices online as a family can be a helpful way to keep your children safe online, according to Ms Luff.\n\nShe said: \u201cAsk your children how they use passwords over multiple accounts. Let them know that using the same password to log into different websites makes each of those accounts less secure, so it\u2019s vital to create a unique password for each one.\n\n\u201cMake sure your kids are also keeping their devices safe with up-to-date security policies.\n\n\u201cBe clear on the family rules around which sites and services your kids can use. You can also use privacy controls to restrict their access to certain websites.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n3. Educate them about threats\n\nSurfing the web with your child can be a great way to show them good online safety practices, Ms Luff explained.\n\n\u201cWhile doing this, talk about which sites look trustworthy and which do not,\u201d she said. \u201cUse a browser with Safe Browsing technology that issues a warning when you attempt to access sites or software it identifies as dangerous.\n\n\u201cAnd if there is the opportunity to create a new account on a trusted website, you can also put your child\u2019s education in strong password creation to the test.\u201d\n\n4. Work on responsible social media use\n\nWith cyberbullying becoming a growing problem in the UK, it can also be helpful to work on responsible social media use with your child.\n\nMs Luff said: \u201cEncourage your children to speak up against, and report, online bullying if they witness or experience it, and also to be aware of when their own actions could be harmful to others.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Google has issued several tips for parents to keep their children safe online during the half-term holiday", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty Images Caiaimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16523336.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Female-teenager-using-digital-tablet-at-night.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
