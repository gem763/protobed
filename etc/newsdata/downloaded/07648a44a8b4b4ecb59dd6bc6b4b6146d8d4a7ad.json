Bernie Sanders proposed a tax on the wealthiest Americans on Tuesday as way to help underwrite his slate of ambitious \u2014 and costly \u2014 policies, offering his own version of an idea one of his toughest rivals has campaigned on aggressively and pushing it further.\n\nSanders, a presidential candidate and independent senator from Vermont, offered his blueprint after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has surged in the polls, made a wealth tax one of her signature ideas. Her crowds regularly chant \u201ctwo cents!\u201d at her rallies when she brings up the idea, a reference to how much the wealthy would have to pay on the dollar.\n\nSanders\u2019s proposed wealth tax is more aggressive than Warren\u2019s and would raise more money. Warren\u2019s plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion. The relatively high threshold has helped Warren fend off critiques that large farms could be exposed to the tax.\n\nSanders would hit more people with the tax and would also significantly increase how much it would take from the very wealthiest, following a pattern in which he has sought to stake out the leftward boundary of the Democratic Party when it comes to policy proposals.\n\nSanders\u2019s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million, and then increases that rate in a series of steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders plans to conclude a two-day swing through Iowa counties that Barack Obama won and then went for Donald Trump. He\u2019s dubbed the trip his \u201cBernie beats Trump\u201d tour, presenting himself as the most electable Democratic candidate against the president.\n\nBut Sanders has struggled to recapture the magic of his near-win in this first caucus state in 2016. A recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren leading with 22 percent. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, and Sanders was running third at 11 percent.\n\nSanders and Warren have been battling for supremacy in the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing, issuing dueling proposals on a number of topics that would reshape the nation\u2019s safety net and significantly expand the role of government.\n\nTheir proposals include making public colleges and universities tuition-free, wiping away much or all of the student loan debt in the country, and enacting a Medicare-for-all health-care system.\n\nThe plans are estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars, raising questions about how they would be paid for. Warren for months has pointed to her wealth tax, and Sanders\u2019s new proposal gives him a similar revenue source to cite.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that Warren or Sanders, if elected, could push such a far-reaching new tax through Congress.\n\nWhen it comes to wealth taxes, the impact on the nation\u2019s biggest fortunes would be profound. Bill Gates, estimated to have $107 billion in wealth, would under Sanders\u2019s plan pay at least an additional $8 billion annually to the federal government. Sanders\u2019s campaign says the wealth of billionaires would be halved under his proposal.\n\nThe plan to tax the wealthy could pay for some of Sanders\u2019s plans but fall short of covering other parts of his agenda. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California at Berkeley estimate Sanders\u2019s plan would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, although conservatives have said such estimates overstate how much can be raised through a wealth tax.\n\nSanders has unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to end homelessness and create 10 million new housing units and a $1.7 trillion plan to cancel all student debt in the United States; those two initiatives alone would come close to eating up the money raised by the wealth tax.\n\nThe senator has also proposed a $30 trillion Medicare-for-all health-care system that would eliminate families\u2019 health-care spending, which Sanders has said would be paid for with higher middle-class taxes.", "description": "Sen.
