Due diligence and legal documentation on the Universal sale is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, Vivendi added.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by David Goodman)", "description": "Shares in French media group Vivendi  jumped on Friday after it posted higher third-quarter revenue and said that a potential sale of a stake in its Universal Music Group (UMG) was attracting buyer interest.
