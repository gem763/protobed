Last year, prosecutors said they would spare Flynn any jail time, citing his extensive cooperation. But on Tuesday, Justice Department attorney Brandon Van Grack said the government intended to file a new sentencing memo for Flynn, suggesting the government may reverse course from its leniency recommendation.\n\nEven as Judge Emmet G. Sullivan set a tentative date of Dec. 18 for Flynn to bring \u201cfinality\u201d to the case, Ms. Powell argued there were too many unresolved issues.\n\n\u201cThere is far more at stake here than sentencing,\u201d she told the court. \u201cAs new counsel, we have an ethical obligation to review everything that has happened or has not happened as the case may be.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ms. Powell said she was not asking to have Flynn\u2019s guilty plea tossed, she claimed \u201cthe entire prosecution should be dismissed\u201d because of \u201cegregious\u201d government misconduct and suppression of evidence.\n\nDespite numerous claims the government is withholding evidence, Ms. Powell did not disclose Tuesday which documents she is seeking or what she thinks they will reveal. She did cryptically claim there is a January 2017 internal Justice Department memo that \u201cexonerates\u201d Flynn of being a Russian agent.\n\nMr. Van Grack countered that Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his communications with the Russian ambassador, not being a Russian agent.\n\nMs. Powell continued, ticking off a vague list of material she claimed could prove Flynn\u2019s innocence, including an unnamed document in the FBI\u2019s computer system and a polygraph test.\n\n\u201cThere is just a plethora of information out there that we need the actual documents to support and the notes to support,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Van Grack emphatically rejected Ms. Powell\u2019s claim of legal shenanigans. He told the court the government \u201cexceeded\u201d its discovery obligations, providing Flynn with more than 22,000 pages of documents. The documents sought by Ms. Powell are irrelevant or had already been disclosed to Flynn ahead of his December 2017 guilty plea, he said.\n\nJudge Sullivan asked both sides to file briefs on the materials Ms. Powell is seeking, setting a deadline of Oct. 15.\n\nThe Dec. 18 sentencing date comes on the first anniversary of Flynn\u2019s previously scheduled sentencing. He abruptly requested to postpone sentencing after a very public rebuke by Judge Sullivan. At the time his lawyers said the delay was necessary so he could continue to cooperate with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team\n\nFlynn\u2019s cooperation continued this summer when he was set to testify against his former business associate who was convicted of illegally lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government. But days before the trial was set to begin, prosecutors decided not to call Flynn, labeling him a co-conspirator.\n\nMs. Powell pushed back against the claim, accusing the government of being \u201cdisingenuous\u201d in a court filing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
