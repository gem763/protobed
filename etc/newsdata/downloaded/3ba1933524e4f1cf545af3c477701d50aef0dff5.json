(AP) - Charlie Brewer completed 13 of 17 passes for 312 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score and No. 18 Baylor beat Oklahoma State 45-27 on Saturday to extend its school-record winning streak to nine games.\n\nJaMycal Hasty rushed for 139 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries and had 66 yards on three receptions for Baylor (7-0, 4-0 Big 12).\n\nJosh Fleeks added three receptions for 126 yards and a touchdown, and the Bears had 536 yards of total offense.\n\nChuba Hubbard, the nation\u2019s leading rusher, ran for 171 yards and two touchdowns on 32 carries for Oklahoma State (4-3, 1-3 Big 12). Spencer Sanders threw for 157 yards and a touchdown on 18-of-32 passing, along with one interception.\n\nAfter Hubbard\u2019s backup, L.D. Brown, scored on a 68-yard touchdown run 2:05 into the fourth quarter, Oklahoma State led 27-24. Baylor responded with 21 straight points, starting with Brewer\u2019s 2-yard run that made it 31-27 with 9:04 remaining.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nBaylor: After scoring a touchdown on their first possession of the game, needing just three plays to go 62 yards and take a 7-0 lead, the Bears didn\u2019t score again until John Mayers\u2019 28-yard field goal with 1:32 left in the second quarter. That pulled Baylor to 13-10 going into halftime. With 213 yards of total offense, Baylor ran 26 total offensive plays in the first half, 19 of which were runs. In the third quarter, though, the Bears broke through to gain 198 yards and scored 14 points to regain the lead, throwing seven times and running nine. Overall, Baylor rushed 37 times to 17 pass attempts.\n\nOklahoma State: After committing five turnovers (three interceptions, two lost fumbles) in the Cowboys\u2019 previous game, a 45-35 loss to Texas Tech on Oct. 5, Sanders turned the ball over three times, including two costly fumbles in the fourth quarter. With eight minutes remaining and Oklahoma State trailing 31-27, Sanders dropped back to pass and had to scramble a bit when Baylor\u2019s Chidi Ogbennaya punched the ball loose and Terrel Bernard scooped it up and ran 20 yards for a touchdown that put the Bears up 38-27. Then, trailing 45-27 with 3:25 left, Sanders lost the ball after he was hit by Baylor\u2019s Jordan Williams, who then recovered the loose ball to seal the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBaylor: After an off week, the Bears host West Virginia on Thursday, Oct. 31.\n\nOklahoma State: At Iowa State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Charlie Brewer completed 13 of 17 passes for 312 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score and No. 18 Baylor beat Oklahoma State 45-27 on Saturday to extend its school-record winning streak to nine games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Tranchina"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/baylor_oklahoma_st_football_42721_c0-819-2685-2385_s1200x700.jpg?b9ececaf02573ff6fb8e999b0fff689ac31ca4f9", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
