He is 5-8 in 22 starts with a 4.99 ERA this season and has dealt with knee trouble.\n\nSabathia has said this will be his last year playing in the majors.\n\nThe Yankees are still figuring out their rotation for the postseason, which begins Oct. 4 with the best-of-five Division Series. Masahiro Tanaka, James Paxson, J.A. Happ and Luis Severino are among the candidates to start.\n\nSeverino came back from a lat injury and made his season debut with four shutout innings in a start Tuesday. Domingo Germ\u00e1n, the team\u2019s top winner at 18-4, was put on administrative leave Thursday under Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy and his status for the postseason is uncertain.\n\nBoone said he anticipates using Sabathia in a controlled setting next week at Tampa Bay. If that goes well, Boone said he would try it \u201ca little more on the fly\u201d next weekend at Texas. Boone envisions a \u201csignificant role\u201d for Sabathia in the postseason.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we want to do this a couple of times. He\u2019s certainly on board with it and wants to do it,\u201d Boone said.\n\n\u201cI feel like for obviously as much as he has to deal with the knee, I feel like he\u2019s in at least a pretty good place right now to be able to do it,\u201d Boone said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia is getting set to close his career as a reliever.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/angels_yankees_baseball_16618_c0-160-3814-2383_s1770x1032.jpg?4a920a9724f3aa2c815110b9689d6c798dcbb704", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
