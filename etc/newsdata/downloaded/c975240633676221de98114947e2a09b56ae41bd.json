Now, CNN says it will not run the ad on its network due to factual inaccuracies.\n\nThe ad says that Biden promised money to Ukraine in exchange for firing a prosecutor that was looking into a Ukrainian gas company with ties to his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,\" the ad begins.\n\nExplainer: What really happened when Biden forced out Ukraine's top prosecutor\n\nIn fact, the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was considered by the United States, European diplomats and other internationalgroups to be ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThere is no credible evidence for the assertion that the ouster of the prosecutor was intended to benefit Hunter Biden.Shokin's inquiry into the gas company focused on a time period before Hunter Biden joined the company, according to a Ukrainian anti-corruption watchdog.\n\nMore: A visual timeline of the events that led up to Trump's fateful phone call\n\nHouse Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry last week after learning about a whistleblower complaint alleging Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate Biden.\n\nThe ad alsoincludesan accusation that the news media has taken sides with the Democrats' agenda to impeach the president.\n\n\"And their media lapdogs fall in line,\" the ad sayswhile displaying shots of CNN's Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Jim Acosta as well asMSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\nI AM DRAINING THE SWAMP! pic.twitter.com/U7WxKrO6Kx Donald J.

In May 2017, just a few months into Trump's presidency, CNN rejected an ad about Trump's first 100 days in office, calling it \"false\" for calling the mainstream media \"fake news.\"\n\nAt the time, the campaign called CNN's decision \"shameful.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump Ukraine-Biden ad will not appear on CNN due to misleading claim", "description": "A CNN spokesperson said that the Trump campaign ad attacking Biden does not meet its advertising standards because it includes \"demonstrably false\" claims.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_faCXBjkat2DT_aTD1alKw--~B/aD00MTAxO3c9NjE1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/977c51a17ec6b5d1b2886c7c1b5a8f6d", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
