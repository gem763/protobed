Where is China?\" Attendees at a plenary meeting of the weeklong congress brought the question to the top of the panel voting system and demanded an answer.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, US Vice-President Mike Pence claimed that his country would only \"work closely with likeminded, freedom-loving nations, as we lead mankind into the final frontier.\"\n\nHis politicized remarks triggered aversion from the audience as about 200 people from the US astronautical community signed a letter condemning Pence, whose inclusion, they said, was at odds with the congress's mission of global collaboration.\n\nThe visa problem encountered by the Chinese delegation is only the \"tip of an iceberg\", Hua said.\n\nFor quite a while, she noted, the US has been denying visas, delaying the processing of visa applications and revoking long-term visas for Chinese scholars, students, entrepreneurs and scientists and even searching and harassing them.\n\nSuch moves have thwarted normal people-to-people exchange between China and the US and infringed upon the safety and lawful rights and interests of the Chinese personnel involved, she said.\n\nThe US has repeatedly disregarded international obligations and disrupted normal international exchanges, Hua said, asking Washington to sincerely reflect on and earnestly correct its wrongdoing.\n\nXinhua contributed to this story.", "description": "The Foreign Ministry confirmed on Wednesday that the Chinese delegation's absence at the International Astronautical Congress in Washington is due to visa problems, urging the United States not to \"weaponize\" visas to hinder normal international cooperation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db082bfa310cf3e97a2a3ff.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
