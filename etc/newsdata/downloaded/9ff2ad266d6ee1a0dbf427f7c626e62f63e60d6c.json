Join the conversation below.\n\nThat is because part of the recent fall in bond yields\u2014which drives bond prices higher\u2014has been caused by banks, insurers and other investors essentially buying on autopilot, scooping up more bonds because that\u2019s what their pre-existing risk models and investment-hedging strategies tell them to do.\n\n\u201cThere was a fundamental driver to this move in yields and that continues to be validated by economic data and the Fed,\u201d said Josh Younger, head of U.S. interest rates derivatives strategy at JPMorgan in New York.\n\n\u201cBut the signals provided by the rates markets are being amplified by this hedging activity.\u201d\n\nThe strong rally in long bonds such as the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and the 30-year bond has made them among the best performing assets of any market in the world this year.\n\nThey also caused dreaded inversions of the U.S. yield curve in August, most notably one where the 10-year yield falls below the two-year yield, a warning that a recession may be around the corner.\n\nStill, less than half the fall in 10-year yields during August\u2014the biggest monthly drop in percentage point terms since 2011\u2014came down to economic reasons, according to Mr. Younger.\n\nHe figures the recent 10-year Treasury yield of 1.5% is about 0.25 percentage point below where it would be without hedging activity, sometimes called \u201cforced buying.\u201d\n\nOne giveaway that the hedging activity has been important in recent market moves is that yields in a part of the derivatives market where hedging is done have fallen faster than those on bonds, according to Mr. Younger.\n\nHere\u2019s how one prominent hedge works for bond investors. Falling rates lead to a wave of Americans refinancing home loans. That means mortgage-backed bonds get paid off quicker than expected.\n\nInstitutions who owned those mortgage bonds\u2014banks, mortgage real-estate investment trusts and fund managers, for example\u2014are then pushed into buying longer-dated Treasurys or interest-rate swaps as the quickest and cheapest way to replace the income that disappeared with the now paid-off mortgage-backed bond.\n\nBuying also comes from pension funds and insurers that sell annuities.\n\nWhen yields fall, their liabilities often grow faster than their assets. That can increase the shortfall between what they are going to earn on their assets and what they owe to pensioners, also known as the \u201cduration gap.\u201d To close the gap, these businesses need more long-term assets such as longer-dated Treasurys.\n\nBets on low volatility in the bond options and futures markets\u2014a trade popular among more flexible, or \u201cunconstrained,\u201d bond funds\u2014can also produce demand for long dated bonds when volatility spikes.\n\nThese trades rely on volatility and yields remaining within a limited range. When yields break lower, as they have recently, investors need to rebuild their long-term exposure quickly and rush into government bonds or related swap markets to do so, says James McAlevey, head of rates at Aviva Investors in London.\n\nBets on low volatility in the bond options and futures markets can produce extreme demand for long dated bonds when volatility spikes.

Hedging activity linked to volatility strategies can also create forced sellers when yields start to rise.\n\n\u201cGamma hedging works both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s going on is just going to lead to higher volatility.\u201d\n\nThe upshot is that without these flows, the U.S. yield curve wouldn\u2019t have inverted and there would be much less fevered chatter about a coming recession.\n\n\u201cThe flattening of the [yield] curves has been exacerbated by these flows,\u201d said Stefano Di Domizio, head of fixed-income strategy at Absolute Strategy Research.\n\nTo be sure, all this hedging activity might have helped yields in the U.S. and Europe to fall more quickly to a level where they will eventually deserve to be.\n\nIn \u201cthe middle of August, it\u2019s quiet, so moves get exaggerated,\u201d says Helen Anthony, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. \u201cWe were expecting this to play out over much longer than just\u201d August.\n\nWrite to Paul J.
