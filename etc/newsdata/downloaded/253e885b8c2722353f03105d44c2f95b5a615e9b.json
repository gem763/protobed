Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016, but there were concerns that the president\u2019s flagging popularity in the suburbs could hurt Bishop. Polling had shown a tight race and millions poured into the state, making it one of the most expensive House races in history.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left,\u201d said Trump at the rally Monday night in Fayetteville, predicting rampant socialism, open borders and crime under Democrats. Trump\u2019s previous visit to the state in July was marked by chants of \u201cSend her back!\u201d when he attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a Somali immigrant.\n\nBishop is a state senator who gained notoriety for sponsoring the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which removed anti-discrimination protections for transgendered people. He prevailed over McCready in a district that includes parts of the Charlotte suburbs and more rural areas along the South Carolina border. McCready, who started a solar energy investment company, had run a centrist campaign and came out against impeaching Trump.\n\nThe special election was necessary after the results of the November 2018 race between McCready and Republican Mark Harris, who defeated sitting Rep. Robert Pittenger in the GOP primary, were invalidated. Harris was initially declared the winner by 905 votes, but the race was never certified, as evidence began to surface of ballot fraud by employees of the Harris campaign. Republicans initially objected that Democrats were trying to steal the election, but during a February hearing by the board even Harris said there should be another election.\n\n\u201cThrough the testimony I\u2019ve listened to over the last three days, I believe a new election should be called,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cIt has become clear to me that the public\u2019s confidence in the Ninth District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted.\u201d\n\nDuring that hearing, operatives explained how they were paid to collect absentee ballots, sign as a witness when they hadn\u2019t seen ballots filled out and forge signatures. Harris, a former senior pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charlotte with controversial social views, opted not to run in the special election, citing health concerns. Harris consultant Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr. and seven alleged co-conspirators have been indicted on multiple felony charges.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Trump had campaigned in the state on behalf of the Republican in a special election seen as a test leading into his 2020 reelection campaign.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HMAWCldFfAtLPEpv_OBVeQ--~B/aD0yNTEwO3c9NDMxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a7020570-d43a-11e9-bf7f-caaa003a42ff", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
