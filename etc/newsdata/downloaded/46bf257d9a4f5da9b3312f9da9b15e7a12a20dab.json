The opening goal had come against the run of play but when Dani Ceballos dispossessed Will Hughes in front of the dugouts, the Gunners struck with speed and precision.\n\nSead Kolasinac collected the loose ball, drove to the edge of the area and slipped a pass to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The striker took a touch and pirouetted with exquisite grace before placing the ball into the net.\n\nConviction drained from the home side, who had been aggressive, sharp and dangerous in the opening 21 minutes. Quique Sanchez Flores must have groaned. This was the Arsenal he remembered from his previous Premier League experience in 2015-16, when Watford shipped seven goals against the Gunners, losing 3-0 at home and 4-0 at the Emirates.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe next 15 minutes seemed to confirm that impression. As Sanchez Flores\u2019 team dropped ever deeper, Emery\u2019s men began to enjoy themselves. Mesut Ozil, making his first league appearance of the season, began to find space. Arsenal strung together 18 passes to get the ball to the German and the next one carved open the left side of Watford\u2019s defence. Ainsley Maitland-Niles overlapped and sent in a cross that Aubameyang put away with style. After 32 minutes the natural order seemed to have asserted itself. \u201cThe first half after the goal was difficult for us,\u201d Sanchez Flores said. \u201cWe were not ready to receive these kicks to our brain.\u201d\n\nThere are few better sides to watch when things are going their way than Arsenal. Perhaps, though, Sanchez Flores recalled an FA Cup sixth round tie at the Emirates when Watford won 2-1. That match came between the home and away games against Barcelona in the Champions League, a 23-day period when Arsenal\u2019s season self-destructed with five successive defeats.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham.

Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe.

If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell.

Getty Images\n\nThat was under Arsene Wenger but an aversion to pressure has been institutionalised at the Emirates. Let them play, they will kill you. Challenge them and, all too often, Arsenal fade. They had been sloppy and aimless before the goals. \u201cI reminded the team of how we played in the first 15-20 minutes,\u201d Sanchez Flores said of his half-time message.\n\nAll Arsenal\u2019s problems were highlighted in the second period. In truth, they were only good in the first 45 minutes when Watford surrendered territory and impetus.\n\nEmery started the game with what appeared to be a midfield diamond but there was nothing precious about it. It was hard to discern any kind of shape. Matteo Guendouzi, in particular, kept popping up in strange positions. The 20-year-old is admired for his effort and engine but his performance was scatterbrained. Just after the second goal he popped up on the edge of his own area to take the ball from Bernd Leno but the pass was not crisp enough and Guendouzi was dozing. Gerard Deulofeu and Andre Gray could not convert the resulting chances but it was one of those moments when you could feel the conviction swelling in the Watford side.\n\nAfter the break the balance of belief had clearly shifted. Guendouzi, \u2018helping\u2019 his defence, found Hughes in the area but the Watford man blasted over. The visiting side were ragged.\n\nCeballos, Granit Xhaka and Guendouzi did not establish any sort of pattern. Ozil, when he did anything, did his own thing. Yet when Arsenal unravelled, it was the defence that took centre stage.\n\nEmery\u2019s team are not equipped to play the ball out from the back but you can see his logic. \u201cIf we can break their pressing,\u201d the manager said, \u201cwe can connect with our midfielders and have space to continue to impose our gameplan.\u201d When Leno rolled a goal kick to Sokratis Papastathopoulos the only thing that broke was Arsenal\u2019s resistance. Again, the pass from defence had no pace. Deulofeu could not believe his luck and deflected the ball to Tom Cleverley, who steered it into the net. It was an entirely self-inflicted wound.\n\nThe Arsenal manager\u2019s response was to change the structure of his midfield from shapeless to amorphous. Joe Willock replaced Ceballos to the shock of the crowd. It was, Emery reasoned, \u201cvery hot.\u201d The Spaniard did not appear to be suffering in the heat. He was much the coolest of the midfielders. Lucas Torreira came on for Guendouzi who, with a lack of self-awareness, made a 2-1 gesture to Watford fans. That hubris is emblematic of attitudes at the Emirates. \u201cMatteo is young and very emotional,\u201d Emery said. \u201cSometimes he needs to make mistakes to improve.\u201d There is another tradition at the Emirates, stretching back to Wenger, of players not being held to account for their blunders.\n\nGuendouzi was soon to feel silly, though not quite as abashed as David Luiz. The Brazilian met the onrushing Roberto Pereyra just inside the box with an awkward lunge that was clearly a penalty. Pereyra, on as a substitute, rammed home the spot-kick to level the scores.\n\nThere were nine minutes left and Arsenal hung on for dear life. Deulofeu, having one of his more effective days, carved out chance after chance. The best opportunity came at the end when Abdoulaye Doucoure shot at Leno from the edge of the six-yard box. Watford had 31 shots on goal. Aubameyang, watching from the other end, could only dream about such service.\n\nSanchez Flores was content afterwards. He has enough talent at his disposal to ensure that he can survive more than a season this time around, even given Watford\u2019s perverse attitude to employing managers.\n\nEmery has bigger problems. Xhaka claimed some of his team-mates were hiding in the second half. \u201cWe were too scared,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wanted the ball.\u201d The Swiss had a point.\n\nArsenal were disjointed. Their attitude was wrong. All the problems that Emery was brought in to address remain, despite spending more than \u00a3200 million. No one expects miracles but a semblance of organisation and a sense of purpose would buy the 47-year-old some credit.
