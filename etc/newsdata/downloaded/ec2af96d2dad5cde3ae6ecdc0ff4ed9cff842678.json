For the year-to-date, the category has garnered more than $319 billion in new inflows.\n\nWorld stock funds, meanwhile, posted a three-week losing streak by dropping another $1.8 billion in outflows. That sent the year to date loss for the category to $37.9 billion.", "description": "Investors retreat from U.S. stock funds amid impeachment inquiry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF911BB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
