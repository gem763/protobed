She sent Mark immediately to the local hospital\u2019s critical care unit.\n\nA team was waiting for him and he was put on an antibiotic drip while they waited for the results of blood tests to find out what type of infection he had.\n\nWhen Mark, pictured now, left hospital in February 2015, he was extremely weak and tired. His joints were painful, and he couldn\u2019t work full-time for four months\n\nMark spent the next three days in hospital, in a delirious state, as his body tried to fight off the infection.\n\n\u2018My joints were swollen, I was confused and felt very wobbly,\u2019 Mark recalls. \u2018I was on so many painkillers and antibiotics I felt completely spaced out.\u2019\n\nAfter three days he was diagnosed with a streptococcus infection. \u2018I have no idea where it originated but I had scratched myself while gardening and streptococcus is found in soil,\u2019 he says. \u2018I was given different antibiotics, and after five days I was discharged.\u2019\n\nAt the time, no one mentioned to Mark that the cause of his symptoms was sepsis, a life-threatening condition where the body\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive in response to an infection, resulting in tissue damage and, in severe cases, organ failure and death.\n\nThere are around 250,000 cases of sepsis a year in the UK, and 52,000 people die from it.\n\nSarah McCandless, 41,pictured, who lives in Hayes, Kent, was in hospital for nine days after sepsis took hold. She was later told the condition may have caused a heart problem\n\nSymptoms include uncontrollable shivering, a high temperature, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nThanks to an awareness campaign, which the Mail has championed, more people are now surviving as symptoms are diagnosed and treated earlier.\n\nHowever, the lack of information meant that Mark was unprepared for the devastating after-effects. When he left hospital in February 2015, he was extremely weak and tired. His joints were painful, and he couldn\u2019t work full-time for four months.\n\nWHAT IS SEPSIS? Sepsis occurs when the body reacts to an infection by attacking its own organs and tissues. Some 44,000 people die from sepsis every year in the UK. Worldwide, someone dies from the condition every 3.5 seconds. Sepsis has similar symptoms to flu, gastroenteritis and a chest infection. These include: S lurred speech or confusion\n\nlurred speech or confusion E xtreme shivering or muscle pain\n\nxtreme shivering or muscle pain P assing no urine in a day\n\nassing no urine in a day S evere breathlessness\n\nevere breathlessness I t feels like you are dying\n\nt feels like you are dying S kin mottled or discoloured Symptoms in children are: Fast breathing\n\nFits or convulsions\n\nMottled, bluish or pale skin\n\nRashes that do not fade when pressed\n\nLethargy\n\nFeeling abnormally cold Under fives may be vomiting repeatedly, not feeding or not urinating for 12 hours. Anyone can develop sepsis but it is most common in people who have recently had surgery, have a urinary catheter or have stayed in hospital for a long time. Other at-risk people include those with weak immune systems, chemotherapy patients, pregnant women, the elderly and the very young. Treatment varies depending on the site of the infection but involves antibiotics, IV fluids and oxygen, if necessary.

I wondered if I was losing it.\u2019\n\nIn fact, Mark was suffering from post sepsis syndrome (PSS), a collection of symptoms that affects around a third of sepsis survivors. Symptoms include memory and cognitive problems, depression, lethargy, chest pain, insomnia, dry skin and nails, poor appetite and excessive sweating.\n\n\u2018Sepsis is a whole body attack and all the organs are affected, which is why PSS symptoms are so wide-ranging,\u2019 explains Dr Ron Daniels, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Birmingham University Hospitals Trust and chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust charity.\n\nYet many patients are not being warned of PSS or offered the support they need to deal with the long-term side-effects.\n\n\u2018We need better education for GPs, pharmacists and community nurses because they are the professionals who see people with symptoms afterwards in the community,\u2019 says Dr Daniels.\n\n\u2018We need more rehabilitation, including physiotherapy, nutritional advice and counselling, and a national register of sepsis survivors to find out what the long-term effects are.\n\n\u2018There is no NHS resource for providing rehabilitation to sepsis survivors and this has to change.\u2019\n\nSix months after his hospital stay, Mark contacted the Sepsis Trust for advice.\n\n\u2018It was only then that I became aware of post sepsis syndrome,\u2019 says Mark. \u2018Yet according to experts, there could be in excess of a million sepsis survivors in the UK who have this.\u2019\n\nSurvivors often have to deal with serious long-term symptoms alone, says Larry Matthews, a former intensive care nurse and support adviser for the charity.\n\n\u2018Sometimes, they are unaware they are even connected to sepsis and lots of doctors don\u2019t recognise PSS,\u2019 he says.\n\nWhile the symptoms of PSS can be varied, 71 per cent of those affected experience significant fatigue. Other common symptoms include muscle and joint pain.\n\nSix months after his hospital stay Mark, pictured now, contacted the Sepsis Trust for advice and was told about post sepsis syndrome\n\n\u2018It typically lasts 12 to 18 months, but some patients may be left with a degree of permanent impairment, such as difficulty exercising as they did before,\u2019 says Dr Daniels.\n\n\u2018The cause is not fully understood. Nerve damage which causes muscle weakness and pain in the limbs is thought to be caused by poor blood flow to the area affected, and memory problems are caused by nerve damage in brain tissue.\u2019\n\nAlthough Mark saw his GP many times for joint pain and fatigue, she treated these symptoms individually, rather than recognising they could be linked.\n\nSarah, pictured now, said it took nine months to 'get back to normal' after she had sepsis\n\n\u2018Just knowing that this is a recognised syndrome would have really helped as I wondered why I had so many things wrong with me,\u2019 he says. \u2018After two years, I was still struggling with memory problems, joint pain and fatigue, which made me feel depressed.\u2019\n\nLarry Matthews says Mark\u2019s experience is not uncommon.\n\n\u2018Patients with PSS can go into a spiral of health decline, suffering from fatigue, pain and reduced mobility, yet 70 per cent are given no information about PSS on discharge and they wonder why all these things are happening to them,\u2019 he says.\u2019 It helps them to know this is a syndrome.\u2019\n\nThis was the experience of Sarah McCandless, 41, who developed sepsis in February 2017. Sarah, who lives in Hayes, Kent, with her husband Chris, an accountant, and their children Harry, 12 and Freya, ten, was in hospital for nine days after sepsis took hold.\n\nShe was later told the condition may have caused a heart problem.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t have any heart symptoms while I was in hospital, but an MRI scan two weeks later showed I had heart damage as a result of the infection,\u2019 says Sarah. \u2018I was told that I\u2019d have to take medication for the rest of my life.\u2019\n\nSarah had also developed \u2018red skin \u2014 like a bad case of sunburn\u2019 in hospital and at home it started to shed and peel off from her hands, feet and body, and she was terribly fatigued.\n\n\u2018For the first few weeks, I could only lie in bed or on the sofa,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018Even after that, a short walk left me wiped out. I\u2019d get up and do what I had to do, but I\u2019d be in bed some days by 8pm because I was so exhausted.\n\n\u2018It took nine months to get back to normal. My muscles were sore, too, and I had some mental fogginess, which wasn\u2019t like me. I also lost 70 per cent of my hair.\u2019\n\nSarah eventually found out about PSS by contacting the UK Sepsis Trust a few weeks after she was discharged from hospital.\n\n\u2018I went to a sepsis survivors group four months after my hospital stay and it was a revelation that all these other people had experienced similar symptoms to me. I felt relieved that I wasn\u2019t alone in taking a long time to recover.\u2019\n\nTo help sepsis survivors through PSS, the charity runs a helpline for survivors, as well as 31 support groups around the country. It has also produced a PSS leaflet which it wants handed out to patients on discharge from hospital.\n\nFour years on, Mark is still suffering from pain in his wrists, hips, ankles and shoulder and is now being investigated for nerve damage. \u2018Sepsis has left me with significant long-term health problems,\u2019 says Mark.\n\nsepsistrust.org", "description": "Mark Stock, 56, from Bedford, was seriously\u00a0ill with a streptococcus infection in 2015.
