This is a great situation to keep his numbers shiny, facing a Baltimore offense that ranks 23rd in wRC+ and 20th against left-handed pitching. Yarbrough checks in as a strong -270 home favorite as a result, and I\u2019m expecting a quality start to go along with the victory this afternoon.\n\nAlso Consider: Kyle Hendricks, Mike Soroka\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nJi-Man Choi - Tampa Bay (vs. Baltimore)\n\nStory continues\n\nDon\u2019t forget about the Tampa offense either, as they\u2019ll step into an encouraging draw against Asher Wojciechowski and the generous Orioles\u2019 bullpen. Wojciechowski carries a vulnerable .389 wOBA split to left-handed bats, which feeds into Choi\u2019s wheelhouse. The lefty first baseman has picked things up lately with eight hits, two homers, six runs, and five RBIs over his last four starts.\n\nAlso Consider: Freddie Freeman, C.J. Cron\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nAddison Russell - Chicago Cubs (vs. Seattle)\n\nThe Cubbies hold the highest scoring projection of this slate, and it\u2019s easy to visualize that against Seattle LHP Justus Sheffield - who has allowed 10 earned runs across 11.1 innings through three major league appearances. This sets up for the Cubs to jump all over him, and Russell is a strong candidate to get in on the action alongside Kris Bryant, Javier Baez (if playing), Anthony Rizzo, and Nicholas Castellanos (more on him later).\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies, Kolten Wong\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJosh Donaldson - Atlanta (vs. Toronto)\n\nI just mentioned how the Cubs represent the highest scoring projection of this slate; well, the Braves aren\u2019t far behind in that regard. They\u2019ll face Toronto RHP Jacob Waguespack\u2019s .368 wOBA split to RHB followed by a non-imposing Jays\u2019 bullpen. Donaldson checks in with a mid-range salary while looking like a strong fantasy candidate in this draw.\n\nAlso consider: Kris Bryant, Joey Wendle (punt)\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nDansby Swanson - Atlanta (vs. Toronto)\n\nTake the previous write-up of Donaldson and directly apply it to Swanson. Dansby recently came off the injured list, getting back into the thick of things with two hits and three RBIs over his last two games. A breakout fantasy performance looms, and it could certainly come to fruition this afternoon.\n\nAlso Consider: Jorge Polanco, Javier Baez (if playing)\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nEddie Rosario - Minnesota (at Detroit)\n\nIt\u2019s pretty crazy that it took this long to mention Minnesota\u2019s \u201cBomba Squad\u201d, but there are plenty of well-aligned offenses to target on this afternoon slate (CHC, ATL, TB). Rosario is my favorite candidate to add to the Twins\u2019 record-setting home run total while facing the generosity of Detroit RHP Jordan Zimmermann (.354 wOBA vs. LHB).\n\nNicholas Castellanos - Chicago Cubs (vs. Seattle)\n\nCastellanos checks in as a strong mid-range outfielder who will benefit from the aforementioned draw against Seattle LHP Sheffield. It\u2019s worth selecting several Cubbies in your lineups this afternoon, and Castellanos is one of my favorites in terms of price and expected production.\n\nAlso consider: Ronald Acuna, Bryce Harper, Austin Meadows, Corey Dickerson, Dexter Fowler, Jake Cave, Matt Joyce", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the main afternoon slate (1:05 ET) on Monday, September 2.
