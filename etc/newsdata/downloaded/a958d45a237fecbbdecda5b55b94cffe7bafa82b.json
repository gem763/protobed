There was no indication of any preconditions set by either side.\n\nThe news sent Asian stocks soaring again, with the Japanese rising 2.3% and the adding 1.0%. European bourses also gained, as the news outweighed a bigger-than-expected drop in manufacturing orders in Germany in July, putting Europe\u2019s largest economy on course for another quarter of economic contraction.\n\nBy 6 AM ET, were trading up 245 points or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was also up 0.9% and the Nasdaq futures contract was up 1.2%.\n\nSterling rises as lawmakers block \u2018No-Deal\u2019 Brexit\n\nSterling rose against the and for a second straight day after the U.K. House of Commons voted to stop the country leaving the EU without a transitional deal on Oct. 31.\n\nIn an obvious prelude to a snap election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to hold a series of speeches blaming recalcitrant Members of Parliament for stopping him implementing the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe House of Commons blocked Johnson\u2019s attempt to dissolve parliament and call a General Election last night, but the opposition has signaled it will allow an election, once the bill preventing a No Deal Brexit is officially in force. That could be as early as Friday.\n\nPayrolls rehearsal tops heavy data schedule\n\nThe report for August at 10:15 AM ET heads a busy session for U.S. economic data, a day after numerous Federal Reserve officials warned that weakening business investment could signal a sharper slowdown ahead.\n\nThe ADP (NASDAQ: ) data are followed by at 10:30, which have been trending up since May, albeit from 50-year lows. Then come for July and the Purchasing Managers Index at 12 PM.\n\nThe durable goods orders may, among other things, corroborate weaker-than-expected German manufacturing orders.

By 6 AM, were steady at $56.27 a barrel, while the international benchmark was up 0.3% at $60.86\n\nSome of the smartest guys in the room\u2026leave the room\n\nRemember when Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) held its IPO at the top of the dot-com boom? Well, more of the self-styled \u2018smartest guys in the room\u2019 appear to be getting ready to leave the room.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal.reported that as many as a dozen Goldman partners will announce their departures in the coming weeks and added that 15% of the total partnership will leave this year, far more than usual.\n\nIt styled the development as a conscious policy of new chief executive David Solomon to cull a group he thinks has become too bloated. The bank currently has nearly 500 partners, compared to 221 when it went public.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2M0MU-ORUTP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
