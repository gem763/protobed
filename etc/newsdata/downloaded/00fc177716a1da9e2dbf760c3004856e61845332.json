But Andre Aciman was anything but when his debut novel, Call Me By Your Name, became an Academy Award-nominated adaptation 10 years after the book\u2019s release. \u201cI adored the film,\u201d Aciman tells me down the phone from his home in New York. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably one of the very few writers who doesn\u2019t feel cheated by an adaptation of their work. I had no idea how great it would be.\u201d\n\nNow, Aciman has finally written a sequel, and he\u2019s aware of the expectation. When Call Me By Your Name came out in 2007, it earned its author comparisons to Proust and a spot on the New York Times bestseller list. Its plot captures the furtive thrills, frissons and torments of first love between two young American men, whose romance unfolds amid the Italian Riviera\u2019s soft, muscular hills and sun-pummelled cobbles. It made for evocative reading, but intoxicating cinema, because on screen, everything that happens between Elio and Oliver is intensified: exchanges more lascivious, kisses more urgent. \u201cObsessive love is the only kind that exists,\u201d Aciman declares when I ask if he thinks that level of fervour exists exclusively in adolescence. He doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe long for people at any age. And if you\u2019re in love with someone and you\u2019re not obsessed by them: what are you?\u201d\n\nOne key difference between Call Me By Your Name the book and James Ivory\u2019s Oscar-winning screenplay was the handling of sex. Take the famous peach scene, in which Elio masturbates with the fruit before climaxing inside it. In the book, Oliver responds by eating the peach. In the film, he merely tastes it. Nonetheless, peaches have never looked the same since. \u201cI was pleased with the tacit way with which that was done,\u201d the 68-year-old says, explaining that he finds it difficult to watch sex scenes. \u201cI don\u2019t like all that humping action you see sometimes with what\u2019s his name... West. Dominic West.\u201d Is he talking about The Affair? \u201cYes, in The Affair, it\u2019s too much sex and I get a bit... I mean I watch it but I\u2019m not exactly comfortable. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m older, who knows. Just a bit of a hug is good enough for me.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He seems a little skittish. Jitters of neuroses surface, like at the beginning of our conversation, when it takes 10 minutes to get him on the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the phones aren\u2019t working. Oh god, this is awful.\u201d Aciman remains haunted for the duration of our conversation, frequently interrupting himself with Woody Allen-like asides about phone signal: \u201cOh my god. Hello? We\u2019re going to lose this in a minute I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nThe film was not completely without criticism, with some arguing that the combination of an amorous plot and utopian cinematography offered a fantasised version of an LGBT+ relationship, free from judgement. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to delve into the familiar tropes of violence against gay people,\u201d says Aciman. \u201cIt is a beautiful love story that unfolds as it would between two straight adolescents.\u201d\n\nWould the book have been as successful had it been about a straight couple? \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. In fact, that\u2019s how the story started until I decided to take a totally different turn, and I am exceptionally pleased that I did. I like writing about people finding themselves in mildly unusual situations.\u201d Aciman is keen to emphasise the \u201cmildly\u201d, given that a gay relationship is by no means unusual. \u201cAn adolescent girl and adolescent boy presented a situation that was quite ordinary,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut an adolescent drawn to someone of his same sex presented all manner of psychological hurdles, and that is what I love to write about.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a perpetual argument in Hollywood about whether straight actors should play gay roles because it takes opportunities away from LGBT+ actors, who are underrepresented on screen. \u201cI leave it to people with small minds to discuss that,\u201d replies Aciman when I ask where he sits on this debate, given that both Timothee Chalamet (Elio) and Armie Hammer (Oliver) are straight. \u201cI find it tiresome. I came up with the perfect metaphor on the matter: If you\u2019re going to have a movie about Jesus Christ, does his mother have to be a virgin?\u201d\n\nAciman is just as forthright when it comes to discussing criticisms that the relationship between Elio and Oliver is predatory given their seven-year age gap. \u201cOh gosh,\u201d he moans. \u201cI mean this is a consensual relationship. People saying that obviously didn\u2019t see the film or read the book.\u201d\n\nTwelve years after his debut novel turned him into a literary darling, Aciman has completed the sequel. Find Me is more complex than Call Me By Your Name, with Aciman presenting an assortment of narratives and relationships as opposed to just one, but like its predecessor, it remains at its heart a tale of longing. Those hoping for another Elio and Oliver epic, though, will be disappointed. The first half of the novel is told from the viewpoint of Sami, Elio\u2019s now-divorced father. Elio, meanwhile, has become a classical pianist living in Paris and Oliver is a married professor in New England with two sons.\n\n\u201cI tried to continue the story of Elio and Oliver, but it wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Aciman explains. \u201cThere was something weird about it, something artificial.\u201d It felt as if he was writing another version of Call Me By Your Name. \u201cI had already done that novel; why was I doing it again?\u201d Starting fresh from Sami\u2019s perspective was much easier. \u201cThen Elio would come from the wings and I would eventually work my way to his story and write about Oliver too.\u201d\n\nFind Me opens on a train, where middle-aged Sami becomes captivated by a young woman named Miranda. The two exchange pretentious thoughts on love and loss (\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the type who even likes people, much less falls in love with them\u201d) and soon tumble into a dizzying romance \u2013 it\u2019s less saccharine than it sounds. The inspiration came from a similar encounter Aciman had, only the woman got off the train after two stops \u2013 without him. \u201cShe was sat alone with a dog and a cake. We only spoke for a few minutes.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Aciman began writing Find Me immediately after, though he doesn\u2019t make much of the exchange looking back. \u201cIt was a difficult train conversation; you\u2019re just talking to do something as opposed to reading. I speak to everyone, I can\u2019t stand being on a plane with someone next to me and not knowing who they are.\u201d He pauses. \u201cHello?\u201d Still here. \u201cOh god. I\u2019m gonna lose you, I know I will.\u201d\n\nAciman teaches literature at a post-graduate university in New York. Despite his first novel becoming a bestseller and a successful Hollywood film he insists his life hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cWhy would it? Every morning I go to the gym, or try to. Then I come back home and I write or grade papers.\u201d I get the sense that Aciman lives in his own world. He avoids films (\u201cI just don\u2019t want to watch them\u201d) and listens exclusively to classical music. He also didn\u2019t know who Chalamet or Hammer were when they were cast in Call Me By Your Name, though he eventually recognised Hammer from \u201cthe Facebook movie\u201d aka The Social Network.\n\nFor someone who rhapsodises so effortlessly about love and desire in his work, it\u2019s surprising that Aciman bristles when I ask about his personal life. He has been married to Susan Wiviott, who runs a mental health charity, for nearly 30 years and has three children. But the writer refuses to define his sexual identity. In an interview last year, Aciman said \u201cwe are all plurisexual\u201d, in other words, attracted to multiple genders. Is that how he feels about himself? \u201cThat\u2019s personal, so I would never answer that question,\u201d he replies, brusquely. \u201cBut no, I wouldn\u2019t use any label. I have hated labels since I was a kid because you are automatically viewed as someone who is different.\u201d\n\nAciman recalls being the only Jewish child in his school, which he believes had a profound impact on his feelings towards being labelled. \u201cSo I don\u2019t like labels. I also hate flags.\u201d Flags? \u201cYes, flags. I don\u2019t like flags. And I don\u2019t like people who are proud of their flags.\u201d I\u2019m unsure how we got from sexuality to flags, but we manage to paddle back to the former. Aciman is happy to stress that he is a dedicated monogamist. \u201cI hate the idea of people cheating,\u201d he says, explaining that his father was a serial cheater who \u201ccreated hell at home\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he believes in being immune from temptation. \u201cOur minds drift constantly and we have to recognise this. Something may cross my mind for half a second, but I recognise it. Most people who read my books say they\u2019re constantly desiring someone. Desire is a condition of life, it\u2019s like hunger. I am constantly aware of my hunger. Personally, I\u2019m always hungry, I could eat all day long.\u201d\n\nFind Me is published on 29 October (Faber \u00a314.99)", "description": "When a film becomes more famous than the book it\u2019s based on, you can understand why the author might feel aggrieved.
