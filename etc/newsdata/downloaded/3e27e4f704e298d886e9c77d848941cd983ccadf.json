Full details will be presented at a summit in December.", "description": "Malian troops backed by foreign allies have launched a hunt for scores of comrades listed as missing after one of the deadliest attacks in a seven-year-old jihadist insurgency.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8183/ea3478c3b05347a18b8a614bc65f8062.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
