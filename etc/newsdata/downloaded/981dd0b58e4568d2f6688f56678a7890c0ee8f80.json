Businesses \u2014 like Delta Airlines and Marriott Corp. \u2014 are engaging meaningfully. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has a task force.\n\nNobody knows how many victims suffer as sex slaves in America. We know that the number is substantial. And that it\u2019s intolerable. We know how to put an end to this shameful condition.\n\nI, Dottie Laster, have been credited with triggering the largest human trafficking victim rescue in U.S. history. And I, Ralph Benko, was a field organizer there and in half a dozen other cities for President George W. Bush\u2019s Operation Rescue and Restore. Unassumingly, we helped build an \u201cunderground railroad\u2019 to rescue the victims of modern day slavery.\n\nWe know from direct experience.\n\nBusiness, and business alone, can provide the missing ingredient to rescue all the human trafficking victims in America. It\u2019s the right thing.\n\nSo welcome, business, to this great humanitarian crusade. However, it is as important to do the thing right as it is to do the right thing.\n\nBusinesses now are putting most of their effort into educating their employees (and customers) on how to spot a victim. Good beginning. Now something more, but not more expensive, is needed.\n\nA famous story supposedly about FDR goes: \u201cCivil rights leader A. Philip Randolph met with FDR before World War II to get the president to take action against discrimination, the president boomed back: \u2018I agree with you, now go out and make me do it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMake me do it\u201d is the missing ingredient. The resources needed to rescue human trafficking victims are already out there. The resources are fragmented among many agencies. We just need to align them.\n\nThe local police are quietly knowledgeable about where the traffickers and their victims may be found. But making the rescue is delicate and complex. And you need T and U visas from the federal Department of Homeland Security at the ready. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services (USCIS) website says \u201cT visa nonimmigrant status is a temporary immigration benefit that enables certain victims of a severe form of human trafficking to remain in the United States for up to 4 years if they have assisted law enforcement in an investigation or prosecution of human trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe USCIS says a \u201cU nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nAlso, many traffickers operate interstate. That can thwart local police and district attorneys. That requires the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nRescuers need a safe and secure place to shelter the rescued victims. Local nonprofits are usually the best bet for this and will go to great lengths to provide. Many victims need language and job training. Many require psychological counseling. Other agencies are available to provide these.\n\nRescuers need philanthropists, foundations and government agencies to provide humanitarian funding to rescue victims at scale. Otherwise, success would swamp the rescue infrastructure. It is a very rewarding cause. Success will win their enthusiastic support.\n\nRescuing the victims \u2014 all the victims \u2014 is not prohibitively expensive. Neither is it cost free. Freedom is never \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nSo, the resources are there.\n\nWhy do we still have trafficking?\n\nLet\u2019s let you in on the secret key to ending human trafficking. Most agencies have little to zero routine operational interaction with one another.\n\nAlso, there are abundant rivalries and even mild animosities. Local police mostly look on the FBI with disdain. And vice versa. Nobody knows USCIS\u2019s phone number. Humanitarian service providers tend to look on the police as borderline brutes. Cops look at social workers as namby-pamby bleeding hearts. (Until they get to know each other.)\n\nThe agencies that have to work together are not naturally aligned. Public pressure makes them do it. But public pressure is \u201cas spontaneous as arson.\u201d It will take a small squad of do-gooders to activate public pressure. Victim rescue at scale requires busybodies and nudniks. Socrates was such a one. He called himself a \u201cgadfly.\u201d\n\nThe government, or government-funded agencies, won\u2019t fund their own busybodies. They can\u2019t. Yet, when FDR said \u201cI agree with you, now go out and make me do it,\u201d he meant it. Here too! Virtually every elected official truly sympathizes with trafficking victims. They would be thrilled to be \u201cmade\u201d to rescue them.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Two dozen or so well-organized busybodies, nationally. They\u2019d pour on the sweet relentless pressure needed to force alignment among the responsible parties.\n\nWe know.\n\nWe\u2019ve done it.\n\nThe cost of such a squad would be a rounding error on the weekly profit and loss report of any major corporation. That cost would be an excellent PR investment. It would protect their brands from the tarnish of charges \u2014 founded or not \u2014 of negligence toward human trafficking on their turf.\n\nPlus, what CEO wouldn\u2019t care to go down in history for more than just turning a profit? To be remembered for ridding America of modern-day slavery?\n\nBeing a great businessperson? Great.\n\nBeing a great humanitarian? Priceless.\n\nLet\u2019s end human trafficking in America, now.\n\nThank you, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u2022 Dottie Laster is the principal of TraffickingVictimRescueCentral.org.
