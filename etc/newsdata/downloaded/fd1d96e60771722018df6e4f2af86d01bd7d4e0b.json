Push will be set on a new map based in Toronto\u2019.\n\nSupposedly both the unnamed PvE mission and the new Push mode will be playable at BlizzCon 2019, which starts on Friday, 1 November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe guide also talks about more specific details, such as hero talents and in-game items, plus 2/2/2 role lock and role queue from launch.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, there\u2019ll also be new maps and and heroes. Although exactly how many new characters isn\u2019t hinted at.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still unclear as to how much of a break this will be from the last game and at the moment it sounds like most of the base features of the current version will be carried through and added to, rather than being a clean break from the first game.\n\nWhich make sense given its ongoing success.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate leak about Diablo 4 also seems to confirm the game\u2019s reveal is imminent and therefore also a shoe-in for BlizzCon.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Overwatch 2 will be at Blizzcon 2019 says leaker\n\nMORE: Overwatch Legendary Edition Switch review \u2013 fallen hero shooter\n\nMORE: Overwatch in Super Smash Bros.
