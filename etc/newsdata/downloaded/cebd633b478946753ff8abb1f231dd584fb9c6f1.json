Despite its massive reach, DirecTV has been hemorrhaging customers\u2014losing 2.5 million subscribers in the last year alone. The company is the targeted of activist investor Elliot Management, which has snapped up a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T and called on management to unload DirecTV.\n\nMounting problems\n\nMeanwhile, AT&T has been sued in federal court over allegedly faking the number of subscribers to its streaming service, DirecTV Now\u2014in an effort to make the brand look like it was gaining customers organically. And maybe more ominous: The Fox Business Network has learned that DirecTV may be the focus of a boycott engineered by outside advisors to president Trump, who has been critical of the news coverage of AT&T subsidiary CNN. Trump has called on his supporters to boycott AT&T services in the past to put pressure on CNN to changes its coverage of the White House, and outside advisers have told the president that DirecTV may be most vulnerable of AT&T\u2019s units to a customer boycott, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nBut Wall Street investment bankers are telling AT&T there is a simple solution that would involve a sale of DirecTV or a merger, people familiar with the matter say. Among the deals being pushed is one where DirecTV teams up with Dish Network by spinning off the companies into a separate unit or a merger that could be financed with capital from private equity firms since Dish \u2014 with 12 million subscribers \u2014 is a significantly smaller company than DirecTV, these people add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's unclear how serious Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s CEO, is taking such overtures.\n\nAn AT&T spokeswoman declined comment as did a spokeswoman for Dish. But media analysts believe the two companies would be stronger together since they\u2019d share the hefty cost of their satellite infrastructure.\n\nSuch a combination can help merged companies slash costs, increase scale and compete with tech and media giants entering the content and streaming world.\n\n\"There has to be an appetite between the two companies to merge,\u201d Peter Adderton a veteran telecommunications executive and founder of prepaid wireless service Boost Mobile said. \u201cThe biggest concern I would think for Dish and Direct TV is its tremendous infrastructure costs both companies have, clearly there\u2019re new competitors in the video space: Youtube, Disney, Amazon and others that don\u2019t have these legacy infrastructure costs.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg T AT&T INC. 37.16 -0.15 -0.40% DISH DISH NETWORK CORPORATION 35.30 -0.78 -2.16%\n\nShares of Dish, which had been down four percent today, gained two percent on a FOX Business report of a possible merger. Shares of AT&T closed at $37.16.\n\nBig believers of distribution\n\nStephenson, the AT&T CEO, hasn\u2019t addressed Elliot Management\u2019s call to sell DirecTV. However, in a Sept. 9 letter to AT&T\u2019s board, he recommended cost-cutting and other divestitures to bolster its balance sheet after the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which closed in June 2018 and survived a challenge by the federal Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.\n\nBut Wall Street has been somewhat skeptical of the telecom behemoth. The company has mountains of debt and cultural differences between AT&T \u2013 a diversified telecom company \u2014 and Time Warner\u2019s main business of news and entertainment. Shares have basically traded flat since the deal was announced in the fall of 2016.\n\nStill Stephenson has defended the strategic sense of the deal, and DirecTV\u2019s role in the company. Speaking Tuesday at Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference, Stephenson said AT&T is \u201cgetting an amazing premium for selling that small advertising inventory in DirecTV.\u201d Stephenson also noted DirecTV plays a key role in the distribution of AT&T\u2019s content: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been big believers of distribution and the power of it.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of DirecTV cost $67 billion, and AT&T took over its debt when it closed the deal in July 2015. But DirecTV lost 2.5 million subscribers in the last 12-month period. The number of subscribers dropped to 22.9 million in the second quarter 2019 from 25.4 million subscribers in the second quarter 2018.\n\nBecause of that bankers say if Stephenson were to unload it now, he would be lucky to recoup half of the purchase price.\n\nAnd the potential sale price of DirecTV could fall further if the Trump boycott effort proves even mildly successful. In June, President Trump suggested a boycott of AT&T on Twitter because of CNN\u2019s coverage of the White House, and more recently advisers have suggested to the president that to extract maximum pressure on the company, he should target the boycott at DirecTV.\n\nA White House spokesman declined comment on the matter, and it\u2019s unclear if the president will focus any possible boycott on the company.\n\nPotential pitfalls\n\nOne potentially devastating blow could come if the NFL decides not to renew its so-called \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d contract with DirecTV \u2014 a package that allows viewers to watch out-of-network games with their DirecTV subscription. Failure to renew could mean DirecTV loses 10% of its subscriber base, according to some estimates.\n\nIf DirecTV does nab the contract, they would have to foot an annual bill of $1.5 billion for the rights, which is the second-largest amount the NFL charges any network. The only channel to pay more is ABC, which has exclusive rights to Monday Night Football for approximately $2 billion a year.\n\nAnd there is no guaranteeing that Dish, or any other suitor, will seek to buy an asset that is clearly declining in value. While some bankers are hopeful that a merger with Dish will resolve DirecTV\u2019s problems, Dish may not be in a position to consummate a merger since it\u2019s already embroiled in buying spectrum and prepaid wireless businesses from Sprint Corp. as part of the DOJ\u2019s approval of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger.\n\nDish is seeking a partner to help build out and finance their current deal with T-Mobile and Sprint to create a fourth major wireless carrier, based on comments Ergen made today at the same Goldman Sachs event Stephenson spoke at.", "description": "Bankers inundate AT&T with pitches on how the telecom giant can unload satellite subsidiary DirecTV.", "authors": ["Lydia Moynihan", "Charles Gasparino"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Dish-DirectTV.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
