The denials began to stack up.\n\nFinally, on Friday, one of his appeals persuaded Texas\u2019 highest court to stay his execution, which had been scheduled for 10 October.\n\nHalprin\u2019s lawyers had found several people who said that the judge who oversaw their client\u2019s murder conviction had regularly used racist language and referred to Halprin, who is Jewish, using antisemitic slurs.\n\nThe lawyers had been spurred to investigate the judge, Vickers Cunningham, by an explosive report in The Dallas Morning News last year saying that he had promised to reward his children if they married a white, Christian person of the opposite sex.\n\nThe report sank the judge\u2019s campaign for Dallas County commissioner.\n\nNow, a trial court will determine whether Mr Cunningham\u2019s reported views and behaviour warrant a new trial for Halprin.\n\n\u201cThe ruling is a very strong signal that the court is not going to tolerate bigotry in criminal courts in Texas,\u201d said Tivon Schardl, one of Halprin\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe decision from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is just the latest twist in the sentencing of a group of defendants known as the Texas Seven, four of whom have been executed.\n\nHalprin and six other men carried out a string of robberies after escaping from prison in December 2000. During their last holdup, they were confronted by officer Aubrey Hawkins, and several men opened fire, killing the officer and dragging him with a car.\n\nHalprin has always said he did not fire a gun; at trial, he told a jury that he had not wanted to carry a gun and \u201cfreaked out\u201d when the other men began shooting. His lawyers have argued that their client was at the bottom of the Texas Seven hierarchy.\n\nBut Halprin was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 under a fiercely debated Texas statute known as the law of parties, which allows accomplices to be punished as if they had been the ones to pull the trigger.\n\nThe only other living member of the escapees, Patrick Murphy, saw his execution temporarily blocked by the US supreme court in March.\n\nRobert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Centre, said that an impartial judge \u2014 one who provides instructions to the jury and rules on lawyers\u2019 motions \u2014 was essential to having a fair trial.\n\nThe lawyers\u2019 investigation had revealed the judge\u2019s \u201cvirulent antisemitism,\u201d Mr Dunham said, and should be grounds for a new trial.\n\nMr Cunningham, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, has admitted to making the marriage deal with his children, but denied using racist language and said his personal views never affected his decisions during court proceedings.\n\nRead more\n\n1,500th person executed since US brought back death penalty\n\nIn their motion for the stay, Halprin\u2019s lawyers included statements from people who said they had heard Mr Cunningham use antisemitic language to refer to Halprin and racist language to refer to Halprin\u2019s co-defendants, who are Latino, as well as black people who had been before the court in other cases.\n\nTammy McKinney, who grew up with Mr Cunningham and remained in touch with him, said the judge had taken \u201cspecial pride\u201d in overseeing the death sentences of the Texas Seven \u201cbecause they included Latinos and a Jew\u201d, according to the motion.", "description": "For more than 15 years on death row, Randy Halprin filed challenge after challenge to his sentence.
