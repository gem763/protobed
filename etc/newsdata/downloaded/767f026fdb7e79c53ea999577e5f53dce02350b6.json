Pause for inspiration | CBC Books", "language": "en", "text": "The 2020 CBC Short Story Prize is open for submissions! You can submit your original, unpublished writing up to 2,000 words for a chance to win $6,000 from the Canada Council for the Arts, a two-week writing residency at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and have your work published on CBC Books. The deadline to enter is Oct. 31, 2019.\n\nTo inspire and support you along the way, we are publishing a writing tip each week on CBC Books. You can also subscribe to our writing tips newsletter for even more tips.\n\nThis week's tip is from Taslim Burkowicz.\n\n\"When you have the passion to write but cannot produce words, my advice is to leave the craft for a short hiatus. Plunge into the works of other writers and let them become your silent writing coaches. Allow them to take your mind on journeys that you could not have dreamed yourself. Lose yourself in the words of other creators. When inspiration comes, you will have things to write about and scenes to illustrate.\"\n\nTaslim Burkowicz was a reader for the 2019 CBC Short Story Prize. Her first novel, Chocolate Cherry Chai, was listed as one of CBC Books' 20 works of Canadian fiction we're excited to read in 2017. Her second novel, The Desirable Sister, focuses on the topic of colourism within Canadian society. It will be out in Fall 2019.", "description": "B.C. writer Taslim Burkowicz offers her best writing tip for those planning on entering the CBC Short Story Prize.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4814998.1536347351!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/woman-writin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
