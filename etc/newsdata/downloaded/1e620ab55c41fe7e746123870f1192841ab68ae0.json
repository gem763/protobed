One of these days they will probably get it right, but it's not today, it's not tomorrow, it's not next month,' Perry said while traveling in Lithuania.\n\nPolitico had reported last week that he was planning to resign at the end of November, citing three anonymous sources.\n\nAsked about the report, Perry denied it while speaking in the present tense. 'No. I'm here, I'm serving,' he said.\n\nThat report followed a whistle-blower's complaint that flagged Perry's trip as head of a delegation to mark the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, after Vice President Mike Pence pull out.\n\nRick Perry has denied ever discussing the Biden family's dealings in the Ukraine with Donald Trump after the president appeared to try to pin the scandal that sparked his current impeachment woes on the outgoing energy secretary\n\nThe whistle-blower alleged a pressure campaign to entice the Ukrainians to investigate a company linked to Hunter Biden, the son of Trump rival Joe Biden.\n\nText messages released Friday show a U.S. diplomat apparently connecting a proposed White House visit that Zelensky was seeking with requests for an investigation.\n\nPerry's statements came as other figures in the Ukraine affair, including former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, either spoke to Congress or prepared to do so.\n\nPerry has denied ever discussing the Biden family's dealings in the Ukraine with Donald Trump after the president appeared to try to pin the scandal on the outgoing energy secretary.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Perry pushed Ukraine to appoint Americans to the board of the Ukrainian state gas company, Naftogaz. Among them was a past Perry donor.\n\nPerry also pushed back against the AP's report.\n\nSecretary of Energy Rick Perry delivers a statement after signing an agreement with Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian counterparts on strengthening energy cooperation between the US and the Baltic States during a meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, on October 6, 2019\n\n'That the AP story basically said that we said, \"You put these people on there\" - is just not correct. I mean that was a totally dreamed up story, the best I can tell,\" he said at his Vilnius news conference.\n\n'We gave recommendations at the request of the Ukrainian government, and we will continue to,' Perry said.\n\nIn an interview with CBN News on Friday, Perry said he likely has closer relationships with Ukrainian officials than any other cabinet secretary because he spearheaded US efforts to clean up corruption in the eastern European nation.\n\nThe former Texas governor said Joe Biden's name never came up during the many conversations he's had with Trump, other White House officials and foreign ambassadors about his dealings in the Ukraine.\n\nPerry's remarks came hours after Trump reportedly blamed the energy secretary for his now-infamous phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nPresident Trump (pictured on October 4) allegedly told House Republicans on a Friday conference call that Perry urged him to contact Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nDuring the call in July, Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky to investigate Biden's son Hunter's business dealings in the Ukraine and see if the former vice president had a hand in the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into a company Hunter was on the board of.\n\nAn anonymous CIA agent lodged a complaint about the call in August, accusing Trump of threatening to withhold military aid from the Ukraine if Zelensky refused to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint led House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry last month.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called the Ukraine allegations a 'witch hunt' and 'presidential harassment', insisting that he didn't do anything inappropriate during the 'perfect' phone call.\n\nDuring the July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky (pictured) to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter's business dealings in the Ukraine\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans on a conference call Friday, Trump claimed that he only contacted Zelensky because Perry urged him to, according to Axios.\n\nThree sources confirmed the contents of the call. One of them quoted Trump as saying something along the lines of: 'I didn't even want to make the call [to Zelensky].'\n\nAnother source said that Trump, referring to Perry, had told House Republicans that 'more of this will be coming out in the next few days'.\n\nAt no point did Trump suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nDuring the CBN interview, Perry insisted that Biden never came up during his dealings with the Ukraine.\n\n'I never heard, and I talked to the president about this,' he told CBN News.\n\n'I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once, as God is my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son, ever mentioned.\n\n'Corruption was talked about in the country but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you.'\n\nSpeaking to CBN News on Friday, Perry said he likely has closer relationships with Ukrainian officials than any other cabinet secretary because he spearheaded US efforts to clean up corruption in the eastern European nation. However, he insisted Biden never came up during his many conversations with members of the Trump administration or Ukrainian officials\n\nPerry said he will cooperate fully with Congress as House Democrats conduct an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee wants to learn more about Perry's trip to the Ukraine for Zelensky's inauguration in May, as well as his other discussions with Ukrainian officials.\n\nPerry's spokeswoman told the Associated Press on Sunday that Perry had in fact encouraged Trump to speak to Zelensky - but on energy and economic issues.\n\n'Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development,' Perry's Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before Trump's call with House Republicans, Politico reported that Perry is expected to resign in November, citing three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nPerry was said to have been planning his resignation for several months.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before Trump's call with House Republicans, Politico reported that Perry is expected to resign in November, citing three sources familiar with the matter\n\nAlthough Perry has been able to steer clear of the various controversies that have embroiled and led to the exit of others in Trump's administration, he is now facing impeachment inquiry scrutiny over his recent trips to the Ukraine.\n\nThe House has subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani for documents related to Perry's 'involvement with Ukrainian leaders last spring', according to Axios.\n\nHowever, there does not appear to be any evidence that Perry was involved in the efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials into investigating the Bidens.\n\nDespite Trump's apparent claims that Perry urged him to make the call, text messages between White House aides and Zelensky's aide indicate it was actually Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who pushed for the call\n\nIn fact, recently released text messages exchanged by Trump administration officials and Zelensky's top aide, Andrey Yermak, appear to suggest that Giuliani - in his role as Trump's personal lawyer - was the one pushing for the call between the two leaders. There also does not seem to be any message of Perry having been involved in the call planning.\n\nPerry was not mentioned in the five-page memo of the Trump-Zelensky call that was released by the White House after the whistleblower complaint went public.\n\nPerry's spokesperson told Axios that the Energy Secretary 'absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development'.\n\nThe spokesperson said Perry 'continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security', which is why he is traveling to Lithuania on Sunday for a Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC) meeting.\n\nAn energy leader from the Ukraine will attend that meeting, along with nearly two dozen other officials from central and eastern Europe.", "description": "Energy Secretary Rick Perry has denied plans to resign from the Trump administration, complaining reporters have 'been writing the story for at least nine months now.'", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/19408292-0-image-a-2_1570477785464.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
