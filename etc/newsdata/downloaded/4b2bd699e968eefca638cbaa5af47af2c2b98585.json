Here's why \u01c0 View", "language": "en", "text": "Thanks to Donald Trump, American women have a fresh, iconic photo of Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the White House on Wednesday. There she is, the only woman at a table of two dozen men, standing up to object to what lawmakers confirm was Trump\u2019s verbal abuse. Meanwhile, the white male power elite of the United States look down uneasily at their collective hands.\n\nThis White House meeting with congressional leaders was supposed to be about the unfolding conflict between Turkey and the Kurds. Before they even got down to business, however, the conversation, perhaps predictably, unraveled. In situations like this, as the only woman in a room full of men \u2014 a woman who is not there as eye candy to help close the deal, but who is present to actually close the deal herself \u2014 Pelosi pushes all Trump\u2019s buttons at once.\n\n\"He was insulting, particularly to the speaker,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters. \u201cThis was not a dialogue, it was sort of a diatribe. A nasty diatribe, not focused on the facts.\"\n\nIn situations like this, as the only woman in a room full of men \u2014 a woman who is not there as eye candy to help close the deal, but who is present to actually close the deal herself \u2014 Pelosi pushes all Trump\u2019s buttons at once. Nina Burleigh Journalist\n\nPelosi later said Trump referred to her as a \"third-grade politician.\u201d Schumer and other Democrats heard \u201cthird-rate.\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham instead implied that Trump was the soul of calm. Pelosi \"had no intention of listening,\" Grisham said in a statement, and Trump had been \"measured\" and \"decisive.\"\n\nThroughout his public interactions with Pelosi, Trump has deployed a combination of patronizing and condescending behavior \u2014 his go-to strategy for dealing with female political opponents. He calls her \u201cNancy\u201d \u2014 she is not even worthy of title, much less a last name \u2014 while she calls him \u201cMr. President.\u201d\n\nPelosi has emerged as a key a problem for Trump precisely because he has never had to deal with women who don\u2019t depend on him. The women in his life \u2014 a few Trump Organization executives, his wives, his daughter and daughters-in-law \u2014 have all been dependent on him for their power.\n\nPelosi, however, is powerfully independent. And as she keeps having to remind him, she is the leader of a co-equal branch of government.\n\n\u201cNancy\u201d was always going to pose a problem for Trump because she doesn\u2019t fit neatly into his two simple categories for all women. She is neither hot and camera-ready nor \u201cnasty.\u201d\n\nBut his efforts to bring her to heel have backfired. The White House insisted Trump himself selected the photo and wrote the correctly spelled albeit characteristically juvenile caption. But this tactic \u2014 tweeting a photo that makes Pelosi look like a female Abraham Lincoln \u2014 did not come off the way Trump and his team seemed to think it would. What woman \u2014 or man \u2014 doesn\u2019t look at that photo and recognize its courage?\n\nAnd the \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d nickname \u2014 a dated but still useful female stereotype \u2014 is the opposite of Pelosi\u2019s sure-footed strategic political moves.\n\nThe image joins two other memorable shots of Trump and Pelosi. The first was from December, in a brief Oval Office video that Trump insisted on recording against Pelosi\u2019s wishes. In it, Pelosi, perched on the edge of a couch, schooling the president in the role of the legislature and his need to respect her as speaker of the House. Schumer smirks beside her and Vice President Mike Pence sits like a wax-figure, all three men sit manspreading in their chairs like walruses in the sun.\n\nThe second iconic photo is the famous \u201cGood Boy, Donald!\u201d Grandma-to-toddler clap she directed at Trump from the rostrum during the State of the Union this year.\n\nFor Trump, meanwhile, Pelosi has long served as a reliably sinister figure around whom he can rally his base. The thousands of replies to Trump\u2019s recent tweet show there is still enough Pelosi-hate in the hearts of the right to indicate that the president and his strategists aren't totally off-base.\n\nPelosi has been a key target of fierce right-wing attacks for more than a decade. She has served as a conservative punching bag since she helped President Barack Obama push the Affordable Care Act through the House.\n\nTrump and his team have also learned that you can never underestimate the power of misogyny to bind up and motivate key bits of the electorate. Now, she has risen above Hillary Clinton in the broomstick pantheon.\n\nBut 2019 is not 2016 \u2014 and Pelosi is not Clinton. She is leading a movement of more than 50 percent of the American people who want Trump impeached and removed from office. She has played the politics of impeachment with a sure, steady hand \u2014 undeterred by calls from her party\u2019s left flank to move faster or by furious attacks from the right.\n\nAs for dealing with Trump, Pelosi deftly steps out of the dynamic that he is trying to create. He revels in trading insults, a childish tit-for-tat. She not only refuses to engage in this, Pelosi looks down on it from above, assessing him like a kindergarten psychologist reporting some bad news to the parents.\n\n\u201cWhat is truly sad about this\u201d, Pelosi said back on Capitol Hill after the White House incident, \u201cis I pray for the president all the time and I tell him I pray for the safety of him and his family. I think now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nIn May, after Trump stormed out of a meeting on infrastructure, Pelosi called on Trump\u2019s family to stage an \u201cintervention.\"\n\nYet anything resembling an intervention seems unthinkable to the men around Trump. They have made it clear time and again that they don\u2019t intend to let mere norms \u2014 including reining in an increasingly unhinged leader \u2014 loosen their grip on power.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which, if any, of Trump\u2019s advisers suggested this latest photo as a worthwhile salvo against Pelosi. But [...] the image clearly shows that the last man standing in that room is, in fact, Nancy Pelosi. Nina Burleigh Journalist\n\nTrump has taught his supporters to project his problems back onto critics. On Wednesday, he called Pelosi \u201ca very sick person\u201d in a separate tweet. The last time Pelosi talked about Trump\u2019s instability, someone produced, and distributed on Facebook, an altered video of Pelosi that made it look like she was slurring her words.\n\nTrump\u2019s shadow foreign policy minion, Rudy Giuliani, tweeted that clearly fake news \u2014 then deleted his tweet. Trump, meanwhile, tweeted a Fox Business News clip of Pelosi edited to made her look like she was stammering.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which, if any, of Trump\u2019s advisers suggested this latest photo as a worthwhile salvo against Pelosi. But combined with the president\u2019s crazy \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the witnesses and whistleblowers testifying before the House impeachment inquiry, the image clearly shows that the last man standing in that room is, in fact, Nancy Pelosi.\n\nNina Burleigh is a journalist whose work has appeared in Newsweek, Rolling Stone, The New York Times and Medium.com.
