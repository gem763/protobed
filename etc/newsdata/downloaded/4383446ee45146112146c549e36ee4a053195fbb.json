REUTERS/David Gray\n\nHousing Minister Megan Woods unveiled measures that include a NZ$400 million ($256 million) funding for ownership schemes like rent-to-buy and shared equity, which allow families to buy chunks of a mortgage until they own a home outright.\n\nIn June, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern replaced her housing minister and appointed a team of senior officials to fix New Zealand\u2019s housing problems after Kiwibuild, the government\u2019s flagship project for adding 100,000 homes, missed several deadlines.\n\nAs of Sept. 4, the number of homes built was 258, according to Kiwibuild\u2019s website.\n\nWoods did not set any new target for Kiwibuild, saying the government would focus on building as many homes as it can.\n\nShe also said the deposit required for government-backed mortgages would be reduced by half to 5%, adding this would ensure more low- and middle-income New Zealanders could buy a first home.\n\n\u201cWhen policies aren\u2019t working, we are honest about that and fix them,\u201d Woods said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBy making improvements to our build program, we can get more New Zealanders into warm, dry, secure homes whether they be public, rental or affordable Kiwibuild homes,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse prices in New Zealand have soared more than 50% over the past decade, and almost doubled in Auckland, the biggest city.\n\nArdern\u2019s centre-left government passed laws last year that restricted many non-resident foreigners from buying existing homes in New Zealand, as part of efforts to contain house price increases and reduce high rates of homelessness.", "description": "New Zealand, facing a shortage of affordable housing, scrapped its target to build 100,000 homes in 10 years as \"overly ambitious\" on Wednesday and reset some policies for grappling with what it calls a crisis.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425989961&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8309R"}
