Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Oversight Committee, one of three panels leading the impeachment process. \u201cOne is that the president is a one-man crime wave who has generated virtually limitless impeachable offenses and misconduct. On the other hand, we need to develop a process that will close within a period of time that makes sense for the legislative calendar.\u201d\n\nBut Raskin said lawmakers are not yet discussing how to make that determination.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really are still in the throes of the fact investigation.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn't a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles.\n\nAnd still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately \u2014 from Trump's own admission that he wants Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, to the summary of his phone call with Ukraine's president to the text messages of senior ambassadors worried that Trump was withholding military aid and a White House visit to bend Ukraine's leaders to his will.\n\n\u201cWhat I think you have in the public domain already is more than sufficient for an article of impeachment,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), an Oversight Committee member.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her top allies say they\u2019re still firmly in fact-finding mode and have promised a deliberate approach to the House\u2019s Ukraine investigation with no ironclad time limit. Senior Democrats say they\u2019re eyeing the end of the year as an unofficial outer limit for the House to craft and pass articles of impeachment, but the unpredictable investigation has produced so many leads it's hard to solidify a deadline.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republicans Wednesday that he expects Pelosi to approve impeachment articles by Thanksgiving, paving the way for the Senate to deal with a trial by Christmas.\n\n\"Everyone\u2019s conscious of the calendar,\" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, which is expecting to handle the process of drafting articles of impeachment once the other panels conclude the Ukraine probe. \"Our expectation should be to have our work done by year\u2019s end.\"\n\nRep.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats continue to rack up testimony and evidence from high-level officials who have provided damaging accounts of Trump and his allies\u2019 handling of Ukraine, some speaking to lawmakers even over the objections of the White House and State Department.\n\nThe impeachment investigation has netted nearly 50 hours of testimony from current and former State Department and White House officials, with a long line of additional witnesses prepared to discuss claims that Trump used U.S. diplomatic might to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nMembers of the investigating committees say it\u2019s conceivable that most interviews of willing witnesses will be finished by next week. Once that\u2019s done, they intend to bring their secretive investigation into the open, and there are early, internal discussions about how to do that.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the investigation, has said he envisions a combination of public hearings and transcript releases to help shed light on the evidence lawmakers are unearthing.\n\n\u201cWe will get to open hearings,\u201d Schiff said Tuesday when asked about GOP complaints that testimony was being taken behind closed doors. Schiff has compared the current phase of the investigation to grand jury proceedings, which are held in secret, before charges are brought that can be litigated publicly.\n\nIn that vein, an attorney for Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in the probe, indicated that Sondland would likely honor a request to testify in public but hasn\u2019t yet received one. And Kurt Volker, a former Trump administration representative to Ukraine, was in the Capitol Wednesday reviewing the transcript of his earlier nine-hour interview, a possible precursor to its public release.\n\nThe bulk of private testimony, according to sources who have been in the depositions, has focused on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as a months-long campaign by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to push Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son Hunter on unfounded charges. Leads from these interviews continue to multiply, though, adding to the challenge Democrats face with trying to accelerate their efforts.\n\nFor example, recent witnesses have indicated that Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his former national security adviser John Bolton played key roles in the controversy \u2014 and neither of them has been called to testify yet. In addition, Democrats have demanded, and so far been denied, cooperation from Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the White House budget office and the Department of Defense \u2014 signaling potentially lengthy legal fights to resolve the disputes.\n\nAt the root of Democrats\u2019 dilemma is the origin of the Ukraine investigation itself. The scandal erupted in mid-September, following an anonymous whistleblower complaint, and quickly united Democrats behind a narrow, speedy impeachment process.\n\nResponding to the sudden outcry, the White House released a record of Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky, which Trump has described as \u201cperfect,\u201d even though it confirmed aspects of the damning narrative that has since been painted by diplomats and administration officials. Each day, witnesses filled in components of a high-level scheme that ensnares multiple members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and has rocked the entire U.S. foreign policy establishment.\n\nYet the deeper the House gets into the inquiry, the more Democrats grow concerned about its sprawling nature.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the No. 5 House Democrat, quickly answered \u201cno\u201d when asked by reporters on Wednesday if Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds in Syria bolster the case for impeachment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve connected one with the other,\u201d Jeffries, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, added. \u201cThe actions of the president as it relates to the Trump-Ukraine scandal speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cMy view is the most damning evidence basically already came out.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday his \u201chope\u201d is to wrap up the impeachment inquiry by the end of the year but acknowledged White House resistance has \u201cmade the fact-finding phase more difficult.\u201d\n\nStill, the No. 2 House Democrat said the decision by witnesses like former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill to testify, despite the administration\u2019s attempt to block them, could lead to other reluctant witnesses testifying.\n\n\u201cI think these two witnesses are going to encourage others to come forward and tell the truth, as patriots,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize this is no rush to judgment,\u201d he added when pressed about a timeline. \u201cOnly in the most serious circumstances, where the Constitution and the laws have been betrayed purportedly by a president, should the Congress take action.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio and Sarah Ferris contributed reporting\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/40/64/12b723a346638318fdc70dbe3ccb/191016-raskin-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
