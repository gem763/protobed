After the trauma of the 7-2 humiliation in their previous Champions League tie here against Bayern Munich and how it had affected them subsequently in the loss at Brighton and the home draw with Watford, they needed a tonic, something to steady the nerves and trample the prospect of an escalating crisis.\n\nThey got it on a night when Son Heung-min ran riot, scoring twice and striking fear in the hearts of the Red Star defenders whenever he touched the ball, and Harry Kane weighed in with two more of his own. \u00c9rik Lamela got the other goal and the truth was that Spurs ought to have reached double figures. Their dominance was total and they certainly had the chances.\n\nSon seems to melt away Spurs\u2019 woes, but hapless Red Star no bellwether | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nRed Star were the most obliging of visitors and their sleepy non-performance was an embarrassment to the manager, Vladan Milojevic, who brooded with menace in his technical area.\n\nThere were so many low points but the nadir surely came just before the interval when the captain Marko Marin \u2013 the one-time Chelsea midfielder \u2013 tried to trick past Tanguy Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\nMarin got his feet into a terrible tangle and, following an inadvertent touch, he merely presented the ball to Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, who strode away and played in Son.\n\nSpurs\u2019s man of the match looked to have taken a slightly heavy first touch but it did not matter because the Red Star goalkeeper, Milan Borjan, was frozen to the spot. Son had all the time he wanted to steer in his shot for 3-0.\n\nIt was Son who fired the feel-good factor, most overtly after his substitution on 68 minutes in front of the South Stand. He took his time walking off around the perimeter while the action continued, even shaking hands with some of the Spurs fans as he went.\n\nThe procession meant that Spurs moved to four points in Champions League Group B and vaulted over Red Star, who they visit in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThe Serbians are a different team on home soil but, on this evidence, it would be ridiculous to suggest that Pochettino\u2019s team could lose in Belgrade, even if they have veered away from the sublime rather too regularly this season. Spurs can see a path to the last 16.\n\nPochettino wanted a return to defensive solidity and he got it with the clean sheet while the result was not in doubt from the moment that Kane rose to flick home Lamela\u2019s ninth-minute corner.\n\nThe manager had prioritised pace and energy in his selection, with the three-man line behind Kane particularly full of the virtues.\n\nSon stood out. In the final sprinting drill of the warm-up, the forward had left his teammates for dead, finishing yards in front of them, and then tearing straight off down the tunnel.\n\nHe was up for this one and, from the first whistle, it was plain that his speed and non-stop movement would be problematic for Red Star.\n\nSon might have scored in the fifth minute, after he laid waste to a couple of dark blue shirts, skating away from them as if they were not there, only to shoot weakly at Borjan.\n\nWhen he scored in the 16th minute, it was no surprise and Spurs could savour the feeling of control. Once again, Lamela was the provider but this time, the assist was from open play and it was a beauty.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane\u2019s celebrates after scoring Tottenham\u2019s fifth goal.

Son did precisely that, reaching the ball on the bounce and directing it high into the net.\n\nRed Star were particularly awful in the opening quarter. They simply did not turn up and Spurs looked as if they could score with every attack.\n\nKane had slalomed through on 12 minutes only to lack power in his finish and, after Son\u2019s goal for 2-0, Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 worked Borjan with a curler and Lamela did likewise with a side-foot from Ben Davies\u2019s cross.\n\nRed Star stabilised a little in the second part of the first-half and the voices of their supporters could be heard, which was a surprise as they were supposed to have been excluded from the stadium as part of a penalty for racist behaviour at HJK Helsinki. How did they get in?\n\nAccording to Spurs, it was by \u201cillegally\u201d obtaining individual tickets on level 5 and congregating in a section behind one of the goals.\n\n\u201cStewards and police contained the group as it was too large a number to eject,\u201d a club spokesman said. An investigation is to follow.\n\nSpurs pressed on with Son\u2019s second after Marin\u2019s aberration and the only question after the interval came to concern how greatly Spurs would embellish the scoreline.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Lamela ought to have scored four times in the opening 15 minutes of the second period \u2013 which was a damning indictment on Red Star\u2019s efforts or the lack of them.\n\nLamela found the net when he fizzed a shot past Borjan from Aurier\u2019s cross after a trademark spin but there was also a stab over the crossbar, a horrible drag wide and a botched one-on-one.\n\nThe chances continued to come, with Son and Kane going close before the latter virtually passed the ball into the far corner to complete the rout.", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side won for the first time in this season\u2019s Champions League as they beat Red Star Belgrade 5-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8d7cb6d4e072297c3f0dc41f34c43ba1cee677/299_342_3098_1859/master/3098.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bfed4fba00ce5c7da8d9555aa1bfbd19", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
