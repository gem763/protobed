So, about that.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nPresident Trump at the White House on Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nUpdate: On Friday, the White House communications team published an essay claiming that The Post had not covered several news stories this summer which, in fact, we had. In fact, we not only had reported on the subjects they target, but we had already pointed out that we\u2019d done so in the below article from Wednesday. In the interest of highlighting the White House\u2019s incorrect claims, we\u2019re republishing it today.\n\nOn Sunday, The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker assessed President Trump\u2019s summer. It wasn\u2019t a particularly flattering review, noting several toxic political fights Trump launched out of the blue, a mass shooting tied to the president\u2019s rhetoric and a stumbling economy.\n\n\u201cWhite House officials promote the summer of 2019 as one of historic achievement for Trump, offering up a list of more than two dozen accomplishments,\u201d Rucker and Parker wrote. \u201cBut privately, many of the president\u2019s advisers and outside allies bemoan what they consider to be a period of missed opportunity and self-sabotage.\u201d\n\nThe White House communications team did not like this characterization. On Tuesday, it published a video purporting to show The Post what we \u201cmissed\u201d over the course of Trump\u2019s \u201csummer of winning.\u201d\n\n.@washingtonpost, is this what you call a \"lost summer?\" pic.twitter.com/M1XwUUSgYv \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 3, 2019\n\n(Note that the video echoes Trump\u2019s characterization of this newspaper as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post,\u201d a reference to owner Jeff Bezos, who is also the founder and CEO of the tech company.)\n\nAs subscribers are probably aware, The Post did not take the summer off. In fact, we covered each of the major stories included in the video package. It\u2019s just that, outside the White House, those individual accomplishments aren\u2019t really a powerful counterweight to the self-inflicted wounds Trump\u2019s presidency has suffered since the beginning of July. Most of those \u201cwins,\u201d in fact, are either executive orders making incremental changes, achievements that happened before the summer or announced changes that exist in limbo.\n\nHere is each \u201cwin,\u201d presented in the order shown in the video, with additional context.\n\nMexico tightens its southern border in response to a Trump tariff threat. The Post did report on this \u2014 but the change happened in early June.\n\nTrump eased the process for eliminating student debt for wounded veterans. We covered this, too. Somewhat lost in the discussion of the change is that Trump\u2019s change (by executive order) removed a requirement that veterans apply to have debt eliminated. The debt forgiveness already existed.\n\nWhen announcing the change in August, Trump didn\u2019t mention that aspect of the change.\n\n\u201cIn a few moments, I will sign a memorandum directing the Department of Education to eliminate every penny of federal student loan debt owed by American veterans who are completely and permanently disabled,\u201d he said. \u201cIncredible. Nobody can complain about that, right? Nobody can complain about that. The debt of these disabled veterans will be entirely erased. It\u2019ll be gone. And you\u2019ll sleep well tonight.\u201d\n\nImposition of new sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader. Here\u2019s The Post\u2019s report on the sanctions targeting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It includes a key line: \u201cBut experts are divided on the actual financial impact of imposing sanctions on Khamenei directly.\u201d\n\nTrump became the first president to enter North Korea. A historic moment, to be sure, but not necessarily a \u201cwin\u201d for the United States.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s still not clear how North Korea\u2019s efforts to build a robust nuclear arsenal have been significantly affected by Trump\u2019s outreach to the country. Last month, we reported on how North Korea\u2019s provocations have continued even since Trump greeted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the demilitarized zone between the Koreas. Trump conceded this month that Kim might be violating U.N. mandates but seemed simply to shrug at the possibility.\n\nTrump reached a \u201csafe third-party country\u201d agreement with Guatemala. The agreement (which you can read about in this article from the Amazon Washington Post) would, if finalized, potentially curtail some migration to the United States by allowing immigration officials to turn away some asylum seekers, who legally must seek asylum in the first safe country they enter.\n\nThe problem? \u201cGuatemala\u2019s constitutional court,\u201d The Post reported, \u201chas ruled any safe third country agreement would require legislative approval and the proposal has been widely criticized there.\u201d\n\nAn executive order increasing transparency in health-care pricing. As The Post\u2019s report notes, the order \u201cdoes not immediately trigger changes in the health-care system.\u201d Instead, \u201cit sets in motion several new rules [the Department of Health and Human Services] and other federal agencies will write and gives Trump a set of pro-consumer talking points in the first week after he formally announced his reelection campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump \u201cgot a lot accomplished\u201d at the G-7 conference in France. That, according to a Fox News clip included in the video. The accomplishments include \u2026\n\nA new trade deal with Japan. As our report on the agreement notes, any such deal would need congressional confirmation. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s not clear how close a deal is.\n\n\u201cWe still have some remaining work that has to be done at the working level,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said at the time of Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nTrump signed an executive order aimed at making kidney transplants easier. Here\u2019s The Post\u2019s report on that development.\n\nThe president met with various other foreign leaders. They included officials from Canada, Qatar, Pakistan, Mongolia, Romania and Poland. That latter meeting, for what it\u2019s worth, was in early June.\n\nTrump traveled to El Paso to meet with people affected by a mass shooting. It was this shooting that was apparently carried out by a gunman echoing Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. The Post covered Trump\u2019s visit \u2014 including that he at one point focused on how big his crowds had been at an event in the city earlier in the year.\n\nThe man featured in the video is a Trump supporter who was frustrated about coverage of Trump\u2019s visit. Other victims\u2019 families were frustrated by the stop.\n\nThe White House held an event focused on putting inmates back to work. The Post covered this, too \u2014 when it happened in mid-June.\n\nTrump signed an agreement on beef exports to the E.U. This, too, happened in mid-June, with Trump holding an event focused on it in early August.\n\nTrump held an event celebrating American energy production. The event wasn\u2019t really pegged to anything that happened over the summer. We did learn, though, that many in the audience were given a choice to attend or to not get paid.\n\nAgain, all of this should be weighed against the obvious trouble the White House has faced since summer began: Trump\u2019s racist tweets targeting Democratic elected officials. The warning signs about a recession, powered in part by Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China. A dip in his approval rating.\n\nThe White House thinks that the actions detailed above outweigh the negatives, proving that Trump \u201cwon\u201d all summer long. We\u2019ll leave that assertion up to you to evaluate.", "description": "In response to an article, the White House compiled a number of \"wins\" that The Post \"missed.\"", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9Zoam2SDmRTSpfScbg93__tD0KY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KMLIXYGPHUI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
