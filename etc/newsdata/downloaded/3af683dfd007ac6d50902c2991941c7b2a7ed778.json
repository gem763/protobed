But now we know it\u2019s cutting corners in at least one way: the Pixel 4 doesn\u2019t come with earbuds or a wired headphone dongle. The company is sending a clear message: Go wireless.\n\nThis is a bit of a shame. I actually thought Google\u2019s USB-C buds were quite good \u2013 certainly the best I\u2019ve heard among bundled earbuds that aren\u2019t meant to create an acoustic seal. Their omission is an especially odd choice considering you can\u2019t even buy the new true wireless Pixel Buds until spring of 2020. You\u2019ll have to wait a while if you want the full Google experience.\n\nYou can definitely get better-sounding headphones for a similar price, but nothing I\u2019m aware of with such deep Google Assistant integration. It\u2019s still a great option if you want decent sound quality, a comfortable fit, ambient awareness, and quick, reliable interactions with the Google Assistant. It can do almost anything the fancier wireless Pixel Buds or other Assistant-enabled headphones can.\n\nThe USB-C to 3.5mm dongle will set you back $12, and you can still buy Google\u2019s USB-C buds for 30 bucks. Or you know, find them for half that price on eBay.\n\nRead next: RIP Clips: Palm-sized AI-powered camera joins the Google graveyard", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F10%2FGoogle-USB-C-Pixel-Buds-1-of-1.jpg&signature=0854b4dcfd582a2d65bc1eac0185ce61", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
