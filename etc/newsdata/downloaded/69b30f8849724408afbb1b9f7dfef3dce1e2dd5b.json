But MPs them rejected a plan to force it through the Commons in three days this week, demanding more time for scrutiny and debate.\n\nThe Government then shelved it.\n\nNo 10 said today it would be prepared pull out all the stops to give MPs time before November 6 - including early starts and late sittings, even recalling Parliament to sit this coming weekend - if they approved an election.\n\nWill Labour back it?\n\nIt is not clear if Labour will back it, and even if Jeremy Corbyn agrees he could face a rebellion from pro-Remain backbenchers.\n\nMr Corbyn and senior figures are said to be keen - grassroots group Momentum has said 'bring it on'.\n\nBut many MPs are said to fear a drubbing by voters after months of Brexit dithering.\n\nSo even if he whips them to support the Government there is no guarantee it will pass.\n\nMr Corbyn said tonight he will only back Boris Johnson's offer of a general election when a no-deal Brexit is 'off the table'.\n\nIn an interview, the Labour leader appeared to keep his powder dry, saying: 'Take no-deal off the table and we absolutely support a general election.\n\n'I've been calling for an election ever since the last one because this country needs one to deal with all the social injustice issues - but no-deal must be taken off the table.'\n\nThis leaves open the possibility he could support an election if the delay to Brexit is long enough.\n\nReports suggest that Labour could abstain in Monday's vote, meaning Mr Corbyn could avoid the embarrassment of a major rebellion.\n\nWhat will happen if they don't back the plan?\n\nIf Labour rejects Boris Johnson's election plan, chaos again reigns.\n\nThe twin parts of the PM's deal are reliant on each other.\n\nNo 10 has been very clear that if Labour does not vote for the election on Monday there will be no extra time for the Wab, it will be pulled again, they 'must agree to an election first'.\n\nThat leaves Parliament, and the nation, in deadlock as it is now.\n\nMr Johnson will again have had his path to a deal or an election cut off by Parliament.\n\nHe would have little option but to perform the parliamentary equivalent of throwing a tantrum and taking his toys home.\n\nHe could go on a political 'strike' refusing to table legislation. But given how little has been done in past months because of the Brexit gridlock, critics might suggest that few people will notice.\n\nMr Corbyn said tonight he will only back Boris Johnson's offer of a general election when a no-deal Brexit is 'off the table'. But he left open the chance that he could back a vote once the EU decides on a Brexit delay\n\nCan Boris Johnson force an election in any other way? What about a vote of no confidence?\n\nUnder the terms of the FTPA he needs a super-majority - 434 MPs - to support him to force an election. So without Labour backing that route is blocked.\n\nHe could invite the opposition to push for a vote of no confidence in his leadership.\n\nIf that passes it gives the opposition 14 days in which to form a rival administration, otherwise a general election is automatically triggered. But Labour seem unlikely to fall into that trap.\n\nProposals for a government of national unity (GNU) that could push through a Brexit delay made up of opposition MPs collapsed last month.\n\nLabour insisted Mr Corbyn would have to be made interim prime minister but the Lib Dems refused to support him.\n\nIn any case given that the GNU was set up to request a Brexit delay, and that has been requested already, it would serve no purpose.\n\nHow long has the EU said it will delay Brexit?\n\nBoris is expected by Monday at the latest to have been handed his humiliating Brexit extension.\n\nSome leaders, led by France's Emmanuel Macron, have been pushing for a short extension to focus MPs minds on passing the Wab, perhaps of 15 days.\n\nBut after discussions between the PM, Germany's Angela Merkel and European Council president Donald Tusk this week No 10 is understood to be resigned to a three-month extension, which can be cut short if a deal is approved.\n\nEU leaders could reveal the length of the extension tomorrow if there is agreement on a date. If there is division a special summit, most likely on Monday, could be announced tomorrow.\n\nThe announcement could come via Twitter, after a letter is send to Downing Street from Brussels.\n\nCan MPs/Boris get Brexit done sooner?\n\nIt would require the opposition parties to all completely reverse their rhetoric and voting positions to allow the Wab to be passed in a matter of days with minimal scrutiny. So it seems very, very unlikely.\n\nAs mentioned above, No 10 appears resigned to a long extension to Brexit.\n\nDoes this mean there could be No Deal on January 31 \u2013 or before?\n\nThe only way this could realistically happen is if the EU offers the UK a Brextension of three months or less and then says it is the last that will be offered.\n\nBut despite some murmurings of discontent from Mr Macron Brussels has been consistent that a No Deal Brexit will not happen because of its actions, suggesting they will grnt further delays if required.\n\nIt depends if there is a limit to the patience of other EU leaders that can force a change in that position.\n\nCould there be a second referendum?\n\nBoris Johnson has consistently ruled one out, and Jeremy Corbyn has resisted pressure to demand one before a general election. So the prospect of a referendum in the near future appears slim.", "description": "The PMs offer of an election tied to his Brexit deal is an attempt to break the chains of months of deadlock.
