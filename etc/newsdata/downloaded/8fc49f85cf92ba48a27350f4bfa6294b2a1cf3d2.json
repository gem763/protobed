A capacity 30,000 crowd is expected at the Partizan Stadium for United\u2019s first visit here since 1966.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer said United would follow Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol, which could culminate in referee Xavier Estrada Fernandez taking the teams off, should they encounter the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d.\n\nThe United manager revealed he convened a meeting in the wake of the racist abuse suffered by England\u2019s black players during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia and that Rashford, one of those abused, and Maguire relived the experience.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of what happened in Bulgaria, we had a meeting with the boys and we\u2019ve gone through the protocol,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cBut I believe in people and I\u2019m sure the atmosphere here will be fantastic. We\u2019ll try to keep them quiet by playing good football. We trust Uefa and, as Savo [Milosevic, the Partizan manager] said, hopefully it\u2019s a celebration of football.", "description": "Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire have given their Manchester United team-mates a frank account of the \u201csickening\u201d racist abuse England players suffered in Bulgaria last week as they steal themselves for the threat of more ugly scenes in Serbia on Thursday night.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213916549-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvyIhey5-bbhpfCG1b5cFTdIoh1MzqKoDRaJh9ydTQVI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
