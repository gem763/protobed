I was a child when I let it go. Of this moment I remember only the bright orange carpet of our lounge, the spiral rug. When someone remarked on my \u201cracket\u201d, I guess my head dropped and floor is all I saw. But as I was eight or nine, and I\u2019m now 47, I can\u2019t be sure. I know only this: in that moment, I shut my mouth to singing. For decades, scarcely a song seeped out.\n\nAll my life, I have tried to square the longing to sing with the fear of being heard. There have been times \u2013 as a teenager in love with a guitarist, for instance, and at my nan\u2019s funeral \u2013 when I have yearned to join my voice with others\u2019 voices. At birthday celebrations, I latch on to the handful of low notes familiar from speech, like finding a cluster of friends at a party of strangers, and skip every other word. My version goes: \u201cHappy birthday \u2026 Happy birthday \u2026 Happy \u2026 Susan \u2026 you!\u201d Karaoke was invented the year before I was born, but I have never tried it.\n\nInstead, I developed a sort of soundless singing, in which the one safe place to do it was in my head. I am only now learning that I had in effect joined a vast, global choir of silent singers, all scarred by some childhood slight and unable to find a home in any song.\n\nMindful of my impediment, I have tried to encourage my children to sing, so I have sung to them \u2013 the exception to my silence \u2013 not as if no one is listening, but as if no one had told me I couldn\u2019t. \u201cMummy has a beautiful voice,\u201d they say. And although this sounds kind rather than truthful, I have decided, after more than three decades of silence, to find and own up to my singing voice \u2013 this part of me that is neither muscle nor bone, that I cannot put a finger on but which engages three-quarters of my torso (according to Anne Karpf, in her book The Human Voice).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There you have it!\u2019 Singing coach Eleanor Wood.

Why do I feel fine speaking in daily life, but phobic about anyone outside my children\u2019s bedrooms hearing me string together two melodic notes? The voice in my head, which I know all too well, is quiet and deep. But if the average vocal range of an adult is two octaves, what might my voice do if given freedom to roam?\n\nTo find out, I have arranged to meet Eleanor Wood, a singing coach at London\u2019s City Academy. I know that the only way to end my silence is to conjure an expectant audience and constrain myself to keep the appointment. The studio is five minutes from my office, but it is not an easy walk. I sing random notes aloud as I go, but my metaphorical ear is so attuned to my metaphorical voice I have no idea if I am audible to anyone but me.\n\nIn the tiny piano room the fan is humming, the chairs are creaking. What noise will I make? \u201cWhat if I\u2019m out of tune?\u201d I ask Wood. \u201cDo people ever open their mouths and nothing comes out?\u201d It\u2019s like being at the doctor\u2019s and asking a multitude of questions to delay the inevitable examination. \u201cI\u2019d like a diagnosis of my voice,\u201d I quaver.\n\n\u201cWe can totally do that,\u201d says Wood, a classically trained soprano. \u201cFirst we\u2019re just going to use our voices. Wake them up a bit.\u201d She straightens my posture and together we hum a \u201csiren\u201d, from the bottom of our voices to the top. Wood\u2019s voice is clear and strong, whereas mine likes to curl up in small spaces. It easily hides inside hers. But then Wood strikes a key and asks me to find the note alone. \u201cNear!\u201d she says. \u201cPretty near!\u201d\n\nWe do this exercise trilling \u201clip bubbles\u201d, rolling Rs, and mini-scales, like taking our voices up and down a very short ladder. I try not to flinch at my racket while Wood says \u201cAmazing!\u201d and \u201cAwesome!\u201d and \u201cThere you have it!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paula tries some singing exercises with Eleanor Wood. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nI have chosen to sing Manic Monday by the Bangles and Bob Dylan\u2019s Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right: I\u2019d like to replay a sliver of my teen years with the volume up. Maybe because Wood and I have spent so long making silly noises, I don\u2019t balk when she explains that I have only one voice, and the one that I use to read bedtime stories or answer a phone is the same one that, in a few minutes, I will use to sing.\n\nThankfully, Manic Monday has a range mostly limited to four notes, and is heavy on \u201cspeech quality\u201d, as defined by the legendary speech pathologist Jo Estill \u2013 a style of singing that is close to talking. While Wood plays piano or clicks her fingers, I chant the words, then articulate them more melodically. I hear myself grow louder.\n\nThere is no line between speech and song \u2013 all speaking voices contain fragments of higher pitches, harmonics \u2013 so if there is a moment when I start to sing, I don\u2019t notice it. I\u2019m just drawing out the pitches from my speech and sustaining them. Besides, I\u2019m distracted by the lyrics. Did people really go to work worrying about whether their beds were made?\n\nAfterwards, Wood swivels on her piano stool. \u201cIn terms of a diagnosis, you sound very comfortable singing low notes. The upper range needs exploring. It\u2019s not just about your range, though, but colour and quality, which I would say is very warm. It\u2019s tentative,\u201d Wood says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got all the bones of a voice.\u201d\n\nI feel elated, as if my singing skeleton is coming to life. So it\u2019s a shock to get home and listen to my recording of the lesson. Only Wood\u2019s voice is audible! Mine, which had resonated with appalling volume in my head, is nowhere to be found. I\u2019m a ghost on the tape.\n\nWhere is my voice? Why does it sound so loud to me but not to anyone else? \u201cI guess we all hear ourselves a little differently,\u201d Wood says diplomatically.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paula gets to grips with the Bangles\u2019 Eternal Flame. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nAccording to Christella Antoni, a speech and voice therapist, \u201cWe tend to hear our voice higher than it is, because it is conducted through the skull bones.\u201d But Johan Sundberg, author of The Science of the Singing Voice, says: \u201cOne\u2019s own voice doesn\u2019t sound to others as it sounds to you for the simple reason that your ears are not in front of your mouth.\u201d He says my voice \u201cis clear, with no leakage\u201d.\n\nA voice traverses its owner\u2019s body, amplifying our inner dimension for the outside world. \u201cYou were musical before you were anything else,\u201d says Graham Welch, chair of music education at University College London, and author of The Oxford Handbook of Singing. \u201cWhat you\u2019re hearing inside the womb is the melody, the rhythm, the tonal colours.\u201d Apparently, consonants can\u2019t travel through amniotic fluid.\n\n\u201cThe voice is one of the first sensorial aspects of contact with the mother,\u201d says Rosine Perelberg, president of the Institute of Psychoanalysis. She mentions Julia Kristeva\u2019s concept of the semiotic, \u201ca sensorial domain which includes sounds and voice of the mother\u201d, and which gets repressed by the realm of rules and laws, Perelberg says. \u201cBut it\u2019s never totally repressed. It survives in different ways. You recovered it when you became a mother, first in private relationships with your own children, and now in public.\u201d\n\nWelch has encountered many people who \u201ccarry the psychological burden\u201d of having had their singing criticised in childhood \u2013 what Perelberg describes as \u201ca prohibition\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got PhDs on this,\u201d Welch says, waving to shelves laden with heavy volumes containing the stories of other members of the silent choir. \u201cI talk to people in their 80s, and they can tell me about that moment as if it were yesterday.\u201d It\u2019s such a pity because by the age of 11 only 2-3% of children sing out of tune, he says.\n\nIn my next lesson with City Academy\u2019s Wood, I practise the Bangles\u2019 Eternal Flame. At the end of the hour, I can hit six notes, from middle C to A. The higher notes seem to ring in my head, the lower ones in my chest. I\u2019m learning that I will not find my voice in any one place. But when I sing \u2018\u201cflaaaame\u201d, on that A above middle C, a sound comes out of my mouth that I never knew I could make. It is powerful and secure and true. I don\u2019t always find it, but at least I know it\u2019s there.\n\nBy the fourth lesson, Eternal Flame is taking shape. I sing all the way back to my desk. I sing (very quietly) in the queue for a sandwich. I sing on my bike and I don\u2019t stop when I see a pedestrian. At yoga, I om with everyone else. I\u2019m like one of those people who are pleased with their work in the gym and want to go everywhere in a muscle tee.\n\nAt home the children are singing Eternal Flame. The whole house hums with it. I listen to the recording of my latest lesson and my voice is on the tape. I sing along with me. The neighbours must be asking each other, how much longer are they all going to be singing Eternal Flame? Quite a while, because \u201cIs this burning an eternal flame?\u201d requires a top C that I still can\u2019t reach.\n\nI would like to know whether I hover around the deep notes for psychological reasons, to keep a low profile, or physiological ones, because I have a deep voice.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d says Welch. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a deep voice.\u201d (The thickness of a person\u2019s neck determines this, he says, and mine isn\u2019t thick.) Welch motions me to his computer, where a program called Sing&See visually tracks pitch and reveals that I speak at around G3 (the G below middle C). \u201cTypical for an adult female in western Europe,\u201d he remarks. Though when women wore corsets, their voices were higher, and if I weren\u2019t emancipated, I might be a soprano.\n\n\u201cYes, but you\u2019ve got at least two to three octaves above your speaking voice,\u201d Welch says. \u201cGive me a scream.\u201d\n\nI do, and Sing&See records it as an A5 \u2013 five notes above the C I cannot find.\n\nGetting the sound out is a bit of \u201ca black art\u201d says William Thorpe, who developed Sing&See at Sydney University in the early 2000s. I\u2019m not surprised when Thorpe says he receives many emails from people who were put off singing in childhood \u2013 the silent choir grows \u2013 but are finding their voices in retirement. He himself was brother to a sibling who was \u201cthe musical one\u201d.\n\nIn my fourth lesson, Wood helps me reach the top C by \u201cthinking down\u201d to create more space. Raising eyebrows also \u201clifts the soft palate\u201d, she adds. I assume the lifting is metaphorical but Wood asks me to yawn. She sounds excited. \u201cBecause of my angle, I can see your soft palate go up!\u201d\n\nSinging is full of new intimacies. I am discovering crevices in my skull, canals and hinges that I never knew existed. Singing into my \u201cmask\u201d \u2013 around my nose and sinuses \u2013 helps to land notes. So does \u201ctwanging it\u201d (twang being another of Estill\u2019s six vocal qualities): I can go higher if I sing \u201cNyis this burning nyan eternal flame?\u201d\n\nIn my fourth lesson, I hit the top C. I can sing all of Eternal Flame apart from the final note where Bangles vocalist Susanna Hoffs goes somewhere I doubt I\u2019ll ever follow. \u201cPaula, boom!\u201d Wood says.\n\nWelch doesn\u2019t know why I\u2019m worried. \u201cThere is nothing unusual about your voice. Bog standard,\u201d he says. Great! But if everything is so normal, what makes my voice mine?\n\nWell, I\u2019m the only one to have truly heard it. \u201cNo one else has heard all of your voice. Nor will they. The lower-frequency parts go through your body,\u201d Welch explains. We are all, in a way, our own private audience.\n\nThe voice in our heads and our physical voice \u201care very, very closely related,\u201d according to Welch. \u201cBecause you cannot speak or write without hearing it.\u201d Even when we are listening to another person speak or sing, our vocal folds move in sympathy. \u201cYours are moving now.\u201d\n\nI sing Happy Birthday down the phone to my mother. I\u2019m still singing Eternal Flame. In my final lesson, I perform it for the head of singing at City Academy. The kids have started to tell me to shut up, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m obsessed. I can scream at C6. The kettle beeps at D7. My partner enrols me on a singing session at City Academy where six of the eight other attendees say that as children they were discouraged from singing. After the taster, I join a beginners\u2019 course. I perform Eternal Flame solo to my 12 fellow students.\n\n\u201cThe voice in our heads can seem rather controlling,\u201d says psychologist Sally Austen, who herself stopped singing in her teens after family teasing. \u201cYou can never get rid of that voice,\u201d she says. But singing can temporarily silence it. Or, better still, create a new kind of harmony.\n\nCity Academy runs singing courses for adults from beginners through to advanced levels, and six choirs across London.\n\nPaula received five free lessons.
