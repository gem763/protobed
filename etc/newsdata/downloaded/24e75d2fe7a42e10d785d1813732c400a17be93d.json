Schiff (D-Calif.). (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nPresident Trump is constantly grasping for anything to exploit to discredit his opponents as Democrats\u2019 early impeachment inquiry produces mounting problems for him. And House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the Democrats\u2019 face of the inquiry, has handed the president at least two things to yank on within as many weeks.\n\nWe now know that Schiff\u2019s committee had a heads-up about the whistleblower complaint because the whistleblower approached Schiff\u2019s staff for guidance before filing the complaint. The New York Times first reported this week that the whistleblower reached out to Schiff\u2019s staff concerned that attempts to flag what the whistleblower found alarming weren\u2019t getting due attention.\n\nSchiff himself didn\u2019t know the exact contents of the complaint, and he says he did not directly talk to this person. But the heads-up gave Schiff a tactical advantage; he knew to press hard to get this person\u2019s complaint when the Trump administration initially held it.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily so bad in itself. But when asked by reporters about his dealings with the whistleblower pre-complaint numerous times, Schiff either didn\u2019t answer the question or, as The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker reported, \u201cclearly made a statement that was false. He now says he was answering the wrong question, but if that was the case he should have quickly corrected the record.\u201d They gave him Four Pinnochios, which is reserved for a \u201cwhopper\u201d of a false statement.\n\nRepublicans on the committee can frame this as Schiff keeping damaging information about Trump to himself. Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) was once considered a potentially persuadable Republican to support an impeachment inquiry. Now she\u2019s asking for Schiff to step down.\n\nRe-upping my tweet from last week given the breaking news today that Adam Schiff had early access to the whistleblower & DID NOT share it with his own committee - instead he manipulated this information & played partisan political games. He should immediately step down as Chair. https://t.co/809PzeUjBs \u2014 Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) October 2, 2019\n\nThe other foible Schiff\u2019s critics are exploiting happened on the first big day of this impeachment inquiry, in the first big moment. In his opening statement in a hearing with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about the complaint, just two days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced her backing for the inquiry, Schiff paraphrased the Ukraine call that the White House had released a rough transcript of a day earlier. Here\u2019s how Schiff recounted the call:\n\nAnd so what happened on that call? Zelensky begins by ingratiating himself and he tries to enlist the support of the President. He expresses his interest in meeting with the President and says his country wants to acquire more weapons from us to defend itself. And what is the President\u2019s response? Well, it reads like a classic organized crime shakedown. Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the President communicates: We\u2019ve been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. And I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it on this and on that. I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people, and not just any people. I\u2019m going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr. He\u2019s got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I\u2019m going to put you in touch with Rudy. You\u2019re going to love him. Trust me. You know what I\u2019m asking? And so I\u2019m only going to say this a few more times in a few more ways. And by the way, don\u2019t call me again. I\u2019ll call you when you\u2019ve done what I asked. This is in sum and character what the President was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine.\n\nStefanik immediately jumped on the fact that Schiff paraphrased the call rather than reading what was in the rough transcript, accusing him of politicizing the investigation into the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nIt is disturbing and outrageous that Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff opens up a hearing of this importance with improvised fake dialogue between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. We should focus on the facts. \u2014 Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) September 26, 2019\n\nRepublicans even drafted a measure to censure Schiff over the statement, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) signed onto it. Politico reported that they\u2019ll try to force a vote on it when Congress comes back later this month. That won\u2019t be approved by a Democratic-controlled House, but it\u2019s a notably aggressive move from the GOP as they struggle to explain the broader allegations about Trump.\n\nLet\u2019s do a quick fact check on those critiques. Schiff gets the general gist of the call right: Trump says that the United States has been \u201cvery good\u201d to Ukraine, and after Ukraine\u2019s president asks for more missiles to defend the country from Russian-backed separatists, Trump says, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d\n\nAnd depending on how you count it, Trump asks for help digging up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter and/or conspiracy theories about a hacked Democratic National Committee server about seven times. And he does tell the Ukrainian president to talk to Trump\u2019s attorney general and personal lawyer \u2014 both men we know were traveling the globe for Trump\u2019s political purposes. Then Trump ends the call by saying Attorney General William P. Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, will call the president of Ukraine.\n\nParaphrasing is a necessary part of relaying what happens. Journalists do it all the time, aiming to do it to the best of their ability to portray the truth.\n\nBut what made Schiff\u2019s decision to paraphrase so perplexing is that the rough transcript of the call he has found so damaging to Trump was right there, willingly released by the White House. All he had to do was read it, rather than risk accusations he was misrepresenting the call by summarizing it.\n\nIt seems that Schiff wanted to add context (by saying, for example, that Barr has \u201cgot the whole weight of law enforcement behind him,\u201d which Trump never said but was certainly implied by the mention of the attorney general\u2019s name.) Still, why put words in his mouth when Trump has his own potentially damaging ones right there?\n\nThat being said, Republicans such as Stefanik also misrepresented what Schiff did. Some of the dialogue was fake, and Schiff added a partisan flair to it, but Schiff didn\u2019t egregiously misconstrue things in his recounting. Republican defenders of Trump are the ones asserting Trump said or didn\u2019t say things when the transcript itself shows they are wrong.\n\nSchiff\u2019s problem is this: Trump doesn\u2019t much care about context when bashing his enemies. He\u2019s adept at turning anything he can grasp into a blunt hammer. According to an archive of his tweet by the website Factba.se, Trump has tweeted about Schiff and his paraphrasing of the call at least half a dozen times in a week. Trump pulls this out when his administration is being criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nRep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\n...sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nIt may not be a fair standard that Schiff has to be held to a much higher level of conduct than the focus of his impeachment investigation. But that\u2019s reality for House Democrats. Trump is often willing to distort or even ignore facts to defend himself. So the last thing Democrats need to do is drop stuff in his lap to use, as Schiff has done these past two weeks.", "description": "House Democrats can't much afford to hand President Trump blunt instruments to wield against them, and Adam Schiff has twice done so.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vwlXF9I1YsFDdI4C-RkF6-DQdNA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XWLBAHXGMAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
