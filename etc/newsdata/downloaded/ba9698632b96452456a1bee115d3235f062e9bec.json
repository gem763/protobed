While Southgate is not minded to go to three at the back ahead of Monday\u2019s qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia, he concedes something must change ahead of next year\u2019s finals.\n\nEngland gave up a chance to qualify early for the tournament with defeat in Prague so must win their final three games to be sure of topping Group A. Even if they do, they are no longer guaranteed to be one of the six top seeds and could even face the prospect of being placed in the same group as world champions France, or Belgium.\n\nMichael Keane\u2019s partnership with Harry Maguire looks shaky and the likelihood is that Southgate will turn to Joe Gomez. He now faces some serious selection decisions especially with players who, in his view, are struggling at their clubs.\n\nSouthgate said: \u201cI think we are in a difficult situation in terms of the players that have played international football with us in that area of the pitch [defence] and who are playing regularly with their clubs. So, that\u2019s part of the reason we didn\u2019t do that [switch to a three-man back line against the Czechs]. It\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve considered and I don\u2019t think we can dismiss. I\u2019m not sure, ahead of Monday, if that\u2019s the right thing to do but we\u2019re very aware and assessing those things.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate is considering returning to the defensive back line of three centre-halves and wing-backs that England adopted for last summer\u2019s World Cup finals, and then tried to leave behind as they embarked on the next phase of their development.", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Matt Law", "Chief Football Writer", "Football News Correspondent", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212761981-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOnF-pGyuMayIW5_daymjxlkiei7Fym8CYupLAL_REXo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
