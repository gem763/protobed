A devastating drought made Balkisa\u2019s harvests fail, made food prices soar, and then forced her family apart. Her husband migrated in search of work to earn money to provide for his young family, leaving her heavily pregnant and alone. \u201cSometimes if my husband had money he sent it to me so I could eat. Sometimes the money just doesn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to give birth.\u201d But seven-month-old twins Hassan and Ousseni are lucky, they were born the night after Red Cross support came to Tombokiery village, Niger. The Niger Red Cross provided the family with a small cash grant. \u201cA Niger Red Cross volunteer told me to go first because she saw how exhausted I was. I used the money to buy food, then I went back home to sleep feeling relieved.

In the Sahel rainfall has become erratic and wet seasons that people rely on are shrinking. The Sahel has one of the driest climates in the world, people who live here have always been incredibly resilient, are now having to adapt and survive to ever harsher conditions. The region is almost one degree hotter than in 1970 and could rise by several degrees by the end of the century. Record hot spells, desertification, loss of crops and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are reducing people\u2019s ability to feed themselves.

For those who want to enjoy a cocktail without the hangover, or have given up libations altogether, these beverages offer the perfect alternative - as they are made using distilling methods typically reserved for alcohol.\n\nThe \u201cfaux-spirits\u201d, as Whole Foods dubs them, mean you can have a martini sans vodka.\n\nThe trend will also include unique options such as hops-infused sparkling waters or zero-proof aperitifs.\n\nThis year\u2019s trend report was compiled with the help of more than 50 Whole Foods Market team members, including local foragers, regional and global buyers and culinary experts.\n\nWhile the supermarket predicts 2019\u2019s trends such as faux-meat to continue increasing in popularity, expect it to make way for, or incorporate, alternative sweeteners and West African flavours.", "description": "As the year of probiotics and kelp comes to a close, Whole Foods has predicted the food trends that we can expect to see - and eat - in 2020.\u00a0 The supermarket released its fifth annual report, where it reveals the most-anticipated and innovative food trends for the upcoming year, according to the market\u2019s global buyers and experts.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/15/istock-1046016472.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
