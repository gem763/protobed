We believe that by targeting C5a receptors, IPH5401 is a potentially first-in-class therapeutic antibody for cancer treatment. The preliminary clinical data set from the STELLAR-001 dose-escalation trial prompted us to start and broaden the expansion cohorts in three different settings where anti-PD-(L)1 have shown no or limited activity,\" said Pierre Dodion, Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. \"In addition, the survival data set for the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab in head and neck cancer support further development in IO-pretreated and IO-na\u00efve patients, populations with high unmet medical need.\"\n\nKey Highlights from IPH5401's STELLAR-001 Study\n\nIn the STELLAR-001 dose-escalation study, 14 patients were included across four doses. Six patients had NSCLC, five had HCC, two had urothelial carcinoma (UCC), and one had renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\n\nThe combination of IPH5401 and durvalumab was reported to be well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicity was reported and no dose relationship was observed regarding safety. Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed full receptor saturation at all dose levels and provided the basis for dose selection for the expansion cohorts.\n\nTwelve patients were evaluated for efficacy. Early activity signals were observed in HCC and NSCLC patients, which included:\n\nOne confirmed partial response was reported in a HCC patient with prior progression after nivolumab\n\nOne prolonged stable disease (40 weeks) was reported in a NSCLC patient with prior progression after nivolumab\n\nThe Company will initiate the planned expansion cohorts in NSCLC patients with secondary resistance to prior IO treatment and in IO-na\u00efve HCC patients to generate additional safety and efficacy data as well as additional translational analyses on tumor biopsies. In addition, based on the data generated in the dose escalation, the Company plans to add an additional cohort testing IPH5401 in combination with durvalumab in IO-pretreated HCC patients, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nKey highlights from the Phase II study of monalizumab in combination with cetuximab in patients with R/M SCCHN, one-year survival data\n\nIn a cohort of 40 SCCHN patients previously treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitors, the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and a response rate of 27.5% (36% and 17% in IO-na\u00efve and IO-pretreated patients, respectively). Responses were observed in platinum-resistant patients and human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and negative patients.\n\nAdditional efficacy highlights included:\n\nMedian overall survival of 8.5 months with median follow-up time of 17 months;\n\nTrend for improved survival in IO-pretreated patients (14.1 months in IO-pretreated patients and 7.8 months in IO na\u00efve patients); and\n\n12-month overall survival rate of 44% (60% in IO-pretreated and 32% in IO na\u00efve patients)\n\nThese data suggest that the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab may provide promising response rates and favorable trends in overall survival. The Company is moving forward with the planned expansion cohorts in IO-pretreated and IO-na\u00efve R/M SCCHN patients.\n\nAbout IPH5401:\n\nIPH5401 is a potentially first-in-class therapeutic antibody that specifically binds and blocks C5a receptors (C5aR) expressed on subsets of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and neutrophils. Part of the innate immune system, these types of cells promote tumor growth by secreting inflammatory and angiogenic factors, potently suppress anti-tumor T and NK cells and hamper the activities of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nC5a, a factor in the complement cascade, is often overexpressed in tumors, where it attracts and activates MDSCs and neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment. Preliminary evidence suggests high expression of the C5a receptor in both NSCLC and HCC.\n\nAbout Monalizumab:\n\nMonalizumab is a potentially first-in-class dual checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.\n\nNKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E, cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Hence, monalizumab may re-establish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells. Monalizumab may also enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies.\n\nAstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab in October 2018 through a co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015. The ongoing clinical development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in combination strategies.\n\nAbout Durvalumab:\n\nDurvalumab, a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, blocks PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 and CD80 on T cells, countering the tumor's immune-evading tactics and inducing an immune response.\n\nAs part of a broad development program, durvalumab is being investigated as monotherapy and in combination with IO, small molecules, and chemotherapies across a range of tumors and stages of disease.\n\nAbout Cetuximab:\n\nCetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody blocking oncogenic signaling and inducing Fc\u03b3 receptor-mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). NK cells mediate cetuximab-induced ADCC against SCCHN. Genetic and preclinical experiments suggest that ADCC can be enhanced by NK-stimulators.\n\nThe activity of cetuximab single agent in R/M SCCHN is limited with a 12.6% ORR, a median PFS of 2.3 months and a median OS of 5.8 months (Vermorken et al, JCO 2007).\n\nAbout Innate Pharma:\n\nInnate Pharma S.A. is a commercial-stage, oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.\n\nInnate Pharma's commercial-stage product, Lumoxiti, in-licensed from AstraZeneca, was approved by the FDA in September 2018.
