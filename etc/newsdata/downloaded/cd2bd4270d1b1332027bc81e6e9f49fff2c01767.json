He was acquitted both times.\n\nWhy is Mr Haradinaj standing?\n\nThe special court has yet to announce any indictments - and will not even reveal the identity of suspects. So Mr Haradinaj and his AAK party are free to take part in the election.\n\nIn fact, his visit to The Hague may even prove a vote-winner.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Vjosa Osmani, the leader of Kosovo's oldest party, is hoping to become its first female prime minister\n\n\"The fact that he has been called before the tribunal is seen by many Kosovo Albanians as a deep injustice,\" says James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans specialist at the London School of Economics.\n\n\"This is seen as calling into question Kosovo's right to exist. People believe that what the leaders were doing during the war was legitimate. They were fighting a campaign against Serbian oppression and should not be held accountable for this - and Haradinaj was a hero of this conflict.\"\n\nWhy is there a trade war with Serbia?\n\nMr Haradinaj imposed a 100% tariff on imports from Serbia last November, in retaliation for Belgrade blocking Kosovo's membership of international organisations. It has been a popular policy, even though it has increased the prices of many items in Kosovo's shops.\n\nMany people view it as standing up to Serbia, which has refused to recognise Kosovo's 2008 unilateral declaration of independence. Scores of other countries will not recognise Kosovo until Serbia changes its stance, leaving Kosovo in limbo.\n\nIn fact, Serbia has been stepping up efforts to persuade countries to withdraw their recognition of Kosovo's independence. It claims that 15 countries have reversed their previous position.\n\nIn practical terms this makes little difference to Kosovo's status. As long as China and Russia do not recognise its legitimacy, it has no chance of joining the United Nations and many other international institutions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Albanians and Serbs remain divided after the war\n\nBut reducing recognitions among UN member states below 50% would be a propaganda blow. Kosovo says it is recognised by 116 of the UN's 193 countries, but Serbia says the figure is 97.\n\nMr Haradinaj hopes the tariffs on Serbia will force the issue.\n\n\"The way out of where we are is a comprehensive agreement on recognition between Serbia and Kosovo,\" he told me.\n\n\"That would resolve not only the tariffs, but every other dispute between two nations that are neighbours. We are ready to stand up for ourselves forever - we have no alternative.\"\n\nSo is Mr Haradinaj's party the favourite?\n\nNot at all. For many voters, modern-day concerns trump past glories.\n\n\"People are deeply aggrieved at the way Kosovo's society has evolved,\" says James Ker-Lindsay.\n\n\"They believe corruption is rampant - and there are severe questions about the state of the economy. And they don't feel the existing political parties have been dealing with that.\"\n\nThat could drive voters towards Vetevendosje - an Albanian nationalist movement with a strong anti-corruption message - or Kosovo's oldest party, the LDK. Its leader Vjosa Osmani is hoping to become Kosovo's first female prime minister.\n\nCould a new government steer Kosovo towards EU membership?\n\nThe tariffs have torpedoed one of the EU's main foreign policy initiatives - normalisation talks between Belgrade and Pristina.\n\nKosovo has repeatedly ignored pleas from Brussels to revoke the 100% tariffs on Serbian imports - a stance that harms its chances of gaining visa-free travel to the EU, never mind EU membership talks.\n\nWhen a new government emerges from post-election coalition negotiations, rebuilding relations with Brussels must be near the top of its agenda.", "description": "The prime minister's past role as a guerrilla fighter against Serbia dominates Sunday's vote.", "authors": ["Guy Delauney", "Bbc News", "Balkans Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11B98/production/_109100627_057054723-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
