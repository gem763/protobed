Bush.\n\nMr. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, have bitterly fought over the administration\u2019s toughest foreign policy challenges, including Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan, among other issues.\n\nAt the root of their differences was how they viewed the baddest dictators on the planet.\n\nMr. Trump continues to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite Russia\u2019s interference in U.S. elections and its seizure of the Crimean peninsula that was condemned by America\u2019s allies.\n\nMr. Bolton believes, as U.S. intelligence agencies have shown, that Moscow was behind the cyberwar during the elections. Mr. Trump said Mr. Putin told him Russia had no part in it, and the president believes him.\n\nMr. Bolton wouldn\u2019t trust North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as far as he could throw him. Mr. Trump described their talks as a \u201clove\u201d affair. At his second summit with Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Mr. Trump ordered that Mr. Bolton not be included.\n\nMr. Bolton has argued that the Taliban are cutthroats and cannot be trusted, opposing the U.S.-Taliban negotiations that Mr. Trump has been seeking.\n\nHe has good reason not to trust any agreement with the Taliban.\n\n\u201cIt gets worse,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Marc A. Thiessen writes this week. \u201cThe Taliban team with whom the Trump administration has been negotiating included five senior Taliban commanders \u2014 the \u2018Taliban Five\u2019 \u2014 who were held at Guantanamo for 13 years before Obama freed them in exchange for U.S. Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. They include Mullah Fazell Mazloom, who according to his Guantanamo military file is \u201cwanted by the UN for possible war crimes while serving as a \u2018Taliban Army Chief of Staff\u2019 and has \u2018operational associations with significant al-Qaeda and other extremist personnel.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton is the celebrated \u201cfire bell in the night\u201d who was warning Mr. Trump not to deal with bad actors because they will double-cross you up one side and down the other.\n\nBoth he and others in the administration argued that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t have to negotiate with Taliban extremists to pull out of Afghanistan, or at least draw down our forces there.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip style, without knowing what or who he is dealing with across the table, or their subversive motivations, was often spot on.\n\nHe leaves office the same way he entered it, with both guns blazing, offering a clear-eyed of our enemies and trying to keep Mr. Trump from giving away the store.\n\nHe leaves behind him some pretty good reviews from his critics.\n\n\u201cPerversely, consider how out of sync he was with Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities, Mr. Bolton managed to accomplish a fair amount,\u201d a Post editorial said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cLast week he helped persuade Mr. Trump to torpedo an agreement with the Afghan Taliban \u2026 just before it was to be signed,\u201d the newspaper said.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, he induced the president to set aside State\u2019s work on a possible interim deal with North Korea on its nuclear program, and instead demand that dictator Kim Jong-un immediately commit to giving up all weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nNot a stellar record, but one that for the time being kept us from going down the wrong road.\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
