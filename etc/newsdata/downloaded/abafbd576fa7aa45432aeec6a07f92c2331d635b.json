She was a management consultant for Bain & Co in San Francisco before that.\n\nShe will lead the project to launch passenger air travel in Melbourne by 2023, announced by the company in June.\n\nIf you thought those images of an Uber drone flying above the Melbourne skyline were just a PR gimmick, think again \u2014 the ridesharing company has just announced a permanent executive to make it a reality.\n\nIn a blog post, Uber announced Natalie Malligan will take on the role of head of Uber Air in Australia and responsibility getting the project off the ground (literally).\n\nMalligan \u2014 who will relocate to Melbourne for the position and was formerly Uber\u2019s head of cities for Australia and New Zealand \u2014 will have the unenviable task of liaising with Victorian politicians, federal aviation authorities, the airport bureaucracy and the general public as the Uber Air offering takes shape.\n\n\u201cNatalie is passionate about Uber\u2019s vision for the future of cities and creating seamless multi-modal transportation for Australians both on the ground and in the air, especially in cities like Melbourne where congestion is an issue,\u201d the blog post said.\n\nIn June the company announced Melbourne as the only city outside the US chosen for a pilot of the Uber Air business, which could see regular app users ferried across the city in electric passenger drones unveiled by the company at its Elevate conference in Washington, DC or other aircraft.\n\nThe Victorian capital was chosen due to its \u201cunique demographic and geospatial factors and culture of innovation and technology\u201d, Uber\u2019s regional general manager Susan Anderson said at the time.\n\nThe plan is to have Uber Air tests up and running by 2020 and commercial passengers onboard by 2023 in the three test cities of Melbourne, Dallas and Los Angeles \u2013 at least that was the stated plan back in June.\n\nThe blog post announcing Malligan\u2019s appointment indicating there may be some wiggle room in the timeline, which is not surprising given Australia\u2019s penchant for overzealous regulation.\n\n\u201cLaunching Uber Air is going to be a lengthy journey but Natalie says she is committed for the long-haul,\u201d the post said. Business Insider Australia has approached Uber for confirmation of the original timeline.\n\nEither way, you\u2019d imagine there are easier jobs out there than getting the green light for electric passenger drones to operate in a major Australian city.\n\nConsidering Malligan cut her teeth advising on major private equity deals for blue chip management consultancy Bain & Company in San Francisco, she is likely experienced in dealing with high stakes gambits and government relations.\n\nIt\u2019s experience it looks like she will need.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
