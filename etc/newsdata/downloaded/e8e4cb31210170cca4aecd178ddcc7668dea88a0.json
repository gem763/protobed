Several whistleblowers raised allegations against Hook and others, prompting the inspector general to analyze emails and other documents as part of the probe. The recommendation for Hook is set to be outlined in a new report by the inspector general. It is due out within the next several weeks.\n\nHook is one of the main Trump officials helping craft and promote the administration\u2019s Iran policy. He liaises with the Treasury Department and the White House on Iran sanctions and Jared Kushner\u2019s proposed Middle East peace plan. Hook worked with former National Security Adviser John Bolton during his time as the United Nations ambassador, and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson brought him in to work on Middle East policy. Hook has traveled overseas to places like Israel and Saudi Arabia to work on gaining the confidence of allies on the U.S.\u2019 so-called strategy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported in March that Hook was among at least eight administration officials the inspector general was examining over reprisals against career department personnel for their perceived disloyalty to the president. At that time the investigation was in its final stages. The State Department at the time told reporters that \u201cthe personnel accusation\u201d was \u201cwithout merit and has no evidentiary, procedural, or legal basis.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s taken several months for the IG office to get to this point. This report, although not 100 percent finalized, is the second part of a larger study about the State Department. The first section found that State Department officials harassed, mistreated, and retaliated against employees deemed disloyal to President Trump. It did not mention Hook.\n\nHook is reportedly in the running for national security adviser following Bolton\u2019s departure earlier this week. Any findings of fault or recommendations for discipline would likely hurt his chances at moving up in the national security ranks. Both officials who spoke to The Daily Beast agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the State Department investigation.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe public first learned about the State Department\u2019s investigation when in early 2017 Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, a career official and Iran expert, had her assignment to Hook\u2019s policy-planning directorate cut short. The Conservative Review soon after wrote that Nowrouzzadeh, an \u201cIran deal architect,\u201d had \u201cburrowed into the government under President Trump.\u201d\n\nOutside parties, including Newt Gingrich, sent that article around to State Department officials. Hook received the article and sent it to a career staffer in the policy planning office, Edward Lacey. Lacey, in an email first reported by Politico, called Nowrouzzadeh and other colleagues \u201cObama/Clinton loyalists.\u201d\n\nLacey told Hook, \u201cI succeeded in ousting five whose details expired before your arrival.\u201d\n\nHook replied, \u201cEd\u2013 This is helpful. Let\u2019s discuss on Monday.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that email and several others that have come under scrutiny by the State IG\u2019s office, sources say.\n\nWhen Nowrouzzadeh was reassigned, Politico reported on it. State officials attempted to craft a response for the piece. \u201c[H]ow about saying something like: \u2018It is regular practice for detailees to return to their parent office at the completion of their detail assignments,\u2019\u201d Lacey emailed colleagues on April 17, 2017, according to emails obtained by The Daily Beast.\n\nNowrouzzadeh replied: \u201cEd\u2014My assignment was not \u2018completed.\u2019\u201d\n\nReps. Eliot Engel (D-NY) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) in August 2018 expressed alarm about Hook\u2019s appointment as the special representative for Iran. \u201cInternal documents... show [Hook] engaging in significant acts of political retaliation against career State Department employees,\u201d they wrote to Pompeo.\n\nSince that time, the State Department has handed over investigative documents and emails to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
