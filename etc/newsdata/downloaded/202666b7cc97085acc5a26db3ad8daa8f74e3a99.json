Further down the page, an \"editorial recommendations\" section showed lipsticks picked by InStyle magazine as part of an Amazon affiliate program, followed by lipsticks that offer quick shipping through Amazon Prime.\n\nThe example shows how Amazon's approach to advertising is getting harder for advertisers to navigate.\n\nAfter years of Amazon testing and adding new ad formats and retail placements on its platform, some advertisers now say it's getting harder for them to stand out.\n\nAdvertisers are increasingly looking to Amazon as an alternative to Facebook and Google, which dominate digital advertising, and such challenges could dampen Amazon's growth as it starts to build out its advertising business.\n\nSome of Amazon's tests, like mobile video ads, are available for advertisers to buy. Others support Amazon's own private-label products and programs like Amazon's Choice that are run by Amazon's retail teams and are not available to advertisers.\n\n\"It makes it hard for an advertiser to figure out how to best position their brand because it's largely out of their control,\" Travis Johnson, the head of Dentsu Aegis Network's Amazon-focused arm Sellwin Consulting, said. \"It feels as though lots of brands are getting hijacked at the last minute by all of these labels and badges across their products.\"\n\nRead more: Inside Amazon's growing ad business: Everything we know about how the e-commerce giant is making inroads with marketers\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon pushed back on the idea that its promotions and retail programs hurt advertisers, pointing to 150 new tools the company has rolled out this year to help third-party sellers. The tools include new bidding controls and dashboards that sellers can use to promote their products.\n\n\"We continue adding tools to help selling partners maximize advertising effectiveness,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're also creating more opportunities for brands to focus on storytelling \u2014 helping customers to easily shop for and discover brands in our store, in the same way we work to make it easy for them to find, discover, and buy great products from across our vast selection.\"\n\nBrands have to fend off competitors on Amazon\n\nIn interviews with a handful of agencies, sources named a few new placements that show how the number of placements on Amazon are growing and getting harder to cut through.\n\nFor example, a placement being tested called posts shows a carousel of recommended items that users can browse and buy from product pages. Sellers cannot pay for their products to appear in the carousel, but Johnson said he expected that would change and that advertisers would eventually have to pay if they wanted to keep competitors from showing their own products.\n\nAnother example is a new ad format called sponsored display that uses machine learning to target shoppers. The ad format shows up on Amazon product pages \u2014 including those of the advertiser's competition \u2014 and on external publishers' websites.\n\nMelissa Burdick, the president of Pacvue, which helps brands buy Amazon ads programmatically, estimated that about 30% of the copy on a seller's product page actually ends up promoting other products. It's formats like these that Amazon often tests and introduces, making it hard for advertisers to keep up, she said.\n\n\"There's no announcement, it just rolls out \u2014 the bigger challenge is explaining that to executives who aren't in it every day,\" she said.\n\nAd prices are a mixed bag for advertisers\n\nWith more placements in search results and on product pages, agencies are seeing a mixed bag in pricing.\n\nMarin Software found that prices for sponsored brands and sponsored products, two of Amazon's most popular ad formats, have decreased over the past year. In August, the average cost per click of Amazon's ads was $1.17, down from $1.46 in the same month last year, according to the company.\n\nBut John Ghiorso, the founder and CEO of Amazon's ad agency Orca Pacific, said the cost per click for all Amazon ad formats has increased by a low-double-digit percentage over the past year.\n\n\"The easy wins that a lot of brands could get two or three years ago by just showing up are not nearly as available,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisers are learning new ways to hack Amazon\n\nGhiorso said advertisers were increasingly using vendors to help them navigate Amazon's ad business. Amazon even put out a directory to help advertisers find such companies.\n\n\"If you look hard enough and are sophisticated enough, there's still a lot of positive ROI opportunity there \u2014 it just isn't staring itself in the face like it used to be,\" he said.\n\nOrca Pacific has used third-party tools to do sophisticated targeting like dayparting. It found that the best time to advertise toys on Amazon was between 6 and 9 p.m., when parents are home, for example.\n\nAnother agency, Mindshare, tried to hack Amazon's algorithm of recommended products. The agency worked with Cheerios to offer a free box of cereal to shoppers who spent more than $40 on Amazon Prime Day in 2018. Sending out the boxes got Cheerios to be a \"recommended\" product on Amazon that appears at the top of searches for \"cereal.\"\n\n\"It is only too crowded if the message being delivered to you is not customized to what you want,\" Jeff Malmad, the executive director and lead at Shop Plus at Mindshare US, said.", "description": "As Amazon tests more ad formats and retail promotions, advertisers say it is increasingly getting harder to advertise there.", "authors": ["Lauren Johnson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7d65752e22af3c08482e52-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
