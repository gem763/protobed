But in a nation in which nearly half of Americans own a dog, according to a Gallup poll, it was unlikely that would last.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201csilent paw-fessional\u201d would be thrust in the spotlight.\n\nOn Monday, Trump boosted the story, tweeting a declassified photograph of the furry special operator -- a Belgian Malinois -- in an armored vest. In the image, its ears stood alert and its tongue hung loose -- and it appeared that the Secret Very Good Boy might actually be a Secret Very Good Girl.\n\n\u201cWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe decision followed nearly a whole day of the Pentagon wrestling with how much to say about the pooch.\n\nThree U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to sensitivity about the raid, said Monday morning that the dog\u2019s identity was classified because of its affiliation with a classified unit. Releasing the name, they said, ran the risk of identifying the service members to which it was assigned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy midday, the Pentagon\u2019s top general was answering questions at a news conference about the prized pooch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not releasing the name of the dog right now,\u201d said Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cThe dog is still in theater.\u201d\n\nMilley, standing alongside Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, said that the dog \u201cperformed a tremendous service, as they all do.\u201d It was \u201cslightly wounded and fully recovering\u201d and had rejoined its handler.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to release just yet photos or names of dogs or anything else,\u201d Milley said.\n\n\u201cProtecting his identity,\u201d Esper interjected.\n\n\u201cProtecting the dog\u2019s identity,\u201d Milley agreed.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. officials told several reporters after the news conference the dog\u2019s breed -- a common one in Special Operations, where the Belgian Malinois is prized for its intelligence, athleticism and ferocity when required. Then came Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nAD\n\nThe dog\u2019s participation in the operation adds a new hero to military lore. It follows in the paw prints of Cairo, who participated in the 2011 raid by Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden, but dogs have served in the military for decades.\n\nWhile the dog in the latest raid was wounded, it will not be eligible for a Purple Heart or valor medal. The U.S. military once recognized canines for such exceptional service, but suspended the practice amid complaints that it diminished the service of humans, according to an Army history of military working dogs. Other countries, such as Britain, still award dogs for valor.\n\nAD", "description": "The Belgian Malinois was wounded in the operation against Islamic State leader.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jcZ2wFk2KqOeFquRjMxzpP4AETU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HCBU4GHZYEI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
