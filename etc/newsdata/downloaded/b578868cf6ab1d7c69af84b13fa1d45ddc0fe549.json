Furthermore, deregulation does not always mean rolling back rules. More often than not it means modernizing or simplifying or streamlining regulations.\u201d\n\nThe official touted EPA stats, showing the agency has taken 46 deregulatory actions under the Trump administration with another 45 in the pipeline. The actions that have been finalized have saved $3.7 billion in regulatory costs, he said.\n\nWheeler also said the EPA was also one of the best at complying with one of President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE\u2019s earliest executive orders requiring agencies to get rid of two regulations for every new one they finalized, cutting 26 regulations while creating four new ones.\n\nBut the agency\u2019s approach has been heavily criticized by former EPA employees and administrators, including Republicans, who said that under the Trump administration the agency has abandoned its mission while systematically undermining protections.\n\n\u201cThe deregulation which Wheeler brags about removes completely or weakens the clean air, water or land standards so there is no incentive for industry to change their existing technologies no matter how polluting they are,\u201d said Betsy Southerland, who was director of the Office of Science and Technology at the EPA\u2019s Office of Water under the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWheeler also continues to cite the cost savings of removing or weakening standards but never mentions the enormous benefits lost.\u201d\n\nThe EPA\u2019s own inspector general said the agency has \u201cexceeded the deregulatory goals\u201d of Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d executive order, and it estimated the regulatory savings were nearly $100 million for 2017 and 2018.\n\nWheeler used the session to defend a number of EPA decisions taken since he was confirmed in February, including revoking a California waiver that allows them to set more stringent tailpipe emissions standards \u2014\u201cFederalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the entire country,\u201d \u2014 to a proposal to roll back Obama-era mileage standards for cars.\n\n\u201cAs prices fall more Americans will be able to purchase newer, cleaner, safer vehicles -- vehicles that they want to buy,\u201d he said, saying scrapping regulations help provide certainty for companies.\n\nBut Bob Perciasepe, the deputy administrator at the EPA from 2009 to 2014, said automakers\u2019 opposition to the rule shows that industries sometimes favor regulations and that they can help provide certainty needed to spur innovation.\n\nPerciasepe said innovation might be driven by a company\u2019s altruism or a desire to find efficiency, but the government\u2019s role is to help make sure that technology is deployed, not just at one company, but also by their competitors if it helps decrease pollution.\n\n\u201cSomething has to drive the deployment and something has to incentivize why someone is innovating in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not binary where you innovate and then don\u2019t need regulations or you regulate and then don\u2019t have innovation.\u201d\n\nWheeler also criticized the media for failing to highly the agency\u2019s achievements more frequently.\n\n\u201cMy frustration with some of the media is they don\u2019t tell this side of the story. If you had similar reductions in opioid addiction or gang violence it would lead the nightly news,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made tremendous enviro progress as a nation and the public needs to know that.\u201d\n\nBut some who keep a watchful eye on the EPA don\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cThis truth hurts Andrew Wheeler plainly, so he bashes the news media for reporting the truth, accurately and fairly. The Trump EPA deserves zero credit for any improvements resulting from the prior administration's rules, especially when Trump rollbacks have increased air and water pollution,\u201d said John Walke, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\n\u201cEvery time he speaks it just proves his tenure is a rollback juggernaut, from the name of the speech to boasting about 26 rollbacks versus four new rules. He just can\u2019t escape the fact that he wants to boast about that on the one hand and then bash the media for reporting it on the other hand. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Andrew Wheeler took to the microphone Tuesday to espouse the benefits of deregulation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/wheelerandrew_040219sr4_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
