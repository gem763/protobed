(AP) - The Royals put a memorable finish on a forgettable 2019 season.\n\nJorge Soler locked up the AL home run crown with his 48th, Brett Phillips drove a game-ending sacrifice fly in the ninth inning and Kansas City beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in manager Ned Yost\u2019s final game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone in the field in the top of the ninth was like, \u2018Give me that at-bat.\u2019 I know that\u2019s what was going through my head,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli turned over coaching duties to infielder Ehire Adrianza, and AL Central-winning Minnesota hit three homers to push its major league record to 307 this season - one ahead of the New York Yankees. Minnesota finished the season 101-61, one victory shy of the franchise record set in 1965.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody will ever forget the \u2018Bomba Squad,\u2019\u201d Baldelli said.\n\nSoler connected in the first inning, becoming the first Royal to lead the AL in home runs and surpassing Rafael Palmeiro for the most long balls by a Cuban-born player. The 27-year-old\u2019s previous career high was 12.\n\nBut the Royals also lost 100-plus games for the second straight season, finishing only two games better than last year at 59-103. Yost said he won\u2019t miss much about the game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one part of me that wants to continue doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done my part. I want to go spend time with my family, especially my wife. We\u2019ve been apart for six or seven months a year, for the most part. We\u2019re both healthy and we want to go do some things together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident in my part in helping this team get back into fait condition. I\u2019m walking out the door feeling good with no regrets.\u201d\n\nIan Kennedy (3-2) pitched a scoreless ninth before the Royals rallied against rookie Brusdar Graterol (1-1). Humberto Arteaga led off with a double, and Nick Dini moved him to third with a bloop single, setting up Phillips\u2019 fly to right that lifted the Royals to 59-103.\n\nKansas City\u2019s Hunter Dozier led off the eighth with his 10th triple of the season, matching teammates Whit Merrifield and Adalberto Mondesi for the AL lead. It marks the first time since 1984 (Astros) that a team has had three players with at least 10 triples. Dozier scored on Ryan O\u2019Hearn\u2019s tying double.\n\nBaldelli tabbed Adrianza to lead because he thinks he has the makings of a future manager. Adrianza filled out the lineup card and called the shots during the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool, A.D.\u2019s first game managing on the same day that a very great and memorable manager on the other side is managing his last day,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cGoing out to home plate was actually pretty nice, too. Ned mentioned that he\u2019s only gone out to home plate a few times over the course of his tenure. And I was very happy to be out there with him on his last day.\u201d\n\nThe Twins scored three runs in the first on back-to-back home runs by C.J. Cron -a two-run shot - and Jake Cave. It\u2019s the 12th time this season the Twins have homered back-to-back. Jason Castro added a solo shot in the fifth.\n\nThe Royals drew 17,875 in their final game. They finished with an average of 18,267 fans, 2,290 fewer than 2018.\n\nWhit Merrifield became the second right-handed hitter to lead the majors in hits in back-to-back years (Kirby Puckett, 1988-89).\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTwins Minnesota is uncertain if rookie 3B Luis Arraez will be ready for the AL Division Series after spraining his right ankle Saturday. \u201cIt could be a few days, it could be a week,\u201d said head athletic trainer Tony Leo. \u201cWe\u2019re not really putting a timeline on this one, obviously, with where we are.\u201d Arraez is hitting .334 in 92 games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Twins will have a few days off before opening their ALDS in New York on Friday. Baldelli has not named any starters for the ALDS.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Royals put a memorable finish on a forgettable 2019 season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/twins_royals_baseball_94196_c0-156-3732-2331_s1770x1032.jpg?236352a73d4b9d76a74533a441916b58d8582dae", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
