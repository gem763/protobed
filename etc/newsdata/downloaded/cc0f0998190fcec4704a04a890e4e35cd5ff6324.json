Cheyenne is among the best retirement cities due to its affordability, as well as healthcare quality.\u201d\n\nWorst cities for retirement\n\nRetirees may be surprised to find that the worst cities for retirees was Stockton, California, followed by Bridgeport, Connecticut and Warwick, Rhode Island. These cities ranked low on all of the metrics.\n\nFour elderly residents of Cheyenne, Wyoming, cross a downtown intersection, May 2, 2004.

In particular, \u201cFresno and Bakersfield ranked particularly low in terms of activities and healthcare.\u201d\n\nHigh costs of living, expensive in-home services, lack of physicians, the poor quality of thee public health system, and the lack of activity options altogether made these cities \u201cless-than-friendly elderly labor markets,\u201d she added.\n\nAging America demands infrastructure changes\n\nAcross generations, the needs of older Americans haven\u2019t changed much, American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Director of Liveable Communities Rodney Harrell told Yahoo Finance. But the overall infrastructure \u2014 or environment \u2014 demands attention, he added.\n\nThe biggest costs retired people face has been \u201crelatively consistent,\u201d Harrell explained. \u201cHousing and transportation are now and have been highest costs for most people, for at least several decades.\u201d\n\nA man rides the subway in Hollywood, California May 29, 2013.

But now that same community is isolating, and they feel stuck and alone, because they don't have the ability to get around that they once did.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
