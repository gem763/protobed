Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's Director of European Affairs, arrived on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning ahead of a closed-door deposition as part of the House's impeachment inquiry. Vindman, who listened to the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, became the first current White House official to testify in the probe despite a blanket White House directive against doing so.\n\n\"Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call 'concerned' today\u2019s Never Trumper witness,\" Trump tweeted. \"Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call.

I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\" Vindman planned to say.\n\nVindman immigrated to the United States from Ukraine as a child, has served in the Army and was wounded in an IED attack in Iraq, and received a Purple Heart.\n\nDespite Vindman's career serving in the U.S. military and government, conservative defenders of the president attacked Vindman's loyalty by focusing on his heritage.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump makes a statement in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 27, 2019.

Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, said on CNN Tuesday morning. \u201cI don't know that he's concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand that. We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from.\"\n\n(MORE: After criticism, Pelosi calls for full House vote on impeachment inquiry, transparency)\n\nResponding to a question from a Fox News host Monday night that broached Vindman's Ukrainian background, John Yoo, a former Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, said that \"some people might call\" Vindman's interactions with Ukrainian officials \"espionage.\"\n\nBut not all Republicans agreed with that line of attack.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, called the attacks \u201cabsurd and terribly unfortunate,\u201d and Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that some Republicans like Duffy have questioned the patriotism of witnesses like Vindman.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday attacked a White House National Security Council official as a \"Never Trumper\" just before he was to tell House impeachment investigators he raised alarms about what Trump told Ukraine's president during a July phone call.", "authors": ["Ben Gittleson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QqgMg5i8Ux5WSiF7UosLGQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/alexander-vindman4-sh-ml-191029_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
