To raise $30,000 for breast cancer with the Whitney pink stockings,' the advertisement said alongside the McGrath Foundation logo.\n\nIn just five days the lingerie retailer managed to donate $30,000 to charity.\n\nHowever, they have since been told to remove the promotional content that had the McGrath Foundation branded on it.\n\nManaging Director Eloise Monaghan hit back at the claims saying they were 'ridiculous' and offensive to women in 2019\n\nThe controversial move came after feminist campaign group Collective Shout accused the company of 'pinkwashing'.\n\nThe campaign group wrote a letter to the McGrath Foundation which expressed concern about the images and accused the retailer of using 'pornified portrayals of women'.\n\n'Pairing a breast cancer charity with the sexual objectification of women is a classic example of 'pinkwashing' - a term used to describe companies that exploit breast cancer charities for profit and image enhancement,' Collective Shout wrote.\n\nA spokeswoman for the McGrath Foundation said the images have since been taken down from the campaign.", "description": "Australian label Honey Birdette  has been accused of sexualising breast cancer and 'pinkwashing', after many believed the 'sexy' ad was soft porn.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/19488584-0-image-a-14_1570621438567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
