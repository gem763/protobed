Lawmakers are focused on whether the president abused his office by leveraging diplomatic engagement, and possibly military aid, to secure investigations that would damage the Bidens.\n\nHill worked closely on Ukraine matters with two diplomats who have become central to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified last week about her understanding of Giuliani\u2019s efforts to remove her from her post. Giuliani and some of his allies in Ukraine saw Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, as a threat to their financial and political interests, she told lawmakers last week.\n\nHill also worked closely with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who in text messages obtained and later released by House Democrats appeared to defend Trump against the allegation that he was pursuing investigations in exchange for U.S. support to Ukraine.\n\nSondland is scheduled to appear before impeachment investigators Thursday and plans to say that the context of a text message insisting there was no quid pro quo in play was given to him directly by Trump in a phone call, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \u201cIt\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.\n\nAlmost as soon as Hill\u2019s testimony began, the proceeding was disrupted by a partisan dispute.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) attempted to sit in on the deposition \u201cas a member of Congress,\u201d he said, arguing that \u201cif Adam Schiff and the House Democrats were so proud of their work, they would be willing to show it.\u201d\n\nGaetz sits on the Judiciary Committee but none of the three panels conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nSchiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the Democrats\u2019 pointman on the impeachment probe, objected to Gaetz joining. The question was then put to a parliamentarian, who decided that Gaetz should leave the room, which he did.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterwards, Gaetz continued to deride the proceedings as a \u201csham or charade,\u201d lamenting that because the full House has not voted on an impeachment process, \u201cthere are no rules\u201d and thus his presence should have been permitted.\n\nRepublicans also have argued that full transcripts of the depositions should be made public, a request that Democrats have so far declined.\n\nHill served on the National Security Council as senior director for Russia and Europe from mid-2017 until the week before Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a July 25 phone call that sparked an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s report and is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. A transcript of the phone call shows that during the exchange, Trump asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor,\u201d requesting Ukrainian officials look into both a debunked conspiracy theory regarding Ukraine\u2019s interference the 2016 U.S. election as well as the energy company Burisma, which paid Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to sit on its board. The former vice president is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHill will be the third high-ranking current or former diplomat that the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees will depose as part of their accelerating impeachment probe.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to block current and former officials from testifying, prompting lawmakers to issue subpoenas compelling their appearance. Hill is complying with a congressional subpoena and intends to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions, her lawyer said Monday. Yovanovitch also appeared last week pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHill, who previously served on the National Intelligence Council during the George W. Bush administration, is known for being a vocal critic of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and an institutionalist \u2014 stances that put her at odds with Trump\u2019s embrace of Russia\u2019s resurgent role in the region and Giuliani\u2019s style of maneuvering in Ukraine.\n\nAD", "description": "Fiona Hill resigned from her National Security Council post earlier this year.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jRKrwSeM9XcQ-d78vkaCff5ALzI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QZTU4HORYI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
