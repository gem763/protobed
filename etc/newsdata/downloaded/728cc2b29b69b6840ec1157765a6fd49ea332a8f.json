Former US senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who has previously spoken at MEK events, will also attend the Pompeo-Wallace event.\n\nOfficially, MEK will hold a separate event, according to the Washington Post, putting a small degree of separation between Pompeo and MEK itself.\n\nWhen asked about the meeting's links to MEK, a State Department official \"dismissed the concerns about the MEK's participation in Wallace's event, [ telling the Washington Post], \"Have you looked at the people attending the U.N.?\"\n\nMEK is currently based in an Albanian compound and does not report the sources of its funding. It has a long history of violence against civilians, hostility towards Israel in rhetoric that borders on anti-Semitic, and sponsorship of attacks against the West.\n\nDespite this, the group has managed to purchase its way to credibility in some US political circles by offering huge speaking fees to US lawmakers willing to share a stage with violent militants. A MEK front group called the National Council of Resistance of Iran is already using Pompeo's name in its propaganda.\n\nThe MEK supported the overthrow of the US-backed regime of the Shah in the 1970s conducting scores of terror attacks against US military and commercial targets inside Iran, as well as supporting the 1979 takeover of the US embassy.\n\nIt later broke with its revolutionary comrades and defected to Iraq, and the patronage of its president, Saddam Hussein.\n\nA US State Department analysis concluded that the group had killed six Americans, including military officers and civilians doing business in pre-revolutionary Iran, as well as thousands of Iranian civilians in terror attacks.\n\nThis history of aligning with two of America's most hated enemies in the Middle East \u2014 Iraq and Iran \u2014 along with its pursuit of a terror campaign inside Iran that killed thousands of civilians, a conclusion reached by the US State Department, led to the group being designated a terror organization by the US government until 2012.\n\nHow did a group widely considered among the most bizarre and violent in the region became acceptable company for current US government officials? Money.\n\nAfter the US invasion of Iraq and defeat of Saddam in 2003, the group immediately began throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars at anti-Iran politicians in Washington, usually in the form of speaking fees to address the group's rallies and events.\n\nFormer National Security Advisor John Bolton, former NYC mayor and current lawyer to the president Rudy Giuliani, former senator Joseph I. Lieberman, and former Vermont governor Howard Dean as well as a slew of lesser-known figures have all addressed the group and publicly taken up their cause. MEK is known for paying very large speaking fees.\n\nThis attention \u2014 and American desperation for a dissident group to support against the current Iranian regime \u2014 led to the group being delisted as a terrorist organization in 2012.\n\nEven if you set aside its history of murdering Americans and supporting despotic regimes, it is unlikely that the group will ever become a credible political partner of the US.\n\nThat's because in Iran, MEK is regarded as a bunch of traitors who fought alongside Saddam Hussein and have a history of murdering Iranian civilians in terror attacks.\n\n\"The fact that the Secretary of State is openly meeting with them will only serve to provoke the Iranians with little gain for the US or its interests,\" said Patrikarakos. He pointed out that the group is widely hated even by Iranians who otherwise oppose the current regime.\n\n\"Indeed, working with them discredits the West in the eyes of normal Iranians who otherwise aren't crazy about the Islamic Republic,\" he added.", "description": "Until 2012, the MEK group was designated a terror group by the US State Department.
