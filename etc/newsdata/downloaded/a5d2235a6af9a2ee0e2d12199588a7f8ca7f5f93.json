PRECIOUS-Gold rises ahead of U.S.-China trade negotiations\n\nOct 7 (Reuters) - Gold prices advanced on Monday as markets\n\nbraced for U.S.-China trade negotiations during the week with\n\nlesser hopes of a breakthrough, following a report that Chinese\n\nofficials may not be as willing to bend.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\n* Spot gold was up 0.3% to $1,508.23 per ounce as of\n\n0101 GMT. Prices had edged 0.5% higher in the previous week on\n\nfears of global economic slowdown.\n\n* U.S. gold futures GCv1 inched 0.1% higher to $1,513.90\n\nan ounce.\n\n* The U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies was\n\na shade lower in early trade. Asian markets too edged lower\n\nahead of the trade talks. USD/ MKTS/GLOB\n\n* The next round of U.S-China trade negotiations, likely to\n\nbe in Washington on Oct. 10-11, will be in focus to see if the\n\ntwo sides can end their year-long trade spat that has upset\n\neconomic growth around the world and raised concerns of a\n\npossible recession.\n\n* U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday there is a\n\n\"very good chance\" of a trade deal with China. * However, a report that Chinese officials may be\n\nincreasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by\n\nTrump has made this uncertain. * Ruffles in the U.S. political front also supported gold,\n\nwith a second whistleblower coming forward with knowledge of\n\nTrump's attempts to get the Ukrainian president to investigate a\n\npolitical rival, amid an impeachment battle that threatens the\n\nU.S. President's administration. * Meanwhile, a report on Friday showed jobs growth in the\n\nUnited States slowed down in September and wage growth stalled,\n\neven as unemployment dropped to a 50-year low.\n\n* The unemployment data drop pushed traders of U.S.\n\nshort-term interest rate futures to pare bets the Federal\n\nReserve will cut rates at both of its two upcoming meetings.\n\n* Elsewhere, twenty people were killed in an attack by\n\nsuspected jihadists on a gold-mining site in northern Burkina\n\nFaso, Senegal on Friday.
