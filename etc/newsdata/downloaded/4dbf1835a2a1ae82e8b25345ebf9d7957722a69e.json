There is a tremendous amount of talent coming through, and there is enormous potential for growth.\n\n\"The hard work starts now, and I am confident we can make a positive impact during our winter tours of New Zealand and South Africa.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGiles said: \"We are delighted to confirm Chris as England Men\u2019s head coach. We have gone through a thorough process and looked at all the options that were available to us. Chris was the standout candidate.\n\n\u201cI believe he is what we need to take our international teams forward.\n\n\"He is somebody we know well, but it is his intimate understanding of our structures and systems and his close relationships with Test captain Joe Root and white-ball captain Eoin Morgan that will help us develop our plans for the next few years.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"He has performed exceptionally well during his role as an assistant coach and has the ultimate respect of the players\u2019 that have worked with him.\n\n\u201cChris demonstrated in his interview a clear understanding and strategy of how both the red and white ball teams need to evolve. He has some detailed thoughts on what it will take to win the Ashes in Australia and win major ICC white-ball tournaments.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of years, he has been an integral member of developing the teams\u2019 culture and emerging a cohesive relationship across the team\u2019s management group.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cChris cares passionately about how we grow and develop the game through the county network. His relationships with the first-class game, in particular County Coaches and Directors of Cricket, will be invaluable.\n\n\u201cHaving led Essex to the County Championship title in 2017, his legacy is very much in evidence this campaign, which saw Essex win the domestic double of the Specsavers County Championship and the Vitality Blast.\n\n\u201cUltimately, his highest quality is that he is a winner and that will be an important part of the job as we look to strive to become the most respected team in the world across all formats.\u201d\n\nSilverwood will take charge as head coach for the first time on the upcoming tour of New Zealand.\n\nEngland face a five-match IT20 series starting on November 1 in Christchurch and two Tests against the Black Caps commencing on November 21 at the Bay Oval.", "description": "Former England cricket ace Silverwood has been promoted from his role as bowling coach", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528770.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1173592003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
