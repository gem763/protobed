Sorry. But, so is Donald Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, Sept. 1, as Hurricane Dorian approached, Trump tweeted:\n\n\u201cIn addition to Florida \u2014 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nHe repeated the erroneous assertion during a FEMA briefing that day, saying: \u201cAnd, I will say, the states \u2014 and it may get a little piece of a great place: It\u2019s called Alabama. And Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be.\u201d\n\nThe problem: Alabama as a target had been eliminated days earlier as scientists refined their models and projections with more up-to-date information.\n\nThe president had either made an honest mistake (that happens) or he hadn\u2019t kept track of more current briefings (that shouldn\u2019t happen) or both.
