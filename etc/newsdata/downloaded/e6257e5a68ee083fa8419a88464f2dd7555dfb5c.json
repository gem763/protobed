Users looking for a sneak-peek of Frozen 2 starring Josh Gad should be cautious and only stream and download directly from a reliable source. The safest thing to do is to wait for the official release instead of visiting a third-party website that could contain malware.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\n\u00b7 Refrain from using illegal streaming sites. When it comes to dangerous online behavior, using illegal streaming sites is the equivalent of spreading like wildfire to your device. Many illegal streaming sites are riddled with malware or adware disguised as pirated video files. Do yourself a favor and stream the show from a reputable source.\n\n\u00b7 Protect your online realm with a cybersecurity solution. This can help protect you from malware, phishing attacks, and other threats.\n\n\u00b7 Use a Web Reputation tool. Using a Web reputation tool alerts users when they are about to go to a malicious website.\n\n\u00b7 Use parental control software. Kids are fans of celebrities too, so ensure that limits are set for your child on the devices they use and use parental control software to help minimise exposure to potentially malicious or inappropriate websites.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
