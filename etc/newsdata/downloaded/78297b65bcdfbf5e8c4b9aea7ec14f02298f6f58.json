Bush Crew Highlight Rising Suicides in Military", "language": "en", "text": "A string of suicides by sailors from the Navy aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush last week has prompted an investigation by local and federal authorities\u2014but it reflects a tragic trend in the Navy, the U.S. military more broadly and across the country.\n\nThe Naval Criminal Investigative Service is currently assisting local authorities in Portsmouth and Norfolk in investigating three deaths \u2014 one that took place on Sept. 14 and two that occurred on Sept. 19, Navy officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe ship\u2019s commanding officer, Capt. Sean Bailey, acknowledged the suicides in a Facebook post on Monday and said, \u201cNow is the time to come together as a crew and as a family to grieve, to support each other, and to care for those in need.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart is broken,\u201d he said.\n\nCmdr. Jennifer Cragg, public affairs officer for the Naval Air Force Atlantic, said in a statement to TIME that Aviation Ordnanceman 1st Class Vincent Vincent Forline was found dead off base on Sept. 14. Chief Electronics Technician, Nuclear James Shelton and Airman Ethan Stuart were found dead in separate incidents at off-base locations on Sept. 19.\n\nCragg said a special psychiatric rapid intervention team is on board the aircraft carrier to assist those grieving, in addition to chaplains, psychologists and counselors. She added that the sailors \u201cdid not serve in the same departments and there does not appear to be a connection between their deaths.\u201d The USS George H.W. Bush, is currently at Norfolk Naval Shipyard and has 2,800 sailors serving on it, Cragg said.\n\nThis is not the first time the USS George H. W. Bush has grieved sailors because of suicide; the crew has lost two other sailors over the last two years\u2014one in November 2017 and another in July 2019.\n\nThe deaths are part of a troubling trend of suicides within the Navy and U.S. military.\n\nIn 2018, 325 active-duty members died by suicide \u2014the highest number since the Pentagon began tracking suicides in 2001, according to Military.com.\n\nIn 2018, a total of 68 active-duty Navy service members died by suicide, the U.S. Navy reports. That number, as well as the rate of suicide, has been steadily increasing over the last decade. In 2017, 65 active-duty members died, followed by 52 in 2016 and 43 in 2015.\n\nSuicides have not just been rising in the military. The last time the nationwide suicide rates were this high was in World War II, according to federal data. And while veterans and military service members contribute to that total, the casualty count also includes victims of the opioid crisis and those likely affected by widespread social media use and high stress. In 2017, 14 out of 100,000 Americans died by suicide, according to to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s a 33% increase since 1999.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said in a blog post last week that sailors often exhibit signs of distress, but their fellow service members \u201cweren\u2019t able to recognize them as indicators of suicide risk.\u201d He encouraged Navy personnel to \u201ctrust your gut,\u201d \u201cuse intrusive leadership\u201d and \u201clook your shipmates in the eyes, and ask, \u2018Are you okay?'\u201d\n\nGilday said he expects leaders to \u201cbuild and support Command Resilience Teams\u201d and \u201cset a tone within their commands where sailors feel comfortable and have the courage to ask for help without fear of judgement or consequences.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense lists a number of mental health resources for service members and veterans, including a crisis support helpline for those affected by sexual assault or others who want to speak to a counselor and an initiative that \u201cpays essential household bills while a wounded service member or veteran is attending residential treatment for a traumatic brain injury or PTSD.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. In emergencies, call 911, or seek care from a local hospital or mental health provider.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A string of suicides by sailors from the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS George H.W.
