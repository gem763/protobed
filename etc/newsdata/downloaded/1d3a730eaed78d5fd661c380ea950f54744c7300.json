And once he\u2019s your only candidate for David Copperfield, certain things flow,\u201d said Loader.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosalind Eleazar at the The Personal History of David Copperfield premiere at the Toronto film festival.

The casting decisions were intended to reflect the diversity of Victorian London.\n\n\u201cIt was like Manhattan in the 1920s,\u201d said Iannucci. \u201cLondon then and London now was and is a global city. We wanted to make a city that the audience would recognise and the characters would recognise.\u201d\n\nThe director said there is a big debate at the moment about \u201cwhat Britain is and what it is not\u201d, and how it has become excluded on the world stage, and the film\u2019s outlook offers another perspective. \u201cI wanted to celebrate what I think Britain is, which is something more lively and vibrant and cheery,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m an optimist.\u201d\n\nThe story was originally published in serial form between 1849-1850, but Iannucci, whose previous films include In the Loop and The Death of Stalin, said the themes Dickens explored were still relevant in contemporary Britain. The satirist said Copperfield\u2019s story was riddled with \u201cstatus anxiety\u201d, which was something that was still ingrained in modern Britain. \u201cHe\u2019s wondering if he fits in and his background, is he making the right friends? It just felt very modern.\u201d\n\nHomelessness is another theme of the film and the charity Shelter is thanked in the credits for its help with the research for the film. Iannucci said he was shocked at how much power landlords \u2013 like Uriah Heep, who is played by Ben Whishaw in the film \u2013 still have.\n\n\u201cThe shocking thing is that the status of landlords hasn\u2019t changed in the UK, they have many more powers and less oversight than they do on the European mainland,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s set in 1840 we wanted it to touch on this thing that is happening now.\u201d", "description": "The Personal History Of David Copperfield has a diverse cast to reflect reality of Victorian London", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8910a19985b4d3f705ec22644dc330f42cba3bf/127_21_961_577/master/961.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d075949bb753611356f6d8d222329a60"}
