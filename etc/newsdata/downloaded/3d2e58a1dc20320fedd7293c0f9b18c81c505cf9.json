And, purists aside - though this may be an unfairly sweeping characterisation - they are often bought by customers who simply want bragging rights of have the very top car in the range.\n\nThree quarters of customers will go for the new and impressively leaner but no less mean 4.0-litre twin-turbo charged V8 petrol versions.\n\nAlthough still not green they provide a more efficient, lighter and arguably sophisticated performance than the bigger bruiser sibling and still wallop along with 550 horsepower.\n\nThis is the third generation of the modern Continental GT since Volkswagen-owned Bentley launched the first in 2003 after buying the classic British luxury brand.\n\nBentley held the launch in the USA \u2013 and particularly California \u2013 because America is one of its biggest and most important export markets.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the V8s are going on sale there first. In the run-up to Brexit, as it plans for the worst but hopes for the best, the firm is keen to keep its transatlantic trade buoyant.\n\nSo what are they like to drive?\n\nThe GTC V8 convertible starts from \u00a3163,700 \u2013 a \u00a314,900 mark-up on the V8 coupe \u2013 but still a hefty saving on the W12 drop-top version costing from \u00a3175, 890 \u2013 a difference of \u00a312,190\n\nPrices for the GT V8 coupe start at \u00a3148,800 in the UK\n\nThis is the third generation of the modern Continental GT since Volkswagen-owned Bentley launched the first in 2003\n\nWell, the smaller 4.0-litre V8 engine packs a pretty hefty punch when compared to its heavy-weight 6.0-litre W12 sibling.\n\nFire up the engine with the press of a button on the centre console, press down hard on the accelerator and the new Continental V8 coupe will sprint from rest to 62mph in four seconds flat. That\u2019s just 0.3 seconds slower than the mighty 6.0-litre W12.\n\nAnd the cabriolet, at 4.1 seconds, keeps the same 0.3 second margin to its more powerful convertible counterpart.\n\nSimilarly, with a top speed of 198mph \u2013 where legal such as on German Autobahns or on a track - the 4.0-litre V8 is just 9mph slower than the 207mph 6.0-litre W12.\n\nCould you really tell the differences? And how often, if ever, would you even test it to that limit. Some might. Not me.\n\nThere are three different driving modes, which can be changed by a circular dial surrounding the starter button on the centre console.\n\n\u2018Bentley\u2019 is the default setting for general driving and is refined and smooth on the open road.\n\nFor simply chilling around town you can go for \u2018comfort\u2019 mode and feel as laid back as the hippies of San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury area in the 1967 Summer of Love.\n\nBut for much more engaging driving \u2013 especially on winding coastal roads and twisty forest trails \u2013 press \u2018Sport\u2019 and just feel those sinews and the responses tighten up, even more so if you override the eight speed automatic gear box and play with the manual paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nThe Continental GTC cabriolet sprints to 62mph in 4.1 seconds - just 0.3 seconds shy of the same model with the V12 engine\n\nPerfect for overtaking too when you need that spurt of energy. It feels rooted to the road, supremely confident, with very light touch handling and tremendously athletic acceleration and energy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the best way to hear the morale-boosting snap, crackle and pop of the burbling exhaust pipe.\n\nThe wind in the hair convertible GTC is perfect for the freedom of the open road and catching those \u2013 in Britain anyway \u2013 rare rays of sunshine. The GT coupe is a mean prowling panther that left America\u2019s home-grown Ford Mustang drivers looking on enviously.\n\nThe GTC V8 Convertible\u2019s tailored roof can be raised or stowed in just 19 seconds at speeds of up to 30mph.\n\nSeven different fabric hood colours are available including an authentic tweed finish, and customers can choose from a range of eight roof linings.\n\nBentley says its powerful new V8 petrol engine ensures \u2018a lively and engaging drive that complements the unparalleled levels of luxury and cutting-edge technology\u2019. It ticks those boxes.\n\nThe new V8 aims to combine immense power with much improved fuel efficiency while feeling exceptionally responsive and agile and with a distinctive personality of its own. Another tick. That\u2019s also reflected in the higher revving engine \u2013 which engineers say is the fastest revver they\u2019ve ever produced, producing a distinctive \u2018burbling\u2019 soundtrack.\n\nSo you get all the looks, the gadgets, and a leaner performance \u2013 the beauty without the beast of the massive 6.0-litre W12 engine.\n\nIt\u2019s a tad cheaper too, though for the average motorist for whom cars in this luxury market are but a pipe-dream, that\u2019s a relative concept.\n\nThe GTC V8 Convertible\u2019s tailored roof can be raised or stowed in just 19 seconds at speeds of up to 30mph\n\nThe V8 might b cheaper but for the average motorist for whom cars in this luxury market are but a pipe-dream, that\u2019s a relative concept\n\nPrices for the GT V8 coupe start at \u00a3148,800 in the UK, compared to \u00a3159,100 for the range-topping 6.0 litre W12 version, a difference of \u00a310,300.\n\nThe GTC V8 convertible starts from \u00a3163,700 \u2013 a \u00a314,900 mark-up on the V8 coupe \u2013 but still a hefty saving on the W12 drop-top version costing from \u00a3175, 890 \u2013 a difference of \u00a312,190.\n\nBentley Continental V8: Will it fit in my garage?

Weight: 2165kg (GT) / 2335kg (GTC) MPG: TBC CO2 emissions: TBC Wheels: 20 inch as standard (21 and 22 inch options)\n\nA Mulliner design pack will add around \u00a313,000 to the price, with other \u2018packs\u2019 from around \u00a36,000.\n\nThe V8\u2019s twin-scroll turbo-chargers are actually located within the \u2018V\u2019 shape of the V8 cylinder engine, which has four cylinders on each side.\n\nThe V8 can also de-activate four of these eight cylinders for even more efficient driving when there\u2019s less demand or load on the engine.\n\nThe change takes just 20 milliseconds \u2013 the blink of an eye - and is imperceptible to the driver or passenger.\n\nStop-start technology, which cuts out the engine when idling, also helps keep down fuel bills and CO2 emissions.\n\nAlthough Bentley has yet to give an official figure for either with the V8, it will be a decent improvement on the gas-guzzling 23mpg and 278g/km achieved by the 6.0 litre W12.\n\nEngine aside, the V8 grand tourers remains largely the same as the W12, save for a few cosmetic details such as some subtle \u2018V8\u2019 badging to the front wings.\n\nThe V8 also comes with 20-inch, 10-spoke painted alloys wheels as standard, but the clever money says upgrade to the 21 inch versions which are standard on the W12. There are nine wheel design options in total measuring up to 22-inches.\n\nA more efficient and quieter neck-warmer means driving with the top down won\u2019t be a pain in the neck.\n\nIt complements heated and 20-way adjustable leather \u2018comfort\u2019 seats, a heated steering wheel and new heated armrests.\n\nThe design of the LED Matrix headlamps is inspired by the finest cut-crystal glass to resemble an illuminated cut gem.\n\nThe dashboard fascia features a new Crown Cut Walnut veneer among the many options.\n\nThere are three levels of sound system and a touch of James Bond-style gadgetry with the optional three-sided rotating dashboard on which the driver can choose to show: a 12.3-inch touchscreen, three elegant analogue dials, or simply a plain dashboard for a \u2018digital de-tox\u2019.\n\nThe V8 also comes with 20-inch, 10-spoke painted alloys wheels as standard, but the clever money says upgrade to the 21 inch versions which are standard on the W12\n\nBentley\u2019s intelligent \u2018Dynamic Ride System\u2019 is also available as an option. This uses a controls ride comfort and lateral roll, cushioning passengers from excessive movement, as well as making the Continental GT V8 models feel effortlessly precise.\n\nAir suspension uses three-chamber air springs to further improve ride comfort and the dynamic ride as it varies the spring stiffness from sporting to luxury limousine refinement.\n\nThe \u2018Active All-Wheel Drive\u2019 system varies level of power pushed to the wheels \u2013 from front to back as needed. It uses rear-wheel drive as much as possible and as the \u2018default\u2019 mode during normal driving. Driver focussed features include active lane assist, traffic jam assist and park assist.\n\nOutside the Bodega schoolhouse used in Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018The Birds\u2019, Bentley interior designer Darren Day, my driving partner for part of my road trip, told me that the firm\u2019s \u2018winged B\u2019 badge is actually asymmetric \u2013 with 11 feathers in one wing and 10 on the other \u2013 to help deter counterfeiters of luxury goods.\n\nWell one thing\u2019s for sure - if you have the money and are looking for a luxury grand tourer that will fly like the wind, the new leaner V8-engined versions of the the Continental GT and GTC that I drove really are the genuine article, and certainly not for the birds.\n\nBentley held the launch in the USA \u2013 and particularly California \u2013 because America is one of its biggest and most important export markets\n\nAir suspension uses three-chamber air springs to further improve ride comfort and the dynamic ride as it varies the spring stiffness from sporting to luxury limousine refinement", "description": "Bentley has fitted its Continental GT coupe and GTC convertible with a mildly more economical V8 engine - Ray Massey's tried both in the US, which is the British car makers' biggest export market.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
