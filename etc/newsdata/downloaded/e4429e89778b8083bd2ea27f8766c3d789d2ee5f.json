He sees Julio Jones , the fast, physical two-time All-Pro receiver, and the emerging Calvin Ridley, who posted his second career 100-yard game last weekend, stressing secondaries. He sees Mohamed Sanu, the perfect complementary piece to Atlanta\u2019s home-run hitters, and tight end Austin Hooper exposing the middle of the field.\n\nIt helps Moore recognize what he and his teammates must do to keep Ryan and his receivers under control Sunday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very talented, very crafty receivers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cEverybody knows what Julio brings to the table. We just have to be on point.\u201d\n\nFor Moore and most of Indy\u2019s young defense, game tapes are all they have. Only six players have ever faced Ryan up close and personal, and safety Clayton Geathers is the only one in the Colts\u2019 back seven to experience it.\n\nMoore recognizes it may take a few series to adapt to the Falcons\u2019 potentially high-scoring offense at game speed.\n\nBut that\u2019s only one potential problem for the Colts (1-1). They could be short-handed, too.\n\nAll-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard spent this week in the concussion protocol. Indy\u2019s top cornerback, Pierre Desir, was limited in practice by a bruised right knee. Starting defensive end Jabaal Sheard, who has played Ryan twice including in New England\u2019s fifth Super Bowl win, returned for a light practice Wednesday after missing eight weeks with a knee injury.\n\nIf the defense can\u2019t slow down Falcons receivers, there could be other options.\n\nIndy could rely on its suddenly strong ground game to control the clock. The Colts could use a vastly improved pass rush to make Ryan uncomfortable as they did the last two weeks with Phillip Rivers and Marcus Mariota. Or, perhaps they\u2019ll take advantage of the Falcons\u2019 biggest early season bugaboo: turnovers.\n\nAfter throwing seven interceptions all of last season, Ryan already has five this year, including two in the red zone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the start you want, but it\u2019s like that sometimes,\u201d said Ryan, now in his 11th season. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to weather the storm and keep making good decisions and be aggressive.\u201d\n\nAnd keep finding Jones and Ridley, Sanu and Hooper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big test,\u201d Colts cornerback Quincy Wilson said. \u201cWe just have to make sure we\u2019re staying on our details, making sure our techniques are on point and don\u2019t walk past any mistakes.\u201d\n\nRUNNING HARD\n\nWith Andrew Luck and Peyton Manning both retired, the Colts have taken advantage of a run-first philosophy that\u2019s reflected in fashionably impressive numbers.\n\nIndy and Minnesota are tied for second this season in yards rushing, Marlon Mack ranks No. 3 among all runners and Indy\u2019s 370 yards are the franchise\u2019s highest for two games to start a season since 1971. Equally strange is the fact Indy ranks No. 32 in passing offense.\n\nNobody minds. All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson keeps a hat with the phrase \u201cRun The Damn Ball\u201d in his locker and quarterback Jacoby Brisset t appreciates the impact the running game has had.\n\n\u201cOur guys up front sense that and they like when that happens,\u201d Brissett said when asked about seeing defenses wearing down. \u201cThey ask for more runs, so they get more runs.\u201d\n\nGOING NOWHERE\n\nThe Falcons, in contrast, are 28th in rushing at 65 yards per game. Devonta Freeman has only 41 yards with no run longer than 9. Freeman looked quick early in last week\u2019s win over the Eagles when he had three carries for 18 yards in Atlanta\u2019s first five plays. But after he was tackled for losses twice, Atlanta changed course.\n\nInjuries, which derailed Freeman last season, don\u2019t seem to be the problem, either.\n\n\u201cHe showed the speed, the burst, the finish,\u201d coach Bob Quinn said. \u201cHe looked stronger in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nCHANGE OF DIRECTION\n\nIndy returns to Lucas Oil Stadium for the first time since Aug. 24, when fans booed as Andrew Luck left the field before announcing his retirement.\n\nPlayers acknowledge it will seem strange without Luck on the sideline or field.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about that but it will be different,\u201d longtime left tackle Anthony Castonzo said. \u201cI think it will be a good atmosphere, I think it will be rockin\u2019.\u201d\n\nPUNTING DILEMMA\n\nThe Falcons may make a late decision on the status of punter Matt Bosher, who strained his groin in warmups before last week\u2019s game. Atlanta signed Matt Wile to the practice squad as a possible backup on punts and kickoffs.\n\nMatt Bryant handled kickoffs last week. Wile was with Minnesota in 2018 and Atlanta briefly in 2016.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Indianapolis Colts cornerback Kenny Moore II understands this week's challenge each time he pops in an Atlanta Falcons tape.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/colts_titans_football_52790_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
