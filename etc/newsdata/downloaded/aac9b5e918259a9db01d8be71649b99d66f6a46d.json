We need to provide good customer service.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBut I fully believe the term is not well understood. If you ask even the leaders of \u201cservice companies\u201d such as banks or hotels to define customer service, they mumble generalities. I have repeatedly asked these leaders, \u201cHow do you teach service? What is your process?\u201d only to find that they have few specific answers.\n\nNo matter what field you\u2019re in, I can guarantee (after processing thousands of customer comments) that the people you serve want three main things.\n\nFirst, they want a product or service or other output with no defects.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re selling them a bottle of water. They want the water to be absolutely pure \u2014 no little \u201cfloaties\u201d swimming around. They also want the bottle to be leak-proof. They want to know they can trust this purchase 100 percent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nWhen I talk about defects, I\u2019m thinking not just of physical defects \u2014 say, a sticky door or a noisy toilet. I\u2019m also including process or system defects \u2014 the kind of thing that leads customers to say, \u201cHey, I never got my receipt,\u201d or \u201cWhere\u2019s my suitcase? I have to be dressed for a banquet in three hours!\u201d\n\nSecond, the people we serve want timeliness.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to have to stand or sit around waiting for you. If they\u2019re eating in a restaurant and their meal comes out absolutely perfect and tasty (no defects), but it took forty-five minutes to be served, they\u2019re going to be unhappy, regardless of how delicious the meal is.\n\nIf someone calls your customer service line and is put on hold for ten minutes, it won\u2019t matter if the agent is totally smart and competent to solve their issue. The customer is going to be so ticked off that they will hardly notice.\n\nIf someone calls your customer service line and is put on hold for ten minutes, it won\u2019t matter if the agent is totally smart and competent to solve their issue. The customer is going to be so ticked off that they will hardly notice.\n\nFinally, they want the person with whom they\u2019re dealing to be nice to them.\n\nThey want to sense a caring attitude. In fact, this third desire is greater than the first two combined. It can atone for other shortfalls.\n\nI have actually heard restaurant customers say, \u201cI had a problem with the food\u2014but the waiter did such a great job, and the chef even came out to my table and apologized. So it all turned out fine.\u201d\n\nI was in Chicago once to speak to the executive team of a certain bank. The afternoon before, I decided to check out their operation. I walked into this massive institution in the downtown Loop area and gazed at the impressive marble pillars. The whole ambience exuded wealth.\n\nI took my place in line and waited to be called. When I finally got to the head of the line, what did I hear?\n\n\u201cNext!\u201d a young woman\u2019s voice rang out.\n\nI approached her station and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to change this fifty-dollar bill.\u201d\n\nANDREW CROWELL: A HAPPY RETIREMENT MAY BE EASIER THAN YOU THINK \u2014 HERE ARE BABY STEPS\n\nWithout a smile or any word, she took my money and did what I asked. In rapid fire, she counted out my change aloud: \u201cTen, twenty, thirty, forty, forty-five, fifty. NEXT!\u201d I took my handful of bills and scooted away.\n\nHad the bank teller delivered a product with no defects? Yes. She gave me the correct amount of money. And all the bills were genuine; none were counterfeit.\n\nHad she done this in a timely manner? Yes. Our whole exchange took less than sixty seconds.\n\nHad she shown any hint of relating to me as a human being or caring about me? No.\n\nI told this story to the bank executives the next morning. Then I asked, \u201cWhat industry are you in? Surely the service industry! You don\u2019t manufacture any money; the U.S. Mint does that part. All you do is handle other people\u2019s money, right?\u201d They begrudgingly nodded their heads.\n\nI made some more remarks and then said, \u201cWhen I entered your bank yesterday, I assure you I did not feel like I was being served.\u201d\n\nLIBERTY VITTERT: A STATISTICIAN\u2019S GUIDE TO LIFE \u2014 WHAT ONLINE \u2018AVERAGE\u2019 CUSTOMER REVIEWS REALLY MEAN\n\nIf you think customer service is merely a desk in the back corner of the store (or a call center cubicle in faraway India, where a polite young man or woman with a thick accent reads from a script while trying to solve your problem), you have sorely shortchanged the concept.\n\nToo many people think customer service starts after a complaint has been voiced. Somebody has gotten upset about something, and the point of customer service is to try to calm them down.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBut that\u2019s far from the truth.
