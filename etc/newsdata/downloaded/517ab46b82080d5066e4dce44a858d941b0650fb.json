China has become the world\u2019s second-largest LNG buyer amid a surge in domestic gas usage. However, the country has started to re-export shipments amid a lull in summer gas consumption and Japanese buyers are scooping up the cargoes to reduce their fuel expenses.\n\nThe cargo of 70,560 tonnes of LNG was shipped from the Hainan LNG Terminal, which is operated by state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp, to Chita near Nagoya, where Toho Gas jointly operates an LNG terminal with JERA, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIt was delivered at $5.68 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), below Japan\u2019s average import cost of $9.50 per mmBtu for LNG during July, according to Ministry of Finance data released on Thursday.\n\nToho Gas declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. CNOOC did not immediate reply for a request for comment.\n\nA search through Japan\u2019s official trade statistics show it is the first LNG cargo from China since 1988, when the Japanese government started publishing import and export figures.\n\nPrices for spot LNG in Asia have sunk to near record lows in recent weeks as a wave of new supply from the United States and Australia comes onto the market.\n\nGRAPHIC: Asian spot LNG prices - here\n\nThe decline in spot market prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is pushing Japanese utilities in Japan to be more aggressive in price reviews built into traditional long-term contracts linked to oil prices.\n\nThey are also buying more LNG on the spot market as part of this shift in approach. Japanese utilities have previously favored stability of supply over price, partly because they could pass on the costs to consumers.\n\nThe liberalization of Japan\u2019s energy markets means the old guard gas and electric utilities are losing customers to new entrants and they are trying to cut costs.\n\nWith summer temperatures peaking, Japanese electric utilities have also been rushing to replenish stocks of the fuel to use to generate power for air conditioning.\n\nHokuriku Electric has bought a spot LNG cargo for delivery in November, while Hokkaido Electric is seeking a cargo for delivery the same month, industry sources told Reuters this week.\n\nGRAPHIC: Japan's LNG import prices - here", "description": "(This August 29 story has been corrected to say China National Offshore Oil Corp, not CNOOC Ltd, in paragraph three.)", "authors": ["Aaron Sheldrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
