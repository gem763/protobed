MacKenzie and Jeff Bezos are divorced after 25 years of marriage.\n\nA King County, Washington judge on Friday signed an order formalising the separation. That sets the stage for the transfer of some 19.7 million shares of Amazon.com Inc. to MacKenzie\u2019s name. The Bezoses announced the split in January.\n\nThat 4% holding is valued at $38.3bn (about R540bn), enough to place her 22nd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 richest people. Her former husband, the founder and chief executive officer of the world\u2019s largest online retailer and web-services company, retains a 12% stake worth $114.8bn (about R1.6 trn) and remains the world\u2019s wealthiest person.\n\nThe court papers formalising the divorce revealed little else about the terms of the separation. The couple filed a parenting plan for their children earlier this week. MacKenzie Bezos, a 49-year-old novelist, said in an April tweet that she gave Jeff Bezos, 55, all of her interests in the Washington Post and space-exploration company Blue Origin.\n\nShe also signed the Giving Pledge in May, promising to donate more than half of her fortune to philanthropy.\n\n\n\n", "description": "MacKenzie Bezos will walk away from her marriage to Jeff Bezos with a R540bn stake in technology company Amazon.", "authors": ["Matt Day", "Tom Metcalf"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5215/7b039bb7f8ba43b7bef92dd910715ec1.png", "published_at": "2019-07-06"}
