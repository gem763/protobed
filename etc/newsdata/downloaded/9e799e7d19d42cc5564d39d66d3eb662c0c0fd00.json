The council previously told Reuters it would move to block any new mines at Atacama because the impact on water supplies was unclear.\n\nIf the transaction with Wealth is closed, Uranium One would have the right to purchase 100 per cent of the project\u2019s production.\n\nSeveral regulatory hurtles remain before Wealth can begin producing lithium from the Atacama salt flat.\n\nBesides further environmental permits, Chile also requires private miners to partner with the state or obtain a special permit known as a CEOL to mine lithium on their own. They also need to obtain a quota to export the lithium from Chilean nuclear agency CCHEN.\n\nRosatom said in June it planned to triple its revenue by 2030 thanks to foreign projects from Belarus to Bangladesh and new product areas.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "51 per cent ownership interest", "authors": ["Polina Devitt", "Dave Sherwood"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chile.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
