USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Washington Nationals\u2019 pitching buzzsaw just keeps slicing through opponents\u2019 bats \u2013 and as a result, the city is one win away from its first World Series appearance in 86 years.\n\nStephen Strasburg became the third consecutive Nats starter to completely overpower the St. Louis Cardinals, holding them to one run over seven innings Monday night for a 8-1 victory in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series.\n\nStrasburg was masterful once again, allowing one unearned run over seven innings and striking out 12 in outdueling Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty. Pitching for the fourth time this postseason, the 31-year-old right-hander earned his third win and lowered his career ERA in the playoffs to 1.10 over 41 innings.\n\nFlaherty had pitched the Cardinals to a clinching victory over the Atlanta Braves in the Division Series, but things came apart quickly in his first NLCS start.\n\nNationals starting pitcher Stephen Strasburg won Game 3 in dominating fashion. (Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHowie Kendrick keyed a four-run uprising in the third inning with a two-out, two-run double \u2013 and then doubled in another run with a double in the fifth to give the Nationals the early lead. And, as has been the case in the series, the Cardinals were unable to get anything going on offense.\n\nThrough the first three games of the series, Washington starters Anibal Sanchez, Max Scherzer and Strasburg have not allowed an earned run in 21 \u2154 innings, and have limited the Cardinals to just nine hits in 73 at-bats (a .123 average).\n\nThe Nationals will go for the sweep on Tuesday night with left-hander Patrick Corbin on the mound, looking to bring a World Series to the city for the first time since the Washington Senators lost to the New York Giants in 1933.\n\nMan of the moment\n\nThe night clearly belonged to Strasburg, who was in control all game long. He mixed his pitches to perfection, including a curveball that\u2019s been almost unhittable this postseason.\n\nAccording to Sports Info Solutions, opponents had been 0-for-17 against his curveball in the postseason with eight strikeouts.\n\nStephen Strasburg\u2019s curveball has been the perfect pitch for the Washington Nationals this postseason. He hasn\u2019t allowed a hit with it yet. We should note that he\u2019s got a pretty good fastball and changeup too. He\u2019ll\u2026 https://t.co/WCaYnKYLCw \u2014 Sports Info Solutions (@SportsInfo_SIS) October 14, 2019\n\nAlthough Ozuna snapped that hitless streak against the curve in the second inning, Strasburg recorded four more strikeouts with it \u2013 and eight with his changeup.\n\nHe allowed just one unearned run in the seventh when he gave up three hits in four batters. The run scored when Juan Soto overthrew two cutoff men on a Paul DeJong single and allowed Martinez to score.\n\nStrasburg now has three wins and a 1.64 ERA in 22 innings this postseason.\n\nFORE: Cardinals pitching coach hits two holes-in-one playing golf\n\nALCS: Correa lost his mind while saving the Astros\n\nTurning point\n\nThe Nationals got all the runs Strasburg would need when they broke through against Flaherty in the third inning. Center fielder Victor Robles, playing for the first time in five games because of a hamstring injury he suffered in the Division Series, led off with a solid single to center field.\n\nRobles moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Strasburg and came home one out later on a single by Adam Eaton. The Nats got a second run on a half-swing by Anthony Rendon that popped out of left fielder Marcell Ozuna\u2019s glove for an RBI double. After a walk to Juan Soto, Howie Kendrick continued his hot hitting in the postseason by ripping a double into the right-field gap to give the Nationals a 4-0 lead.\n\nThe rally essentially sealed Flaherty\u2019s fate because it forced him to throw 33 pitches and gave the Nationals a big enough lead that he had to be taken out for a pinch-hitter in the top of the fifth.\n\nManager\u2019s special\n\nAfter his regulars went 2-for-54 (.037) in the first two games, Cardinals manager Mike Shildt made one major tweak to his lineup for Game 3, inserting Jose Martinez in the No. 6 spot in the batting order. Martinez was 2-for-2 as a pinch hitter in Games 1 and 2, so he got the start in right field, despite his defensive liabilities.\n\nMartinez was 2-for-3 with a single and a double \u2013 and scored the Cardinals\u2019 only run -- but it wasn\u2019t enough to make much difference. Look for him to be in the starting lineup once again in Game 4.\n\nNeeding a mulligan\n\nCardinals left fielder Marcell Ozuna was involved in a pair of plays he\u2019d like to have back. He got the first hit off Strasburg, lining a double into the left field corner to lead off the second inning. But he strayed a bit too far off the bag when Jose Martinez hit a one-hopper back to the mound. Strasburg flagged down the ball and ran directly at Ozuna, who was caught in between second and third, tagging him for the out.\n\nThen with two outs in the bottom of the third inning, Ozuna misplayed a shallow looper off the bat of Anthony Rendon into an RBI double when he tried to make a sliding catch. The ball hit off his glove and caromed away, allowing Adam Eaton to score all the way from first for the Nationals\u2019 second run.\n\nState of the series\n\nThe Nationals will look to complete the sweep Tuesday night and close out the series in front of their home fans, who helped pack Nationals Park with a sellout crowd of 43,675 in Game 3.\n\nWashington will send left-hander Patrick Corbin (7.56 ERA in postseason) to the mound in search of his first win of the playoffs. Corbin took both losses against the Dodgers in the NLDS, once as a starter and once in relief. But he\u2019s coming off 1 1/3 scoreless innings in relief in Game 5 vs. the Dodgers.\n\n\u201cI knew in that series it might be an opportunity for me to face some of those guys,\u201d Corbin said before Monday\u2019s Game 3. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking forward to tomorrow, getting back to starting.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals will counter with rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson (1.93 ERA in postseason), who last pitched in Game 4 of the NLDS against the Braves, allowing one earned run in 4 2/3 innings in his first playoff start.\n\n\u201cI think that gave me the experience to kind of sit back and \u2026 just kind of stay within myself,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go out there and try to do anything that\u2019s out of my skill set. I just want to give the best I have.\u201d", "description": "Stephen Strasburg struck out 12 batters as the Nationals cruised to an 8-1 victory over the Cardinals in Game 3 of the NLCS.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
