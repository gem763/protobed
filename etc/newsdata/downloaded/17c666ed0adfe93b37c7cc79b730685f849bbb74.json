However, Chesney intervenes and, upon coming to Bernie\u2019s rescue, he delivers a thunderous punch which successfully knocks the sex abuser off his feet.\n\nWill Kel get his comeuppance for what he did?\n\nDuring an appearance on Lorraine, actor Joe said: \u2018I have no idea [how long I have left], it is open-ended,\u2019\n\n\u2018The character I\u2019m playing is finite, I\u2019ll never be a regular on Corrie that\u2019s sure.\u2019\n\n\u2018My role will come to an end,\u2019 he confirmed, but not before there \u2018will be a lot of fall out\u2019.\n\n(Picture: Mark Campbell/MCPIX)\n\nKel made his first appearance on Corrie back in September, and it didn\u2019t take viewers long to work out what he did to Paul.\n\nThe pair have had several altercations \u2014 one of which left Kel in a coma \u2014 but the truth has remained hidden thus far, with Billy being the only one to have discovered what really happened.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that the Winter family will be horrified when they learn about the abuse Paul suffered at the hands of Kel, and the upcoming scenes demonstrate the clan seeking revenge on the abuser.\n\nThese scenes will air in November.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Bernie sees red.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kel-bernie-Chesney-Corrie-1a8b_1570699895.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
