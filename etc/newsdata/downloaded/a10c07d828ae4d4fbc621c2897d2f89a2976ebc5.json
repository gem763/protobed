The House Appropriations and Budget Committees requested a tranche of documents from the Office of Management and Budget in hopes of establishing how and why that aid\u2014granted to Ukraine without incident since 2015\u2014stalled over the course of the last several months before being released earlier in September. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint only glances at the issue of the held-up aid, which is at the heart of whether Trump attempted to establish a quid-pro-quo with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRussia\u2019s Fingerprints Are All Over Trump\u2019s Ukraine Whistleblower Scandal\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the committees will also subpoena witnesses of Trump\u2019s communications with Ukrainian officials or if they will call on Giuliani for questioning. Asked Monday if he would cooperate and agree to an interview on Capitol Hill, the Trump attorney said, \u201cNo, not [with] the corrupt ones like Schiff and Nadler.\u201d Giuliani also cited attorney-client privilege between him and the president.\n\nFriday\u2019s salvo represents the first serious move by House Democrats to learn more about the substance of an explosive complaint from an anonymous whistleblower, which has become the basis of their newly-minted impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint, made public on Thursday, laid out efforts by Trump, Giuliani, and other U.S. officials to pressure Ukrainian officials\u2014including the president, Volodomyr Zelensky\u2014into investigating the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, in the country. It also documents the unusual steps White House officials took to conceal not only a conversation between Trump and Zelensky but other conversations between the president and different foreign leaders, too.", "description": "Mandel Ngan/GettyThree congressional committees have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to efforts by President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to dig up dirt on 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden.The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Sam Brodey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UgXUty4ojFmycyUdyZMP0g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/84f59af3b3058fc0bc8e78b9d5e51eb6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
