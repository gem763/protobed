The new facility will serve as the base for its flights, which it's first 600 passengers have locked in for $US250,000.\n\nOf the more than 600 people who signed up to Virgin Galactic's waiting list, according to Mr Attenborough Aussies are the third most represented nation.\n\n\"Australia is one of our biggest markets. It's always been strong for us and we have some really passionate, enthusiastic and good fun customers here,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Virgin is a popular brand in Australia and there's obviously an element of trust when people sign up to something like this, and there's a lot of trust in Richard to do this properly.\"\n\nThe first would-be space travellers have already committed to paying $US250,000, but when the wait list is next opened up, the price will be higher.\n\n\"[In 30 years] we'll likely see private orbital habitats.\" \u2014 Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic\n\nIn the long run Mr Attenborough hopes the cost will come down, as the company gradually builds more spaceships and the frequency of flights goes from once or twice a month to a few times a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're going to continue this approach of safety first. We've done a huge amount of testing, but this will be the first time we take paying passengers, so we'll give ourselves plenty of time between flights,\" he said.\n\n\"But we're vertically integrated so we build our own spaceships and we've got two more in the production line back in Mojave, so we'll launch a second service at the end of next year, then a third, fourth and fifth all at Spaceport America.\"\n\nEventually, Mr Attenborough hopes the company will be able to establish spaceports in other countries.\n\nFuture\n\nAs part of shareholder documents published in the course of its upcoming merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, Virgin Galactic flagged the possibility that it could expand into urban air mobility, which would make it a competitor to Uber's ambitious flying vehicle project.\n\nWhile Mr Attenborough said there were no concrete plans at this stage, because of the company's ability to manufacture its own vehicles, it was a possibility. It also has the potential to build jets for super fast transcontinental travel.\n\nIn the next 30 years he said consumers' mindsets about space would change and it would become a new frontier for innovation, thanks to the industry being opened up to the masses.\n\n\"We'll likely see private orbital habitats... which will benefit space research. We will also start to see manufacturing in space and I hope we can source some of our requirements in terms of power and minerals from space too,\" he said.\n\n\"It's all part of the mentality that's starting which says we need to preserve the planet for the human species... and improving access to space is part of the answer.\n\n\"It holds enormous potential to help us maintain a great life down here for everyone and if you speak to Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk or Richard Branson... fundamentally that's why all three are doing this so they can provide the basic infrastructure that's required.\"", "description": "Stephen Attenborough was the first employee at Virgin Galactic and he has helped build the company since it was little more than a blank sheet of paper.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e04060bff44ca88b6286e4f7bdb9b0a5cf7e5544", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
