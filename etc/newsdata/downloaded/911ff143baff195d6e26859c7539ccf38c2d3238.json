The result: Botswana and Zambia 2019 \u2013 five years in the saving, two years in the planning. The team at True Luxury Travel, our tour operator, had a simple brief: to send us on the world\u2019s best family safari. But would they deliver?\n\nAfter 20-plus hours of travel to Zambia (I won\u2019t bore you with the details), we didn\u2019t have long to wait. As soon as our boat headed down the Zambezi, it all kicked off: we passed a herd of hippos, a lazy crocodile and a giraffe drinking nonchalantly on the riverbank.\n\nTaking a right turn on to a quiet tributary, we arrived at Sindabezi Island with its five magnificent off-grid chalets. Beds were quickly sorted \u2013 Matilda, our middle child, has autism, so one of the big challenges is \u201crooming\u201d. We\u2019ve learnt that the path of least resistance is to have a boys\u2019 room and a girl\u2019s room; it\u2019s the best way. The children and, more importantly, my wife Caro and I know that this will give us the best chance of keeping Matilda in good spirits.", "description": "", "authors": ["Will Greenwood", "Chris Leadbeater"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/okavango-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
