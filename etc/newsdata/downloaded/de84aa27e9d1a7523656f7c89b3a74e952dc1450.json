When you have ringing of the ears, seeing stars, that is a concussion. If that is a concussion, I have had hundreds, probably thousands throughout my career. Which is frightening.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at USA Today", "description": "Favre, who turned 50 today, played in the NFL for 20 seasons and spent his last three years in the league with the Jets and Vikings instead of the Packers.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-106934127-e1570719623229.jpg?fit=857%2C570", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
