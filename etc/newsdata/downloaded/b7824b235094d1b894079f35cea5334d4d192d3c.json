USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington Nationals offense has suddenly gone cold at the most inopportune time.\n\nAfter scoring 17 runs in the first two games of the World Series, the Nationals have only been able to score a meager two runs in their last two losses to the Houston Astros in Games 3 and 4 at Nationals Park.\n\nThe Nationals have combined to go 1-for-19 with runners in scoring position in those games \u2013 0-for-10 in Game 3 and 1-for-9 in Game 4.\n\nThat's a far cry from the .355 mark with runners in scoring position they posted during their eight-game postseason winning streak.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re swinging the bats poorly,\" said Nationals right fielder Adam Eaton, who went 0-for-3 in the 8-1 loss on Saturday. \"With runners in scoring position, yes, but when they make their pitches \u2013 I don\u2019t care who you are \u2013 97 on the black on each side and two other pitches they\u2019re throwing, it\u2019s going to be difficult.\"\n\nNationals shortstop Trea Turner pops out in the first inning.

The Nationals made him look like an ace as he tossed five scoreless inning and allowed just two hits to earn the victory.\n\n\"I just wanted to make sure that I was fair to him,\" said Astros manager A.J. Hinch. \"We hadn't asked this much even out of him.\n\n\"I didn't want him to fail. I didn't want to lead him down a path that we hadn't asked him to do over the last month and have it turn on him.\"\n\nThe Nationals had a chance to get things going in the second inning when Yan Gomes hit a leadoff double, but Urquidy got the next three batters out to end the threat.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of us having bad at-bats,\" said Nationals shortstop Trea Turner. \"We got runners on base, just haven\u2019t gotten any big hits.\n\n\"We hit a lot of balls good, right at people ... who knows, some of those balls fall and we\u2019re still playing.\"\n\nThe Nationals, who last lost consecutive games on Sept. 13-14, need their bats to wake up \u2013 and fast. The Astros tied the series 2-2 and now have momentum on their side and the pitchers lined up for what is a best-of-three set.\n\nCole, who is 19-1 since May 22, is scheduled to pitch Game 5 on Sunday, and Verlander is set to pitch Game 6 back home in Houston on Tuesday.\n\nThe opportunities were their for the Nationals in each of the last two games, but they failed to execute when they had the chances.\n\n\"We haven't hit the last couple of days, but I've got confidence we'll bounce back and be ready to play tomorrow,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \"It's just one of those things.\n\n\"It's baseball. And it's the World Series.\"", "description": "The Nationals offense has suddenly gone silent.
