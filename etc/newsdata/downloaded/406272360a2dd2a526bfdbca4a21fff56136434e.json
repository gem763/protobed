If you - or anyone you are buying with - have ever owned a property, or even part of one, previously, either in the UK or abroad, you will not qualify for the tax break.\n\n'While first-time buyers are now not treated differently in Wales in terms of stamp duty, lower property prices there mean that 56 per cent of homes respectively are also exempt, which is still a welcome reality.'\n\nPERCENTAGE OF HOMES EXEMPT FROM STAMP DUTY FOR FIRST-TIME BUYERS County FTB Tax Threshold % Below FTB Tax Threshold % Above FTB Tax Threshold England \u00a3300,000 58.20% 41.80% Scotland \u00a3175,000 61.40% 38.60% Wales \u00a3180,000* 56.10% 43.90% Great Britain N/A 59.20% 40.80% Source: Zoopla\n\nWHAT PERCENTAGE OF FIRST-TIME BUYERS PAY STAMP DUTY? First-time buyers who buy a house for \u00a3300,000 or less do not pay any stamp duty. HMRC does not publish official figures for those first-time buyers who pay stamp duty if they purchase a house above \u00a3500,000. However, the percentage of first-time buyers who buy a house between \u00a3300,001 and \u00a3500,000, and pay stamp duty is 22 per cent, according to HMRC. Stamp duty has different names and thresholds depending on which country you are in, including Land Transaction Tax in Wales and Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in Scotland. Both England and Scotland have separate rates for first-time buyers while Wales does not - and so Zoopla applied the threshold that everyone has to adhere to in its research for Wales.", "description": "First-time buyers can escape stamp duty, but whether they can squeeze under the \u00a3300,000 tax-free threshold depends on where they want to live, Zoopla research highlights.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/14/19493356-0-image-a-22_1570629523615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
