The company declined to give further details.\n\nUniversal Pictures is the parent company of DreamWorks Animation, which coproduced the film with China-based Pearl Studio.\n\nWhy is the map in the film?\n\nAbominable's plot has nothing to do with the territorial dispute. The film tells the story of Yi, a Chinese girl who discovers a yeti living on her roof and helps it back to its home on Mount Everest.\n\nThe controversy centres around a scene in Yi's makeshift shed where there is large map of East Asia on the wall showing a series of dashes in the South China Sea. The map is also briefly seen in the English-language trailer for the film.\n\nIn the film Abominable, a large map of East Asia on a main character's wall shows a series of dashes in the South China Sea - territorial marks that have sparked controversy in Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines [Scree ngrab/DreamWorks]\n\nChina uses the U-shaped nine-dash line to illustrate its claims over vast expanses of the South China Sea, including large swaths of what Vietnam regards as its continental shelf, where it has awarded oil concessions.\n\nIt is not clear why the map is included in the film. For Chinese audiences, and the Chinese production company, it will appear accurate and familiar.\n\nBut cinema-goers in Vietnam have taken to social media to accuse China of attempting to use the map to normalise its claims on the territory.\n\nWhy is the South China Sea so controversial?\n\nThe South China Sea is a hotly-disputed territory, through which one-third of the world's shipping passes. It is also home to lucrative fisheries and huge oil and gas reserves.\n\nChina issued a map in 1947 stating its territorial claims, which it says are supported by history. However, Vietnam has clashing historical claims on parts of the territory.\n\nAdded to this, the Philippines points to its proximity to some of the islands in the territory, as well as the fact that they have long been populated by Filipinos, as support for its own claims.\n\n191014100622601\n\nTaiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also insist parts of the territory fall within their economic exclusion zones as defined by United Nations laws.\n\nIn 2016, an international tribunal invalidated China's vast claims in a case brought by the Philippines, but the ruling was rebuffed by Beijing.\n\nChina has continued to assert its claims to the sea by building and staffing outposts on man-made islands and deploying ships in the area.\n\nHow have other countries reacted?\n\nIn the Philippines, Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin Jr called for a boycott of DreamWorks productions, while Vietnam banned the film last week.\n\nThe Vietnamese ban came during an increasingly tense and months-long standoff between its ships and a Chinese survey vessel and escort ships in disputed Vanguard Bank off Vietnam.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reiterated his call on Monday for a peaceful resolution to the dispute as he warned that an increase in Chinese and US military presence could threaten the vital shipping route.\n\n\"In the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea, the passage of ships is still free without obstruction but once people start sending warship[s], then we have a problem.\n\nThere might be accidents and as we know accidents may lead to war,\" Mohamad told local media on the sidelines of a conference.\n\nThe United States, which also frequently butts heads with China over the South China Sea, has responded well to the film, which made $25.8m in its opening weekend, according to Box Office Mojo, a revenue tracking website.", "description": "Several Asian governments have criticised and banned the film Abominable over a map showing China's territorial claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/f58b4f018fda4049b54480d86591cac6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
