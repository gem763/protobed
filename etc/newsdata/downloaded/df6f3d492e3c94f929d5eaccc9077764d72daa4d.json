This is a whole new chapter and I think it's the future for X Factor.\"\n\nThe first episode, showing auditions in front of various music producers and writers in Simon's garden in Malibu, received mixed responses online.\n\nThe format is far from the small, minimally designed audition room with an X on the floor from early series', but the judges haven't changed much.\n\nReality star Megan McKenna told Newsbeat: \"I was so happy when I found out it was judged by Simon, Nicole and Louis because they're the originals.\n\n\"I've watched the show growing up my entire life, so singing in front of them was one of the best moments of my whole life.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nicole joined the panel in the ninth series\n\nDermot O'Leary will once again host the series and be the contestants' general shoulder to cry on.\n\nHe said: \"It may well be that we uncover this incredible singer, it may well be that it doesn't fly - but it's definitely worth the risk.\n\n\"Whether we can find a recording artist with these celebrities - probably not! As long as we can put on a good entertainment show, that's what matters.\"\n\nNicole agreed that the show was more about providing entertainment, saying: \"We still get pretty great ratings, all we can do it put on the best show we can, and hopefully we can entertain the people who are watching.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The celebrity line-up could be the boost that the show needs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9E5D/production/_109214504_island.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
