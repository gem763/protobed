USA TODAY\n\nIs it Nov. 9 yet?\n\nLast year's Alabama vs. LSU was billed to be the game of the year in college football, but the Crimson Tide rolled the Tigers, 29-0.\n\nThis year's edition seems to be better and better with every passing week. No way the LSU offense gets shut out this time around, even in Tuscaloosa.\n\nHurry up, October! The Tigers are ready to redeem themselves.\n\n1. Alabama (6-0, 3-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 1\n\nIf LSU quarterback Joe Burrow hadn't already had two Heisman moments in knocking off No. 9 Texas on the road and No. 7 Florida at Death Valley, then Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa would be all anyone is talking about.\n\nTagovailoa added four more touchdown passes against Texas A&M to bring his season total to 27, which is two more than Burrow's 25. Tagovailoa also has only thrown one interception. Burrow has thrown three.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs, Tennessee, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN.\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State remains No. 1 as Oklahoma rises after Texas win\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nFOOTBALL FOUR: LSU moving up in College Football Playoff chase\n\n2. LSU (6-0, 2-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 3\n\nThe 2011 LSU-Alabama game was dubbed the \"Game of the Century.\" It finished 9-6 in favor of the Tigers in overtime. This year's game could have that many points scored in the first five minutes.\n\nLSU averaged 10.6 yards per play and scored 42 points against a Florida defense that came into the game as arguably the best in the SEC. Alabama's defense has allowed 27.3 points in conference play.\n\nHave we mentioned that we're ready for Nov. 9's firework show at Bryant-Denny Stadium?\n\nUp next: Saturday at Mississippi state, 3:30 p.m., CBS.\n\n3. Georgia (5-1, 2-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 2\n\nThe Dawgs' defeat to South Carolina is simply inexplicable, especially at home. They can't say they got caught looking ahead, either. Next on the schedule is a Kentucky team that South Carolina drilled by 17 a couple weeks ago.\n\nGeorgia might even be over-ranked here. We'll find out in a couple weeks when the Bulldogs take on Florida.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Kentucky, 6 p.m., ESPN.\n\n4. Florida (6-1, 3-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 4\n\nIf LSU is truly one of the best teams in the country, and it's fair to confidently say the Tigers have proven as much thus far, the Florida is probably pretty dang good too. The Gators went toe-to-toe with the Tigers at Death Valley for most of the game. A costly interception in the end zone and a turnover on downs on their last possession proved to be the difference.\n\nUp next: Saturday at South Carolina, noon, ESPN.\n\n5. Auburn (5-1, 2-1 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 5\n\nAuburn essentially has two bye weeks in a row to shake off the loss to Florida and prepare for a big game against LSU. The Tigers were off this past week and travel to Arkansas this week.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Arkansas, noon, SEC Network.\n\n6. Missouri (5-1, 2-0 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 6\n\nDon't look now, but Missouri sits all alone atop the SEC East standings.\n\nWait to look until the Tigers have to take on Georgia and Florida in back-to-back weeks on Nov. 9 and 16. For the time being, though, Missouri is still very much a contender in the division after taking care of Ole Miss, 38-27.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Vanderbilt, 4 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n7. Texas A&M (3-3, 1-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 7\n\nWe'd say the Aggies earned a moral victory in scoring 23 points against Alabama while holding the Tide under 50 points, but then we realized A&M still didn't cover the point spread at home. A&M doesn't need moral victories anyway. It needs wins.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Mississippi, 7:30 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n8. South Carolina (3-3, 2-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 10\n\nWill Muschamp's reward for beating No. 3 Georgia on the road? A home game against a No. 9 Florida team trying to rinse off the sting of defeat in Death Valley. After that, though, South Carolina gets Tennessee and Vanderbilt.\n\nMuschamp's win at Sanford Stadium could hold up as the best upset in the SEC this season, though, some fans in Columbia might be fine with coming back down to earth if the Gators come in and chomp on the Gamecocks this weekend.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. No. 9 Florida, noon, ESPN\n\n9. Mississippi (3-3, 2-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 9\n\nPerhaps the last thing a rebuilding program needs is a quarterback controversy. That's what Ole Miss has with redshirt freshman Matt Corral and true freshman John Rhys Plumlee. The duo kept Ole Miss in its game with Missouri, though, so maybe head coach Matt Luke is onto something for the time being.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Texas A&M, 7:30 p.m., SEC Network.\n\n10. Tennessee (2-4, 1-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 12\n\nGood ol' Rocky Top, woo!\n\nTennessee picked up its first SEC win in nearly an entire calendar year with an upset of Mississippi State. It was a feel-good type of day in Knoxville, but now The Vols have to travel to Tuscaloosa. Goodbye, good feelings.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 1 Alabama, 9 p.m., ESPN.\n\n11. Mississippi State (3-3, 1-2 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 8\n\nHead coach Joe Moorhead inexplicably stuck with senior quarterback Tommy Stevens for the entire first half against Tennessee. Mississippi State subsequently scored three points and averaged less than four yards per play.\n\nIf true freshman Garrett Shrader doesn't lead the Bulldogs onto the field against LSU, then expect the boos at Davis Wade Stadium to be louder than the cowbells.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. No. 3 LSU, 3:30 p.m., CBS.\n\n12. Kentucky (3-3, 1-3 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 11\n\nKentucky got its first SEC win of the year, but it came against Arkansas -- a team that hasn't won an SEC game since Oct. 28, 2017. It was one of those wins that'll feel good for a few days if you're a fan of big blue until the Wildcats fall victim to Georgia in a game the Dawgs will certainly be playing angry in.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 10 Georgia, 6 p.m., ESPN.\n\n13. Arkansas (2-4, 0-3 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 13\n\nWell, with that four-point loss to Kentucky, it's possible Arkansas will go two straight seasons without winning a conference game. The Razorbacks' next two opponents are No. 11 Auburn and No. 1 Alabama. After that comes probably the Hogs' best chance: a home game against Mississippi State.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs No. 11 Auburn, noon, SEC Network.\n\n14. Vanderbilt (1-5, 0-4 SEC)\n\nLast week: No. 14\n\nUNLV snapped a four-game losing streak by thumping Vanderbilt by 24 points in Nashville. My goodness, that's bad. That's really, really bad.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Missouri, 4 p.m., SEC Network.", "description": "The LSU Tigers moved up to No. 2 in the SEC power rankings and could be the No. 1 team, but they'll have to wait to prove it against Alabama.", "authors": ["Tyler Horka", "Published P.M.
