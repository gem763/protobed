But the harsh\u2014and somewhat ironic\u2014reality is that, even if Trump never scrapped the deal and Iran abided by it, the same situation would result as is unfolding today. Indeed, the nuclear deal is not collapsing. In a strange way, it is working as written\u2014just a decade faster.\n\nUnder the deal, key restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program expire over the next 12 years\u2014the so-called sunset clauses. Beginning in 2026, Tehran is free to enrich uranium using advanced centrifuges and to install and operate more of its older models. In 2031, restrictions on the amount and level of enriched uranium that Iran can stockpile disappear. So, after these two dates, Iran will be able to build as large of a nuclear program as it wants\u2014while enjoying relief from sanctions, if the United States were in the deal.\n\nIn other words, Iran is doing now in violation of the deal what it will soon be able to do with the international community\u2019s blessing. Either way, the result is the same.", "description": "", "authors": ["Aaron Kliegman", "Freebeacon.Com Blog Iran-Nuclear-Deal-Working-Written-Decade-Faster"], "top_image": ""}
