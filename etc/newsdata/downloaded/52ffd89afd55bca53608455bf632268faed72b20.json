The punishment would be at the discretion of the disciplinary panel.\n\nCity posted a tweet soon after the charge was announced, showing an image of Mendy shoving a computer screen off a desk in apparent disgust, under the words: \u201cLogging on to find (hashtag)TwitterDown this morning.\u201d\n\nSilva has written a letter to the FA, expressing regret for any unintentional offense caused by the tweet. It was posted on Sunday - and has since been deleted - and showed a picture of Mendy when he was a kid alongside the character found on a packet of Conguitos, which are chocolate-covered nuts made in Spain. Both Mendy and the character are black.\n\nMendy, who is close friends with Silva having also played with the Portugal international at French club Monaco, issued a supporting statement with Silva\u2019s letter, saying he did not take offense.\n\nSilva has been strongly defended by City manager Pep Guardiola, who said his player\u2019s \u201cintention was just a joke\u201d and \u201cprobably the same happened a thousand million times with white people.\u201d Guardiola said it would be \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to think the tweet had any racist undertones.\n\nAnti-discriminatory body Kick It Out has called on the FA to take action, referring to the contents of the post as a racist stereotype.\n\nSilva has until Oct. 9 to respond to the charge.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva was charged with misconduct by the English Football Association on Wednesday for posting a tweet which compared teammate Benjamin Mendy to the character on a packet of Conguitos chocolates.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/britain_soccer_premier_league_80611_c0-280-3120-2099_s1770x1032.jpg?e0b23e5713d20284c02cee13dfa9d9361b84d8eb"}
