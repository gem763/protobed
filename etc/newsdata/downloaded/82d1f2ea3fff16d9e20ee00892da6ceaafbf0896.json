That could all be about to change. The Wall Street Journal reports that in South Korea, acorns have achieved \u201csuperfood\u201d status, with people devouring \u201cacorn noodles, jelly and powder\u201d. And, last month, the Woodland Trust in the UK published a piece on its website about acorns and how to eat them.\n\nWe\u2019re catching on late. Native Americans relied on acorns \u2013 rich in nutrients \u2013 as a staple part of their diet. They are farmed in China and South Korea, and often ground into flour. Many cultures make acorn \u201ccoffee\u201d. They are rich in protein, fats, fibre and essential minerals.\n\n\u201cMy life revolves around acorns,\u201d said Marcie Mayer in a recent Tedx Talk about the nuts. Mayer, who lives on a farm on a Greek island, produces cookies made from acorn flour. She pointed out that protecting oak trees, and planting more, could help tackle the climate crisis and that acorns are good for food security because they can be stored, squirrel-like, long-term.\n\n\u201cNow is the perfect season,\u201d says the forager Fergus Drennan, who is running an acorn-foraging course this weekend. \u201cYou might think to head off to the woods, but I go to parks, gardens and golf courses in particular.\u201d The acorns fall on to clean, short grass, which makes them easier to collect than rooting through leaf litter.\n\nGetting them ready to eat, \u201ctakes a little bit of work. You need to shell them first. If you\u2019re working small-scale, you could just slit them with a knife and pop them out of their shell.\u201d With bigger harvests (remembering to leave enough for wildlife), Drennan likes to dry them \u2013 you can do it on a radiator or spread out in a warm room \u2013 before sandwiching them between two sheets and getting some friends round to dance and stamp on them.\n\nThen you should leach them to get the bitter tannins out. Drennan says he puts them in a porous sack and sticks them in a toilet cistern. \u201cThat can take between two and six weeks, as the quantity of tannin can be variable. Don\u2019t mix batches from different trees, even if they\u2019re the same variety because they can have different tannin levels.\u201d\n\nThen they can be roasted, or ground for coffee or flour. \u201cLast year, I made an acorn chocolate cake, which I loved. More commonly, I put it in bread, and I like to make tagliatelle with it.\u201d They taste, he says, \u201cnutty, a bit earthy. There\u2019s a kind of density to it.\u201d", "description": "They can be roasted for coffee and ground down to make flour \u2013 and you can pick them up free at your local park", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a07a65ef2505321698b57b1132d6a28d30def0/0_156_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb976839f7e7e44a4a55ee981effc8dc", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
