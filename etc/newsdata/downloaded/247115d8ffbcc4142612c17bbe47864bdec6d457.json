These periods, which attract penalty rates, are when our customers want to shop and we're aligning our rosters to meet these changing needs,' she said.\n\nShe went on to say that the new changes will benefit the company in the long-run as well as the thousands of staff it supports.\n\nDailyMail Australia has contacted Woolworths for comment.\n\nWoolworths' managing director, Claire Peters, insisted that the new changes will benefit the company in the long-run as well as the thousands of staff it supports\n\n\n\n", "description": "Woolworths has made drastic changes to rosters, pays and store roles that could save them $50 million dollars annually but have in-turn negatively impacted employees and suppliers.", "authors": ["Mahnaz Angury For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19292496-0-image-a-19_1570184925375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
