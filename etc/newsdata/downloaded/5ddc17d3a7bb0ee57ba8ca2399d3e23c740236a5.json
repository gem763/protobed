(Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in the aftermath of a since-deleted pro-Hong Kong tweet that drew Chinese backlash, saying on Tuesday that the league is not apologizing for Morey\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said during a press conference before a preseason game between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors in Tokyo. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d\n\nThe tweet, which Morey sent last Friday, came as the league is ramping up its preseason schedule, which includes several games in Japan and China. The blowback was swift: Rockets legend Yao Ming, head of the Chinese basketball association, suspended cooperation with his former franchise, and Chinese streaming giant Tencent announced it would not show Rockets games for the upcoming season.\n\nSilver\u2019s newest comments drew additional penalties. After the remarks, Chinese broadcaster CCTV revealed it would not broadcast the two NBA exhibition games in China this week between the Brooklyn Nets \u2014 owned by Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai \u2014 and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d CCTV also stated it is reviewing all partnerships involving the NBA in the fallout of the situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d The commissioner will be heading to China Wednesday, and said he hopes to meet with league partners to help improve the situation.\n\nAfter the league\u2019s initial statement Sunday, which called the reaction to Morey\u2019s statements \u201cregrettable,\u201d numerous American lawmakers have urged the league to stand up to the Chinese and respect American values. Silver appeared to address those calls in a statement released before the press conference, saying \u201cBut for those who question our motivation, this is far more than about growing our business.\u201d", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in the aftermath of a pro-Hong Kong tweet that drew Chinese backlash.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
