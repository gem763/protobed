She covered her face with both hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving again. This time I\u2019m gonna stay and I\u2019m gonna burn in my house,\u201d she said on Sunday morning. \u201cPG&E has not learned anything? Are they trying to kill us?\u201d\n\nThe Kincade fire first erupted last Wednesday but doubled in size on Sunday, fueled by extreme wind conditions that saw gusts reaching over 100mph in some mountainous peaks. Authorities expanded evacuations throughout the week, extending them again throughout Sunday as the fire spread into the edges of the small towns of Windsor and Healdsburg. By Sunday evening, more than 185,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes, while the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) utility cut power to millions of people in an effort to prevent its wind-damaged equipment from sparking further blazes.\n\nFor many Sonoma county residents, Sunday\u2019s horror came in its unsettling similarity to the devastating 2017 North Bay firestorm that killed 44 people, destroyed thousands of homes and burned roughly 245,000 acres \u2013 a recent, ravaging trauma from which so many are still attempting to recover.\n\nThe Kincade fire remained a fraction of that size.\n\nCoffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is deep in the midst of rebuilding after it was all but destroyed in 2017. Freshly painted new homes stand next to naked wood frames, next to still empty lots, dry lumber piled on gravel. One homeowner evacuated with a hose still spraying over the fresh wood chips in their front yard.\n\nWith smoke from the fire bearing down, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated by Sunday morning, but Ken Herland stood outside, watering his yard and the new wooden fence surrounding it with a garden hose. Herland has only lived in this house since July.\n\n\u201cWe just put a new metal roof on the house,\u201d he said as he worked the hose. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I left the last time.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cThis time feels worse.\u201d\n\nThis time is, objectively, not worse, and the large evacuation zones and many repeated warnings left residents far more time to prepare and leave before danger approached.\n\nHerland\u2019s daughter Jessica evacuated the horses at her ranch by the Pepperwood Preserve, which by Sunday was burning in places. She watched a neighbor\u2019s video of the fire on her phone.\n\n\u201cThe ranch isn\u2019t on fire yet,\u201d she reported back. \u201cSo far, we\u2019re looking good. I\u2019ll be hopeful until they tell me not to be.\u201d\n\nThe Kincade Fire approaches a herd of alpacas in Sonoma county, California, on Sunday.

Two CalFire firefighters filled their truck\u2019s tank from a hydrant. By early afternoon, the fire would push to the outskirts of the town, where hundreds of firefighters worked to protect homes from spreading embers.\n\nFurther south on Sunday, evacuees had gathered at the Sonoma county fairgrounds, a temporary shelter and incident command for firefighters who had traveled from across the state, and the country, to fight the Kincade. The site was littered with stacks of hay bales and multicolored pumpkins in anticipation of a weekend Halloween event and petting zoo, since cancelled. Instead, the grounds were overflowing with evacuees who had nowhere else to go.", "description": "The wind-fanned Kincade wildfire doubled in size on Sunday, threatening the north Bay area where 44 people died two years agoThe wind whipped through the flats of Sonoma county on Sunday morning, spreading dry autumn leaves and oily shreds of eucalyptus through the streets of downtown Santa Rosa.Late", "authors": ["Susie Cagle In Sonoma County"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ophoae6nB0pTSmUuu5y1Uw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/0682f6a55a1ccee524305d4de8dd3af4", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
