Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposes 'prison abolition': 'A cage is a cage'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed abolishing prisons in favor of \u201cjust alternatives to incarceration\u201d in a series of tweets Monday.\n\n\u201cMass incarceration is our American reality,\u201d New York Democrat wrote. \u201cIt is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage as Jim Crow, American apartheid, & slavery. To end it, we have to change. That means we need to have a real conversation about decarceration & prison abolition in this country.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez was reacting to a tweet by comedian Chelsea Handler, highlighting the story of Deandre Somerville, a 21-year-old black man who was sentenced sent to jail for 10 days because he\u2019d slept through jury duty. Ms. Handler and others claimed that race played a factor in the man\u2019s harsh sentencing.\n\nWeighing in, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez recalled a conversation she had with a woman who was jailed as a teen and kept in solitary confinement.\n\n\u201cYesterday morning I spoke with a woman who was thrown in Rikers as a teenager,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cPut in solitary confinement for MONTHS, aka torture. Force-fed pills. The conditions were so bad, she too had drank out of toilets. A cage is a cage is a cage. And humans don\u2019t belong in them.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez later further explained her \u201cprison abolition\u201d stance after apparent backlash from \u201cthe right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the term \u2018prison abolition\u2019 is breaking some people\u2019s brains. The right is already freaking out,\u201d the congresswoman wrote. \u201cYet the US incarcerates more than anywhere in the world. We have more than enough room to close many of our prisons and explore just alternatives to incarceration.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, many people in jail or in prison don\u2019t belong there at all. Whether it\u2019s punitive sentencing for marijuana possession or jailing people for their poverty & letting the rich free through systems like cash bail, we wrongly incarcerate far, far too many people,\u201d she continued. \u201cSecondly, our prison & jail system is so large bc we use them as de facto mental hospitals, homeless shelters, & detox centers instead of *actually* investing in\u2026 mental health, housing, edu, & rehab. If we invested meaningfully, what do you think would happen to crime?\n\n\u201cLastly, people tend to say \u2018what do you do with all the violent people?\u2019 as a defense for incarcerating millions,\u201d she concluded. \u201cOur lawmaking process means we come to solutions together, &either way we should work to an end where our prison system is dramatically smaller than it is today.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
