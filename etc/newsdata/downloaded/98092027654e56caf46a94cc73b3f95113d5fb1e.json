So putting up those Christmas decorations early extends the excitement!\"\n\nAs for the people who give the outside of their house a glow up in the Christmas period, Mr. McKeown said that they tend to be deemed more \"friendly and cohesive\" compared to their neighbors.\n\nThe nostalgia associated with festive decorations reminds people of when they were children with no responsibilities.\n\nRead more: Hallmark is looking for amateur bakers to compete on a new show called 'Christmas Cookie Countdown'\n\nIn our stressful lives, we have few opportunities to feel truly irresponsible.\n\nAlongside this, memories associated with Christmas can often include individuals who are no longer with us.\n\n\"It may be a bittersweet feeling. Perhaps the holidays serve as a reminder of when a loved one was still alive. Or maybe looking at a Christmas tree reminds someone of what life was like when they still believed in Santa,\" said Mr. McKeown.\n\nBy putting up decorations we have time to reflect and remember those who have passed, which can make us feel calmer.\n\nSo if you were wondering when to start decorating, the answer is now.", "description": "If you were wondering when you should start putting up your decorations, the answer is now.", "authors": ["Alexandra Richards", "Evening Standard"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6ea262f4fc242e0623a29a-1536-768.jpg"}
