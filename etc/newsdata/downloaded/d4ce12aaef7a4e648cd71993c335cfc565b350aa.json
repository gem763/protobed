They came out and voted, and now it is your turn,\" he told Netanyahu and Gantz on Monday night.\n\n\"The responsibility for establishing a government falls on you, and the people expect you to find a solution and to prevent further elections, even if it comes at a personal and even ideological cost.\"\n\nGantz, an ex-military chief who mounted his challenge to the prime minister with no prior political experience, will face a formidable negotiating foe in Netanyahu.\n\nHe is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, having held the post for a total of more than 13 years, and has repeatedly outmanoeuvred rivals with his sharp political skills.\n\nRivlin is expected to designate a candidate to try to form a government sometime after he receives final official election results on Wednesday.\n\nThe timing of his announcement may depend on the progress of negotiations between the Likud and Blue and White.\n\nThe person chosen would then have 28 days to form a government, with a possible two-week extension.\n\nIf all attempts fail, Rivlin can then assign the task to someone else.", "description": "Negotiators for Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main opponent Benny Gantz met Tuesday to discuss possibilities for a unity government that both men say they should lead after last week's deadlocked election.
