(B. Venugopalarao/B. Venugopalarao)\n\n\u201cThe [pregnancy] was smooth. There were no complications,\u201d Shankar told The Post. \u201dShe only had respiratory issues, but that was taken care of.\"\n\nThe twins were conceived through in vitro fertilization. Because Yaramati had experienced menopause, a donor\u2019s egg was fertilized with Rajarao\u2019s sperm before it was implanted in the new mother, doctors told the Hindustan Times.\n\nShannon Clark, a professor of maternal and fetal medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, said Yaramati\u2019s delivery is atypical but not surprising given the existing technology around assisted reproduction.\n\nDaily News Quiz: Another House Republican exits ahead of 2020\n\nA woman\u2019s eggs deteriorate in quality and quantity over time, but her uterus \u201cis not subject to the same age constraints,\u201d Clark explained. By turning to egg donors, as Yaramati did, women are able to carry babies at an advanced age.\n\n\n\nSitarama Rajarao, 82, stands with one of the twins his wife birthed. (B. Venugopalarao)\n\nYaramati\u2019s doctors say that at 74, she is the oldest person in the world to give birth, though this was not immediately verifiable. Three years ago, another Indian woman, Daljinder Kaur, gave birth in her early 70s. She was reported by the Guardian to be 72, though her age was also not verifiable at the time. In 2007, a 59-year-old British mother broke the world record for giving birth after a natural pregnancy, the Telegraph reported.\n\nSeveral ethicists raised concerns about Kaur\u2019s pregnancy in 2016, arguing at the time that giving birth at such a late age is irresponsible. Others, including Kaur\u2019s doctor, countered that childbirth is a \u201cfundamental right\u201d that should not be denied to individuals based on their age.\n\nIn a 2016 document, the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine discouraged physicians from \u201cproviding donor oocytes or embryos to women over 55 years of age, even when they have no underlying medical problems.\u201d\n\nThe committee cited concerns around maternal and fetal safety, longevity and \u201cthe need for adequate psychosocial supports for raising a child to adulthood.\u201d", "description": "Doctors say Mangayamma Yaramati, 74, and her twin girls are healthy.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "Tania Dutta", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MK3vWqD9wi9CP71MCV2KtqVg65Q=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5d7296dbcff47e00097e597e/2019-09-06T171717Z_1_OVAVIZOFF_RTRMADC_0_INDIA-SEPTUAGENARIAN-BABY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
