But it\u2019s still unclear if China is willing to meet U.S. demands on core concerns related to intellectual property, forced technology transfer, subsidies and other state-directed policies accused of ripping off U.S. innovation.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Now, the administration now seems to be considering new ways to pressure China beyond tariffs.\n\nThe news that the administration is now considering capital measures was reported by Bloomberg on Friday, but people close to the administration have hinted for weeks that such actions were under consideration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at very low levels of pressure compared to what could be done,\u201d Michael Pillsbury, an outside adviser to Trump on China and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told POLITICO earlier this month.\n\nPillsbury described a measure the administration could take to eliminate waivers that allow Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to bypass auditing and financial disclosure requirements required for American firms. This could force major Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent off U.S. stock exchanges, he said.\n\n\u201cSteps that would inflict pain on China\u2019s national champion companies might bring them around to a binding deal,\u201d Pillsbury said.\n\nThere are 159 Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges, representing a total market capitalization of $1.1 trillion, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced legislation in June that would force Chinese companies to disclose financial information the Chinese government blocks U.S. regulators from reviewing.\n\nRubio and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) also sent a letter in late August to Michael Kennedy, the chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, to reverse a decision that exposed $50 billion worth of U.S. government workers\u2019 retirement assets to investments in Chinese firms.\n\nThe lawmakers said the decision exposed U.S. pension funds to Chinese companies involved in espionage, human rights abuses and Chinese industrial policies, like the \u201cMade in China 2025\" initiative, that have been the target of the U.S. tariff actions.\n\n\u201cThere are obvious problems that need to be urgently corrected given China\u2019s policies, its use of all companies to achieve them regardless of ownership structure, and its lack of transparency around all such efforts,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the discussions. \u201cFolks have had blinders on for far too long, particularly Wall Street.\u201d\n\nThe move could cause major disruptions as portfolio managers try to adjust to a possible ban and new regulations, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.\n\n\u201cMy own guess is this is just a negotiating tactic from the White House aimed at ratcheting up the pressure on China and giving a tangible show of U.S. leverage ahead of the upcoming meeting in October,\u201d he said.\n\nCapital controls and restrictions could also make it more difficult for the two sides to reach a true deal.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have confidence in China honoring a deal. China has no confidence in Trump; he appears to them as an unreliable moving target,\u201d said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. \u201cMy best guess is no real trade deal is possible for at least two years.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing recently repeated its warning that a further decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies would be counterproductive.\n\nDuring a speech this week to U.S. business executives on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will continue efforts to open up its economy.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of our economies and the level of interdependence, the so-called \u2018decoupling\u2018 or \u2018shutting the door to each other\u2018 is just like an attempt to build castles in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is neither sensible nor realistic.\u201c\n\nBen White contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3e/db/2bd248ae4d248f420c0a4a0779f3/190927-wall-street-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
