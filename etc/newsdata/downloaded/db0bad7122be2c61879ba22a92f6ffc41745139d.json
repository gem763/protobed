He gave us his word, but in the end he couldn't continue.'\n\nDe Gea appeared to suffer the injury while taking a goal kick just after the hour mark\n\nA stoppage-time strike by substitute Rodrigo Moreno cancelled out Marcus Berg's opener for Sweden and gave Spain the draw they needed to qualify for Euro 2020 in a Group F game that finished 1-1 on Tuesday night.\n\nSpain dominated the opening 20 minutes and looked set to easily book their berth in next year's finals but Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen pulled off a string of superb saves as his side grew into the game.\n\nStriker Berg put Sweden in front early in the second half after his initial header was saved, as was Emil Forsberg's shot, but Berg nodded home from close range at the second attempt to give his side the lead.\n\nDe Gea left the fray injured on the hour mark and, despite plenty of possession, the Spaniards had to wait until stoppage time before Rodrigo finally found a way past Olsen, firing home to send his group-leading side to the finals.", "description": "Manchester United face an anxious wait to discover the extent of the injury suffered by David De Gea while playing for Spain on Tuesday night.
