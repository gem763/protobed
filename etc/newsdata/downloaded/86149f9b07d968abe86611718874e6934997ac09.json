(and) support our industry to 17 million plus level for what is now the fifth straight year,\" Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a call with analysts.\n\nThere were concerns that GM's sales could take a hit after 48,000 hourly employees at the top U.S. automaker walked out for the first time in 12 years on Sept. 16 and remain on strike.\n\nGM did not face a severe inventory crunch in the third quarter, as most dealers showed healthy supply levels heading into October, according to an analysis by automotive shopping website CarGurus.\n\nHowever, the company risks facing parts shortage that could possibly affect sales in the current quarter, likely benefiting rivals including Ford.\n\nSales of Silverado pick-up trucks jumped 16.6% to 155,482 vehicles, boosting GM's total U.S. sales by 6.3% to 738,638 vehicles.\n\nSales of Ford's pick-up trucks rose 5% to 240,387, their best third-quarter performance in 14 years, even as overall sales fell 4.9% to 580,251 units, hurt by lower demand for the company's passenger cars including the Taurus sedan.\n\nFiat Chrysler's sales of its Ram pick-up trucks surged 14% to 161,635, marginally lifting overall sales by 0.1% to 565,034 units.\n\nGM's sales fell slightly short of U.S. car shopping website Edmunds' forecast of 748,746 vehicles, while Ford and Fiat Chrysler beat expectations. Edmunds had expected third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at GM.\n\nEdmunds had forecast Ford's sales at 570,179 vehicles and Fiat Chrysler's at 558,302.\n\nThe results showed September U.S. light vehicle seasonally adjusted annualized pace was tracking 17.2 million vehicles, above consensus of 17 million, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said.\n\nShares of GM fell 4.7% to their near four-month low of $34.41, while those of Ford slumped 5.2% to more than six-month low of $8.44. Fiat Chrysler's U.S.-listed shares slipped 2.1% to $12.46.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Anil D'Silva)", "description": "Shares of General Motors , Ford Motor  and Fiat Chrysler  were, however, trading lower, tracking a broad selloff in the market over fears of a U.S. slowdown.
