She shared the award equally with Indian-born American Banerjee and Kremer, also of the United States.\n\nThe Academy said the work of the three economists had shown how the problem of poverty could be tackled by breaking it down into smaller and more precise questions in areas such as education and healthcare, making problems easier to tackle.\n\n\"As a direct result of one of their studies, more than five million Indian children have benefited from effective programmes of remedial tutoring in school,\" the Academy said in a statement.\n\n\"Another example is the heavy subsidies for preventive healthcare that have been introduced in many countries.\"", "description": "Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer won the award for their studies into global poverty.
