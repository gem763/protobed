His young mother sent Clarence and his brother to live with their grandfather Myers Anderson, who was born poor but became the owner of a fuel-delivery company. In his 2007 memoir, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son,\u201d Thomas recalled the humiliations Anderson suffered, which ranged from abjectly terrifying to grotesquely petty; he once got a ticket for the phony violation of driving with too many clothes on.\n\nWhile white conservatives have since pointed to Jim Crow\u2019s demise as evidence that the country has moved beyond its historic sins to become a colorblind society, Thomas\u2019s views on race relations have always exuded a potent fatalism. \u201cI am here to say that discrimination, racism and bigotry have gone no place and probably never will,\u201d he told the graduating class of Savannah State College in 1985. But he wasn\u2019t just saying that some things don\u2019t change; he was saying that things had gotten worse. That same year, he told a group of black conservatives: \u201cWhat we had in Georgia under Jim Crow was not as bad as this.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cthis,\u201d he meant what white liberals had wrought \u2014 integration and social reform, or what Thomas prefers to call \u201cindiscriminate social engineering.\u201d He acknowledges that he was a beneficiary of affirmative action, but insists that such programs are inevitably stigmatizing and demeaning to the people they\u2019re meant to help. His position sets him apart from other conservatives, who typically cast affirmative action as tantamount to discrimination against white people \u2014 an argument Thomas doesn\u2019t buy. \u201cThey must remember that if we are to play the victim game,\u201d Thomas wrote in 1996, five years after joining the Supreme Court, \u201cthe very people they decry have the better claim to victim status.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas believes that affirmative action is a white program for white people,\u201d Robin writes, a way for liberal elites to perform a \u201cpatronizing indulgence\u201d while still maintaining their control over who gets admitted into their ranks. State action cannot help African-Americans \u2014 it can only harm them. Robin shows how Thomas\u2019s jurisprudence \u2014 curtailing voting rights and limiting regulatory powers \u2014 both assumes a political futility and exacerbates it, discouraging African-Americans from participating in the political realm and pushing them to focus their energies in the economic one. A capitalist economy might be unpredictable and risky, but at least it was ostensibly impersonal; better the mechanical indifference of the market than the capricious \u201cpunishments and preferments doled out by whites.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for this worldview is Thomas\u2019s grandfather Anderson, whom the justice venerates for his persistence, his hard work, his self-sufficiency and his communal ties. Thomas\u2019s vision is neither individualistic nor communitarian, Robin says; it\u2019s patriarchal. The welfare state cushions men from adversity, softening and ultimately emasculating them; Thomas paints it as especially degrading to \u201cthe strength and the will of black men,\u201d on whom he believes \u201cthe salvation of our race\u201d depends. Robin quotes Thomas castigating white liberals who would set out \u201cto destroy people like my grandfather and declare his manliness to be foolishness and wasted effort.\u201d\n\nAll of this made Anita Hill, who testified at Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearing that he had sexually harassed her, an \u201coverdetermined figure\u201d for Thomas; Robin describes him as so preoccupied with valorizing the black male provider that \u201cthere never was any room in this dreamscape for black women.\u201d\n\nReading Robin\u2019s book, you begin to wonder if this \u201cdreamscape\u201d is the future that Thomas and many of his fellow conservatives want: Women at home and out of sight, wealthy men providing for their families, with the \u201cmasses\u201d (cited by Thomas as \u201cmy people\u201d) competing for scraps.\n\nStill, readers on the left who are inclined to feel a smug sense of moral superiority should pause; they might share something with Thomas\u2019s bleak vision. \u201cThomas\u2019s black nationalism is mirrored not only by the white nationalism of Trump,\u201d Robin writes, \u201cbut also by the racial despair of the left.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I wholly agree with this diagnosis, but it isn\u2019t every day that reading about ideas can be both so gratifying and unsettling, and Robin\u2019s incisive and superbly argued book has made me think again.", "description": "In his new book, Corey Robin argues that the black nationalism underpinning Thomas\u2019s jurisprudence is a \u201csecret hiding in plain sight.\u201d", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/books/25bookrobin1/25bookrobin1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
