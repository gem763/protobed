Meanwhile, Mastercard (MA) and Shopify (SHOP) are on tap for early Tuesday.\n\nX\n\nGoogle stock fell modestly in late trading after clearing a buy point ahead of earnings. Beyond Meat stock and Grubhub stock plunged. T-Mobile stock and Akamai stock were little changed.\n\nMastercard stock and Shopify stock were quiet overnight. Mastercard stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Shopify stock, a big 2019 winner, is trying to recover from the big software sector sell-off.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures were just above fair value. S&P 500 futures were about flat. Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.1%, with Google stock a modest drag. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nCurrent Stock Market Rally\n\nThe current stock market rally had a strong Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, the S&P 500 index advanced 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite tacked on 1%. The S&P 500 hit a record high at the open and continued higher. The Nasdaq is within 14 points of an all-time high. The Dow Jones is 1% off its July all-time peak.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) rose 2.5% to 144.19, breaking out past a flat-base buy point to a new high after winning the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract over Amazon.com (AMZN). Microsoft \u2014 a member of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite \u2014 was Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day. Google stock climbed 2%.\n\nAmong the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) edged up 0.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rallied 0.9%, moving back above its 50-day line as Microsoft stock broke out and some damaged software leaders continued to rebound. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 1.5% to another high.\n\nThe Dow Jones today has yet to clear its old highs, but even the S&P 500 is just above its July peak. In fact, the S&P 500 isn't significantly above its January 2018 peak. As the prior stock market futures column stressed, continuing to advance beyond record highs is key to confirming that this stock market rally is a new or revived bull market.\n\nOn the upside, the indexes' marginal progress since early 2018 means that the stock market rally has stockpiled nearly two years' worth of earnings. That bodes well for the market uptrend, even with current sluggish earnings.\n\nGoogle Earnings\n\nGoogle earnings unexpectedly fell 22.5% to $10.12 a share, with gross revenue rising 20% to $40.49 billion. Analysts expected Google earnings to rise to $12.38 a share on revenue of $40.32 billion.\n\nGoogle stock fell 1.6% to 1,268.50 late, signaling a move to right at its 1,268.49 buy point. In Monday's session, Google stock rose nearly 2% to 1288.98, breaking out from a cup-with-handle base going back nearly six months. Google stock hit a record 1,299.24 intraday.\n\nBuying stock right before earnings is risky. That's why IBD recommends an earnings options strategy to capitalize on a stock's upside potential, while reducing the downside risk. Be sure to follow sound buy and sell rules to minimize your exposure.\n\nBeyond Meat Earnings\n\nBeyond Meat earnings came in at 6 cents a share for its third quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss. Revenue leapt 250% to $92 million. Analysts expected Beyond Meat earnings per share of three cents with revenue of $82.23 million.\n\nBeyond Meat sees full-year revenue of $265 million to $275 million. Given the Q3 beat of nearly $10 million, that implies cautious sales guidance for Q4.\n\nBeyond Meat is booming as it expands into more restaurants. But competitors from plant-based pure-play Impossible Burger to huge food giants has take a toll on Beyond Meat stock.\n\nBeyond Meat stock fell 10% late. The lackluster guidance and a Beyond Meat IPO lockup expiration Tuesday may have fueled selling. Beyond Meat stock had rallied 4.6% to 105.41 on Monday.\n\nBeyond Meat stock debuted at 25 a share in early May, running up all the way to 239.71 on July 25. Since then shares have sold off hard.\n\nGrubhub Earnings\n\nGrubhub earnings came in at 27 cents a share. Revenue climbed 30% to $322.1 million. Analysts expected Grubhub earnings of 27 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research, but other forecasts were at 28 cents. Revenue was supposed to hit $330 million.\n\nThe food delivery operator also gave weak guidance.\n\nGrubhub stock plunged 30% late. That would send Grubhub stock to its lowest level since mid-2017. Grubhub stock peaked at 149.35 in September 2018, closing at 58.39 on Monday.\n\nT-Mobile Earnings\n\nT-Mobile earnings rose 25% to $1.16 a share. Revenue climbed 2% to $11.06 billion. Analysts expected T-Mobile earnings of 97 cents but also revenue of $11.284 billion.\n\nT-Mobile stock fell a fraction overnight. Shares rose 0.9% to 82.39 on Monday. T-Mobile stock is working on an 85.32 cup-base buy point.\n\nAkamai Earnings\n\nAkamai earnings rose 17% to $1.10 a share. Revenue climbed 6% to $710 million. Security product revenue, including acquisitions, popped 28% to $216 million. Analysts expected Akamai earnings of $1 a share on revenue of $701.3 million. They had estimated Akamai security revenue of $210 million for the internet infrastructure provider.\n\nAkamai stock rose slightly late. Shares closed up 0.4% to 89.48, just below the 50-day line. Akamai stock is moving toward a 93.22 flat-base entry.\n\nShopify Earnings\n\nAnalysts expect Shopify earnings to spike 175% to 11 cents a share. Revenue should jump 42% to $384.5 million, though that would be the ninth straight quarter of slowing top-line growth.\n\nShopify stock rose 2.4% to 324.93 on Monday. Shares peaked at 409.61 on Aug. 27 but sold off hard with other big software stock winners. Shopify stock last week did not undercut its September lows and is trying to move back to its 50-day line.\n\nMastercard Earnings\n\nWall Street sees Mastercard earnings per share rising 13% to $2.01, with revenue up 14% to $4.42 billion. That would mark the third straight quarter of slowing Mastercard earnings growth but the second quarter of faster sales gains.\n\nMastercard stock climbed 2.1% to 275.93 on Monday, reclaiming its 50-day line. The payments giant is working on a 293.79 flat-base buy point. Mastercard stock has been lagging the S&P 500 index over the past several weeks.\n\nDow Jones futures and other futures could swing on early Tuesday earnings such as Shopify, Mastercard, General Motors (GM), and Dow Jones drug giants Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:\n\nThe Big Picture: Leaders Emerge In These Sectors\n\n5 Reasons Why Wed.'s Rate Cut Will Be The Fed's Last\n\nWhy 69% Sales Growth May Lift This Stock To New Heights\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today", "description": "Dow Jones futures: After the S&P 500 hit a new high, Google stock fell to a buy point as Google earnings missed.
