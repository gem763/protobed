Prospects are few. And violence against women and children is endemic.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the department of social development\u2019s brand new centre for victims and survivors of gender-based violence was opened last week.\n\nClad in a black dress, her distinctive Afro accentuated by sparkling eyes, Patricia Toli is the embodiment of a Seoding survivor.\n\nThe 42-year-old mother-of-two has been raped and physically abused more than once.\n\n\u201cI was raped for the first time at the age of nine by a family friend. At the age of 29 I was beaten to a pulp by my boyfriend,\u201d says Toli, whose earlier cheerfulness has now been replaced by a visible air of despair.\n\nJust as she was healing from that and trying to rebuild her life, the same fate befell her again.\n\n\u201cThe man I married and with whom I have two children was extremely abusive and he repeatedly beat me. It became the norm,\u201d she says.\n\nA tear trickles down Toli\u2019s cheek. She pauses to catch a deep breath, trying hard to compose herself.\n\nBut she is so overwhelmed by the pain and emotions her hands trembling.\n\n\u201cMy heart is sore because I have not made peace with the rape that happened when I was nine. The two men who violated me in my later years were aware of the rape that happened early in my life \u2026 I can never forgive these people,\u201d Toli says.\n\n\u201cThese were people I trusted with my deepest secrets and I feel like they took advantage of that. My past is hampering me [from making progress] and it is not easy to move on after such attacks \u2026 to make it worse, the law is disappointing us.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, Toli believes the abuse has filtered down to her son.\n\n\u201cI have a 10-year-old who witnessed his father abusing me and now he has turned violent and beats other children at school.\u201d\n\nRESTORING HOPE\n\nIn line with President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s action plan to tackle the scourge of violence against women and children, Deputy Minister of Social Development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, earmarked Seoding as one of the places for a centre for victims and survivors of gender-based violence.\n\nThe centre is directly linked with the local police station.\n\n\u201cWhen a woman or a child is violated, the White Door Centre is a place they can run to prior to turning to the police. Once they are safely taken into the centre, police will be contacted,\u201d Bogopane-Zulu said during the opening of the centre last week.\n\n\u201cJohn Taolo Gaetsewe as a district does not have a shelter for women in need of protection from gender-based violence. We learnt that the number of women abuse cases in the area were on the rise so we had to make sure that we provide the community with this centre,\u201d she said.\n\nBoitumelo Kgakelebotse (25) was born in Seoding. She also suffered at the hands of an abuser, and is excited about the new centre.\n\n\u201cI was abused by a man I used to date. I got sick and tired of it and one day I decided to go to the police station and report him.\n\n\u201cI got a protection order and he actually stayed away from me,\u201d she explains.\n\nKgakelebotse believes that \u201cthis centre could be the safety net women in Seoding need and could help calm the high levels of crime in the area\u201d.\n\nAlthough the centre still doesn\u2019t have running water and electricity, it will provide a 24-hour service from its staff members who include psychologists and counsellors.\n\nSeoding at a glance THE PEOPLE\n\nThe Northern Cape is the largest province geographically, but it is the most sparsely populated, with a population of just over 1.2 million (2.1%), according to StatsSA 2018 mid-year population estimates.\n\nThe Northern Cape is the largest province geographically, but it is the most sparsely populated, with a population of just over 1.2 million (2.1%), according to StatsSA 2018 mid-year population estimates. UNEMPLOYMENT\n\nAccording to StatsSA\u2019s labour force survey for quarter two of 2019, the unemployment rate in the province rose by 3.4 percentage points. The increase from 26% to 29.4% made it the province with the second-largest recorded increase, after the North West.\n\nAccording to StatsSA\u2019s labour force survey for quarter two of 2019, the unemployment rate in the province rose by 3.4 percentage points. The increase from 26% to 29.4% made it the province with the second-largest recorded increase, after the North West. SEODING\n\nA StatsSA 2011 census showed that the small village of Seoding has a population of just more than 7000, mostly of youth between the ages of 16 and 35. According to the census more than 12% of the more than 2000 households have no source of income.\n\n\n\nTHE SOCIOECONOMICS OF SEODING\n\n\n\nDuring the launch, police visibility was high, a novelty for the villagers.\n\nThe nearest police station is about 7km away in Mothibistad or 15km in Kuruman.\n\n\u201cWe can wait [for] up to two days before police arrive when they are needed in emergencies,\u201d says 21-year-old Mpho Morwagae.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they only have one car or what [the problem is]. Just last night [Monday] someone was stabbed right in front me. The police were called but we received no assistance.\u201d\n\nMorwagae is a self-proclaimed \u201chustler\u201d and doesn\u2019t believe that education is the be-all and end-all for one to have a successful future.\n\nWe find him in the company of four friends, who gleefully give each other random high-fives while engaging in a seemingly funny conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about an individual and a person\u2019s mentality, that is what makes a person successful \u2013 intelligence and a positive mindset,\u201d he says in a husky voice, admitting to not having slept much the night before.\n\nMorwagae says he found \u201csolace in weed and alcohol\u201d and started smoking dagga when he was 13.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith nothing to do, how else can I keep myself busy?\u201d he asks.\n\nHe is skeptical about what, if any, difference the White Door Centre will make.\n\n\u201cI doubt the centre will make a difference because the abuse of women is prevalent and police don\u2019t intervene,\u201d he says.\n\nAobakwe Tsolo (24) runs his own car wash. We find them sitting under a tree with his friend Chalk, who runs the business with him.\n\nThe two are originally from Lesotho.\n\nTsolo says the lack of job opportunities in the area means the local people need an entrepreneurial mindset.\n\n\u201cWhere would we look for jobs in this area? There are no jobs. So the best thing to do is to be proactive and not wait for things to come to you,\u201d he says.\n\nNext to him are six drums filled with water. Tsolo has no access to running water. He stores all the materials he needs to do his job in an orange shack.\n\nAlthough Tsolo is the proud owner of Stu\u2019s Car Wash, he says it is not always easy to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI have been here since morning and I have not had a single customer,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s now 4pm.\n\nTHE BOOZE\n\nTshesa Nyama Tavern is just a few metres from the new centre.\n\nAt 10am, the drinking spot is empty but the owners say they are \u201cusually swamped from Thursdays\u201d [and over the weekends].\n\nNtombizodwa Bosman, the 26-year-old owner, runs the tavern with her boyfriend of three years.\n\nShe has been behind the till since 7am and will be closing shop at 8pm.\n\nBosman is indifferent about the centre and if it will stop the violence.\n\n\u201cYes, we know that drinking is a problem in our area. But we have to make a living and this tavern is what sustains us.\n\n\u201cDrinking is part of the culture in this community,\u201d she says.\n\nBosman, who has a seven-year-old-son, acknowledges the role that alcohol consumption has played in the high levels of crime.\n\n\u201cMost of the crimes we have witnessed at the tavern typically involve young boys. They drink, get drunk and most of the time they stab each other for material things, such as phones.\u201d", "description": "The White Door Centre is directly linked to local police station as part of government\u2019s new plan to tackle gender-based violence.", "authors": ["Palesa Dlamini"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7945/7556578eb7c4445c973e978fe84a5736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
