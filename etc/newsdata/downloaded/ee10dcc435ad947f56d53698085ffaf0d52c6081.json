Instead, it\u2019s a bet Trump can prevail through his own aggressive public messaging campaign and the help of the Republican-controlled Senate, which ultimately would have to vote on the U.S. president\u2019s fate following an impeachment trial.\n\n\u201cThere is no discernible legal strategy coming out of the White House,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who has participated in prior impeachment cases before Congress. \u201cMany of the latest positions laid out in the letter undermine the White House\u2019s best legal arguments.\u201d\n\nHiring former Representative Trey Gowdy as an outside legal adviser was another sign of the political dimensions shaping the White House fight.\n\nThe White House letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sent on Tuesday night, said the administration will not cooperate in any way with the Democrats\u2019 investigation. The letter argued the Democrats\u2019 inquiry was invalid because liberals have long sought to discredit Trump since his election in 2016, and this was only the latest salvo.\n\nDemocrats launched the inquiry after a whistleblower complaint and White House summary transcript showed Trump asking the Ukrainian president to investigative his political rival ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign, a move Democrats say undermines national security and foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers are dealing with a client who wants to see this type of aggressive and, frankly, reckless public banter,\u201d Turley said, referring to the strong rhetoric laid out in that White House letter. \u201cThere has never been any evidence of the legal team being the driving force behind the White House\u2019s public statement or strategy. At some point, they will have to mount a legal defense.\u201d\n\nHiring former Representative Trey Gowdy as an outside legal adviser was another sign of the political dimensions shaping the White House fight. While Gowdy served as federal prosecutor and district attorney in South Carolina, he\u2019s also known for his partisan and aggressive leadership of the House oversight committee and his Fox News commentary.\n\nWhite House officials expect Gowdy to play the role of made-for-TV surrogate during the impeachment fight, offering political advice, communication skills and \u201ctrench warfare\u201d expertise, a senior administration official said. The president is excited he was joining the team, a second aide said.\n\nAmong Trump allies and White House officials, there\u2019s also talk of Gowdy potentially managing the White House\u2019s war room to steer the political and communications response, a Republican close to the White House said.\n\nBut Gowdy is not expected to be brought into the inner circle of the White House counsel\u2019s office, over which top attorney Pat Cipollone has kept a tight grip.\n\n\u201cThe counsel\u2019s office wants to concentrate the flow of information as much as possible. They keep a narrow circle on this. Lawyers do not like others meddling,\u201d said the Republican close to the White House.\n\nIn addition to the roughly 40 lawyers within the White House counsel\u2019s office, the president is also receiving legal and communication advice from Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, the law firm of Consovoy McCarthy, and Marc Mukasey, a criminal trial lawyer based in New York, according to a second Republican close to the White House.\n\nThese attorneys maintain that the Democratic impeachment inquiry amounts to political theater and an abuse of process.\n\nThat argument also conveniently gives Senate Republicans an out, said one of the Republicans close to the White House. \u201cThe senators will not have to address the merits of the impeachment investigation. All they will have to say is that this is a charade. Why should I spend a moment on the merits?\u201d this person said.\n\nWhite House officials and Trump allies argue the administration\u2019s letter to the House does contain legal arguments, despite any skepticism from constitutional law experts.\n\nFor now, the White House is leaning into its aggressive political strategy of stonewalling the Democrats.\n\nOfficials say the White House has not received due process during the impeachment inquiry, an argument laid out in detail in the letter, including the ability to cross-examine and call witnesses and access evidence and transcripts of testimony.\n\n\u201cLet me just say: The Republican Party and president has been treated extremely badly by the Democrats, very unfairly, because they have a tiny margin in the House. They have eviscerated the rules. They don\u2019t give us any fair play,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday at an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. \u201cIt is the most unfair situation people have seen.\u201d\n\nTrump added that the White House would cooperate with House Democrats if they held a formal impeachment vote and \u201cif they give us our rights.\u201d He also said the impeachment inquiry will likely end up being decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublican lawyers and Trump allies overwhelmingly believe the Republican-controlled Senate will decide the fate of the Trump presidency.\n\nFor now, the White House is leaning into its aggressive political strategy of stonewalling the Democrats. They hope the approach will slow the Democrats\u2019 inquiry and sap its momentum, so much so that Americans either become confused about the procedural details or lose interest. Polling now shows a majority of Americans favor the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cWhat legal strategy?\u201d said a third Republican close to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s a delay strategy to force the Democrats to impeach on procedural grounds of obstructing the investigation. There won\u2019t be a court battle because the Democrats have no need to go to court, they will impeach for failing to provide documents.\u201d", "description": "To survive the riskiest battle of his term, US president is skipping the legal minutiae and pulling out his fighting gloves.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook", "Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180081881-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
