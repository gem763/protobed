It\u2019s called \u201cViva,\u201d and it will be available for $1,800 in Taiwan in October, and \u201csome global markets\u201d starting in 2020.\n\nAt 80 kilograms (176 pounds), the Viva is the smallest and most nimble scooter that Gogoro\u2019s created to date. It\u2019s meant to be a city commuter, something that can replace a 50-100cc gas scooter that\u2019s often used for short trips. As such, it has a range of just 85 kilometers (just shy of 53 miles).\n\nOnly 53 miles of range, but in Taipei, there are battery swaps on almost every corner\n\nBut like all of Gogoro\u2019s other scooters, the Viva is powered by swappable batteries. So any time a user is running out of juice they can stop at one of the company\u2019s 1,400 battery swap stations scattered throughout Taiwan. The difference is that the Viva will use just one battery, whereas Gogoro\u2019s other scooters use two. (That\u2019s likely thanks to the fact that Gogoro has been switching over to new batteries that use the same type of Panasonic cells found in the Tesla Model 3.)\n\nThe Viva scooter will also be \u201ccompletely customizable,\u201d Gogoro CEO Horace Luke tells The Verge, with \u201cover 100 accessories that you can bolt on.\u201d Despite its small size, the Viva also has 21 liters (under one cubic foot) of storage.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can make it a utility vehicle if you want, you can make it a more stylish vehicle if you want, you can make it a more naked vehicle if you want, or you can put on a whole bunch of bags and carrying gear,\u201d he says.\n\nLuke also says he expects the Viva to be less intimidating than Gogoro\u2019s other scooters, which are larger and faster. \u201cIt\u2019s less like a motorcycle, and more like something where you can say: \u2018I need to go half a mile, or two or three miles, from point A to point B, and I can jump on this and I don\u2019t have any stress doing it,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nGogoro debuted its first scooter all the way back at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show, but the company has since released multiple iterations on the design. The most recent, the Gogoro 3, can last for 105 miles on two full batteries. (That model runs for about $2,500.)\n\nAlong the way, the company has gobbled up market share in Taiwan, while slowly testing out markets outside its home country. Gogoro has trialed vacation rentals in Japan, more straightforward shared rental services in France and Germany, and recently provided scooters to delivery services in Korea. In total, Luke says, more than 1 billion kilometers (621 million miles) have been driven on the company\u2019s scooters.\n\nThe company has also partnered up with some incumbent scooter manufacturers like Yamaha to help accelerate a broader switchover to electric, and positions its battery swap stations as a way to help power-hungry cities handle peak energy demand. The Viva scooter helps complete a product line that Luke says should be very attractive to cities that want to change how people get around in a sustainable way.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants micromobility in their city, but micromobility that is steady, that is licensed, that is kind of governed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and spread this as big as possible over the next 24 months.\u201d", "description": "Taiwan\u2019s Gogoro has a new scooter coming out that\u2019s smaller and more adaptable than anything else in the company\u2019s growing stable.
