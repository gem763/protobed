Last season City were third after 19 matches and were seven points adrift of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, before clawing their way back with a strong finish to the campaign.\n\nThe international break will give Guardiola and his staff time to ponder the problems and find solutions because any further dropped points really could all but end their title tussle with Klopp's side.\n\nWith that in mind, Sportsmail takes a look at where the issues seem to be for City and why last season's heroic effort may be taking its toll.\n\nDODGY DEFENCE\n\nThe departure of club captain Vincent Kompany in the summer was a symbolic moment on and off the pitch.\n\nHe had been a mainstay in the side since Sheikh Mansour's investment arrived and has survived multiple managers and new arrivals to provide an air of calmness at the back.\n\nThat has now gone and while optimism was high initially, the baton passed to Aymeric Laporte, injuries have struck and City looks increasingly vulnerable when sides come to attack them.\n\nNicolas Otamendi has struggled this season and has been caught out on multiple occasions\n\nNicolas Otamendi was caught out again for Wolves' first goal on the counter-attack as Raul Jimenez jinked it past him as he slid in and failed to take either man or ball.\n\nThe Argentine was culpable in the defeat to Norwich, too. Teemu Pukki hassled and harried him and he brings panic, rather than the calmness mentioned earlier that Kompany gave those around him.\n\nIn contrast to last season where City had conceded just three goals in their opening eight games, Guardiola's side have shipped nine in the same number of matches this season.\n\nGoals aren't the problem - they have hit 27 in the Premier League already this season which is more than they did after eight games in 2018-19, albeit the 8-0 rout of Watford skewed results somewhat.\n\nBut defensively teams are growing increasingly confident that they can press Otamendi in particular into mistakes.\n\nGuardiola has had to deploy Fernandinho at centre back to partner Otamendi in recent games\n\nFernandinho has been a crucial piece of the puzzle for City in recent years as a defensive midfielder and while he is competent at centre back, he is having to hold it together alongside a less-than-confident Otamendi, with John Stones and Laporte out.\n\nCity are used to blowing teams away, particularly at home; they lost just once at home in all of last season when Crystal Palace ran out 3-2 winners.\n\nBut the defeat to Wolves showed how when frustration kicks in and City, in a depserate bid to not lose further ground on rivals Liverpool, throw most of the side forward, they can be caught short time and time again on the counter-attack.\n\nAdama Traore left with two goals in the end as City fell apart defensively but ultimately, those at the Etihad on Sunday know it was far from a smash-and-grab from the Midlanders.\n\nINJURIES HURT\n\nIt is no coincidence that Manchester City's two league defeats in the Premier League arrived after Laporte was ruled out of action until 2020.\n\nThe Frenchman was tasked with shoring up the City backline following Kompany's departure but after he damaged his cartilage and lateral meniscus in his knee against Brighton, he was forced to take a back-seat role.\n\nAymeric Laporte's injury shows City's lack of depth at centre back and he is out until 2020\n\nGuardiola made noises in the summer that he wanted to bring in another centre back as he knew it was becoming an increasingly problematic position, even more so if Laporte was to sit out injured.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE ASSIST TABLE Kevin de Bruyne (Man City) - 8 David Silva (Man City) - 4 Emi Buendia (Norwich) - 4 Anwar El Ghazi (Aston Villa) - 3 Erik Pieters (Burnley) - 3\n\nHarry Maguire's price tag put City off and he eventually made the move to join rivals Manchester United for a record \u00a380million - the most paid for a defender in world football.\n\nThat left Laporte, Otamendi and Stones as the primary options for the two positions, with Guardiola not regularly looking to Kyle Walker to slot in at centre back as Gareth Southgate did for England.\n\nKevin de Bruyne is another who sat out the defeat to Wolves and while City made do without him for much of last season on route to the title, they really feel the effect when he is out of the side.\n\nThe Belgian is the conductor and has the best passing range in the side, run closely by David Silva. He has the ability to unlock even the meanest of defences and so when injury flared up in the away win at Everton, concern going forward was natural.\n\nKevin de Bruyne's absence was keenly felt in the disappointing defeat to Wolves on Sunday\n\nIt is worth noting that De Bruyne has twice as many assists as anybody else in the division. That kind of influence is difficult to replace.\n\nHe has 29 key passes so far this season and is the focal point that Guardiola can build his midfield around when he is fit. It was his absence, arguably more so than Laporte, that City felt most against Wolves.\n\nWolves conceded five against Chelsea's young guns and yet City, at home, managed just two shots on target.\n\nDe Bruyne is set to make a timely return to the side against Crystal Palace after the international break. Any further damage to the Belgian playmaker could all but see City surrender to a relentless Liverpool.\n\nUNFAMILIAR TERRITORY\n\nGuardiola's teams have rarely found themselves on the back-foot in a title race; usually it is they who are setting the pace.\n\nIn 2008-09, Guardiola's first title in La Liga, Barcelona were top from gameweek nine and stayed there before lifting the title.\n\nGuardiola has never been this adrift of a title rival and it is unfamiliar territory for his players\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009-10 they lost once all season in a fiercely close battle with Real Madrid. They were never a point or two off their rivals and were top with eight games left to make it back-to-back titles.\n\nThe following year Guardiola masterminded a title win which saw Barcelona coast home and stay top from gameweek 13 onwards. In Spain, he never found himself this far off.\n\nHis three titles at Bayern Munich - in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 - were won by 19, 10 and 10 points respectively. The challenge was minimal and from about gameweek five or gameweek six they were top and were never moved.\n\nBut the Premier League has proven a tougher beast, even if in his maiden season City ran away with the title, winning by 19 points over Manchester United.\n\nLast season was the indicator that the momentum was shifting and Liverpool had heavy artillery to win their first Premier League title.\n\nFor the likes of Sergio Aguero and David Silva - players who were in the side when Roberto Mancini delivered the club their first top-flight title - this is not a position they are used to finding themselves in.\n\nEven by City's standards they know the rest of the campaign must be flawless - two wins against Liverpool is a must. Another defeat could be disastrous if Klopp's side continue at the pace they are going right now.", "description": "Pep Guardiola has eight domestic league titles to his name as a manager but if he is to add number nine, he will have to pull off something he has never done before.
