REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) reported an 18% drop in its third-quarter pre-tax profit, lagging forecasts, as the Sino-U.S. trade war and Brexit uncertainties weighed on business sentiment in its core markets of Asia and Britain.\n\nPre-tax profit at Europe\u2019s biggest bank by assets was $4.8 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $5.9 billion a year earlier, HSBC said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday.\n\nThe profit was lower than the $5.3 billion average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by the bank.\n\nHSBC has been looking to step up its cost-cutting efforts amid gloomier business outlook due to an escalation of a trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market, and Brexit.", "description": "HSBC Holdings Plc reported an 18% drop in its third-quarter pre-tax profit, lagging forecasts, as the Sino-U.S. trade war and Brexit uncertainties weighed on business sentiment in its core markets of Asia and Britain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445709850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R074", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
