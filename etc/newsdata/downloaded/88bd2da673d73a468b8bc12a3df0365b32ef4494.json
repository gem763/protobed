(AP) \u2014 Freshman Breece Hall rushed for 132 yards and scored three touchdowns to lead Iowa State to a 38-14 victory over West Virginia on Saturday night.\n\nHall scored on a pair of 1-yard runs and also had a 12-yard TD. He might have given the Cyclones (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) the dependable option at running back they'd been looking for ever since star David Montgomery departed.\n\n\"He certainly did a great job tonight and hopefully he can build on that,\" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \"I expect that he would.\"\n\nBrock Purdy threw for one TD and ran for another for the Cyclones, who held the Mountaineers (3-3, 1-2) scoreless in the second half.\n\nWest Virginia quarterback Austin Kendall was hit hard while attempting a pass during the Mountaineers' first series. He did not return and was replaced by backup Jack Allison.\n\nWest Virginia coach Neal Brown said Kendall appeared to sustain a chest injury and will know more by early in the week.\n\n\"It's not an arm or shoulder injury,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Cyclones scored 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to pull away.\n\n\"I'm not disappointed in our effort. I thought our guys were ready to play,\" Brown said. \"We just ran out of gas.\"\n\nHall entered the game fifth on the team with 84 rushing yards on 18 carries. The 205-pound Hall is the third different running back to lead the Cyclones in rushing this season and the first to eclipse 100 yards. Purdy had 102 yards a week ago against TCU.\n\nJohnnie Lang started Saturday's game and had four carries for 11 yards before giving way to Hall.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa State: Hall's performance will help the Cyclones take the running load off of Purdy, who entered the game with the most carries on the team.\n\nWest Virginia: The Mountaineers were limited to 190 yards of offense. Allison had one good series but couldn't generate enough offense to keep up with Purdy. Allison finished 18 of 24 for 140 yards with one touchdown pass and an interception.\n\nTARGETING\n\nThe Mountaineers will be without cornerback Hakeem Bailey for most of next weekend's game after the senior was called for targeting for a hit on wide receiver Tarique Milton early in the third quarter.\n\nEARLY CYCLONE STRUGGLES\n\nIowa State's offense had two three-and-outs all season entering the game but failed to get a first down on two of its first three series Saturday. On the second one, West Virginia's Tykee Smith caught a deflected pass from Purdy and went 19 yards for the opening touchdown.\n\nCHANGE OF FORTUNE\n\nWest Virginia's Nicktroy Fortune broke up a second-quarter pass that would have forced an Iowa State punt near midfield. Instead, linebacker VanDarius Cowan was called for using his hands to the face on the play, giving the Cyclones a first down at the 34. Purdy later converted a fourth-down run and then scored on a 2-yard run to put Iowa State ahead 14-7.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa State travels to Texas Tech next Saturday.\n\nWest Virginia plays at No. 6 Oklahoma next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
