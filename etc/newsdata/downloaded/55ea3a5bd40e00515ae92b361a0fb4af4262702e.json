The menu was reassuring in that it made no reference to any marinade or potential allergenic ingredient in the food selected \u2026 The deceased was not informed that there were allergens in the order. The food served to and consumed by the deceased contained dairy which caused the deceased to suffer a severe anaphylactic reaction from which he died.\u201d\n\nThe family of the teen have called for legislation referred to as \u2018Owen\u2019s law\u2019, requiring food allergens to be clearly labelled on menus, saying:\n\n\u201cIt is simply not good enough to have a policy which relies on verbal communication between the customer and their server, which often takes places in a busy, noisy restaurant where the turnover of staff is high and many of their customers are very young. This leaves far too much room for error on an issue we know all too well costs lives.\u201d", "description": "Owen Carey, a teen from the UK, died of a \"severe allergic reaction\" after eating a chicken burger, a coronoer has found this week.", "authors": ["Alasdair Duncan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/OwenCareyBurgerDeathFB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
