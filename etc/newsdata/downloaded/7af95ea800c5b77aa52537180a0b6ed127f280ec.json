Hundreds of customers have expressed their dissatisfaction with both Rent the Runway\u2019s special event service \u2014 where customers take out designer outfits for formal occasions \u2014 and its everyday wear business. The start up, which is valued at over $1 billion and backed by investors like Franklin Templeton, has blamed the installation of a new warehouse software system for the issues.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

All event orders scheduled to be received the first week of October are canceled and the company is not accepting any new event rental orders or new subscribers until October 15. Regular subscription orders may also be delayed by one or two days until then, the email said.\n\nRent the Runway\u2019s latest troubles began on September 13 after it installed a new system in its New Jersey warehouse, said Hyman. The integration of the new system wreaked havoc on fulfilment, impacting the number of orders that could be shipped each day.\n\nUltimately, the new software should be \u201cthe most significant transformation in our company\u2019s history,\u201d said Hyman. It will allow the company to make items available faster, thanks to a new racking system for inventory.\n\nHyman said the problems affected 14% of Rent the Runway\u2019s subscriber base and a smaller percentage of event renters. Following the mishaps, the company\u2019s supply chain head Marv Cunningham, who previously worked at Target Corp. and Amazon Inc., is stepping down after about a year in the role.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rent the Runway\u2019s social media pages have been inundated with complaints from customers who weren\u2019t able to get help from customer service representatives. There have also been complaints since July over long wait times for customer service, before the warehouse issue. The company said earlier that it would double its customer service staff and make it simpler to cancel subscriptions.\n\nThe company was founded in 2009 by Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss, who now works at Walmart Inc., as a rental platform for women to get outfits for special events. It\u2019s since grown rapidly into a subscription business, with most of its customers now paying a monthly fee of $159 to rent items ranging from Kate Spade dresses to Oscar de la Renta earrings for everyday use. The service has also starting renting out children\u2019s clothing and home decor, attracting criticism that it\u2019s expanding too quickly.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The Fashion rental service is refunding and giving out extra cash to disgruntled customers although the disruptions are likely to continue.", "authors": ["Kim Bhasin"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/jennifer-hyman.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C15px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
