Neale Whitaker was quick to slam it, describing it as \u201cpolarising\u201d and \u201ca bit ostentatious\u201d i.e. pretentious.\n\nHe is not one to hold back. Clearly.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom for the couple. In fact the judges had a lot to like about their rooms \u2014 even Neale.\n\nHere\u2019s exactly what went down.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Double veranda reveal\n\nHOUSE 5: Jesse and Mel\n\nYes, the fully custom $8000 wine cellar was a major talking point in Jesse and Mel\u2019s room reveal, but upon walking into their house all three judges were blown away with how far they had come in completing most of their rooms.\n\nShaynna took particular appreciation to Jesse\u2019s handy work with the chevron floors.\n\n\u201cJust remember, Jesse laid this all out by himself,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd it was a massive space to cover too.\n\n\u201cI love the simplicity of that arch. And how beautiful does this formal room feel now,\u201d she added as she stood in the hallway.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Ensuite, studio reveal\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first person to admit I didn\u2019t like this formal room but now seeing it as a whole with this hallway, I think it works beautifully,\u201d Neale said.\n\nNeale once compared it to the \u201cfoyer of an office\u201d. In other words. boring.\n\nIt was at this point they discovered the luxury wine cellar in the hallway.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Darren yelled.\n\n\u201cTalk about knowing your market,\u201d Shaynna added, as the pair drooled over the $8000 cellar.\n\n\u201cBeautifully finished. I love the detailing in here,\u201d Darren said. \u201cWhat a wonderful entrance and possibly one of the most tasteful ways of displaying wine we have ever seen on The Block.\u201d\n\nNeale however had another view, describing it as a \u201cdramatic statement\u201d and wondered if it was a bit \u201cpolarising\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big statement, it\u2019s a very big statement. You have got to really love and value your wine,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is going to want a wine cellar that is that dominant.\n\n\u201cI think I am probably trying to find a polite way to say I find it a bit ostentatious.\u201d\n\nShaynna pretty much disregarded what he said and added that it would still look great on their sales brochure regardless.\n\nThen they went upstairs and all was forgotten after seeing the amazing style, design and layout of the rest of their house.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this very impressive chandelier soaring away up in the ceiling,\u201d Neale said, almost like his wine comments never happened.\n\n\u201cJesse and Mel have probably done the best out of everyone,\u201d Darren added.\n\nInto the compact laundry and media rooms, Darren loved their \u201csexy\u201d safe but said it belonged in a walk-in wardrobe rather than an office.\n\nNeale added that Jesse and Mel had done another brilliant job in showcasing what else the space can be used for.\n\nAnd because of their gushing reviews they came second with a score of 25.5.\n\nHOUSE 1: MITCH AND MARK (WINNERS)\n\nDespite the judges hating their hallway tiles, the Bondi boys still managed to come out on top with the highest score of 26, making it their second win in a row.\n\nUpon walking in their front door the judges noticed how clean and tidy everything was. Darren noticed the brass handrails on the stairs, describing it as beautiful and striking.\n\n\u201cThis house never fails to surprise me,\u201d Neale added.\n\nA comment that came in great timing when they crossed the blue and white stripped tiles in the hallway.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Courtyard reveal\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Living and dining reveal\n\n\u201cMy eye was immediately drawn upwards and thank goodness cause we can start on a positive note but ALARM,\u201d Darren yelled, as police sirens went off in the background.\n\nNeale just couldn\u2019t understand \u201cwhy they would do that\u201d, comparing it to a taped off police area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they have a done a herringbone floor here (next to the tiles) and then worked from their back, they get to a point where they can\u2019t join the herringbones up,\u201d Darren explained.\n\nNeale was still confused.\n\n\u201cBut why did they have to do the tiling quite like that,\u201d he asked as he slowly showed off the tiles in a sweeping motion with his hand.\n\nDarren said the area looked like an oil rig and it was a shame as everything else in their house looked like it belonged in a Hollywood mansion.\n\nThey did love their guest bedroom, which was originally a study.\n\nThe couple got bonus points for their styling, ample storage space and overall floor plan.\n\n\u201cThe fact we\u2019re standing in a bedroom that\u2019s done this well, that has such attention to style, the finesse, the colour palette and it still has energy in it,\u201d Darren said.\n\nNeale was so impressed he said if he was wearing a hat, he would tip it off to the boys. So posh of you, Neale.\n\nThey then went up to level three to see what it all looked like from the top and while hanging over the rail, they appeared to have really taken a liking.\n\n\u201cIs there another word for mind-blowing,\u201d Neale asked.\n\nAnd just like that the tile disaster was forgotten and the boys came first, topping the leaderboard.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Kitchen and butler\u2019s pantry reveal\n\nHOUSE 2: TESS AND LUKE\n\nEven though Tess and Luke came last after having really struggled to complete their rooms, they still managed to impress the judges.\n\nAll three judges were mesmerised by the massive sky light in their kitchen.\n\n\u201cOh my God how good is that,\u201d Shaynna yelled.\n\nNeale thought there house was \u201cbreathing again\u201d both visually and physically.\n\n\u201cThe transformative effects those sky lights have in terms of light and height is just incredible,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter grilling them over their dining table a few weeks ago for being attached to their kitchen bench, they were happy to see it has now been detached.\n\n\u201cWhat an improvement. This lounge room now feels generous,\u201d Darren said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s genius,\u201d Shaynna added, which was a given considering it was her idea to separate it.\n\n\u201cSo many I have come into their house and have gone \u2018oh god\u2019, but today..\u201d she then took a deep breathe and sighed in relief.\n\nHeading into their media room Neale said it was a \u201ctriumph\u201d. He was referring to the sky light.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool,\u201d Darren said saying the see-through glass feature on the floor connects to the downstairs lounge room.\n\n\u201cBut you have also got this acoustic barrier in between so you can get the kids up here watching a movie, but if you\u2019re down there you can keep an eye on the little monsters and make sure they\u2019re not tearing anything up.\u201d\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t overly styled the judges still liked what they saw \u2014 however they couldn\u2019t ignore the unfinished paint and skirtings.\n\nIt was no where near as finished as Mitch and Mark\u2019s but it was \u201cfar from a failure\u201d, Neale said.\n\nUp on level three the judges said things felt calmer in terms of execution in terms of finishings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rough around the edges, there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done but it\u2019s here, and they have achieved it and they have done it,\u201d Neale added.\n\nThey scored the lowest points with 20.5.\n\nHOUSE 3: ANDY AND DEB\n\nAndy and Deb had a lot to get through from completing three hallways, two toilets and a study and while they didn\u2019t complete it all, there was enough to impress the judges \u2026 just not enough.\n\nUpon walking into their front door the judges immediately noticed there was a lot of unfinished work.\n\n\u201cOh wow, so unfinished,\u201d Neale pointed out in the powder room, adding it wasn\u2019t something he was used to seeing when walking into Andy and Deb\u2019s rooms.\n\nBut their tune changed when walking up the stairs, taking a particular liking to their brick work and contemporary artwork.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Master ensuite reveal\n\n\u201cI love the brick work, I love the artwork, I love those basket weave pendant lights and that runner carpet gives such a sense of length to house,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLook downstairs I really was feeling Andy and Deb had been defeated by this week.\u201d\n\nBut standing from the top, he didn\u2019t feel like that at all, saying he \u201cbloody loves it\u201d.\n\nFor him, the home had a style of a global nomad.\n\n\u201cSomeone who has seen a lot of the world and looking forward to coming home to their oasis in St Kilda.\u201d\n\nNot a bad description, Neale.\n\nHeading into their home office, the positive feedback continued.\n\n\u201cWhat a lovely place to study or work or hide form the rest of your family,\u201d Darrens said, while adding how he loves the delicate slab of terrazzo that forms the bench top.\n\nAs Shaynna sat on their chairs, she admitted she has seen some \u201cugly desk chairs\u201d, but these \u201cwere one of the nicest with their brass base and subtle lilac colours\u201d.\n\nNeale said the house is a nod to busy Aussies.\n\n\u201cThis house acknowledges the amount of people that are now working from home and as you say (Darren), running businesses and empires from home.\u201d\n\nWhile the judges were generous with their comments despite slamming the obvious (unfinished rooms), they managed to come third with a score of 23.\n\nHOUSE 4: Matt and El\u2019ise\n\nBefore starting their feedback, the judges had a go at host Scott Cam for setting such an impossible task, with Shaynna going as far as calling him \u201csadist\u201d.\n\nBut that aside, they still had to judge Matt and El\u2019ise\u2019 rooms even though they barely finished.\n\nDrawing their attention to the staircase, Darren said he really like how the visible timber had a \u201clight structure\u201d to it, while Shaynna added \u201cit would look great when it\u2019s finished\u201d.\n\nPopping into the power room Neale was taken by the colour palette.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t mind it at all; it\u2019s very black but I actually quite like it and the tile choice of the metallic sheen.\u201d\n\nHeading upstairs, Shaynna couldn\u2019t help but comment on the laundry shoot saying how much she \u201cloved it\u201d.\n\nAnd next door to that they found a generous home office area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good functional space. There\u2019s room for three chairs there,\u201d Neale pointed out.\n\nShaynna said it\u2019s great Matt and El\u2019ise have been able to dress the space, taking particular notice to the \u201cbeautiful artwork\u201d.\n\nPlanning the space to include a sky light was a clever move too and one that was a must for Andy and Deb before deciding to flip their bathroom to a study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not big. it\u2019s not grand like Andy and Deb\u2019s but any bit of natural light is welcome,\u201d Darren said.\n\nBut Neale kept comparing it to next door\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue with this as a good functional space. I guess I have been spoiled by seeing that beautiful home office in Andy and Deb\u2019s house that I would rather it have that abundance of light,\u201d Neale added.\n\nHowever all three judges agreed the space they delivered is going to stack up well on sales brochures.\n\n\u201cUnfinished as this is and rough around the edges as it is, they still are good at creating a home,\u201d Neale said.\n\nThe couple ran out of time to execute all spaces at their usual high standard, but they\u2019re on track and on the way to an impressive finish, according tot he judges.\n\nThey came second last with a score of 21.\n\nSCOREBOARD:\n\nMitch and Mark: 26\n\nTess and Luke: 20.5\n\nAndy and Deb: 23\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise: 21\n\nJesse and Mel: 25.5\n\nThe Block airs tomorrow at 7pm on Channel 9", "description": "Have a spare 400 bottles of wine laying around?", "authors": ["Shireen Khalil"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e8b69653fc44b3a245869af2d061425d?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
