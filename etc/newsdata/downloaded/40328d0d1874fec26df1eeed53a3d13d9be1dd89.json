The craft's pokey size would help it avoid detection on the battlefield\n\nPlans suggest the craft would be capable of firing missiles at enemy targets, though exactly where they would launch from is unclear.\n\nIt can apparently reach speeds of up to 400mph and fly up to 20,000 feet high.\n\nSome experts in China reportedly expressed concerns that the craft would not be stable enough to fly. Similar experiments in the US have later been canned.\n\n\"Whether or not this particular helicopter can become practical, such explorations are beneficial to China's technology development for future helicopters,\" an anonymous military expert told the Global Times.\n\nChina, hell-bent on becoming the world's most powerful country, recently boosted annual military spending to a whopping \u00a3140billion.\n\nFor comparison, Britain spends $48 billion a year on its military, while the United States defense budget - the biggest in the world - sits at $696 billion.\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "An experimental attack helicopter that looks like a flying saucer has been unveiled in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/super-great-white-shark-helicopter-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
