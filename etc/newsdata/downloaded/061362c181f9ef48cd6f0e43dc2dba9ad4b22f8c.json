Now, his buddy Francis Ford Coppola is busting out some even saltier anti-Marvel rhetoric. As reported by Yahoo!

Or that Thor: Ragnarok is no The Godfather Part II. \u201cWhen Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right, because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration. I don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again,\u201d Coppola explained. \u201cMartin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u201d Mic drop, Matera style.", "description": "Francis Ford Coppola is agreeing with Martin Scorsese\u2019s criticisms about the Marvel cinematic universe, saying the films are \u201cdespicable.\u201d", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/06/20-francis.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
