Job openings still outnumber the unemployed by about 1 million in August, indicating that employers may need to raise wages to attract workers out of their current positions.\n\nThe data come from the Labor Department\u2019s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.\n\nUnemployment has fallen this year, recently hitting 3.5 percent. That has contributed to slowdown in payroll growth. Payrolls have grown by an average 161,000 jobs per month so far in 2019, a decline from the average of 223,000 in 2018.\n\nThe share of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs remains high, although it ticked down in August from 2.4 percent to 2.3 percent. Still, even with the tick down, a larger percentage of Americans are quitting their jobs than have at any time prior to this year than a one-month period in 2005. Prior to that, quits had not been so high since March of 2001.", "description": "Unemployment is at a 50 year lows so it is not surprising that a historic share of the workforce is voluntarily quitting their jobs. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-102322999-e1570640511613-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
