The much-anticipated plans fulfilled President Trump\u2019s request, made back in March through a presidential memorandum, directing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to create a blueprint for housing finance reform.\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s plan includes a series of 49 recommendations focused primarily on ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while still guaranteeing support for single- and multifamily lending and affordable housing initiatives.\n\nFannie Mae\n\nand Freddie Machave now been under conservatorship for 11 years after the wave of foreclosures that preceded the Great Recession put the two so-called government-sponsored enterprises in dire straits.\n\nRead more: As Fannie-Freddie reform gets underway, here are the three big questions for the housing market\n\nThe HUD plan, meanwhile, is concerned with refocusing the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s mission and ensuring that tools are in place to manage risk appropriately.\n\nThe recommendations made by both departments include a mix of proposals that would require Congress to take action and measures that could be taken in the meantime or in the event that legislators cannot pass a comprehensive housing-finance reform package. The Treasury department noted in its plan that it would prefer Congress to undertake comprehensive legislation.\n\n\u201cAlthough Treasury does not believe a Government guarantee is required, Treasury would support legislation that authorizes an explicit, paid-for guarantee backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government that is limited to the timely payment of principal and interest on qualifying mortgage-backed securities,\u201d the department said.\n\n\u201cLegislation could also achieve lasting structural reform that tailors that explicit Government support of the secondary market and repeals the GSEs\u2019 congressional charters and other statutory privileges that give them a competitive advantage over private sector competition.\u201d\n\nAlso see: Will Fannie and Freddie get a new sibling?\n\nBoth plans lacked specifics regarding some of the recommendations, though a more detailed vision of the Trump administration\u2019s view could come to light next Tuesday. That\u2019s when Mnuchin, HUD Secretary Ben Carson and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria are set to testify about the reform plan before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nMany analysts, meanwhile, aren\u2019t holding their breaths for the Trump administration\u2019s plan to come fully to fruition anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThe release of this plan is certainly a positive catalyst for the process moving along, but we remain confident that there will be many more twists and turns before any recapitalization and release is fully, if ever, executed,\u201d Beacon Policy Advisors said in a note this morning. \u201cChange may be coming, but as we saw with this upcoming blueprint, it will likely be far more drawn out and less specific than investors may hope.\u201d\n\nBeacon Policy Advisors further noted that Calabria has insisted that any reforms should take place over the span of five years, which extends well beyond the 2020 presidential election at this rate.", "description": "Priorities include recapitalizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and ending their conservatorship.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB564_fannie_ZG_20190108124811.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
