He was re-elected three months later.\n\nViolence related to the crisis has left at least 1,200 people dead and displaced more than 400,000 between April 2015 and May 2017, according to estimates by the International Criminal Court, which opened an investigation.", "description": "The United Nations envoy to Burundi announced on Wednesday that he planned to step down from the post he has held for two years, amid concerns over the impartiality of elections set for 2020.  \"Poorly organized and contested elections are always a source of conflict,\" he warned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IheK0tFFSp03cm.Ve5MBvA--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/7ebfdcfc93189d85cf9ac6ba4228dc0ffcf4f4d5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
