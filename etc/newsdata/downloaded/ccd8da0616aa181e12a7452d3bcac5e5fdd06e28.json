The tiger called Sahebrao will be fitted with a artificial paw in around four weeks, in the first operation of its kind.\n\nSahebrao was rescued from a poacher\u2019s trap in Gondmohadi village in Chandrapur district in 2012. His wound later developed gangrene, and a part of his injured front left leg had to be amputated. Since then, he has been living in captivity at the Wildlife Rescue Centre in Nagpur\u2019s Gorewada Zoo.\n\nProf Giannoudis, an expert in fractures and bone regeneration, told the Telegraph he was advising the team and intended to be at the final operation, but said he would not comment until it was complete.\n\nThe tiger was adopted by Sushrut Babhulkar, a Nagpur-based orthopaedic surgeon, in 2016, who has since then been investigating the possibility of an artificial limb. He contacted experts abroad and teamed up with the University of Leeds.\n\n\u201cNow we will be able to fix the prosthetic limb within 3-4 weeks\u2026 the limb will be manufactured in Nagpur. We have taken all the necessary measurements,\u201d he told The Indian Express, a Delhi-based daily newspaper.", "description": "A tiger maimed by a poacher's trap is to be given a prosthetic paw, in a world first operation aided by a UK surgeon.", "authors": ["Ben Farmer", "Con Coughlin", "Benedict Spence", "Charlotte Gill"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000001469579-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqC_LLCXkS_z-CZqgOMP7Be9WPY3Z_26YLrAU_gL4_dbY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
