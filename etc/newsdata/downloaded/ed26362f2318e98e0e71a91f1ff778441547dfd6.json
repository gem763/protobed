Both of their missions took place in the 1980s.\n\nThe trip is being hailed as a positive sign for the UAE's growing space sector. Other plans include an unmanned mission to Mars, with hopes of reaching the red planet in 2021 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state.\n\n\"This mission is a great milestone for me personally and for the United Arab Emirates,\" Hazzaa said at a news conference in July.\n\nWho is Hazzaa Al Mansoori?\n\nHazzaa said his fascination with space began as a child in Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE.\n\n\"I started to look at the stars since childhood,\" he recalled, adding that getting that bit closer to them had not seemed possible.\n\nHe has also long been inspired by the ambitions of UAE Founding Father Sheikh Zayed, who famously met US astronauts in Abu Dhabi in the 1970s.\n\nBut with no Emirati space programme at that time, he settled for taking to the skies as a pilot. After studying aviation at university, Hazzaa joined the armed forces and worked as a military pilot, flying F-16 fighter jets.\n\nIt was not until years later that he realised his dreams of space travel could become a reality.\n\nHow did he become an astronaut?\n\nIn December 2017, the ruler of Dubai and prime minister of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, issued a public call on Twitter for young Emiratis to register for the UAE Astronaut Programme.\n\nMore than 4,000 people applied to be in with a chance of becoming the first Emirati astronaut.\n\nHazzaa and fellow applicant, Sultan Al Neyadi, were selected as the final two after a series of interviews and medical and psychological tests.\n\nYou might like to watch\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the SpaceX Dragon Capsule that docked on the ISS\n\nSheikh Mohammed described the pair as representing the \"pinnacle of the UAE's ambitions\".\n\nHistory professor J\u00f6rg Matthias Determann, author of Space Science and the Arab World, said the founding of the UAE at the height of the US Apollo space programme had inspired Emirati leaders.\n\n\"The United Arab Emirates is a young country. It was founded in 1971 - at the height of the Cold War space race and at the height of that lunar accomplishment in particular of the United States.\n\n\"This was the high time of US success in particular. The United States itself was trying to make the most of this great achievement by following up with a great publicity campaign.\"\n\n\"The Apollo achievements, they really coincided with the founding moments of the United Arab Emirates.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption The Apollo mission to the Moon inspired the UAE's space programme\n\nDubai's Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre announced in April that Hazzaa had been chosen as the \"prime astronaut\" to make the inaugural journey, and Sultan as the \"backup\".\n\nHazzaa will travel to the ISS with US astronaut Jessica Meir and Russian astronaut Oleg Skripochka for his eight-day mission.\n\nWhile aboard the ISS, he will carry out scientific experiments and present a tour of the station in Arabic for viewers back on Earth.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to coming back with knowledge and experience and to sharing it with everyone,\" Hazzaa said.\n\n\"By living in the International Space Station... it will give us more knowledge and more understanding of how we can go beyond this. To go to the Moon and to Mars eventually.\"\n\nWhat will he take into space?\n\nHazzaa said he would take a family photo to the ISS and a UAE flag.\n\nHe will also carry a photograph of the meeting between Sheikh Zayed and the Apollo astronauts. \"This is one of the pictures that inspired me and today I am living this dream,\" he said.\n\nThe former pilot is also reported to be taking seeds and a copy of Sheikh Mohammed's book, My Story.\n\nEmirati food has been prepared for his trip, including balaleet - a UAE speciality of sweetened vermicelli served with an omelette - that he plans to share with the other astronauts.\n\nHazzaa said the mission was a \"huge responsibility\" but that by taking the UAE's first trip to space he hoped to inspire the next generation of explorers.", "description": "What's it like to be the first astronaut of your country?", "authors": ["Alice Cuddy", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BB64/production/_108827974_16ef86cd-4a87-4a37-9c88-6e62c9bb346f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
