Money was tight, so I lived mostly on empanadas: cheap, filling, delicious and somewhere in the territory of a punchy, chilli-spiked pasty.\n\nIn Argentina, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll come across an empanaderia \u2013 a bakery with glass cabinets full of empanadas. It\u2019s been years since I walked through the doors of such a place, but at this time of year, I find myself craving flaky pastry, chilli and things eaten in hands, all of which adds up to empanadas. I dip them in chimichurri, an Argentinian-style salsa verde.\n\nSquash and green chilli empanadas (pictured above)\n\nThese are filled with squash, cheddar (not traditional, but I like the kick), herbs and quick-pickled red onions.\n\nPrep 45 min\n\nChill 1 hr\n\nCook 55 min\n\nMakes 10\n\n1kg squash, peeled and cut into 1cm cubes\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\nA few sprigs oregano\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n1 red onion, peeled and very finely sliced\n\nZest and juice of \u00bd lemon\n\n1 green chilli, finely chopped\n\n100g cheddar, crumbled into chunks\n\n\u00bd bunch parsley, chopped\n\n1 tsp paprika\n\nFor the dough\n\n500g plain flour\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n160g unsalted butter, cold, cubed\n\n80ml olive oil\n\n50-100ml cold water\n\n1 egg, beaten with a dash of milk or water\n\nHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/gas 7. Scatter the squash on a roasting tray with the olive oil, half the oregano, salt and pepper, and roast for 25-30 minutes, until soft and slightly caramelised. Set aside to cool. Turn down the oven to 210C (190C fan)/gas 6\u00bd.\n\nTo make the dough, put the flour, salt and butter in a food processor and blitz until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the olive oil and blitz until the mixture has the texture of sand, then add the water, a little at a time, until it comes together into a dough. Tip out on to a clean work surface, shape into a disc, cover with a tea towel and chill in the fridge for an hour.\n\nPut the onion, lemon zest and juice in a bowl, then scrunch it all together with your hands until the onion starts to turn pink. Add the chilli, 70g of the crumbled cheddar, parsley, paprika, leaves from the remaining oregano, and season. Add the squash and mix until combined.\n\nLine a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Roll out the dough to 3mm thick on a lightly floured surface. Use a 12cm cutter to cut out 10 discs, then place a heaped tablespoon of the filling in the centre of each. Brush one side of the pastry with egg wash, then fold the other side over. Press down the edges with a fork, to stick them together neatly.\n\nLay the empanadas on the tray, brush the tops with egg wash, grate over the remaining cheddar, add a little more salt and pepper, then place in the oven for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Leave to cool for a few minutes before serving with a dollop of chimichurri.\n\nChimichurri\n\nAs well as being the perfect accompaniment for empanadas, chimichurri is also great as a dressing for roast veg or as a topping for a bowl of polenta.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nMakes 1 small bowlful\n\n1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped\n\nA few sprigs oregano, leaves picked and finely chopped\n\n1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped\n\n1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced or finely chopped\n\n3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil\n\n1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n\n1 tsp salt\n\nIn a small bowl, mix all the ingredients to form a silky, herby sauce. Taste, adjust the seasoning if needed, and serve. This can be kept in a jar in the fridge for up to one week.", "description": "Argentina\u2019s equivalent of Cornish pasties \u2013 punchy, chilli-spiked and best eaten with your hands on a cold day", "authors": ["Anna Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c562aae58445123fa02a0e3d95d2fbc4256baec/0_626_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2609513b1f1ea21cfb84080a5101ed96", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
