And workers in multiple spots around the city were tearing down large outdoor promotional advertisements for Thursday\u2019s Lakers-Nets game.\n\nThe teams are also supposed to play Saturday in Shenzhen.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday in Tokyo that he supports Morey\u2019s right to free speech. Several Chinese companies have suspended their partnership with the NBA in recent days, and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it will not broadcast the Lakers-Nets games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d\n\nSilver was arriving in Shanghai on Wednesday. All around China, stores that sell NBA merchandise were removing Rockets-related apparel from shelves and many murals featuring the Rockets - even ones with Yao Ming, the Chinese great who played for Houston during his NBA career - were being painted over.\n\nSan Antonio coach Gregg Popovich spoke out Tuesday in Miami in support of how Silver is handling the situation.\n\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t easy for him to say,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. So I\u2019m thrilled with what he said.\u201d\n\nOther NBA coaches have not been so willing to discuss the situation. Philadelphia\u2019s Brett Brown said he did not wish to get into specifics of the China-NBA rift, though said he has been to that country many times and is always blown away by how popular the game is there.\n\n\u201cJust massive amounts of basketball courts and you\u2019re looking out and there\u2019s no available court,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s just people playing on a court. I took a (lower-level) Australian team to China and the story comes there was 400 million viewers watching not the true national team. You\u2019re just reminded of the popularity of the sport.\u201d\n\n___\n\nReynolds reported from Miami.
