However, this might not be possible considering year 12 students across the country are just days away from their final high school exams.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years now since I sat my own year 12 exams, but I remember being shit-scared enough as it was, let alone without a storm a\u2019brewin\u2019 in my guts.\n\nThe first exams of the year kick off on Monday, with main subjects like English, maths and psychology first off the rank. The VCE exam season will run until November 20, when students can focus on the more important things in life\u2026 like stressing non-stop about their standardised test results until they get released.\n\nFootscray City College principal Angelique den Brinker has reached out to students to offer support during this difficult time, but says no students have requested special consideration for their exams.\n\n\u201cThe school has been in contact with students and staff to provide them with support if needed,\u201d she said, according to Townsville Bulletin. \u201cWe are continuing to support students as they prepare for their Year 12 exams.\u201d\n\nAll shitty jokes aside, Year 12 is a wildly stressful year where you\u2019re basically convinced that these few weeks of exams will make or break your entire future. Coming down with an unfortunate illness like this just days before your exams would be truly heartbreaking, especially for those students that have worked their butts off all year long.\n\nFor the sake of the poor students in question, here\u2019s hoping the shitty situation is cleared up nice and quickly so they can focus on their exams and end their high school journey on a good note.", "description": "Year 12 students from Melbourne's Footscray City College have been hit with a gastro outbreak at their graduation dinner, just days before exams.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1084691498-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
