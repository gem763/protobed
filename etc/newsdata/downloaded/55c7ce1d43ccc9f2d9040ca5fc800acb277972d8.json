He had run third in the opening laps behind the Ferraris but was the first to stop and lock himself in a two-stop strategy.\n\nVerstappen recovered to finish sixth ahead of Racing Point's Sergio Perez and Renault's Daniel Ricciardo on a terrible day for McLaren.\n\nCarlos Sainz and Lando Norris had started seventh and eighth, but Norris retired after a bungled pit stop in which he was sent away without his left front wheel attached, while Sainz faded to 13th, lacking pace.\n\n\"Sooooooo, you like motorsports.....?\" Mexico's Sergio Perez gets reacquainted with the locals\n\nDriver of the day\n\nHad Vettel's strategy gamble on staying out when Hamilton pitted paid off, it would have been him. But Hamilton gets it for a superbly controlled drive to victory. Honourable mention for Sergio Perez, taking an excellent seventh and best of the rest at home.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. One of Hamilton's favourite races, on a great track near a great city. Hamilton will surely clinch the title there - and he will be determined to do it in style, on a track where he has won five times in the last seven years.\n\nWhat they said\n\nHamilton: \"We came here thinking we were on the back foot but we pulled through, I had quite a bit of damage on the car so the race was quite a struggle but I kept my head down. It felt like a long second stint but I am so grateful today.\n\n\"I don't mind (not clinching the title yet). I love racing and just take it one race at a time. This is a race I have wanted to win for some time and it has always been a bit tricky for us. everything held together and the team did the best strategy, holding off the Ferraris was not easy in the end.\"\n\nVettel: \"Surprisingly, the hard tyres worked really well. It was an intense race because there was no break.\n\n\"It was a good race but here and there with strategy we could have been a bit stronger.\"\n\nBottas: \"I enjoyed, considering yesterday. The start was quite tricky - I dropped a place. But I don't think we could have done much more today.\"\n\nBottas made a mess of his car during qualifying, which led to the controversy of Verstappen being stripped of his pole position\n\nEarly bird: Mexicans will celebrate the Day Of The Dead next week\n\n\"I'd just jump over them...\" Thirty years ago Ayrton Senna won in Mexico. Five-time F1 champion Juan Manuel Fangio didn't seem overly impressed\n\nHead gear: Pre-race dancer is the only job you need bigger neck muscles than an F1 driver", "description": "Lewis Hamilton wins the Mexican Grand Prix to move to the brink of the Formula 1 world championship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/FB60/production/_109425346_hamhat2_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
