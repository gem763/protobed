But only four of the 172 were African-Americans, leading Winslow\u2019s attorneys to raise the issue of their client\u2019s ability to get a fair trial.\n\nWinslow, a former NFL star, is African-American. He is about to stand trial on charges of raping or sodomizing three different women who are white or Asian.\n\n\u201cThere should be more African-Americans,\u201d one of Winslow\u2019s attorneys, Gretchen von Helms, told the judge last week.\n\nOf the first 86 prospective jurors summoned to court last week, only one was African-American.\n\n\u201cTo have only one African-American is appalling,\u201d von Helms said to the judge. \u201cIt is not representative.\u201d\n\nHIGH STAKES, TOUGH QUESTIONS: In Kellen Winslow II's second rape trial\n\nMORE WINSLOW: How Kellen Winslow II went from NFL star to accused serial rapist\n\nKellen Winslow II appears in court in Vista, Calif., on the first day of his rape trial. (Photo: John Gibbins, AP)\n\nThis is the second trial on rape charges for Winslow, 36. In the first, a jury of eight men and four women \u2013 none African-American \u2013 convicted him in June of raping a white homeless woman, exposing himself to a Vietnamese neighbor down the street and lewd conduct with another Asian woman at a local gym, all ages 57 or older. Those convictions still stand and could put him behind bars for nine years. But that jury couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict on most of the other charges as required, setting up a retrial with a new 12-person jury being selected here this week.\n\nThis is the same court in north San Diego County where Winslow stood trial the first time. It draws its jury pool from near where the alleged crimes occurred. It also is near where Winslow had a $3 million home in Encinitas, an upscale seaside community where African-Americans make up less than 1% of the population, according to government data. Other parts of north San Diego County also are heavily white, with few communities having populations where African-Americans make up more than 5%.\n\n\u201cThere really aren\u2019t that many African-Americans in those parts of town,\u201d said M. Dod Ghassemkhani, a criminal defense attorney not involved in this case.\n\nAcross the nation, the underrepresentation of African-Americans on juries still remains an issue with complex causes and no easy solutions. In this case, Winslow is facing life in prison if convicted of more forcible sex crimes. On Monday, von Helms also noted this was a case in which white women had accused a black man of rape and that there was a stream of \u201cwhite juror after white juror\u201d coming through the jury screening process.\n\nAt one point, one prospective African-American juror also became a subject of conflict between Winslow\u2019s attorneys and prosecutor Dan Owens. The woman told the judge Monday she once lived down the street from Winslow\u2019s family in the early 1980s and indicated she might view the Winslows favorably in deliberations over his guilt.\n\nBecause of this, Owens wanted her excused from the case on the grounds that it indicated she might not be fair and impartial. But Winslow\u2019s attorneys wanted to keep her.\n\n\u201cI should mention to the court: We have an issue here in that we have (approximately) 180 jurors ... and we\u2019ve got four black people,\u201d Marc Carlos, an attorney for Winslow, told Judge Blaine Bowman.\n\nVon Helms then noted to Bowman the \u201cproblem with striking an African-American\u201d from the jury pool.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t change the standard based on the color of their skin, OK,\u201d Bowman told her. \u201cThe same rules apply.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a judge, you have to be careful that it is not, that striking (a juror) for cause is not a proxy for race,\u201d von Helms said.\n\nVon Helms noted racial segregation by neighborhoods in San Diego County and said, \u201cYou are not going get other white people living down the street from a black family in the \u201880s.\u201d\n\nThis prospective juror said she once lived down the street from the Winslow family in the city of Lemon Grove, which is east of downtown San Diego and not part of the North County jury pool. In 2016, Lemon Grove had around 14% African-Americans, according to estimates.\n\nBowman decided to reserve judgment on whether the woman should be excused at Owens\u2019 request. Meanwhile, both sides in the case soon hope to seat a jury of 12, plus alternates, with opening statements in the trial likely later this week or next.\n\nDepending on further developments in jury selection, Winslow\u2019s attorneys could invoke Winslow\u2019s right to a jury that represents a fair cross-section of the community. That could mean asking for a whole new jury pool and raising an objection if only to set up a possible appeal.\n\nBoth sides last week tried to keep another African-American prospective juror from being excused from the case because of financial hardship. The man indicated last week his employer only covers five days of pay to cover absences because of jury duty. But he had already used two of them, and the trial is expected to last several weeks.\n\n\u201cWould you be able to survive financially without pay for such a long period of time?\u201d Bowman asked the man.\n\nThe man replied could use his vacation time to serve on the jury if necessary. Bowman then told him he didn\u2019t meet the financial-hardship requirements to be excused from the case.\n\nFollow Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.
