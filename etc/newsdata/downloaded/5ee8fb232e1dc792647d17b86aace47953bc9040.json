[The judges] are the best judges in the world, they do know what they're talking about, if they'd sent me home that would have been the best decision, I can't get involved in any of that.\n\n\"I just have to concentrate on improving, and if Katya is happy with what I'm doing then I'm happy.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nCatherine and her partner Johannes Radebe were eliminated after Shirley Ballas was given the deciding vote and opted to save Mike and Katya.\n\nViewers even called for Shirley to be sacked over the controversial decision.\n\nCorrie star Catherine immediately burst into tears and struggled to get her words out as she said goodbye to presenter Tess Daly.", "description": "The BBC Breakfast presenter, 53, was in the dance off with Catherine Tydlesley and her partner Johannes Radebe", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_19163433-high_res-strictly-come-dancing-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
