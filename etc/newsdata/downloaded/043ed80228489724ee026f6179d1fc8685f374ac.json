It contrasts dismissive and disparaging comments about Bernie from TV pundits with the warmth felt towards him by his supporters across the country. It movingly shows how Sanders inspires people and gives them hope \u2013 but also just how insulated the \u201cpundit class\u201d is from the reality of people\u2019s lives.\n\nIn the video, commentators from CNN and MSNBC talk about Sanders as a man \u201cyelling at people in the same screechy voice, without smiling, without any kind of personal connection\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually smile that much\u201d. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, thousands of people feel a strong connection to Bernie, because he\u2019s talking about the issues that matter to them: healthcare, student debt, climate change, working conditions. And he smiles quite a bit.\n\nThe media not only treat Sanders as a humorless fringe demagogue, but they also understate his popularity. Katie Halper has documented the various ways in which media organizations have subtly fudged the numbers to make Bernie seem less successful than he is, and there is still a narrative that his campaign is failing even as it hauls in giant quantities of small donations from all over the country. Even as he shatters fundraising records there will be stories of him \u201cstruggling to attract new supporters, and even keep some of the old ones\u201d.\n\nIn part, the media underestimates Bernie because it can\u2019t understand Bernie. The new ad quotes CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson saying it\u2019s \u201creally hard to imagine who the Bernie Sanders voter is at this point\u201d. And it\u2019s true: if you are, like Henderson, a Yale graduate living in Washington DC, or you are, like the New York Times\u2019 Sydney Ember, a former financial analyst for an investment bank, the source of Bernie\u2019s appeal must be mystifying. That\u2019s because Sanders returns again and again to issues that are of little interest to the political media, like environmental policy, social welfare, and education.\n\nConsider MSNBC. Combing through their home page a few days ago, I found that nearly every story was about Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. The one headline about climate change, an issue so important that it should be dominating every day\u2019s deadlines, was \u201cWatch London climate change protest involving 1,800 liters of fake blood go horribly wrong,\u201d hardly a substantive discussion of science or policy.\n\nIn a recent New York Times profile, Rachel Maddow was quite open about her show being dominated by stories about Russia and Trump: \u201cI\u2019m happy to admit that I\u2019m obsessed with Russia. I realize it\u2019s controversial, and people give me a lot of grief for focusing on it. But I make no apologies.\u201d\n\nMaddow even says that she has borrowed broadcasting techniques from Roger Ailes, the alleged sexual predator who turned Fox News into a brain-numbing hate factory. This is the kind of television MSNBC aspires to: a leftwing version of Fox News, meaning a lot of drama and excitement but very little relevance to the real issues affecting people\u2019s lives.\n\nIf you see MSNBC as \u201cthe left\u201d and Fox as \u201cthe right\u201d, then Bernie Sanders must be some strange aberration that doesn\u2019t make sense. In fact, he\u2019s just a person with a well-refined sense of what matters and what doesn\u2019t. Sanders has been accused of mirroring Donald Trump in his scathing attacks on the media. But while Trump\u2019s objection to the media is that they spend too much time exposing his crimes and lies, Sanders\u2019 objection is that they don\u2019t elevate the voices of ordinary people and they don\u2019t inform the public about the most important issues.\n\nAs he writes in his book Our Revolution:\n\nFor years, major crises like climate change, the impact of trade agreements on our economy, the role of big money in politics, and youth unemployment have received scant media coverage. Trade union leaders, environmentalists, low-income activists, people prepared to challenge the corporate ideology, rarely appear on our TV screens \u2026 [A]s a general rule of thumb, the more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media.\n\nIt is very hard for any honest person to deny that this is true. Maddow essentially admits it. What she cares about is the story about Trump and Russia. Climate scientists? Union leaders? They\u2019re probably ratings poison. The impeachment story is the kind of scandal that makes for great television.", "description": "Sanders returns again and again to issues that matter to ordinary people: healthcare, student debt and climate change \u2013 issues which are not a priority for the mainstream mediaAn unofficial ad made by a fan contrasts what pundits say about him with the warms felt towards him by his supporters.
