The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nWith that, here are five burning questions as the UFC heads to the Sunshine State:\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with Joanna Jedrzejczyk?\n\nFight week in Tampa took quite an eventful turn when reports surfaced that former strawweight champion Jedzejczyk (15-3 MMA, 9-3 UFC) \u2014 who has never missed weight over the course of her career, but has also had some unhealthy-looking weigh-ins along the way \u2014 wasn\u2019t going to be able to make 116 pounds.\n\nWhen Waterson\u2019s camp refused to accommodate her opponent on a catchweight, JJ decided she could make weight after all, and then got snippy with reporters who at Wednesday\u2019s media day when they tried to ask what happened.\n\nSo, what was going on, here? Was this all simply a big miscommunication? Was it a whole lot of noise about nothing? Or, is a fighter who not all that long ago was an undefeated and seemingly untouchable champion now getting a little desperate, having lost three out of her past four fights? And if so, was this a failed attempted a gaming the system, as Jedrezjczyk, who fought for the flyweight belt last time out, takes on one of the smaller strawweights in former Invicta atomweight champ Waterson?\n\nSaturday should give us an indication as to which is which.", "description": "MMA Junkie's Dave Doyle runs down the top storylines heading into UFC Tampa, which features Joanna Jedrjezczyk vs. Michelle Waterson.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Christian Stein", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joanna-jedrzejczyk-michelle-waterson-ufc-on-espn-plus-19-weigh-ins1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
