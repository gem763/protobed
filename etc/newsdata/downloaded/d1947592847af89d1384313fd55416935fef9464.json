The package will sell for $699.99 unlocked, with preorders starting this Friday, October 25th. LG expects the bundle to go for around $300 when discounted through carrier agreements.\n\nThe G8X ThinQ is a unique take on a dual-screen phone. Instead of using a foldable screen, like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold, or attaching an entire second screen with a hinge, like Microsoft\u2019s upcoming Surface Duo, LG just made a normal phone with one screen. The second screen is based entirely within a case that the G8X slips into. Once it\u2019s in, you can turn the second screen on and off or remove the phone later and just use the device as normal.\n\nA far more affordable dual-screen option\n\nThe final result is not quite as impressive as something like the Galaxy Fold, but it\u2019s a lot more likely to work without issue. The $700 price also makes this quite likely the cheapest way \u2014 by a large margin \u2014 to get a dual-screen phone in 2019. (LG previously tried the dual-screen accessory with the V50.)\n\nThe phone has the specs you\u2019d want from a high-end Android phone, too. It includes a Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 6.4-inch OLED display, a 4,000mAh battery, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and a secondary wide-angle rear camera.\n\nLG\u2019s smartphone sales have been slipping lately. In the US, its shipments have made up low double digits of the market in recent quarters, according to Counterpoint Research. The G8X very much seems designed to boost sales over the holidays. With a feature that no one else is offering near this price, LG might have better luck getting its phone to stand out on retail shelves over the next few months.", "description": "LG\u2019s G8X ThinQ will go on sale in the US on November 1st, and it\u2019ll come bundled with the device\u2019s biggest draw: a case that includes a flip-out second screen.
