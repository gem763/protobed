That is, you might think that if you haven\u2019t been paying any attention to the right-wing mind-set.\n\n[For an even deeper look at what\u2019s on Paul Krugman\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\n\nWhat is happening instead, of course, is that the usual suspects are trying to portray California as a terrible place \u2014 beset by violent crime and rampant disease \u2014 in sheer denial of reality. And they have seized on the issue of homelessness, which is, to be fair, a genuine problem. Furthermore, it\u2019s a problem brought on by bad policy \u2014 not high taxes or excessively generous social programs, but the runaway NIMBYism that has prevented California from building remotely enough new housing to accommodate its rising population.\n\nThe striking thing about the right\u2019s new focus on homelessness, however, is that it\u2019s hard to detect any concern about the plight of the homeless themselves. Instead, it\u2019s all about the discomfort and alleged threat the homeless create for the affluent.\n\nWhich brings me to Trump\u2019s war on California.\n\nThe attempt to kill the state\u2019s emissions rules makes a kind of twisted sense given Trump\u2019s policy priorities. His administration is clearly dedicated to the cause of making America polluted again, and in particular to ensuring that the planet cooks as quickly as possible. California is such a big player that it can effectively block part of that agenda, as shown by the willingness of automakers to abide by its emissions rules. Hence the attempt to strip away that power, never mind past rhetoric about states\u2019 rights.\n\nDeclaring the homeless an environmental threat, however, aside from being almost surreal coming from an administration that in general loves pollution, is pure nonsense. It can be understood only as an attempt both to punish an anti-Trump state and to blacken its reputation.\n\nWhat should you take away from Trump\u2019s war on California?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s yet another illustration of the intellectual imperviousness of the modern right, which never, ever lets awkward facts disturb its preconceptions.\n\nMore ominously, the apparent weaponization of the Environmental Protection Agency is more evidence that Trump \u2014 whose party fundamentally doesn\u2019t believe in democracy \u2014 is following the modern authoritarian playbook, in which every institution is corrupted, every function of government is perverted into a tool for rewarding friends and punishing enemies.\n\nIt\u2019s an ugly story, and it\u2019s scary, too.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
