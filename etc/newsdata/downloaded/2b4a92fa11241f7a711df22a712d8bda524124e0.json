They pulled a gun on me. They accused my son of wrongdoing.\"\n\nLane said her son was wearing the same white T-shirt as the suspect and police were making sure they had the right man. She had to walk the officer through her house, with a gun at her back, to prove the suspect wasn't hiding inside.\n\nThe Dabbs Street neighborhood is a lot quieter these days, after Hattiesburg Police officials began \"Operation Quality of Life\" there. Police Chief Anthony Parker announced the initiative at a community meeting in October, following a murder and triple shooting in the neighborhood.\n\nThe program frees two patrol officers from each shift, around the clock, to roam areas in the city to reduce crime.\n\nStory continues after photo gallery.\n\n\"Since the operation was put into place, we haven't had any violent offenses or aggravated assaults in the Dabbs Street, East Sixth and Mobile streets and Vickers Circle areas,\" said Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker. \"The officers in those areas have made multiple drugs and weapons arrests without violent incident.\"\n\nAs part of \"Operation Quality of Life,\" officers are visible on foot, bicycles and in patrol cars, so community members can interact with them and share information.\n\n\"Residents are no longer afraid to approach our officers and speak up,\" Barker said. \"This sort of strategy doesn't just work in areas where we have problems \u2014 this is something that can work in all neighborhoods.\n\n\"That's why we continue to try to increase our (police) manpower.\"\n\nParker says police presence is increased in certain locations during busy periods.\n\n\"It is an ongoing operation for us,\" he said. \"We constantly keep those units in areas where we tend to see problems, but we don't limit them to any one area.\n\n\"We move them around, whether it be for increased shoppers during holiday times or anywhere we may see an increase in people.\"\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL NEWS: Please subscribe to HattiesburgAmerican.com today\n\nParker said the police have received support from the community in every area they visit.\n\n\"The citizens love us being there and will constantly interact with our officers or give them tips or ask for assistance if needed \u2014 which goes to the basics of community policing,\" he said.\n\nCouncilwoman Deborah Delgado, whose ward includes the Dabbs Street neighborhood, said closure of an unlicensed business in the area also helped reduce crime.\n\n\"It had presented a lot of challenges over the years,\" she said. \"I think the closure of that, along with the community policing, has contributed to (reduced crime in that neighborhood).\"\n\nDelgado said she's also seen evidence that residents are more willing to come forward with tips and crime reports since the October community meeting.\n\n\"I think they got together and talking to them about that raised their consciousness to object to that kind of behavior,\" she said.\n\nFor Lane, the new atmosphere is welcome. She had been contemplating selling her home, due to the frequent gunfire, before the community policing effort started.\n\n\"It's just so peaceful now,\" she said. \"They patrol, and you can see (the police) riding out all the time.\n\n\"I'm glad to see them drive by.\"\n\nContact Ellen Ciurczak at eciurczak@gannett.com.
