This isn\u2019t something from a decade ago where he\u2019s commenting on Indians owning 7-11s and Dunkin Donuts shops in Delaware\n\nor asking crippled guys to arise and walk\n\nThis is from 2017 and the scene is him at the dedication of the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center in Wilmington, DE.\n\nThis is BIZARRE!\n\nHere's Joe Biden telling the story of his face-off with a gang of razor-wielding ne'er-do-wells led by a guy named 'Corn Pop.' pic.twitter.com/DddRtWgdza \u2014 Eddie Zipperer (@EddieZipperer) September 15, 2019\n\nYou owe it to yourself to watch this but this is the Cliff\u2019s Notes.\n\nIn 1962, Biden was a lifeguard at the pool. In his story, he was the only white lifeguard in a pool with all black staff and a mostly black clientele. The villain is a local tough\u2026put the coffee or other drink down NOW\u2026called \u201cCorn Pop\u201d who leads an all black gang called, naturally, \u201cthe Romans.\u201d According to Biden, Corn Pop would insult Biden\u2019s mom so while Biden was crying or whatever gang members could sneak into the pool. The matter came to a head over Corn Pop using the 3-meter dive board.\n\n\u201cThis was the diving board area, and I was one of the guards, and they weren\u2019t allowed to \u2014 it was a 3-meter board. And if you fell off sideways, you landed on the damn, er, darn cement over there,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd Corn Pop was a bad dude. And he ran a bunch of bad boys. And back in those days \u2014 to show how things have changed \u2014 one of the things you had to use, if you used Pomade in your hair, you had to wear a bathing cap. And so he was up on the board and wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I said, \u2018Hey, Esther, you! Off the board, or I\u2019ll come up and drag you off.\u2019 Well, he came off, and he said, \u2018I\u2019ll meet you outside.'\u201d Biden\u2019s comments were a reference to competitive swimmer-turned actress Esther Williams, who died in 2013. \u201cMy car was mostly, these were all public housing behind us,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cMy car \u2013 there was a gate on here. I parked my car outside the gate. And he said, \u2018I\u2019ll be waiting for you. He was waiting for me with three guys with straight razors. Not a joke. There was a guy named Bill Wright the only white guy and he did all the pools. He was a mechanic. And I said, \u2018What am I gonna do?\u2019 And he said. \u2018Come down here in the basement, where all the mechanics- \u2013 where all the pool builder is.\u2019 You know the chain, there used to be a chain that went across the deep end. And he cut off a six-foot length of chain, and folded it up and he said, \u2018You walk out with that chain, and you walk to the car and say, \u2018you may cut me man, but I\u2019m gonna wrap this chain around your head.'\u201d Biden continued: \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re kidding me.'\u201d He said, \u2018No if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t come back.\u2019 And he was right. So I walked out with the chain. And I walked up to my car. And in those days, you remember the straight razors, you had to bang \u2019em on the curb, gettin\u2019 em rusty, puttin\u2019 em in the rain barrel, gettin\u2019 em rusty? And I looked at him, but I was smart, then. I said, \u2018First of all,\u2019 I said, \u2018when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I\u2019ll kick you out again, but I shouldn\u2019t have called you Esther Williams, and I apologize for that. I apologize.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t know that apology was gonna work.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018you apologize to me?'\u201d Biden went on. \u201cI said, \u2018I apologize but not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said.\u2019 He said, \u2018OK,\u2019 closed that straight razor, and my heart began to beat again.\u201d\n\nI have to admit, given Biden\u2019s reputation for making things up, I was, even as an unambiguously white guy, pretty much in the same place as The Root writer, Michael Harriott\n\nNow it has already been demonstrably proven that Biden will make stuff up. But any black person who hears this story will automatically give you the side-eye and says: \"nigga please.\" It begins when Biden was working as a lifeguard at a pool. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nSo, that summer, Biden was the only white lifeguard at Prices Run swimming pool in Brown-Burton Winchester Park. He says he did it\u2014y'all, I SWEAR this is true\u2014\"in hopes of learning more about the black community.\" Yes, that's an actual quote. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nAnyway, during Biden's Negro Summer Safari Adventure, one day, all of the town gangsters came to the pool. Now I know what you're thinking, but don't stereotype. Gangbangers are NOT a monolith. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nNow if you're black, I know this shit sounds like some white kid tried to make a gang fairy tale for a sixth-grade play because you and I know there ain't no squad led by a nigga named Corn Pop going around terrorizing Delaware pools. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nBiden told him: \"Esther Williams! Get off the board, man\u2026\" Then Biden kicked Corn Pop out of the pool.\n\n(I know you're thinking \"Who TF is Esther Williams?\" She was a famous swimmer in the 50s. But I admit, I thought he was talking about the lady who played Florida Evans, too) \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nThey told Biden that Corn Pop carried a straight razor and was gonna be waiting for him when he got off work. Now you and I both know that, if this was true, Biden would've just called the cops to walk him to the car. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nAnyway, Biden says, instead he wrapped a six-foot metal chain around his arm and wrapped that in a towel. Because everyone knows there are ample black chains just laying around the \"African America community\" but no police officers. \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nAnd guess what happened? Just like that, my nigga CP put down the straight razor and he and Biden became friends. From that day own, Biden was untouchable in the black community because Corn Pop vouched for him Again, STOP LAUGHING! \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nBut this story is actually recounted in Joe Biden's 2007 autobiography AND is retold in the Washington Post, here: https://t.co/oN2TCKwKsw \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nBut this is not about Biden. This is a celebration of the life of a straight razor-carrying certified street thug who I'd bet my pinky toe never existed. But if you ask Biden, I bet he'd say Corn Pop has passed on. RIP my nigga Corn Pop.\n\nThis is how it sounds when thugs die \u2014 michaelharriot (@michaelharriot) September 14, 2019\n\nBut, there appears to be some truth in the story. This guy, who, by the way has never encountered a liberal Democrat he will not fluff, comes up with evidence that there was actually a gang based in Northeast Wilmington public housing called \u201cThe Romans\u201d and that there was a least one guy in Wilmington at the time who was at some point in his life called \u201cCornpop.\u201d And some notable locals claim to know all about this event:\n\nBiden is facing skepticism for a story he has told about a 1960s confrontation at a Wilmington, Delaware pool with a guy named Corn Pop \u2014 partly because of the name Corn Pop. Here's an obituary for Wilmington's William L. \"CornPop\" Morris, who died at 73 in 2016. (Thread) pic.twitter.com/HGuLyorEvW \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 15, 2019\n\nSome of the skepticism has been about the name of the gang or crew Biden said CornPop ran with, the Romans. Here's an article from Delaware's News Journal in which a local historian says there was a Wilmington gang called the Romans in the 1960s. pic.twitter.com/A4ePc4hnDX \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 15, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s Mediaite\u2019s Tommy Christopher adding to the story, for what that might be worth (not much, is my guess):\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Just because various parts of this story are true doesn\u2019t mean the story is true. The odds of significant political figures in Delaware blowing the whistle of Joe Biden approach zero. So we can really discount the third party claims to the story as unreliable. The fact that a gang named The Romans existed doesn\u2019t mean they went to the pool where Joe Biden worked. There is nothing in the obit of William \u201cCornpop\u201d Morris to indicate that a) he was affiliated with a street gang or b) that he was even a Wilmington native. He is of the same age as Biden and there is the nickname but none of that adds up to Biden\u2019s story. And the fact that the usual rescue squad for Democrat politicians on fire is in operation doesn\u2019t give one a great feeling of comfort:\n\nTweets by newsbysamuels\n\nThe story may be true or it may not. Outside of Jiffy Pop or Lollipop showing up to give corroborating testimony, we\u2019ll most likely never have conclusive proof that the story is real and not another Bidenesque adventure that has entertained us over the years. What we can say is that a) Biden has been telling it for a while and b) there are verifiable factoids in the story that indicate something like the story happened but my gut feeling is that the actual story is something very dissimilar to Biden\u2019s rendition of the tale, just like the story of him awarding the Navy Cross to the tearful and reluctant Navy captain.\n\n=========\n\n=========\n\nLike what you see?
