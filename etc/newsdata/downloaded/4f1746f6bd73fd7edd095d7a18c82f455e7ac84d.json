Patel & Nikhil Research Company. The imports will rise as edible oil consumption is estimated to grow to a record 23.6 million tonnes.\n\nPalm oil accounts for nearly two-thirds of India\u2019s total edible oil imports. India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, with its soyoil mainly imported from Argentina and Brazil. It purchases sunflower oil from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cSoybean oil imports may rise 3.4 million tonnes against previous year\u2019s 3.1 million tonnes due to a drop in domestic crop,\u201d Patel told a conference.\n\nThe country\u2019s soybean production is expected to drop 12.6% from a year ago to 9 million tonnes as excessive rainfall damaged the crop in the top producing central state of Madhya Pradesh, he said.\n\nMadhya Pradesh received 38% more rainfall than the average since the start of four-month long monsoon season on June 1. India is likely to receive above-average monsoon rains in 2019 for the first time in six years as seasonal rainfall continues longer than expected.\n\nHigher rainfall, although, could lift groundnut and cotton production and allow farmers to expand the area under winter-sown oilseed crops such as rapeseed, said Patel, who has been trading edible oil for more than four decades.\n\nThe South Asian country\u2019s total edible oil imports could rise to a record high of 15.6 million tonnes in 2019/20, up 3.8% from a year earlier, Patel said.\n\nIndia\u2019s sunflower oil imports in the new marketing year could rise to 2.5 million tonnes from 2.4 million tonnes estimated in the current year, he said.", "description": "India's palm oil imports in 2019/20 are likely to rise 2% from a year earlier to a record high as consumption in the world's biggest edible oil buyer will expand more rapidly than local supplies, a leading industry analyst said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Rajendra Jadhav", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433716143&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0QC", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
