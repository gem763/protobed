Even though the incident happened almost a year ago, it's still absolutely hilarious.\n\nNo fuel needed\n\nThere are no details about who the woman is, or the guys in the car filming the incident, but their laughter is uncontrollable and contagious at the same time.\n\nWATCH | Tesla comes when called, but can fray nerves\n\n\n\nElectric cars have been a hot topic for more than a decade and with so many electrified models on sale all around the world, it's very difficult to comprehend that someone driving a Tesla Model S would not know about this technology.\n\nIt most probably is not her own car, and whoever the owner is, clearly did not give her any instruction - or warning.\n\nThe video starts with the woman walking around the car several times, confusingly searching for a fuel cap, she even opens the boot in error. The folks in the car continue their fit of hysteria as the woman finds the cap which opens the car's charging point, then reaches in the car for her card to swipe and pay for fuel. Even more shocking is that she tries to make the fuel pump fit into one of the smaller holes meant for the car's charging plug.\n\nEventually, one of the passengers jumps out of the car behind her and puts her out of her misery and explains the Tesla is an electric vehicle that does not use any fuel. She seems relieved and laughs with the man before he returns to his friends.\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n", "description": "It's never right to laugh at others' misfortunes, but even this woman chuckled at herself when someone pointed out to her that you can' 'fill up' an electric car at a petrol station.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2444/2367b8446fbd4fe7bf493290b9021684.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
