Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are running nearly even in California and Nevada, with their campaigns yet to develop to the point of separation here. That\u2019s a departure from other early states such as Iowa, where Warren has pulled ahead, or South Carolina, where Biden remains dominant.\n\n\u201cThere were certain kinds of common wisdoms going into California \u2014 there\u2019s lots of Latinos, and Kamala Harris or [Los Angeles Mayor] Eric Garcetti might have a base here. Those kinds of thoughts were really prevalent, and they\u2019ve all been really put on the back burner right now, with more of the tried, true, traditional Iowa, New Hampshire,\u201d said Paul Mitchell of Political Data Inc., the voter data firm used by both Democrats and Republicans in California. \u201cThe current narrative around the presidential race has almost forgotten that there\u2019s a big California contest.\u201d\n\nGiven the high cost of advertising in California\u2019s massive media markets, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can afford to make California anything but a shorter window. \u2026 In retrospect, the smart strategy is to focus on the less expensive targets for this long winter of the campaign, and make sure you have the fuel to come around and explode in California.\u201d\n\nThe lack of a favorite in California and Nevada has reduced pressure on campaigns to spend money early in the two states, or to devote anything close to the amount of time they are spending in other early states. Biden has not held a single public event in California this year, though he has raised money in California and is expected to campaign in the state in November.\n\n\u201cWe are totally wide open,\u201d said Annette Magnus, executive director of the progressive group Battle Born Progress in Nevada. \u201cThere\u2019s so much potential in a state like Nevada \u2014 and it\u2019s a relatively small investment that you can make here, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.\u201d\n\nCandidates are laying groundwork to exploit that opportunity \u2014 eventually. Biden has nearly 40 staffers in Nevada. Warren has had a presence in Nevada since January and now has more than 50 staffers spread across nine offices in the state. Sanders, who narrowly lost the Nevada caucuses to Hillary Clinton in 2016, has 70 staffers in the state. In neighboring California, where Sanders spent weeks campaigning in a losing effort in 2016, the Vermont senator has 24 paid staffers.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has 56 staffers in Nevada and campaigned in the state last week. And California has seen a spate of town halls, rallies and forums in the state. Tom Steyer, a Californian, was in Los Angeles planting an apple and an avocado tree last week, and national Democrats announced Friday that they will hold the year\u2019s sixth presidential primary debate, in December, in Los Angeles.\n\nDoug Herman, a Democratic strategist in California, described the campaigns\u2019 efforts in the state as \u201cstill rudimentary, and they should be at this point. \u2026 None of what happens in a Super Tuesday state prior to Iowa and New Hampshire is relevant unless it\u2019s an error.\u201d\n\nBut in Nevada, the contest has taken on a greater urgency because of its earlier place on the calendar. And despite its small size, staffing requirements can be significant because of the difficulties campaigning in a state with a large shift-work and transient population.\n\n\u201cNevada is a place where there\u2019s no playbook in how to win,\u201d said Alana Mounce, the Nevada State Democratic Party\u2019s executive director.\n\nCalifornia Playbook Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

But it could also be a death knell for a candidate who cannot appeal to nonwhite voters, with the largest Latino population \u2014 29 percent \u2014 of any of the early-voting states.\n\nIn particular, Nevada stands to challenge Buttigieg\u2019s attempt to join the campaign\u2019s top tier. Despite his massive fundraising and large staffing, he continues to struggle with nonwhite voters. Michael Ceraso, his former New Hampshire director, said he is \u201cnot resonating with communities of color,\u201d a shortcoming that could be first exposed in Nevada.\n\nJason Frierson, Nevada\u2019s Assembly speaker, suggested Nevada still presents an opportunity for Buttigieg or any other candidate to grow. Nevadans, he said, are still \u201cwaiting to assess the candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there are some candidates who have put a lot of sweat equity into Nevada early, and every single one of them that has reached out to me, I\u2019ve told them that we are a small state, but we are an early state, and our folks remember those one-on-one relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cOur folks remember that candidate\u2019s presence here.\u201d\n\nAnd by Super Tuesday, Californians likely will, as well. Gray Davis, a former Democratic governor, said it is possible that California\u2019s effort to play a more significant role in the nominating process \u201cmay not play itself out in this election, it may not play itself out in the next election.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, it has a better chance of being significant now than it did when it held its primary in June.\n\n\u201cLook, California is the fifth-largest economy in the world,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat means only the United States, China, Japan and Germany have a larger economy. We do not deserve to be the caboose on the presidential train.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Former California Gov.
