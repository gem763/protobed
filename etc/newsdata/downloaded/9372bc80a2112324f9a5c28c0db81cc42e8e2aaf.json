CTST need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 18, 2019 $2.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CannTrust shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CannTrust is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical \u2013 Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter widened from a loss of 3 cents per share to a loss of 4 cents.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about CannTrust right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.
