As she speaks, the hurt is still very much apparent. One of England\u2019s biggest stars at the time, when she asked to miss a training camp in 2011 for childcare reasons, her international career came to an abrupt halt. It would be four years, and a new manager, before Chapman received another call-up. She missed a World Cup, a home Olympic Games and lost the financial help her central contract provided.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel supported by the FA at that point, I felt pressure,\u201d she says now. It is not a palatable message of empowerment. Nor is it a wonderful shot of an athlete, child on hip, posting their epic victory as a new mother. It is an alternative reality of the sporting mother, one of a constant fight to remain relevant in a profession where having a child could mean you are written off. It exists along with so many others in the shadows of the spotlight given to remarkable mothers competing at the upper echelons of elite sport.\n\nNothing exposed those conflicting narratives more starkly than US sprinter Alysia Montano\u2019s fightback against Nike earlier this year. \u201cNike told me to dream crazy, until I wanted a baby,\u201d she told the New York Times of the hypocrisy behind the sportswear company\u2019s viral ad campaign championing Serena Williams\u2019s comeback while she experienced quite the opposite.\n\nSpeaking out sent shockwaves, with Nike since reviewing its maternity policy to waive pregnant athletes\u2019 performance-based targets for 12 months.\n\nJust as with the average woman, elite sport stars\u2019 journeys in motherhood vary greatly. While some choose to jump back into competition, others take a break. While some are mothers in their 20s, others start families in their 40s after retirement. And where some are supported to the ends of the earth, others must grapple with professional sport\u2019s often unaccommodating environment.", "description": "\u2018I felt I got punished for having children.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/16/ss-composite-image-2019-10-16-13-8-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
