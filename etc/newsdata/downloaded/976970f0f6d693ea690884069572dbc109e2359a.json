It\u2019s a dream recipe if your kids are picky because you can come up with personalized combinations, and it\u2019s nut-free so it\u2019s a nice alternative snack to send in kids' lunches (just make sure to check with your kids' school first), or serve as an after-school snack. I even like to munch on it while I work!\n\nThe recipe below is a basic version with simple add-ins \u2014 I personally like to keep it simple! \u2014 but here are a few options for different add-ins you can experiment with. Feel free to step outside of the list and add other things your kids like.\n\npopcorn\n\ncereal\n\ndried fruits (apricots, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries, etc)\n\ndried cherries\n\ncoconut chips\n\nroasted chickpeas\n\ngranola\n\nbanana chips\n\nplantain chips\n\nmarshmallows\n\nchocolate covered raisins\n\nThis is an easy recipe to make \u2014 there is no hot stove, hot liquids, or complicated processes, so kids can make this on their own. In my case, and likely yours too, when my kids make a recipe and have the choice over what goes in and what stays out, they\u2019re more likely to eat it \u2014 and love it. The only rule, and it\u2019s a loose one, is that you start with a base and then customize with your add-ins.\n\nTo make nut-free trail mix, you will need:\n\nBase:\n\n3/4 cup roasted, unsalted pumpkin seeds\n\n1/2 cup roasted, unsalted sunflower seeds\n\nAdd-Ins:\n\n1/2 cup pretzels (any shape)\n\n1/4 cup raisins\n\n2 tablespoons mini-chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\n\nAdd all ingredients to an airtight jar and shake to mix everything up.\n\nRecipe Notes:\n\nYou can mix and match your ingredients (see suggestions above), but be sure to always have a good base of seeds to start. I recommend what is used in the recipe, 1/2 cup roasted pumpkin seeds and 1/2 cup roasted sunflower seeds.\n\nI use unsalted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, but I will sometimes use salted sunflower seeds for a little hint of saltiness if none of the other add-ins are salty.\n\nThis recipe can easily be doubled or tripled for larger batches.", "description": "If it\u2019s sometimes a chore to find nut-free snacks both you and your kids will love, then this nut-free trail mix recipe is for you!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/LEAD-nut-free-trail-mix-recipe.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-16"}
