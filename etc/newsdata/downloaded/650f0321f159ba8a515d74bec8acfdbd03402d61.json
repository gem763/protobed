That is a more than 70 percent cut from its level when President Barack Obama left office.\n\nThe move has been part of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader effort to reduce the number of documented and undocumented immigrants entering the United States, including numerous restrictions on asylum seekers, who, like refugees, are fleeing persecution but cross into the United States over the border with Mexico or Canada.\n\nNow, Mr. Miller and allies from the White House whom he placed at the Departments of State and Homeland Security are pushing aggressively to shrink the program even further, according to one senior official involved in the discussions and several former officials briefed on them, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail the private deliberations.\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJohn Zadrozny, a top official at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, made the argument for simply lowering the ceiling to zero, a stance that was first reported by Politico. Others have suggested providing \u201ccarveouts\u201d for certain countries or populations, such as the Iraqis and Afghans, whose work on behalf of the American government put both them and their families at risk, making them eligible for special status to come to the United States through the refugee program.", "description": "Two options administration officials will consider next week would all but end the United States\u2019 status as one of the leading places accepting refugees from around the world.", "authors": ["Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Michael D.
