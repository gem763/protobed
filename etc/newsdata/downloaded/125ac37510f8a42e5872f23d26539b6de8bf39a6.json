The same lawyers represent both leakers.\n\nCiting the attorney\u2019s biography published by his current employer, the Federalist revealed that the lawyer used to report directly to Clapper, adding:\n\nCharles McCullough, an attorney now representing the whistleblowers with Andrew Bakaj, a former staffer for Sens. Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, was previously the inspector general of the intelligence community (ICIG) at the height of the Clinton email scandal. Now a partner at the Compass Rose Legal Group, McCullough\u2019s professional biography on the law firm\u2019s website notes that he reported directly to Clapper as ICIG and \u201coversaw intelligence officers responsible for audits, inspections, investigations.\u201d Clapper, who joined CNN as a national security analyst after leaving government in 2017, was a central figure in perpetuating the Russia hoax against Trump and lied to Congress about mass surveillance on Americans.\n\nIn an interview with Fox 5 last December, McCullough commended the former DNI, saying, \u201cI enjoyed a very good relationship with Jim Clapper, we got along fabulously.\u201d\n\nClapper is a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Air Force. The former intelligence community chief is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics.\n\nThe \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d claim that Trump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine if it refused to investigate corruption allegations against Biden, and his son is at the center of the impeachment probe.\n\nAccording to the \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d Trump made the so-called quid pro quo offer during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. However, both Trump and Zelensky have denied the \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d characterization of their conversation.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, has also said there was not quid pro quo during the call.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the IC IG, noted in an August 26 letter that the first \u201cwhistleblower\u201d was found to have harbored \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of a rival political candidate to President Trump. Atkinson did not name the rival.", "description": "One of the lawyers representing the unnamed \"whistleblowers\" at the center of the impeachment inquiry \"reported directly\" to James Clapper.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/GettyImages-680439030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
