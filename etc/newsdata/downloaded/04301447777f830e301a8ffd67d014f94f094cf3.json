How many questions can will you get correct in our tricky theory test?\n\nTo pass the quiz element, those taking the test must get 43 out of 50 correct. But some questions are far trickier than others and it appears to be catching people out.\n\nLatest statistics from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency for July and September 2016 show that 511,708 took the car theory test in that period - and 51 per cent failed.\n\nThe pass rate was a far higher 65 per cent ten years ago - and the DVSA says: 'This is attributed mainly to the introduction of new theory test questions that had not been published before. This lowered the pass rate and has led to more retakes.'\n\nThe test costs \u00a323 - and it means if the 260,903 who failed during that period chose to take it again, a total of \u00a36million in retake revenue for the DVSA.\n\nThis is Money asked the DVSA for what the ten most commonly failed questions in its data bank are.\n\nIt, however, refused our request on the grounds that it doesn't want candidates to 'learn' the answers by rote.\n\nCar theory: The pass rate has fallen substantially over the years this DVSA graph shows\n\nLesley Young, DVSA chief driving examiner, adds: 'In January 2012 we stopped publishing the theory test questions to make sure that candidates understand the theory behind safe driving, rather than simply learning answers by rote.'\n\nThere are millions of drivers on the road with full licences who have never needed to take the theory test.\n\nRecent data from comparison website Moneysupermarket suggests that a staggering four in 10 motorists would fail a theory test if they had to take it today.\n\nHowever, separate data from Asda Money revealed 74 per cent are convinced they would pass their practical driving test should they be made to take it again.\n\nNo theory: Millions of drivers, who were on the roads before 1996, have never needed to take a theory test\n\nWe have trawled through hundreds of theory test questions and picked 15 which we believe are tricky and could catch the average motorist out.\n\nAlthough many of the questions are common sense, some are incredibly difficult, testing your maths skills while even questions about automatic cars are asked - even though many will only drive manual.\n\nTake the test, tell us how many you got right and whether you have seen some of these signs, or used some of this knowledge in your everyday driving.", "description": "This theory element is now made up of 50 multiple choice questions and 14 short video clips in which people have to click on the screen when they see a potential hazard.", "authors": ["Lee Boyce For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
