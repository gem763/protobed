In 2010 his taxi business went bankrupt and he was forced to return to work as a private cab driver.\n\nHe kept his dark side a secret from those closest to him in later years.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe would pick prostitutes up in his taxi and those who encountered him weeks before Sian's death in 2011 said he got \"rough and weird\" with them and had called for help.\n\nIn March 2011, Halliwell used his green Toyota Avensis to pick up office worker Sian from Swindon's Suju nightclub as she made the 15 minute walk back to her home.\n\nDespite Halliwell putting a \u00a320,000 reward posted in the back of his car within days of Sian's disappearance, he quickly became the main subject of the subsequent police investigation.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nOn the day of his arrest, Halliwell spoke to Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher, and admitted to murdering two women and dumping their bodies in shallow graves.\n\nHalliwell's former girlfriend Heather later told how they'd had sex just hours after he killed Sian.\n\nSex worker Becky Godden-Edwards, who went missing in 2003, was found in a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, eight years later in 2011.\n\n(Image: Godden Family / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Family handout/PA)\n\nDespite initially denying her killing Halliwell led detectives to the grisly site where he had buried Becky's headless corpse, telling them he was a \"sick f**ker\" and asking: \"Is it too late to get help?\"\n\nNew evidence was later uncovered which helped the police convict the killer cab driver.\n\nHalliwell has since been linked with the cases of several missing women in his home time and Fulcher also linked him to the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence.\n\nWhile Halliwell is only serving life sentences for the murders of two women a secret trophy collection of 60 items of women's clothing suggest there could be more victims.\n\n*The final episode of A Confession airs tonight at 9pm on ITV", "description": "Christopher Halliwell was convicted of the murders of two women and police have linked him to several other cases", "authors": ["Natalie Corner", "Image", "Wiltshire Police", "Pa", "Swns.Com", "Itv", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Godden Family", "Swns", "Family Handout Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19895952.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Becky-Godden-Edwards-murder.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
