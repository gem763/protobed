Bryant, 21 at the time, was working at a store when Emmett came in to buy two cents of bubble gum. Till would end up beaten, shot and disfigured beyond recognition on August 28. His body was recovered from the Tallahatchie River at Graball Landing in Money three days later. Bryant's husband, Roy, and his half-brother JW Milam, were arrested for the murder, but were acquitted by an all-white, all male jury on September 23. Both men later admitted killing Emmett in an interview with Look Magazine, safe in the knowledge they were protected by double jeopardy laws. The case - and the outcome of the trial - sparked widespread outrage because of the young age of Till, and the brutality of the attack. It was seen as representative of the injustices suffered by black people in America at the time. Rallies were held around the country - including one led by Martin Luther King Jr in Montgomery, Alabama which was attended by Rosa Parks. A hundred days after Till's murder, Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus, sparking the famous bus boycotts against segregation. She would later say that she was inspired to stay seated because of what happened to Till.\n\nIn the photo, LeClere can be seen holding a shotgun while Lowe holds a AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. All three members were members of the Kappa Alpha Order, which later suspended them.\n\nProPublica's coverage of the incident prompted a possible Justice Department investigation.\n\nUS Attorney Chad Lamar of the Northern District of Mississippi in Oxford at the time looked over the photo and said that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division would be looking into the incident.\n\n'We will be working with them closely,' he said then.\n\nA spokesperson for Lamar was not immediately available when DailyMail.com reached out for an update on the probe.\n\nTill's story shook the nation 62 years ago, after he was found beaten, shot and disfigured beyond recognition. His attackers walked free, acquitted at the hands of an all-white, all-male jury.\n\nThey had accused the boy of harassing at a white woman.\n\nThe woman, Carolyn Bryant, finally admitted in 2017 that her testimony at the murder trial, which carried the case, was a blatant lie.\n\n'The Blood of Emmett Till', a book by Timothy B Tyson, Senior Research Scholar at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, published that year included an interview with Bryant, who also had accused Emmett of grabbing and verbally abusing her.\n\nBryant, then 21, was the wife of one of the men who was arrested for Emmett's murder, Roy Bryant. She was working at a store when Emmett came in to buy two cents of bubble gum on a hot August day.\n\nIn her testimony she told the court that she couldn't bring herself to say the 'unprintable' word he'd said to her - only that he told her he'd done 'something' with white women before.\n\nShe added: 'I was just scared to death.'\n\nIt took the jury less than an hour to acquit Roy Bryant, and his half-brother JW Milam of the crime, which they admitted to law enforcement.\n\nTill allegedly whistled at a white woman, Carolyn Bryant (pictured) who finally admitted in 2017 that her testimony in the murder trial, which carried the case, was a blatant lie\n\nJW Milam (center) of Glendora, Mississippi, and his half brother, Carolyn Bryant's husband, Roy (right) of Money, were acquitted by an all-male, all-white jury for Till's murder\n\nAt the time, Mississippi had very few white on black crime convictions, and led the nation in lynchings.\n\nSeveral months later, the men admitted killing Emmett in an interview with Look Magazine, safe in the knowledge they were protected by double jeopardy laws and were paid $3,000 for sharing their story.\n\nSaturday's dedication included two of Till's cousins, the Reverand Wheeler Parker and Ollie Gordon.
