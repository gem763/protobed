One man, however, took the usual back-and-forth to whole new heights.\n\nA man from Beirut, Lebanon, was so vexed with his brother inheriting the family land and constructing a building on it, he sabotaged the house.\n\nHe did the only thing he could: built the thinnest house he could in front of it. And it wasn\u2019t so they could be neighbors.\n\nThe petty sibling did it to block his brother\u2019s view of the sea.\n\nLocals in the neighbourhood have shared the well-known story of the house that was built in the 1950s after a feud between the brothers.\n\nThe thin house, which is inhabitable albeit narrow, resulted in the original property losing value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd get this \u2013 he named the building Al Ba\u2019sa, Arabic for The Grudge.\n\nGoodbye sea view (Picture: Sandra Rishani)\n\nThe details of the story were shared by urban planner and architect Sandra Rishani who was asked to research a forgotten story of the capital for a book.\n\nShe asked her dad, who shared the popular story of the brothers.\n\nWriting in Arab zine Jadaliyya, she wrote: \u2018I spotted right in front of me a 14-metre-high edge, no wider than one metre!\n\n\u2018I had passed it many times before, had even looked at the facade, thinking, \u201cWhat an intriguing, abandoned low-rise building with a sea view.\u201d\n\n\u2018Mesmerised by its \u201cfake\u201d facade, which at first glance made the house appear wide enough to be inhabitable, I approached the concierge of the building next door to inquire further.\n\nThe wider end of the building (Picture: Sandra Rishani)\n\n\u2018\u201cYes, I know. It\u2019s shocking,\u201d he said, before I had even finished my question. \u201cIt\u2019s a wall. But people used to live in it\u201d.\u2019\n\nThe house \u2013 which he said may be the thinnest inhabitable building in the world \u2013 came to be used as a brothel before eventually being inhabited by refugees fleeing the war.\n\nAccording to Sandra\u2019s research, the livable home ranges in depth from four metres at its widest, to sixty centimetres \u2013 the depth of a closet \u2013 at its slimmest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt comes equipped with two flats on each floor.\n\nTo add further irony, the building was constructed by two brothers, Salah and Fawzi Itani.\n\nThankfully they had no squabbles during construction.\n\nMORE: Stunt siblings walk on wire suspended over New York\u2019s Times Square\n\nMORE: Amazing photographs of brothers both born with one brown eye and one blue\n\nMORE: Kitten trying to find help for her abandoned siblings gets her head stuck in the fence\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A man from Beirut, Lebanon, was so vexed with his brother inheriting the family land and constructing a building on it, he sabotaged it.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89970400_1571137401.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
