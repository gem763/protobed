(the world need[s] two of you !).\u201d\n\n\"Not particularly,\u201d Goulding responded, as captured by People. She added a gritting-teeth emoji and added, \"As you can imagine it\u2019s been a non-stop question.\"\n\n\u201cI hate being made to feel like that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to be doing on this earth,\u201d she continued. \u201cI guess technically I am. But I see things differently in today\u2019s world!\u201d\n\nBefore she starts producing babies, fans would probably be content with Goulding producing a new album. Though she's released several hit singles, like the Diplo/Swae Lee collaboration \"Close to Me\" and \"Hate Me\" with Juice WRLD, her last album, \"Delirium,\" came out in 2015.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
