(We\u2019re going to presume, if only to simplify the grammatical issues here, that said \u201csenior official\u201d was/is a \u201che.\u201d)\n\nAlthough the author\u2019s identity reportedly is known only to three top editors at The New York Times, speculation has run the gamut from Mike Pence or Mike Pompeo to Kellyanne Conway or Nikki Haley. At the risk of playing this parlor game ourselves, we would have guessed Rex Tillerson, but he was forced out as secretary of State at the end of March 2018, more than five months before the column appeared.\n\nThe column ran less than 20 months into the Trump presidency, and it\u2019s not clear, now 12 months later, whether its author is still in the administration and still toiling to \u201cthwart\u201d the parts of the president\u2019s agenda he doesn\u2019t approve of.\n\n\u201cAnonymous\u201d didn\u2019t have the courage of his convictions to put a byline on the piece and to let the chips fall where they surely would have; namely, in his firing by the president. (A column in the Gray Lady admitting to seeking to subvert President Trump\u2019s agenda is surely more of a firing offense than gossipy remarks about the president\u2019s children made by White House aide Madeleine Westerhout in what was supposed to be an off-the-record chat with a Washington Post reporter, which got her fired last week.)\n\nApparently, the \u201cpayroll patriot\u201d behind The New York Times column wasn\u2019t willing to sacrifice his high-dollar sinecure \u201cto put country first,\u201d which is how he sanctimoniously characterized his actions.\n\nAnonymous insisted, however, that he should not be confused with \u201cthe popular \u2018resistance\u2019 of the left.\u201d Nor is this \u201cthe work of the so-called deep state,\u201d he averred.\n\nTo the contrary, \u201cWe want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\u201d citing \u201ceffective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military, and more.\u201d\n\nBut those genuine Trump achievements were given short shrift, rendering their mention little more than a fig leaf in defense of his sub-rosa actions, which are, in Anonymous\u2019 telling, a justifiable attempt to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201camorality\u201d and \u201cimpulsiveness.\u201d Those traits supposedly have resulted in \u201chalf-baked, ill-informed, and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.\u201d But who elected Anonymous?\n\nFor all the posturing and preening in the column, one is left to wonder: Which, if any, of President Trump\u2019s policies, programs and initiatives have the clandestine Anonymous\u2019 efforts actually prevented, reversed or undermined?\n\nThe column was silent on that point, presumably because such specificity would have \u201couted\u201d the author, who vowed to continue to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmore misguided impulses until he is out of office.\u201d\n\nIf Anonymous and others like him in the administration can\u2019t in good conscience carry out the president\u2019s decisions, the honorable thing to do would be to resign and explain why they can no longer do so.\n\nMore to the point, the American public deserves to know whether Anonymous is still trying to thwart the president, and on what issues and in what ways? And is he acting as a \u201clone gunman\u201d or still part of that purported \u201clike-minded\u201d cabal out to sabotage Mr. Trump?\n\nThis sordid episode was, and is, regrettably representative of the Washington Swamp at its most tenacious and intractable. That\u2019s disturbing, because it was Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to \u201cdrain the Swamp\u201d that got him elected in the first place. The Swamp will not be drained, at least not if Anonymous and the other Swamp dwellers have anything to say about it.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
