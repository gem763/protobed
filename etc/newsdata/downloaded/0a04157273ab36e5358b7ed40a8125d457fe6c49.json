He\u2019ll have Snead behind him with his next title, which doesn\u2019t seem such a daunting task with the form Woods showed tying Snead\u2019s victory mark in Japan.\n\nStats: Breaking down Tiger's 82 PGA Tour wins\n\nPlus, as an amateur, Woods did things even Bobby Jones didn\u2019t do, winning three U.S. Amateurs in a row.\n\nAll those names Woods bettered don\u2019t include the most fearsome foes he faced along the way.\n\n\u201cShame\u201d and \u201cGuilt\u201d might top the list of those vanquished in the wake of his very public sex scandal. Nobody ever overcame greater challenges than those on a public stage.\n\n\u201cEmbarrassment, in golf, is psychological cancer,\u201d sports psychologist Gio Valiante said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a throw switch in the brain. Anytime someone is humiliated in a public forum, the game becomes so much more difficult. For him to come back from the humiliation he endured, it\u2019s really inexplicable.\u201d\n\nYes, Woods didn\u2019t get hit by a bus like Hogan did, but there were real physical injuries to overcome, too, all those back and knee surgeries that could have put Woods down for good.\n\nTiger: 'I know how it feels to have this game taken away from you'\n\nAnd then there were the challenges pain medications presented. We may never know the nature of that challenge and the effort required to overcome it.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe may never understand what reserves Woods mined to deal with the cumulative weight of one potentially career-ending threat after another.\n\n\u201cA single, minor injury can derail a professional\u2019s career,\u201d Valiante said. \u201cOr a divorce. Or problems with a new house construction. It\u2019s a pretty low bar for getting into players\u2019 heads.\n\n\u201cSmall things can affect players at the highest level, things they can\u2019t absorb. Tiger absorbed multiple physical injuries, psychological trauma, loneliness, pills, drinking and shame.\u201d\n\nAside from the nature of the foes Woods whipped, there\u2019s the unprecedented domination in his prime. There\u2019s the unheard of separation in his triumphs.\n\nThere are the four major championship victories in a row over the 2000 and \u201901 seasons, his 12-shot victory at the Masters in 1997, his 15-shot victory at the U.S. Open in 2000 and his eight-shot victory at The Open Championship in 2000. He didn\u2019t just show how much better he was than anyone in his generation, but how much more dominant he was than anyone ever.\n\nIs Tiger the greatest putter of all time?\n\nIt\u2019s no stretch declaring Woods is already the toughest, most resilient and most spectacular player who ever lived, but ...\n\nDoes that make him the greatest player of all time?\n\nOf course, you knew where this was going ... To Jack and his 18 major championship titles.\n\nNicklaus is the Mount Everest that must be scaled to lay claim as the GOAT.\n\nSure, we can channel the spirits of all-time great litigators Joe Jamail, Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Darrow in presenting a powerful case that Tiger is already the greatest player ever, but he can\u2019t definitively be anointed as such until he has won three more majors to at least equal Jack\u2019s total. No matter how convincing your argument is today, there will always be Nicklaus.\n\nBut ...\n\nThat\u2019s our good fortune, the wonder of the time we\u2019re blessed to be following the game. It looks like we\u2019re seeing Woods resume his quest in earnest with his strength and game returning yet again. It looks like we\u2019re seeing a golf Hercules back to tackle his 18 \u201cLabors\u201d in what would have read like mythology before we saw it with our own eyes.\n\nWhether Woods definitively reaches the summit or not, we can definitively say we\u2019re watching the greatest pursuit the game has ever seen.\n\nWe can revel in the thrill of that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "We may never understand what Tiger Woods has gone through off the golf course, but even so, does that make him the GOAT without 18 majors?", "authors": ["Randall Mell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/czdolcE.tx5nv4ohHEFPew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1tbos3cCNrVGHbhnFFV_CQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_golf_channel_404/dcdffeb9276295e1cec15e83d569b765", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
