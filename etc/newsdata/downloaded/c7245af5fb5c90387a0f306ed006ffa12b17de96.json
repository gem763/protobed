Can you imagine that?\u201d\n\nThe story is meant to foster support and acceptance of gender-nonconforming children, according to co-authors Sarah and Ian Hoffman. And until this week, \u201cJacob\u2019s New Dress\u201d was set to be included in lesson plans for first-grade students at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, one of the largest public school districts in North Carolina.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the book was abruptly pulled from the reading list after several teachers complained, according to Charles Jeter, the district\u2019s government liaison. Those complaints reached a few Republican lawmakers in the state\u2019s General Assembly who \u201cweren\u2019t happy about it when they found out about it Monday,\u201d Jeter said.\n\n\u201cI got a call that it was brought up in the House Republican caucus Monday night, which is never a good thing,\u201d he told The Washington Post by phone Wednesday.\n\nBecause of Jeter\u2019s position \u2014 and because he is a former Republican state representative \u2014 he said those lawmakers asked him to relay their concerns to the school district. So he did, then spent all of Tuesday in Raleigh speaking with \u201cmostly Republicans, some Democrats\u201d about their issues with the book.\n\nAD\n\nBy Tuesday night, Charlotte-Mecklenburg district officials had \u201cmade the decision to not move forward with \u2018Jacob\u2019s New Dress,'\u201d Jeter said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe purpose of our elementary schools is to teach writing, reading and arithmetic, not to encourage boys to wear dresses,\u201d Tami Fitzgerald of the NC Values Coalition said Tuesday, according to the Charlotte Observer. \u201cThese lessons found in the \u2018Jacob\u2019s New Dress\u2019 and \u2018My Princess Boy\u2019 and other transgender curriculum are not appropriate for any child whose parents support traditional family values.\u201d\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg district is one of the largest in North Carolina, with 170 schools and about 147,000 students. A district representative declined to comment in detail Wednesday, instead emailing a statement from Superintendent Ann Blakeney Clark.\n\nAD\n\nThe book had originally been part of an annual \u201cage-appropriate lesson for each grade level\u201d to comply with Title IX and to recognize Child Abuse Prevention Month in April, Clark wrote. (Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, at schools that receive federal funding for educational activities or programs.) Each lesson plan had been intended to teach children how to handle harassment and bullying.\n\nAD\n\nJacob loves playing dress-up, when he can be anything he wants to be.

(@AlbertWhitman) January 25, 2017\n\n\u201cCMS is committed to safe school environments where all students are empowered with the tools they need to prevent, detect and report harassment and bullying,\u201d Clark said in the statement. \u201cThe lesson will help students understand how to recognize harassment and bullying, what to do if it happens to them and how to help someone else who may be experiencing it. The initial first-grade book selection, which focuses on valuing uniqueness and difference, has been replaced due to some concerns about the book.\u201d\n\nA copy of the original lesson plans obtained by The Post showed that first-grade students in the district were to read (or watch on YouTube) \u201cJacob\u2019s New Dress\u201d and then discuss it to learn about sexual and gender harassment. Some recommended guided practice questions had included:\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy do you think Christopher is upset that Jacob wants to wear a dress? What does he do to hurt Jacob\u2019s feelings during the story? (tore up dress, says he has to be on the girls\u2019 team)\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did the teacher help him? How could other students have helped Jacob?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should Jacob do if this happens again? (teach students to say STOP, move away, tell a trusted adult)\u201d\n\nThe lesson plans had also suggested that the students participate in an activity to share what they like and encourage a \u201cwelcoming classroom.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are a boy or a girl, the color of your skin, the language you speak, or where you are from, everyone gets to choose what you like,\u201d the original lesson plans stated. \u201cEmphasize that students had many similarities and differences no matter how they look.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jeter, \u201cJacob\u2019s New Dress\u201d will be replaced by another picture book called \u201cRed: A Crayon\u2019s Story,\u201d about a blue crayon mistakenly labeled as a red one. The publisher\u2019s blurb describes the crayon\u2019s journey to \u201cfind the courage to be true to your inner self\u201d as follows:\n\nAD\n\nHis teacher tries to help him be red (let\u2019s draw strawberries!), his mother tries to help him be red by sending him out on a playdate with a yellow classmate (go draw a nice orange!), and the scissors try to help him be red by snipping his label so that he has room to breathe. But Red is miserable. He just can\u2019t be red, no matter how hard he tries! Finally, a brand-new friend offers a brand-new perspective, and Red discovers what readers have known all along. He\u2019s blue!\n\nJeter said that, while he was in Raleigh on Tuesday, two lawmakers reviewed an e-book version of \u201cRed: A Crayon\u2019s Story\u201d and were not pleased to learn that it had been included in Charlotte-Mecklenburg\u2019s lesson plans previously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re real thrilled with that book, either,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cThat book is now going to be getting more scrutiny in the General Assembly because of this issue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJeter noted that, when he was a state representative, he was \u201ca staunch supporter of LGBT rights\u201d and took issue with some Democratic critics who thought he had orchestrated the removal of \u201cJacob\u2019s New Dress\u201d this week. He said he was simply doing his job by relaying information between lawmakers and district officials.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge or prejudge,\u201d Jeter said, adding that about 60 percent of the district\u2019s budget is approved by the General Assembly. \u201cWith everything going on in North Carolina right now, poking the bear is not a pathway that I think is beneficial to students in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. I don\u2019t think we want our children to live in a bubble and I don\u2019t think the General Assembly wants to micromanage curriculum.\u201d\n\nAs a state representative, Jeter was one of the few Republicans to oppose HB2, a controversial bill that required transgender people use public restrooms that matches the \u201cbiological sex\u201d on their birth certificate.\n\nAD\n\nNorth Carolina legislators passed HB2 last year, and it was signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory \u2014 prompting widespread protests and boycotts of the state. Both the NBA and the NCAA ditched plans to hold special games and tournaments in North Carolina, causing a potential loss of more than $100 million in tourism revenue, CBNC reported.\n\nAD\n\nIn December, North Carolina lawmakers convened a special legislative session to rescind the law but failed to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a weird time politically in North Carolina right now. People overreact on both sides,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this is where we are as a state, for a lot of reasons, but I don\u2019t see it going away anytime soon.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, one of the largest school districts in North Carolina, pulled the book from its elementary lesson plans after lawmakers complained.", "authors": ["Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hvyRzS0XdJYmwajKfKnz1XZvw50=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/66H2QIB4XYY27OJ2EG2ZOQT4KI.png", "published_at": "2017-03-23"}
