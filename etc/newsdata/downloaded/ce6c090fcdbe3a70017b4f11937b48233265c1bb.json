The predictable result? Premiums hundreds of dollars higher than they would otherwise be, according to estimates from health-care analyst Charles Gaba.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, those who don\u2019t qualify for the subsidies that shield enrollees from these price hikes are dropping out of the individual market altogether because they can\u2019t afford the insurance.\n\nBut no worries. For years, administration officials and fellow Republican lawmakers have argued this is merely an expansion of a fundamental American freedom \u2014 the freedom to go uninsured.\n\nSimultaneously, of course, the administration has also been undermining our legal immigration system. Emphasis on \u201clegal\u201d here: For all of Trump\u2019s vitriol for undocumented immigrants, he\u2019s also been targeting people who are trying to come to this country lawfully.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the creative, non-legislative ways the administration has sabotaged the legal immigration system: huge and arbitrary delays in visa and citizenship application processing; cruel and inhumane treatment of families seeking asylum; reductions in the refugee admissions cap to its lowest level on record; and, of course, the travel ban placed on several majority-Muslim countries.\n\nAnd then there are all of the policies intended to penalize legal immigrants whom the Trump administration claims are a financial burden.\n\nTo be clear: Immigrants are in fact a net fiscal boon to the United States, according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and their children are \u201camong the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population.\u201d But Trump and his aides are convinced that immigrants are, and will forever be, a drain on society.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOr, as Trump\u2019s acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Ken Cuccinelli put it: \u201cGive me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli was talking about a new administration rule \u2014 currently being challenged in eight lawsuits \u2014 that makes it harder for immigrants to receive green cards if they have ever used or might someday need safety-net benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid. But it\u2019s actually one of several policies the administration has devised to drive down immigration numbers under the guise of fiscal prudence.\n\nThe latest such development was rolled out Friday night. This new policy, issued via presidential proclamation, bars issuance of visas to immigrants unless they can prove they will obtain health insurance within 30 days of their arrival in the United States, or otherwise demonstrate that they can pay medical expenses out of pocket.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s right, the Trump administration has brought back the individual mandate, but for immigrants only \u2014 the GOP\u2019s supposed commitment to \u201cfreedom\u201d notwithstanding. The Migration Policy Institute estimates the change could end up excluding about two-thirds of future immigrants.\n\nThe new policy is vague about how would-be immigrants would even be able to prove they meet the new requirement. Maybe they\u2019d need to somehow buy insurance before they leave their home countries, while still waiting in that interminable visa queue; maybe not.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if they get subsidized insurance through the individual exchanges, Trump\u2019s proclamation says it won\u2019t count. This is yet another way the administration is sabotaging Obamacare, which explicitly allows immigrants to purchase subsidized exchange insurance. It also places low- and moderate-income immigrants in an impossible position, since they\u2019re now stuck buying insurance at the sticker prices that the Trump administration has helped jack up through its earlier rounds of Obamacare sabotage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder the proclamation, immigrants could instead buy junk insurance. But, as the administration also surely knows, these Trumpcare plans cover almost nothing. So forcing immigrants to buy such policies seems unlikely to shield taxpayers (or hospitals) from immigrants\u2019 emergency medical costs \u2014 which is allegedly the goal here.\n\nOf course there is also a fundamental tension between arguing that uninsured immigrants impose huge costs on the country but uninsured native-born Americans don\u2019t cost anyone anything. But no one said consistency was this administration\u2019s strong suit \u2014 aside from its consistent desire to find new ways to destroy as many institutions as possible.\n\nRead more:\n\nAlex M.
