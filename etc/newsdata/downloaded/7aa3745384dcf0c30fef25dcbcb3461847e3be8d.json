You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cBaby, baby, baby, nooooooo. Justin Bieber could inspire his fans around the world to save a life by adopting a cat from a local animal shelter - rather than fuelling the dangerous demand for hybrid cats, contributing to the animal overpopulation crisis, and proving that when it comes to helping animals, his stance so far is 'I don't care'\", senior vice president of Peta, Lisa Lange said in a statement to People.\n\nBieber did not take kindly to the public criticism of his exotic feline friends, and took to Instagram, where he has more than 119m followers, to respond to the organisation.\n\nThe singer started his tirade with \u201cPeta can suck it.\u201d\n\nPosting to his Instagram story, he went on to say: \u201cPeta go focus on real problems. Like poaching, and animal brutality. Ur tripping because I want a specific kind of cat? U weren't tripping when I got my dog Oscar and he wasn't a rescue...every pet we get must be a rescue?\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old added: \u201cI believe in adopting rescues but I also think there are preferences and that's what breeders are for. Peta go help with all of the plastic in the ocean, and leave my beautiful cats alone.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She said: \"Sorry, Justin, but you must think more deeply about this issue: When millions of animals are losing their lives every year because not enough people adopt - choosing instead to shop - the animal overpopulation is a 'real problem'. That's what 'sucks'.\n\n\"Peta urges you to spend just one hour in a municipal animal shelter with us - we think you'll understand how hard it is to look into the animals' eyes and know that because people pay breeders, many of them will pay with their lives. You have the power to be a great role model on this issue - your behaviour guides that of tons of your fans - so please put that to good use.\"\n\nSushi and Tuna are not Bieber\u2019s first exotic pets. In 2013 he was given a Capuchin monkey called OG Malley. He decided to bring the monkey on tour with him to Germany, which was seized and placed in quarantine upon arrival. OG Malley was later taken to a zoo in Hodenhagen, where reports say the monkey remained \u201ctraumatised\u201d for years.\n\nSpeaking to GQ in 2016, Justin Bieber admitted his mistake, explaining: \u201cHonestly, everyone told me not to bring the monkey. Everybody. Everyone told me not to bring the monkey. I was like 'It's gonna be fine, guys!\" It was the farthest thing from fine.\u201d", "description": "Justin Bieber is feuding with Peta, after the animal rights group criticised the singer for purchasing his\u00a0new pets, two cats named Sushi and Tuna.
