It was the first mainstream phone to push the envelope of screen size \u2014 so much so that, at first, we dubbed it a \u201cphablet\u201d because it seemed so silly big. Sure, it had Samsung\u2019s latest tech and features, plus that stylus, but the Note was first and foremost about the big screen.\n\nEight years on from the first Note, big phones are no longer novel. So instead of just one Galaxy Note this year, we have two: big and bigger. We\u2019ve already covered the \u201cbigger\u201d model in our review of the Note 10 Plus, so I\u2019m going to look at the $949.99 Note 10.\n\nMuch of the Note 10 is the same as its bigger sibling: it has the same processor, the same S Pen stylus, the same software, the same angular design and premium feel, and the same camera system. The difference is that it\u2019s smaller, with \u201cjust\u201d a 6.3-inch display compared to the 10 Plus\u2019 gargantuan 6.8-inch screen. The Note 10 is the smallest Note phone ever released, roughly the size of the mainstream Galaxy S10 or iPhone XR.\n\nThat smaller size gives the Note 10 the potential to be something that no prior Note has been: the ideal premium smartphone for everyone. It comes with all of the bells and whistles, yet it isn\u2019t such an enormous thing that it doesn\u2019t fit in any of my pockets and can\u2019t be used without two hands and lots of concentration. That\u2019s more than I can say for the otherwise stellar OnePlus 7 Pro and every other Note phone I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nBut after using the Note 10 for the better part of the past two weeks, I\u2019ve determined that it\u2019s little more than an S10 with an S Pen.\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent build quality\n\nBright, colorful display\n\nSmooth performance\n\nVersatile camera system\n\nLoud, clear speakers\n\nThe smallest phone you can get with an S Pen Bad Stuff Expensive compared to similar phones\n\nNo headphone jack\n\nNo SD card expansion\n\nUnderwhelming battery life\n\nIn-screen fingerprint reader can be slow and unreliable Buy for $849.99 from Best Buy Buy for $949.99 from Samsung Buy for $959.99 from Walmart\n\nThe Note 10 has the same aluminum frame plus glass construction as the Note 10 Plus. It is just as premium feeling as its bigger sibling, and the fit and finish are at the top of what you can get from a smartphone in 2019. It\u2019s just a really nice thing to hold in your hands.\n\nIt\u2019s also slightly easier to hold in your hands than the Note 10 Plus because of its smaller dimensions. On a spec sheet, the Note 10 is within millimeters of the S10 and the iPhone XR. But its squared-off shape and lack of bezels make it a bit harder to use in one hand than those phones. Reaching the top to swipe down for notifications requires shifting the phone down in my hand, and I have to tilt the device precariously to reach the opposite side with my thumb. It\u2019s really the upper limit of what I can manage without dropping the device. Though the Note 10 is a \u201csmall Note,\u201d it\u2019s still a big phone, and it won\u2019t be for everyone.\n\nDespite that smaller frame, the Note 10\u2019s 6.3-inch screen is still a huge display that\u2019s extremely immersive, thanks to those tiny bezels above, below, and on the sides of it. This phone is about as all-screen as you can get at this point, and even the cutout for the front camera doesn\u2019t diminish the immersive feel. I love using this phone for reading text and watching videos more than perhaps any other device. It\u2019s just that nice to look at.\n\nThe display has a lower resolution than the 10 Plus\u2019 screen, and it even has fewer pixels than the S10 or S10 Plus. But in practice, it\u2019s still razor sharp, and I\u2019d be hard-pressed to believe anyone who says they can see the difference in resolution between it and the screens on the other phones. It\u2019s also exactly what I\u2019ve come to expect from a high-end Samsung screen: bright, colorful, and with great viewing angles. In an interesting change, the Note 10\u2019s screen is set by default to display more muted colors than is typical of Samsung phones. If you want to restore the punchy colors of prior Samsungs, you have to change the display to \u201cvivid\u201d in the phone\u2019s settings app.\n\nSince the Note 10 has the same processor and software platform as the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 Plus, its performance is just as fast and smooth. I rarely encountered any hiccups or stutters. The only other phone that feels any faster is the OnePlus 7 Pro, and that\u2019s largely due to the 7 Pro\u2019s higher refresh display. A higher refresh screen is something that Samsung could have added to differentiate the new Note models from the rest of its lineup this year, but it didn\u2019t. I wish it had.\n\nThe Note 10\u2019s battery life is less impressive than the rest of the phone\n\nThe Note 10\u2019s 8GB of RAM is plenty for multitasking and streaming music in the background without the worry of it being shut down by the phone\u2019s memory management. (I\u2019m looking at you, Pixel 3.) The 256GB of built-in storage \u2014 the only configuration available \u2014 is generous enough to cover all but the most voracious data hoarders\u2019 needs, and I didn\u2019t miss the fact that I can\u2019t expand it with a memory card.\n\nWhile the Note 10\u2019s performance has no issues, its battery life is less impressive. Galaxy Note phones are famous for being able to last for a full day with heavy usage, but the Note 10 requires a bit more management and attentiveness to its battery life than I was expecting. Even though the battery capacity is higher and the screen resolution is lower than the S10, I\u2019ve been getting about the same battery life on the Note 10 as I did on the S10, with just under four hours of screen time between charges. That\u2019s still solid, and it will suffice for most people, but it\u2019s not the impressive stamina you can get from the Note 10 Plus or even the S10 Plus.\n\nThe Note 10\u2019s camera system is basically the same as the Note 10 Plus: a triple-camera array, with standard, ultrawide, and telephoto cameras. That gives it a lot of versatility with angles of view. It\u2019s a bit like having a whole camera bag full of lenses built into the back of your phone. The Note 10\u2019s cameras are fun to use and consistently provide detailed, colorful pictures in good lighting. But as with the other Samsung phones, the Note 10\u2019s camera can\u2019t keep up with the Google Pixel 3 in nighttime shooting.\n\nWhat the Note 10 doesn\u2019t have is the extra depth-sensing sensor found on the back of the 10 Plus, which is said to be used for various augmented reality effects. But in practice, the Note 10 doesn\u2019t suffer for it. You can still do all of the same tricks and gimmicks, like the AR Doodle thing, with the Note 10 as you can with the Note 10 Plus. It\u2019s not clear to me what the extra sensors are actually doing on the 10 Plus if the Note 10 can do the same things without them.\n\nThree cameras provide a lot of photographic versatility\n\nFinally, the Note 10 has the exact same S Pen stylus and features as the Note 10 Plus. You can use the S Pen to write on the screen, navigate the user interface, or remotely snap photos in the camera. In the many years I\u2019ve tested, owned, and used Note phones, I\u2019ve always struggled to adopt the S Pen into my daily workflow, but Samsung insists that the pen is a major reason why so many people buy Galaxy Note phones. The Note 10\u2019s slightly smaller screen doesn\u2019t diminish the S Pen\u2019s capabilities, either. It\u2019s just as easy to write with and mark up documents as it is with the larger screen of the 10 Plus. It\u2019s also pretty good for playing Two Dots.\n\nThe point of the matter is if you\u2019ve long been intrigued by the S Pen\u2019s capabilities but put off by the fact that you needed to buy a giant phone to get them, the Note 10 puts the S Pen in a smaller phone than ever before.\n\nThat is the only real reason to purchase the Note 10. Sure, it\u2019s an excellent phone with great performance, a beautiful screen, and a premium design. But the Galaxy S10 is also an excellent phone with great performance, a beautiful screen, and a premium design. Six months after its release date, the S10 is frequently on sale for hundreds of dollars less than the Note 10. It makes the Note 10 a really tough sell \u2014 unless you want a phone with a pen, then it\u2019s the only game in town.\n\nThough it may not be readily apparent from reading its spec sheet, the Note has changed more this year than it has with any prior model. No longer the King of the Big Phone Hill, the Note 10 is something else.\n\nIt\u2019s the phone that comes with a pen.", "description": "The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is the smaller of the two Note models released this year, which means there is a different set of expectations for what it can be.", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BowlZyfEgrktMFbuQ4-hr0tTac0=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19128982/akrales_190828_3620_0579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
