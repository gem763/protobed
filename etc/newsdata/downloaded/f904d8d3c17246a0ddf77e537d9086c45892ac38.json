Declining usage of traditional TV across every demographic, particularly among young viewers, has also demanded new solutions to the traditional distribution model that is pay-TV.\n\nAlthough streaming media bundles are still evolving, four distinct models have emerged:\n\nSkinny bundles \u2014 Cheaper, streaming versions of the traditional pay-TV bundle, but with fewer channels.\n\nSVOD aggregators \u2014 Facilitate a la carte sign-ups to third-party streaming services through a central user portal. The primary example so far is Amazon Channels, Amazon's SVOD partner program.\n\nSVOD integrations \u2014 SVOD services like Netflix that bring their offerings to a traditional operator's service.\n\nStreaming service partnerships \u2014 Combine one or more streaming services under a single offering, at a lower cost than the total price separately.", "description": "This research report from Business Insider Intelligence outlines how streaming services are converging under new content bundles, investigates the dynamics of the four distribution models that have emerged, and identifies strategies players can take to meet changing consumer behaviors.", "authors": ["Audrey Schomer"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bb77a069a4ab85d866f8629-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-05"}
