They talked and Halep handed out some sage advice: the 16-year-old Andreescu was already good enough for the professional tour and she should join it as soon as possible.\n\nOn Monday, in their first match at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen, the pair finally met as equals and grand slam champions and Halep, the Wimbledon champion, valiantly saved a match point and recovered from a set down to defeat Andreescu, the US Open champion, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3 in a dramatic battle.\n\nWomen\u2019s tennis takes victory lap in China despite troubling backdrop | Tumaini Carayol Read more\n\n\u201cIt was a very tough match,\u201d Halep said. \u201cI knew that she\u2019s a great player and she\u2019s playing till the end without giving up. I had to fight. I\u2019m a little bit dead but I have time tomorrow to recover. I\u2019m really happy I finally won a match [again] in the WTA Finals.\u201d\n\nHalep is Romania\u2019s most famous active athlete, while Andreescu\u2019s parents are both Romanian and she spent part of her youth there. The match had been long-awaited and duly delivered. The youngster started off fearlessly, dictating the rallies with her weight of shot and her arsenal \u2013 drop shots, slices and loopy balls. She took the first set 6-3.\n\nHalep fought back immediately, breaking first in a turbulent second set as Andreescu\u2019s unorthodox attack met Halep\u2019s resolute defence. At 6-5 in the second set, Andreescu seemed to be closing in on victory but Halep defended every strike then crushed a cross-court backhand to avert the danger.\n\nIn the tie-break Halep\u2019s defence triumphed as her ability to get one extra ball back forced Andreescu to aim for the lines. After saving two set points, Andreescu snapped a wild return long to push the match into a third set.\n\nBy that time Andreescu had undergone medical time-outs for a bleeding shin and aching back. Halep pounced, securing the vital break for 5-3 and serving out the victory.\n\n\u201cIn the second set, even if she was leading, I had a thought that I\u2019m stronger mentally. We had some long rallies and I won those balls,\u201d Halep said. \u201cThen I just didn\u2019t think about the result. I\u2019ve been focused on myself. I just had in my head what I have to play against her to be good.\u201d\n\nAndreescu no longer needs advice from her rivals but she learned plenty in Monday\u2019s battle as in their previous encounter. Many can outplay Halep for a set but the great challenge is enduring the long, grinding rallies against one of the fittest players in the world and surviving to win two of them.\n\nThe defending champion, Elina Svitolina, overcame a marathon first set to edge out Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (12), 6-4, her seventh straight victory at the WTA Finals. \u201cThere is always pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always have to be up there, always have to bring your best game. Until the last point is done, you have to fight for every single point, every single game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why round-robins are extremely tough, because you never know what\u2019s going to happen. You have to give everything each time you step on the court.\u201d", "description": "Simona Halep, the Wimbledon champion, valiantly saved a match point and recovered from a set down to defeat Bianca Andreescu in three sets at the WTA Finals", "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72427a10943c687fd93ace02ae792c341a6a6087/42_0_2899_1739/master/2899.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=baf6440c7403c5c5766b6dec9de8a1c5", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
