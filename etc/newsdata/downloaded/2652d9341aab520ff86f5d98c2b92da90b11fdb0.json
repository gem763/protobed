China approved such a drug for anemia last year.\n\nFor cancers, on the other hand, trials for drugs that interrupt this process and thus short-circuit tumors are now underway.\n\n\u2013 Basic research \u2013\n\nFor Kaelin, the breakthrough highlighted the importance of basic research \u2014 that is, work aimed at deepening understanding of natural phenomena and driven by scientists\u2019 curiosity.\n\n\u201cHere I am as a cancer biologist helping to contribute to a new drug for hematological condition, namely anemia,\u201d he said, adding he hoped to use his voice to advocate for sufficient funding for such science.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the way real science works, it doesn\u2019t work by putting blinders on people and trying to make believe they\u2019re working on an engineering problem when they\u2019re really working on a scientific problem.\u201d\n\nThat was echoed by Semenza, who told AFP: \u201cWe do know that a lot of the really novel discoveries in terms of therapies come from unexpected turns in projects that started in very basic research.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe made the discoveries when we were young, but we get recognized when we\u2019re old,\u201d the 63-year-old director of the Vascular Research Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering added.\n\nKaelin said he was accepting his prize partly on behalf of his late wife Carolyn, a breast cancer surgeon who died from a brain tumor in 2015.\n\nAfter she died, he thought winning the Nobel \u201cwould be just be too bittersweet and it would be too crushing\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m at a point now where I like to think she\u2019s smiling down and nodding and saying \u2018I told you, I told you this can happen.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 When US scientist William Kaelin\u2019s phone began ringing at 5:00 am, he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was dreaming: Winning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/42dac2_william-kaelin-it-lie-say-he-had-dreamt-winning-nobel-prize-but-you-try-not-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
