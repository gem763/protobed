One in ten adults now choose to live as unmarried couples rather than tie the knot.\n\nLast year 92,361 divorces were finalised in 2018, down from 103,366 in 2017, according to the tally from Office for National Statistics (ONS) records (file image)\n\nAnd those who do choose to get married are increasingly Britons from middle-class backgrounds, while working class and lower-paid couples typically shun marriage. Analysts say middle-income married couples are more likely to stick together because they tend to have shared property interests and realise the high emotional and economic cost of a break-up.\n\nThe figures from the Ministry of Justice show there were 92,361 divorces finalised in 2018, down from 103,366 the previous year. In 2003, 154,326 marriage splits were sealed in the courts.\n\nThe ministry said further falls in divorce numbers are likely, and that between April and June this year some 28,144 proceedings begun in the courts, down 13 per cent on the same period in 2018.\n\nThe official tally from Office for National Statistics (ONS) records show divorce numbers were last below 100,000 in 1971, when there were 74,437 marriage break-ups.\n\nAcademic Patricia Morgan, who specialises in family issues, says people are marrying later in life and it is becoming 'more middle-class' with a people tying the knot from high socio-economic backgrounds. Getting married is becoming more 'stable' (file image)\n\nAt the time, rates were shooting up following the liberalisation of divorce laws in 1969. That ushered in the \u2018quickie\u2019 divorce, in which couples could split in as little as six months. Divorce numbers trebled following the reforms, and reached a peak of 165,018 in 1993.\n\nMeanwhile, ONS analysis show divorce rates are falling faster than marriage rates. The unpopularity of marriage is such that fewer than half of all women \u2013 49.5 per cent \u2013 are now married.\n\nFive million Britons are in an unmarried cohabiting relationship. Those who do tie the knot are increasingly likely to be well-educated and to enjoy higher incomes. Academic Patricia Morgan, an author on family issues, said: \u2018It is true that there are not so many marriages now in the first place.\n\n\u2018But people are marrying a lot later in life, and they come from higher socio-economic backgrounds. They are less likely to divorce because they have more invested in the marriage. Marriage is becoming more stable as it becomes more middle class.\u2019\n\nThe fall in splits comes as fresh reforms of divorce law planned by Theresa May\u2019s government appear to have been dropped by Boris Johnson. Former justice secretary David Gauke wanted to introduce a regime of no-fault \u2018divorce on demand\u2019 which removed the grounds of adultery or unreasonable behaviour.", "description": "There were 92,361 divorces finalised in 2018, down from 103,366 in 2017 - making it the lowest level since marriage splits started to rise in the 1970s, figures from the Ministry of Justice show.", "authors": ["Steve Doughty Social Affairs Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/01/19320614-0-image-a-28_1570235803639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
