It\u2019s the perfect match with super high-rise jeans.\u201d\n\nHow do you recommend styling a denim jacket?\n\n\u201cNaturally, we love denim on denim when worn with the right attitude. There\u2019s an unexpected combination of irony and sophistication to this look: It\u2019s just \u2018Dad\u2019 enough to be cool and yet shows an appreciation for denim\u2019s workwear roots. Of course, denim jackets also go with just about everything else in the closet from the ubiquitous legging for women to chinos for guys. For fall, we are loving unexpected layers, such as denim jackets layered over trenches or tailored blazers.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with personalized denim jackets?\n\n\u201cThere are unlimited options in personalizing a denim jacket, from adding embroidery, pins and patches to ripping off waistbands and collars.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt denim jackets are here to stay, but if you\u2019re looking for the latest styles to stay on trend we\u2019ve rounded up a few of our favorites for you to shop.
