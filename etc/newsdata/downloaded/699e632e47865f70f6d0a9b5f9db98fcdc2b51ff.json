Doing so, the former students were told, would void their debt and prompt a refund on past payments.\n\nThe Education Department \u201ctakes responsibility\u201d for the violations of Kim\u2019s order, Charlie Merritt, a lawyer for the agency, told Kim. \u201cWe will bring ourselves into full compliance\u201d and make sure the agency \u201cstays that way going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nKim ordered both sides to file arguments this month to assist in her final ruling on whether DeVos is in contempt.\n\nIn 2017, a group of former Corinthian students sued the Education Department and DeVos over claims it had ceased granting the loan discharges. The case was brought as a class action on behalf of about 80,000 students.\n\nA report the department filed last month to show its compliance with the judge\u2019s order to cease debt collections instead explained that the agency has seized tax refunds and wages from at least 1,808 students. Almost two years later, the department still hasn\u2019t identified all the students in the lawsuit who are owed refunds, and has processed refunds for only 10 of them, according to a court filing.\n\nReacting to the findings, Kim on Monday lifted a pause on the lawsuit against DeVos, ordering it to move \u201cfull-steam ahead\u201d in tandem with a related suit filed by California despite the Education Department\u2019s pending appeal of her rulings in the litigation.\n\n\u201cWe think contempt is clear on the record presently before the court, and expect that the court will issue that finding, regardless of what sanctions are imposed,\" said Eileen Connor, legal director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University, which represents the students.\n\nThe cases are Manriquez v. DeVos, 17-cv-07210, and California v. U.S. Department of Education, 17-cv-07106, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joel Rosenblatt in San Francisco at jrosenblatt@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Peter Jeffrey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos faces potential sanctions or a finding she\u2019s in contempt of court for continuing to collect on the debt of former students at bankrupt Corinthian Colleges Inc., going so far as seizing their tax refunds and wages.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is contempt", "authors": ["Joel Rosenblatt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
