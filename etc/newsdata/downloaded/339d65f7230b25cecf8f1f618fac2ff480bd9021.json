Though the astounding gains it has made in the last handful of sessions are effectively intact \u2013 at present, anyway \u2013 the currency nevertheless stumbled out of the gate. Against and alike it sank 0.6%, taking it back under $1.271 and \u20ac1.151.\n\nWednesday might bring with it the latest UK inflation data \u2013 expected to nudge up from 1.7% to 1.8% month-on-month \u2013 but like with Tuesday\u2019s jobs figures, they might get lost in the fray as the pound prepares itself for the next Brexit steps.\n\nThe can\u2019t catch a break at the moment. Despite the pound opening in the red, the UK index was unable to avoid a fall of its own, even if its losses only amounted to 15 or so points. The overall mood on the markets was muted \u2013 the and slipped 0.2% and 0.4% respectively \u2013 in large part because of new tensions between the US and China just days after the announcement of a \u2018partial trade deal\u2019.\n\nLast night the House of Representatives passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, one that, if successful in the Senate, would see the US end its special trading status with Hong Kong if the city\u2019s authorities were deemed to have reached human rights and the rule of law. It is safe to say Beijing weren\u2019t best pleased with this development, warning it would take strong measures to retaliate.\n\n\"Disclaimer: Spreadex provides an execution only service and the comments above do not constitute (or should not be construed as constituting) investment advice or recommendations, or a record of our trading prices, or an offer of, or solicitation for, a transaction in any financial instrument.
