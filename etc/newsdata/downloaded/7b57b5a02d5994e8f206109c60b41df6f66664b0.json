It\u2019s like the menu at the Cheesecake Factory \u2013 there\u2019s too much to choose from.\u201d Kimmel then proceeded to compare each candidate to an item on the notoriously overstuffed Cheesecake Factory menu. Joe Biden is the old-fashioned burger, Elizabeth Warren the super antioxidant salad \u201cbecause it seems kinda good but also like it\u2019s trying a little bit too hard\u201d.\n\nTrevor Noah: Trump the 'only person who could make the Middle East more chaotic' Read more\n\nBernie is the chicken salad sandwich \u201call over your chin\u201d, while Mayor Pete is the children\u2019s brunch. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang are \u201cthe roadside sliders \u2013 they\u2019re always falling off their skateboards.\u201d Cory Booker is shrimp with angel hair, \u201chold the angel hair\u201d.\n\n\u201cAmy Klobuchar is Renee\u2019s Special because nobody knows who Renee is either,\u201d and Tulsi Gabbard is \u201cthe luau salad \u2013 Hawaiian and mostly nuts.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris is avocado toast \u2013 \u201cfrom California, and toast\u201d \u2013 and Juli\u00e1n Castro is \u201cthe baja chicken tacos, because he\u2019s mildly spicy and he\u2019s a twin, so you get two\u201d. Billionaire candidate Tom Steyer, in his first debate, is the impossible burger \u201cbecause those are his chances of winning\u201d.\n\nAnd all 12 candidates, despite their differences, are \u201ctrying to defeat the world famous pumpkin cheesecake, Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nOn the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also recapped the fourth Democratic debate, the first since the House launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump. While the impeachment drama was a point of agreement among the candidates, the dominant issue of healthcare \u2013 particularly whether government-run insurance should be an option or the only option \u2014 revealed divisions among the candidates.\n\n\u201cBut the thing that got the crowd going was when the OG of Medicare stepped into the game and showed everyone why they should put respect on his name,\u201d said Noah, referring to Senator Bernie Sanders, who characteristically railed against corporate healthcare. \u201cThe issue is whether the Democratic party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry which made $100bn in profit,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) The #DemDebate stage narrowed from 10 to\u2026 12 candidates? Trevor went LIVE to break it down: pic.twitter.com/2Fywe7uyfy\n\n\u201cYou cannot deny, no one speaks about healthcare with the passion that Bernie does,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI also have a suspicion that that\u2019s the same speech he gave every time the nurses try to give him pills.\u201d\n\nBecause the debate was in Ohio, a state ravaged by the opioid crisis, the moderators asked candidates about holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for their addictive drugs. Klobuchar came out particularly strong: \u201cThe people that should pay for this, the people who should pay for the treatment, are the very people who got people hooked and killed them in the first place, and that is the people who are manufacturing these opioids.\u201d\n\nNoah \u201c100%\u201d agreed with Klobuchar, he said. \u201cDrug companies should have to pay to rehabilitate all the people that they got addicted.\u201d\n\nBut he also joked it should go beyond drugs.\u201cIf you create something addictive, you should be responsible for making it harder to consume. Like Oreos \u2013 if they\u2019re going to make those cookies so goddamn addictive, the least they could do is like every fourth cookie put a mousetrap inside.\u201d\n\nAccording to Noah, the weirdest part of the night was \u201cwhen Kamala Harris started a real-life Twitter beef\u201d by criticizing Elizabeth Warren for not co-signing her pledge, via tweet, that Twitter should remove Donald Trump from the platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I kinda understand Warren\u2019s point here,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe need Trump on Twitter. It\u2019s the only way we can monitor what he\u2019s up to, otherwise he\u2019s doing that shit in secret. You\u2019ve gotta think of Twitter as a presidential baby monitor.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts recap fourth debate \u2013 the first since the impeachment inquiry \u2013 in which 12 candidates squared off in Ohio", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e81418ec13c4a386755e70cb60c2d0f1fc3ce1f3/259_23_1490_894/master/1490.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc330bb54bec78daadb84b4dc62c0c12", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
