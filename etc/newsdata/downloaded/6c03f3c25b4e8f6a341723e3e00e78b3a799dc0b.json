But now, people have more information from social media and other sources and so general public awareness has improved.\"\n\nParticipants at Mongolia's pride festival in 2015 [Gonto Erdeneburen/Al Jazeera]\n\nHate crimes\n\nThe LGBT Center, a Mongolian NGO, began training the police on hate crimes and the implications of the 2017 criminal code after they failed to take action against an officer who assaulted a detained transgender woman.\n\nThey have since trained more than 500 police officers, prosecutors, and judges.\n\nMongolia\u2019s police also have criteria for dealing with transgender individuals: When they are held in police custody, transgender people must be treated and categorised according to the gender that they identify as, regardless of what is written on their state-issued documentation.\n\n\"Compared with 2017, I see an improvement, especially from the Crime and Investigation Division,\" said Baldangombo Altangerel, the LGBT Center\u2019s legal director who was responsible for overseeing the police training programme.\n\nFollowing the attack on the woman last month, the Human Rights Commission of Mongolia sent a formal request to the police to investigate Bosoo Khukh Mongol\u2019s actions under the new criminal code.\n\nMongolian police told Al Jazeera that they were currently investigating the case as a hate crime and, in late September, they brought formal charges against Bosoo Khukh Mongol leader, Gankhuyag Ganzorig. They have not taken action against the TV station.\n\nThe woman, who prefers to remain anonymous, has given two statements to the police and is being treated as a victim. That is also progress - historically, rape and sexual violence against Mongolia\u2019s LGBT population have not been prosecuted.\n\nWhile the LGBT Center is waiting for the outcome of the case, they\u2019ve been surprised by public reaction to the incident.\n\nGrowing support\n\nKenna, the Youth Programme Manager for the LGBT Center said people had posted messages of support on its social media page.\n\n\"I\u2019ve noticed that people speaking up for LGBT rights has increased,\" Kenna explains, \"People are starting to know about the criminal code, anti-discrimination.\"\n\nIn October 2018, Kenna launched the Mongolian Queer Podcast.\n\nThe podcast recently completed its third season, focussing less on discrimination and more on providing advice and support, profiling those who are already out and proud.\n\nThe podcast hosts also interview people who are not LGBT to show their listeners that acceptance can happen. To date, the podcast, which is only available in the Mongolian language, has nearly 60,000 unique listeners - significant in a country with a population of only 3.1 million.\n\nThat public opinion is changing is clear not only online, but in real life too.\n\nIn 2014, Mongolia held its first pride parade with only fifteen people.\n\nParticipation has grown every year since and this August, an estimated 250 took part.\n\nAt the weekend in the capital Ulaanbaatar, D.D./H.Z., Mongolia\u2019s first gay bar, is heaving. Zorig Alima, the bar\u2019s owner, says that since the implementation of the criminal code, police raids, which used to happen regularly, have stopped.\n\nAnd D.D./H.Z is no longer the only bar in town. In recent years, as many as four new places have opened for business.\n\nBut while Mongolia\u2019s new criminal code has given gender and sexual minorities more protection from hate crimes, Baldangombo says more needs to be done to help them integrate into society.\n\nThe statue of Genghis Khan in Ulaan Baatar.

Rentsendorj/Reuters]\n\nDiscrimination\n\nA report from the United Nations Development Programme in 2014 found that a Mongolian from a gender or sexual minority was more likely to be unemployed than the average person. It also found that an LGBT person's perceived risk of falling into poverty doubled when they lived openly.\n\nThe situation is even more difficult for Mongolia\u2019s transgender population because they can only change their gender on state-issued identification documents after undergoing full gender reassignment surgery, which is not available in the country. As a result, when they submit their paperwork for employment, they expose themselves to the risk of discrimination.\n\nUnable to access formal employment, many transgender people go into sex work - illegal in Mongolia - in order to survive, exposing themselves to the risk of arrest and harassment.\n\nMarta Sukh-Ochir, a transgender woman who once worked alongside the woman questioned by Bosoo Khukh Mongol, told Al Jazeera she took up sex work when her family kicked her out and she couldn\u2019t afford food or a home.\n\n\"I actively looked for other jobs, cashier at a supermarket, receptionist at a hotel, shop assistant...I tried many times, she said. I applied to so many jobs. My gender expression, my appearance - how I looked with long hair, nails, being and acting feminine - was a struggle for employers.\"\n\nSukh-Ochir fled Mongolia as a refugee but, in light of the recent Bosoo Khukh Mongol threats, she worries for the safety of her friend and transgender people back in her homeland.\n\nWhile life is gradually improving for Mongolia's LGBT community, it is still a struggle.\n\n\"It\u2019s a street life,\" Sukh-Ochir said. \"It\u2019s not safe.\"", "description": "Police bring charges against far-right group after attack on transgender sex worker investigated as a hate crime.", "authors": ["Aubrey Menarndt", "Khaliun Bayarsogt"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/581647c8f8804c13a58a611c6b1847ab_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
