It was a conscious, concerted statement of our imperfection,\" Weiss joked.\n\nIn all seriousness though, it was a mistake that Benioff admitted embarrassed the pair.\n\n\"We were concentrating so much on Daenerys and Jon Snow that we just didn't see this coffee cup right in the middle.\n\n\"At first I couldn't believe it and then it was embarrassment, because how did we not see this coffee cup in the middle of the shot?\n\n\"Eventually it was just kind of funny. Because this one is just a mistake and it's just kind of funny to us now.\"\n\nWeiss called it \"surprising\" the final season received so many Emmy nominations - a record-breaking 32.\n\n\"I thought (season seven) would have been the peak,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just a great excuse for everyone to get drunk again,\" Benioff added.\n\nOne of the actors up for an Emmy - Gwendoline Christie who played Ser Brienne of Tarth - had to nominate herself for the award despite having one of Benioff's favourite moments in season eight.\n\n\"Brienne of Tarth has always been one of our favourite characters and the moment where she is knighted by Jamie Lannister is just a wonderful thing in the story.\n\n\"To see Gwyn's face in that moment - I've probably watched that scene 400 times and every time it gets me.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The makers of the hit TV series speak for the first time about the show's final season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/039F/production/_108572900_coffee.jpg"}
