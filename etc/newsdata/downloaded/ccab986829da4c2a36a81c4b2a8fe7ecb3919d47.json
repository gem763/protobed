Congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one show on Cable Television,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nTelevision ratings released this week by Nielsen placed Fox News as the top cable network in terms of primetime viewers, with Mr. Hannity\u2019s program ranking first in its time slot for the fifth month in a row.\n\nUsually supportive of the right-leaning TV network, Mr. Trump repeatedly attacked Fox News and several of its host this week on social media and during interviews.\n\n\u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Wednesday. \u201cFox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy with Fox,\u201d the president added during an interview Thursday, making an exception to note that several hosts of popular, pro-Trump opinion programs aired by the network \u2014 namely Mr. Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson \u2014 have been \u201creally good\u201d for him.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweets about Fox were met with pushback from network personalities like Brit Hume and Neil Cavuto.\n\n\u201cI think the president watches Fox. I also think he\u2019s getting sick of Fox, which is weird because I think he gets pretty fair coverage on Fox, but the president making clear to fact-check him is to be all but dead to him and his legion of supporters, who let me know, in no uncertain terms, I am either with him totally or I am a never-Trumper fully,\u201d said Mr. Cavuto in the closing segment of his Thursday afternoon program.\n\nMr. Hannity, 57, has unabashedly praised Mr. Trump on-air and has previously claimed to be the president\u2019s biggest fan at Fox News.\n\n\u201cI am the only one that is as strongly supportive of the president, of anyone else at Fox. I think that\u2019s a fair statement,\u201d Mr. Hannity said in 2017.\n\n\u201cHannity\u201d was the most-watched program on cable news in August, followed in second and third place by \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d respectively, according to the latest Nielsen ratings.\n\nRecent polling indicates Americans have varying opinions about the network\u2019s legitimacy, however. The results of a survey released Wednesday ranked Fox News first as being both the most and least trusted TV news or commentary source among U.S. voters surveyed recently.\n\nA study released in May by Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, found that Mr. Trump granted 11 out of 12 of his previous interviews to either Fox News of Fox Business hosts.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Trump said Thursday that he thought he would be considered \u201cdisloyal\u201d by his supporters if he sat down for an interview with the network\u2019s top cable news competitor, CNN.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
