Not that there\u2019s all that much reason to buy it over the already excellent OnePlus 7T; it\u2019s basically a slightly different design with a better telephoto lens and slightly beefier specs.\n\nBut it turns out the device is coming to the US after all \u2013 and with 5G to boot. The company is partnering with T-Mobile to release a variant of the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition with 5G in the US. The McLaren Edition of the Pro comes with a massive 12GB of RAM instead of the 8GB in the regular Pro and 7T. It also has a snazzy orange and black design matching the McLaren brand.\n\nUnfortunately, the companies haven\u2019t revealed much else. Pricing and availability will be revealed \u201clater this year.\u201d Maybe that\u2019ll give T-Mobile some time to roll out 5G a little more widely; it\u2019s currently only available in a few pockets of select cities.
