They are a really good side who put a lot of points on Russia and didn\u2019t concede a try. So we\u2019re very aware of the threat they have.\n\n\u201cYou see Japan beating Ireland and it reminds you that anyone can beat anyone.\u201d\n\nThe hosts lit a fire under the fight for the last eight as they slayed the Irish in Yokohama.\n\nIt was the Brave Blossoms\u2019 second giant-killing act in as many tournaments following on from their famous 2015 victory over South Africa.\n\nThe consequences could yet be dire for the Scots \u2013 who remain pointless after being well beaten by Ireland in their opener \u2013 if Japan go on to deny them a place in the knockout rounds, but McInally confessed part of him was pleased to see their group rivals take down the world\u2019s second best side.\n\n\u201cI was very impressed by the Japanese side, I thought they played exceptionally well and deserved to win,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a disappointing result for Scotland but it was great to see what it did for Japan, and to see how much it means to the country as a whole as obviously they\u2019ve put a lot into the World Cup.\n\n\u201cBut I feel that nothing changes for us. The task is still the same. It may be a little harder in terms of needing bonus points now, but ultimately we\u2019re just going to need to win all of our games to get out of the pool.\n\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have changed whether we\u2019d beaten Ireland or not, we still need to win all our games because you don\u2019t know what else is going to happen. Nothing changes for us as a group.\u201d\n\nTownsend\u2019s team got their first look at the 30,000-seater arena that will stage their second match during Sunday\u2019s captain\u2019s run.\n\nTournament rules mean the venue\u2019s retractable roof will remain closed and McInally is bracing himself the action to get hot and humid.\n\n\u201cThe fact it\u2019s an indoor stadium keeps the heat and the moisture in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do too much running around in the team run just to save the legs and we were definitely sweating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another challenge. The pitch and the conditions are the same for both teams. We just can\u2019t wait to get out there.\u201d", "description": "Stuart McInally has warned Scotland they will be putting their Rugby World Cup hopes at risk if they embark on a wild bonus-point chase against Samoa.
