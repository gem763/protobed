If we plant trees, they suck carbon dioxide in. They don\u2019t deal with the whole problem but they are a contributor to the (solution).\n\n\u2018I think it forces us to think about the land and the way we use it and of course about the broader issue.\u2019\n\nMr Miliband talks to XR activist Matthew Shribman (Picture: Harrison Jones)\n\nThe \u2018Reforest Earth\u2019 initiative handed out trees to hundreds of MPs (Picture: Harrison Jones)\n\nActivists say planting one million trees would only counteract the last five minutes of global emissions \u2013 and are urging governments to plant more.\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and former Liberal Democrat leaders Vince Cable and Tim Farron all collected trees, as well as representatives for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nBut in a thinly veiled swipe at Mr Johnson, following his comments about XR protesters, Mr Miliband continued: \u2018I am not in the uncooperative crusties\u2019 camp, I think politicians who are failing to deal with the climate emergency should be careful about what they say. These are decent people who are trying to draw attention to this.\u2019\n\n(XR) protesters, who have camped out in Westminster, are urging the government to \u2018tell the truth\u2019 on the climate crisis (Picture: PA Wire)\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s father Stanley said earlier this week that he is proud to be an \u2018uncooperative crusty\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtesters from XR have caused major disruption in London since Monday, as part of a global plan to draw attention to global heating through a fortnight of action.\n\nMr Miliband conceded that many did not agree with the tactics but said \u2018most people recognise the aims\u2019 as being important.\n\nBus driver praised after taking detour to help 'sobbing' little girl get home\n\nHe appeared to back the group\u2019s methods, explaining: \u2018I think it is incredibly important it is nonviolent. There is a tradition of civil disobedience in this country.\n\n\u2018XR hopefully are being careful about who they disrupt and how they cause disruption. It is not all the time, it has been every so often. Of course, for those people whose lives and work have been disrupted I am incredibly sympathetic but I think (XR) are trying to draw attention to an incredibly important issue.\u2019\n\nThough the group have faced criticism, the \u2018Reforest Earth\u2019 initiative of distributing trees has won praise, particularly from MPs.\n\nOne organiser, XR activist and scientist Matthew Shribman, said: \u2018The government need to be talking about billions of trees.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018We have been getting literally hundreds of MPs coming down to collect their trees (and) having really good conversations with everyone about how we need to massively accelerate our tree planting and radically reforest this country.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists suggest planting roughly a trillion trees would absorb the last 10 years\u2019 worth of global emissions, while the UK government has committed to plant 11 million new trees by 2022 \u2013 roughly a 0.5% increase in coverage.\n\nMr Miliband said the combination of XR and the school climate strikes had \u2018changed the conversation\u2019 and forced \u2018the climate emergency into the political conversation\u2019 at a time when Brexit seems to be the only topic attracting interest.\n\nHe urged politicians to \u2018do more\u2026 a lot more, with much greater urgency and (on a) much greater scale\u2019 over climate.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
