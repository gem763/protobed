Biegun.\n\nSaturday\u2019s stalled talks in Sweden marked the first time the two sides have engaged in in-depth working-level talks since negotiations broke down in February during at a second summit between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nThe Hanoi talks collapsed over Mr. Kim\u2019s demand that the U.S. deliver sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a partial dismantling of his nuclear arsenal. The North Korean leader\u2019s posture at the time was widely seen to be a response to an apparent all-or-nothing offer put forward by the American side in Hanoi.\n\nThis round, U.S. officials said they \u201cpreviewed a number of new initiatives,\u201d and explained the goal was to \u201cmake progress\u201d on the basic agreement reached in Singapore last year between President Trump and Mr. Kim to pursue denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAnalysts have said the U.S. officers were likely to embrace more of a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach at this weekend\u2019s working-level talks and see what the North Korean side brought to the table in response.\n\nBut the North\u2019s negotiator claimed that the talks \u201cdid not live up to our expectations and broke down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very displeased,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cIt is entirely because the U.S. has not discarded its old stance and attitude that the negotiation this time failed to produce any results.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea later claimed the U.S. is \u201cspreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet after two weeks.\u201d\n\nPyongyang has since declared that the ball is in \u201cWashington\u2019s court,\u201d Reuters reported, and gave an end of the year deadline for the U.S. to propose a different plan.\n\nThe State Department has indicated that it seeks to hold another round of talks in Stockholm later this month and vowed its commitment to diplomacy and future negotiations.\n\nThe two countries will not \u201covercome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula through the course of a single Saturday,\u201d the State Department said. The negotiations \u201crequire a strong commitment by both countries,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cthe United States has that commitment.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Guy Taylor contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
