Recession fears continued to bubble up on Tuesday, when the ISM September Manufacturing Index slipped to 47.8, a 1.3 percentage point drop from August \u2014 a concerning occurrence, Trahan said, because ISM falling below 50 has been synonymous with S&P 500 earnings growth turning negative.\n\nDespite the darkening economic outlook, consumer confidence has remained persistently high.
