USA TODAY\n\nThe competition is about to ramp up for the front-runners in the race for college football\u2019s most prestigious individual award. But for now, the field is headed by three prolific quarterbacks followed by a few potential challengers as the season nears the midpoint. Oklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts continues to lead the USA TODAY Sports Network Heisman survey followed by his former Alabama teammate Tua Tagovailoa and LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow.\n\nIn the weekly survey of 21 official Heisman voters who work for USA TODAY Network properties, Hurts holds an 11-point advantage this week after a 14-point edge last week. He received 14 first-place votes and named on all but one of the ballots heading into the Sooners\u2019 annual Red River showdown with Texas.\n\nOklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts jumps over Texas Tech defensive back Thomas Leggett during the second quarter at Gaylord Family - Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.

Up next for the Tigers is a home date with Florida, with dates with Auburn and Alabama looming down the pike.\n\nOnly three other players earned mentions this week.
