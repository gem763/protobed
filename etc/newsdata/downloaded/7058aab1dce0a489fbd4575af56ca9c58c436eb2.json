O'Rourke scrambles Dems' gun message", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Beto O'Rourke's \"hell yes\" moment at the Democrats' presidential debate is scrambling his party's message on guns.\n\nThe Democrats have long contended their support of gun control laws does not mean they want to take away law-abiding citizens' firearms. But on Friday, they struggled to square that message with their presidential contender's full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles.\n\n\"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we're not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,\" the former Texas congressman declared during Thursday night's debate.\n\nO'Rourke's hometown of El Paso was the site of a mass shooting last month that killed 22 people, and he has put the issue of gun violence at the center of his campaign effort. On Friday, his campaign hawked T-shirts emblazoned with his debate vow.\n\nHowever, some fellow Democrats chastised him and fretted that his remarks may have made things harder for gun control supporters as they negotiate with President Donald Trump on legislation to respond to this summer's mass shootings.\n\n\"I frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\" Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware told CNN Friday. \"I don't think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks. We need to focus on what we can get done.\"\n\nHis fears about new rages against gun control supporters seem sure to be borne out.\n\n\"This is what their goal is. We've always said it, now they're saying it,\" said Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation, based in Washington state. \"Now they've said it and we're going to make them eat it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Coons is working with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on a measure to require that law enforcement officials be notified when someone fails a gun-purchase background check. Toomey, who is also working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the firearms issue, agreed that O'Rourke's comments could backfire.\n\n\"This rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks,\" he said.\n\nO'Rourke was less provocative in his language but still determined Friday.\n\n\"Much respect to Sen. Coons for leading the fight on background checks,\" he tweeted. \"But the time for letting status quo politics determine how far we can go is over. If we agree that having millions of weapons of war on the streets is a bad idea, we have to do something about it.\"\n\nOne worry among Democrats is that calling for outright confiscation plays into claims by Trump and other Republicans that Democrats are coming for people's firearms.\n\nOn Thursday night, just as O'Rourke made his call to take back the rifles, Trump warned at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, \"Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they are totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house.\"\n\nRepublicans, Trump promised, \"will forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\" That line got huge applause at the GOP retreat, and again Friday when it was repeated there by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nBy all accounts, Trump needs to run up the score in rural areas to win reelection next year. The 2020 outcome is expected to depend heavily on a trio of Rust Belt states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 that have large numbers of rural voters, many of whom are gun-owners or sympathetic to owners on this issue. And Democrats' hope of winning control of the Senate rests on states with high rates of gun ownership, like Arizona and Texas.\n\nSeveral gun control groups stressed Friday that they were not advocating confiscation, but they also didn't follow Coons' lead in condemning O'Rourke's declaration.\n\n\"I think it is very understandable that he is taking a policy position that the larger gun safety community hasn't taken and he's trying to push the envelope,\" said Robin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, the gun control group named after Gabby Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head in 2011. \"If the American voter does not think this is an appropriate solution, they'll let us know.\"", "description": "Beto O'Rourke's \"hell yes\" moment at the Democrats' presidential debate is scrambling his party's message on guns.
