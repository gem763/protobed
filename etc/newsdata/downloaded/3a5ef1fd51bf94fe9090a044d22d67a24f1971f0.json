And by all scientific predictions, it\u2019s looking to the world of science that people, gasp, are going to continue to die.\n\nGood God man, somebody grab a pen. Somebody grab a cellphone. There\u2019re regulations to write and taxes to impose.\n\nYou know what they say: Save a fish. Save a human.\n\n\u201cGlobal warming has already reached 1 [degrees Celsius] above the pre-industrial level, due to past and current greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d the IPCC said in a statement accompanying the report, as Fox News noted. \u201cThere is overwhelming evidence that this is resulting in profound consequences for ecosystems and people. The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea level rise, and coastal extreme events are becoming more severe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to take this stuff seriously because the alarmist wing of the environmental movement has been wrong on so many \u2014 read: all \u2014 previous occasions.\n\nGlobal cooling didn\u2019t kill off humanity.\n\nAcid rain didn\u2019t kill off humanity.\n\nAerosol hairspray containers didn\u2019t kill off humanity.\n\nHumans are either an extraordinarily hardy bunch \u2014 or environmentalists are off their rocker. And with pinheads like socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York leading the charge, it\u2019s not difficult to decide which of those statements strike as truest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like, the world is going to end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change,\u201d she said in January.\n\n\u201cClimate change is here + we\u2019ve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half,\u201d she said in April.\n\nAnd guess where she gets those startling-albeit-stupid predictions?\n\nDa da dum, drumroll please: the United Nations. The batch of IPCCers calling themselves scientists at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble and that means we\u2019re all in big trouble, too,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, the Associated Press reported.\n\nDidn\u2019t we already go through with former Vice President Al Gore and his posed polar bears atop a broken-off glacier, looking dejectedly at the water \u2018cause, you know, they feared drowning?\n\nAgain, it\u2019s so hard to take these climate predictions with any ounce of seriousness. They keep recycling, only louder, with scarier deadlines for death.\n\nAnd always, always with the common message from the United Nations: Give us your sovereignty and your money, and we can save the world. Today\u2019s oceans, tomorrow\u2019s rainforests, next week\u2019s factory pollutants. It\u2019s all, and always, the same.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
