But when the court\u2019s founding document, known as the Rome Statute, went into force in 2002, language that would have criminalized large-scale environmental destruction had been stripped out at the insistence of major oil producing nations.\n\nIn 2016, the court\u2019s top prosecutor signaled an interest in prioritizing cases within its jurisdiction that featured the \u201cdestruction of the environment, the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land.\u201d\n\nThat move came as activists seeking to criminalize ecocide had been laying the groundwork for a landmark change to the court\u2019s remit. Their plan is to get a state that is party to the Rome Statute \u2014 or a coalition of them \u2014 to propose an amendment to its charter establishing ecocide as a crime against peace. At least two-thirds of the countries that are signatories to the Rome Statute would have to back the initiative to outlaw ecocide for the court to get an expanded mandate, and even then it would only apply to countries that accept the amendment. Still, it could change the way the world thinks about environmental destruction.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ernesto Londo\u00f1o", "Nytimes.Com Sunday-Review Bolsonaro-Amazon-Fire.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
