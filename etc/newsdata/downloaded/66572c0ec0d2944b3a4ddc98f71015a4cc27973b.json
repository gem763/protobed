Was it simply the crooked former Ukrainian prosecutor general, who was spinning a fever-swamp conspiracy that Joe Biden was somehow out to get him? Was it Dmitro Firtash, the Ukrainian oligarch\u2014and \u201cupper-echelon [associate] of Russian organized crime,\u201d per the DOJ\u2014awaiting extradition to the U.S., who just so happened to be in the same orbit as those aiding Giuliani in Ukraine? Or was it someone else?\n\nAnswers to these questions have yet to emerge. Nevertheless, one thing is crystal clear: Any one of those instances, any of these concentric circles of crooked dealings, should have cajoled Giuliani into registering with FARA. Moreover, Giuliani\u2019s defense that he\u2019s simply a lawyer, and thus eligible for an exemption from FARA registration, isn\u2019t nearly sufficient.\n\n\u201cGiuliani\u2019s defense has been that\u2026he was acting at the behest of the president,\u201d Joshua Ian Rosenstein, a partner at Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock P.C., which specializes in lobbying compliance, tells The New Republic. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say about that. I think it\u2019s sort of astonishing, in a way, that we have sort of an unauthorized [person], not even a special government employee, who\u2019s conducting diplomacy\u2026 Just saying you\u2019re not a lobbyist ain\u2019t gonna cut it.\u201d\n\nGiuliani doesn\u2019t actually appear to have a good grasp on what FARA registration entails, including who is eligible for the exemptions from registering. (This is a man, after all, who recently said that he \u201cexpected to be a hero like in a Tom Hanks movie\u201d for his recent actions.) There is a FARA exemption for lawyers\u2014but it applies only to their actions within the confines of the courtroom, not for those who litigate from the cable news green room, or who worm their way into president\u2019s confidences.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve explained it to friends is that despite being a lawyer, I don\u2019t think Giuliani actually understands this law,\u201d Freeman added. \u201cThe [FARA] statute is really not that long. I think you could take any law student in America, and have them quickly read through that statute, and then evaluate Giuliani\u2019s behavior. And I would be very surprised if that law student wasn\u2019t very concerned that Giuliani was not violating this law.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, one other intriguing possibility for Giuliani: a national security exemption. In any other timeline, and under any other administration, the possibility that Giuliani would receive a national security exemption\u2014which would require the consent of the president, the secretary of state, and the attorney general\u2014could be safely ignored. But here, under the first American president who has ever pressured a foreign government to investigate a political rival, anything is up for grabs.\n\nThat ship may have already sailed for Giuliani. Federal prosecutors have already begun probing Giuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine\u2014specifically, whether he\u2019d failed to register his work with Parnas and Fruman, the two goons charged with FEC violations, with FARA. One possibility is that Giuliani \u201cwas actually representing these two individuals sort of as conduits for some foreign source of money, and making arrangements for them, for example, to participate in the political process\u2014which as we know was an FEC violation,\u201d Rosenstein says. \u201cBut if he knowingly facilitated an FEC violation, that\u2019s problem number one. Problem number two is that\u2019s pretty clearly a FARA violation, also.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s double-dealings\u2014and the lengths he\u2019s already gone to undercut American interests\u2014have presented an unparalleled chapter in FARA\u2019s checkered history. The lack of FARA enforcement in the decades leading up to Trump\u2019s election, after all, allowed Manafort to gobble up piles of cash from the world\u2019s most heinous autocrats, and, eventually, Trump.\n\nFor decades, FARA was closer to farce than any kind of force.\n\nFor decades, FARA was closer to farce than any kind of force. As an amazed Ken Silverstein explained in Politico back in October of 2017, in the twenty years prior to Manafort getting busted on a FARA violation, he\u2019d only seen \u201ca handful of cases brought against people\u201d who violated FARA. \u201cLike dozens of other influence peddlers,\u201d he wrote, Manafort had been \u201coperating in plain sight for years.\u201d It was as if FARA was a frivolous suggestion, not a serious rule. (There\u2019s a reason my wife and I chose \u201c#reformFARA\u201d for our wedding hashtag a few years ago.)\n\nMore recently, however, FARA\u2019s seen new life in the form of a brand new task force and a shiny new set of advisory opinions outlining just who needs to register. For the cops on this beat, there\u2019s been a renewed sense of purpose. Against that backdrop, it\u2019s been a maddening perplexity that Giuliani has not found himself in the regulatory crosshairs. He has served only as the ne plus ultra as to how FARA remains essential to our democracy\u2014and how it applies to all who come, regardless of ties to a president, or to a fellow conspirator-in-chief.\n\nStill, it is possible that the veil will be lifted in the days to come. \u201cI fully expect that in the not-too-distant future we\u2019ll get an indictment for Parnas and Fruman for FARA violations,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cAnd on the DOJ front with Giuliani\u2014again, I fully expect that, once their investigation is concluded, you\u2019ll see an indictment of Giuliani for FARA violations, too.\u201d", "description": "It's a genuine mystery how the president's aide-de-camp has avoided Paul Manafort's fate.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/433501b7b9f3ce46e59c2452ace70af0d225ab03.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
