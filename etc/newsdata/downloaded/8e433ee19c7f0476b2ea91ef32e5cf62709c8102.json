Here comes another.\n\n\u201cWho would ever want to marry you?\u201d\n\nIs she done? I wanted to flee. Oh no, she\u2019s got help.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s Shamu. Shamu, the whale,\u201d my brother said, cackling.\n\nThe insults and criticisms kept coming. Mom led the way and the rest of my family followed. As I wore my scapegoat hat, their bullying continued for decades and my fighting back did, too. Although I had career success and received awards along the way, underneath it I was seething with anger and resentment. And that affected all aspects of my life.\n\nLittle did I know that the obstacles I faced in my childhood would end up being the biggest opportunity of my life. By facing those challenges, I figured out the secret to finding forgiveness and the power and freedom it gives you.\n\nForgiveness takes commitment and work\n\n\u201cSometimes what seems to be a big tragedy turns out to become the greatest good in our lives,\u201d writes Louise Hay, author of \u201cYou Can Heal Your Life.\u201d\n\nToday, my mother \u2014 the woman I wished would die during my childhood \u2014 is my closest friend. We speak daily and travel the world together.\n\nAlso read: This 29-year-old woman lost her job and is looking for healthy \u2018poor people meals\u2019\n\nToday, my mother \u2014 the woman I wished would die during my childhood \u2014 is my closest friend.\n\nThink about your life. Who hurt you so much you have not been able to forgive them? In some cases, the incidents occurred so long ago that you don\u2019t even connect the trauma you suffered as a child to your current problems, such as autoimmune illnesses, stomach issues or asthma.\n\nFamily and friends from my youth who observed my relationship with my mother marvel at the transformation. It took commitment and work.\n\nThese are the five steps I took to finding forgiveness:\n\n1. Create a support system\n\nWe all need a team. Create a support system, which consists of friends, co-workers, spiritual leaders, therapists and support groups. Pets are a great source of comfort. Meetup groups are a great way to find others with shared interests. Surround yourself with positive people and remove those who bring you down. Choose people you can share your story with \u2014 people who have emotional intelligence and empathy. Holding it in, keeping it a secret, creates shame and grows inside us, which can make us sick.\n\n2. Understand your abuser\n\nLearn about your abuser\u2019s past. What did the person go through? I learned about my mother\u2019s pain, the untimely death of her baby sister, the financial hardships, her father\u2019s suicide attempts and the childhood she never really had. Invariably, anyone who is abusive to others (unless they suffer from a serious mental illness) is often a victim of trauma. Hurt people hurt people.\n\nRead: Suicide rate among young Americans soars by more than 50% over 10 years\n\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu, who won The Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in ending apartheid, said, \u201cHealing comes through understanding\u2026No one is born a liar or a rapist or a terrorist\u2026but in any given day\u2026we can easily be hurt and broken, and it\u2019s good to remember that we can just as easily be the ones who have done the hurting and breaking.\u201d\n\n3. Reframe\n\nNow that you understand that your abuser was damaged, reframe how you look at the person. A lightbulb moment for me was when I played a psychological board game in a group. I threw the dice and when it landed, the facilitator asked me to stand, close my eyes and think of my mother as a little girl.\n\nAt that point, I knew about her childhood and saw a little wounded girl. Then, she instructed me to imagine myself as a little girl. I knew that I was a wounded little girl, too. Next, the facilitator said: \u201cYou both come together.\u201d Wow! My mother was no longer my mother. We were both wounded little girls.\n\n4. Forgive\n\nAfter learning about the tragedies in my mother\u2019s life, I was able to feel compassion for her. I realized that she was doing the best she could and was able to forgive her.\n\nSee: My mother stole my identity and racked up $500,000 in debt\n\nDo not wait for the individual to acknowledge or apologize for what he or she did to you before you forgive the person. In many cases, the abusers won\u2019t do either and will deny ever doing anything wrong. They are often clueless.\n\nForgiveness is a virtue based on the ability to love when others are not loving you.\n\nYou forgive for yourself. No one else. Forgiving does not mean we are condoning behavior. It doesn\u2019t mean we necessarily want to have a relationship with the abusers.\n\nForgiving doesn\u2019t mean we forget. We never forget. It means we want to heal ourselves and set ourselves free. Free from the negativity, the depression, aggression, anger and resentment.\n\n5. Change your behavior\n\n\u201cWhen we blame another, we give our power away because we\u2019re placing the responsibility for our feelings on someone else,\u201d Louise Hay writes. \u201cPeople in our lives may behave in ways that trigger uncomfortable responses in us. However, they didn\u2019t get into our minds and create the buttons that have been pushed.\u201d\n\nOur brain is our most powerful organ. If we change our thoughts, we change our reactions, and in turn we change our life.\n\nWhat gets us so upset are our unfulfilled expectations. As soon as I reframed how I looked at my mother, I changed my expectations. I no longer saw my mother as the person who should love, adore and nurture me, but as a child who was in pain herself and craved love.\n\nAs I took my power back, her insults eventually had no impact on me. And as she saw that, they eventually stopped. In time, I got to a place where I was able to start giving her love.\n\nBy showing kindness, compassion and love to someone you can actually transform them.\n\nThe benefits of forgiveness\n\nThere has been much research on the benefits of forgiveness. According to The Mayo Clinic, \u201cIf you don\u2019t practice forgiveness, you might be the one who pays dearly. By embracing forgiveness, you can also embrace, peace, hope, gratitude and joy.\u201d\n\nHanging onto anger puts you into a fight or flight mode, which affects your blood pressure and immune system, and increases the risk of depression, heart disease and much more.\n\nRobert Enright, a pioneer in the field of forgiveness, points out, \u201cResentment can last so long that it can be passed to the next generation. Forgiveness, if we choose it, can be a way of leaving love, rather than anger, to our children.\u201d\n\nWe all have a story. And we all have the power to forgive. It\u2019s our choice.\n\nI chose to be the hero of my story, not the victim.", "description": "Hanging onto anger puts you into a fight or flight mode, and it\u2019s really not good for you.", "authors": ["Gayle Kirschenbaum"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT457_na_rev_ZG_20191016171201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
