The plan is to now to tidy everything up.\n\n\"My pet peeve would be we buy all this great technology and we don't use anything of it,\" he said, noting the plan with Mulesoft as a partner is to determine how MLC can get more value from its software stack.\n\n\"We're doing it right now to get the delivery done, but it's that next stage where we are really working with Mulesoft ... assessing what we've got, doing maturity assessments, and helping us pave that roadmap ahead.\"\n\nWhile the transition has been full-steam ahead, Chandran said a priority for MLC has been business and IT alignment. As such, business engagement has been one of the five pillars for its technology strategy.\n\n\"One of the biggest and most important themes is business engagement. The organisation has been on a delivery journey -- let's just get these things in and get the data out of NAB and into future MLC -- now it's actually about all the assets that we've got in place, we've got to really leverage that,\" he explained.\n\n\"Business engagement for us is about explaining and working with the business, explaining the value of technology and value of the assets we have to them, but also likewise understanding what the journey they want to get onto, and starting to prepare for that.\"\n\nChandran called it a balancing act. The danger, he said, is if the people don't understand why something is changing, the journey could fall apart very quickly.\n\n\"Because sometimes you have execs up there, or business people out there getting onto buzzwords ... and trying to say, 'Let's just get on and do that', but also sometimes you've got to pare that back and explain to them that it's a journey that they need to get onto as well ... whether it's through CX, automation, AI -- all these other things -- we need to explain to them and get them excited to some extent,\" he continued.\n\nSee also: How AI may help solve banks' customer relationship issues (TechRepublic)\n\nTouching on a product launch MLC had embarked on a little over a year ago, Chandran said such a process isn't usually easy, even with a good technology partner in tow.\n\n\"We had an interesting scenario about 12 months ago where due to certain market conditions, a particular product of ours was not going to be sold, which had a huge impact on our balance sheet,\" he explained.\n\n\"What actually happened then, in the midst of transitioning all of our technology and building all these new platforms, we also had to find a way to launch this product a different way, but using these new systems that we hadn't finished building yet ... we actually launched in a very compressed time frame.\"\n\nThe product launched within a year, which Chandran said is unheard of in the \"conservative\" insurance industry; one he said is usually fraught with \"ancient\" processes.\n\nThe plan for MLC is to now focus on leveraging APIs.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "MLC Life Insurance has been on a three-year transition out of the National Australia Bank.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/09/6edba80c-df21-4130-9281-d5ec33f3542b/thumbnail/770x578/e8cd2d716bfb1af492dafc81377d25f5/gdpr-data-padlock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
