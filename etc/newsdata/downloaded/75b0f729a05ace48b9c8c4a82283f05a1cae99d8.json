And then he started s**t about my girlfriend, my family, some of the more vulnerable times in my life. And he took too many low blows for me to be respectful any more.\u2019\n\nLogan stormed out of the press conference last summer after his opponent ripped into his dad and girlfriend Chloe Bennet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKSI ranted: \u2018No one has your back except your ludicrous mum and your disgusting dad.\u2019\n\nSpeaking to his dad directly, KSI said: \u2018You said you\u2019d beat me in a fight but you wouldn\u2019t do s**t. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like a round with those little girls you like kissing. You dumb, bald p***k.\u2019\n\nThe YouTube stars are set to scrap again (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nLogan then made a hasty exit from the stage remarking: \u2018KSI has covered it. I\u2019m outta here.\u2019\n\nThe whole ordeal started after KSI won in a boxing match against British YouTuber Joe Weller. KSI took his victory to call out Logan which began this entire crazy buzz.\n\nThe rematch is due to take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday 9 November.\n\nThe first match ended in a majority draw following six rounds of sparring \u2013 in an evening which also saw Logan\u2019s brother Jake Paul go head to head with KSI\u2019s brother Deji.\n\nAt the time Logan called for a rematch, saying: \u2018I think it\u2019s what the people want. Let\u2019s give them a motherf*****g rematch!\u2019 KSI was in agreement as he declared:\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s do that again, that was fun. Holy shit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKSI doesn\u2019t want Logan to be the only Paul that he takes on in the ring, as he also his sights set on Logan\u2019s brother Jake.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to TMZ, KSI said: \u2018I want to fight Jake Paul, man. I really want to break his face.\u2019\n\nKSI \u2013 real name Olajide William \u2018JJ\u2019 Olatunji \u2013 and Logan\u2019s first match ended in a draw, but if there was a winner Jake would have been next in line to take the novice boxer on.\n\n\u2018I would love to break Jake\u2019s face as well as Logan\u2019s. I personally don\u2019t think, as soon as I knock out Logan, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna want to fight me,\u2019 he said.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
