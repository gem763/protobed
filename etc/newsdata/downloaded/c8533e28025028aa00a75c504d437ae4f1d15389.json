I am still single.\n\n\"But I am quite a happy single person. You accept yourself.\n\n\"Statistics prove that you are a lot happier and healthier now if you are single, because you don\u2019t have to compromise.\n\n\"You are in control. You get pickier when you get older, you know what you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the 44 year-old doesn\u2019t get plenty of attention - even voted Sexiest Female at the 2017 Inside Soap Awards, more that some of that attention can be very unwelcome.\n\nThe North Lanarkshire born actress says: \u201cIn this industry it is very difficult to know if people want you to be you.\n\n\"I play characters but it is not real - I have come across it and it is a bit frightening. I have had some creepy moments and it did put me off.\u201d\n\nAnd although she is open to romance, she\u2019s definitely ruled out dating apps after seeing friends go through bad experiences with online dating.\n\nNatalie explains: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do the online thing - it\u2019s a big dodgy. My friends have done it and it has made them feel bad about themselves.\n\n\u201cBut that is the society we are in now, people don\u2019t go out to meet each other any more, and I really hope that that will come back.\u201d\n\nIf she is to meet someone, it won\u2019t be on a boozy night out as for the moment Natalie has knocked alcohol on the head.\n\nShe went booze-free for Dry January but liked the way not drinking made her feel and hasn\u2019t touched a drop since, instead spending her time walking her beloved dog Bronson, doing yoga and spending time with friends and family.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\u201cLast Christmas it was making me feel a bit sick, even just a sip, so I thought I would have a break and then I just continued it because I felt great,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cBut what I have found is that you see a lot of things very differently. Even though I would only have a drink at the weekend it would be Wednesday until I felt better, and I couldn\u2019t cope with that any more with this job.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot about yourself, and I have loads more energy - there are loads of benefits.\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying I am never going to drink again, but I would like to get to a year and give my liver a break.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 45 this year. I just think I have had a load of fun of really demolishing my liver and kidneys over the years, and now I am just giving a bit back.\n\n\"And I think I like myself better without alcohol than I did with it.\u201d\n\nAnd Natalie certainly isn\u2019t joking when she says she doesn\u2019t have time for romance or alcohol at the minute.\n\nHer character Moira has been at the centre of Emmerdale\u2019s most explosive storylines in recent years with the death of her daughter Holly from a heroin overdose, her involvement in the death of Emma Barton, and now a raunchy affair with Nate which is about to be revealed with devastating consequences.\n\nCain uncovers his wife\u2019s affair next week - and like any true Dingle he isn\u2019t going to let Moira and Nate off lightly.\n\nAnd that means him taking revenge in spectacular Dingle style with the boat trip from hell which saw Natalie filming with a stunt double to create the explosive scenes.\n\nShe says: \u201cIt was two weeks of a shoot in an actual lake. I had a stunt woman who was amazing - she had worked with Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. It was good fun. There was a massive fight and I ended up overboard.\u201d\n\nDespite Moira\u2019s tough storylines that keep Natalie on her toes, she is still loving every minute of life on Emmerdale and celebrated her 10th anniversary on the show this year.\n\nAnd Natalie is in the rare but lucky position as an actress to have not stopped working since her first major role aged 14 as Trish McDonald in Scottish soap Take the High Road.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nRoles in Taggart, Sunburn, Dream Team, Doctors and The Bill followed before she landed the part of Moira in Emmerdale in 2009.\n\nEver modest, Natalie says she doesn\u2019t really know what the secret to her success is - although she admits that she is a grafter like her character Moira, and never takes anything for granted.\n\nAnd she says she is proud to work on a show like Emmerdale which is still going strong despite tough competition from the likes of Netflix and Amazon.\n\n\u201cI work hard. I think for me I have never taken a job for granted.\n\n\"I have always been grateful for what I do. I think what I love about the job is the fact that I am willing to learn everyday, every day is a school day.\n\n\u201cI find it really rewarding, it is tough graft. Soap is one of the hardest jobs - you have to keep coming up with the goods and it tests you a lot.\n\n\u201cIt keeps you good at your craft. I think there is often a snobbery about it - but it is amazing that soaps like Corrie, Emmerdale and Eastenders are still going even though we have got all these other channels now.\n\n\"For people, soap is an escapism - they can relate to it but it is tongue in cheek as well. It says something if they are still doing well despite all the competition they now have.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to stay here. I would love to see how things pan out for Moira.\u201d\n\nBut while Moira might be horrified that her affair has been revealed - Natalie thinks viewers will be glad the cheating has come to an end.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like the affair storyline at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThey love Cain and Moira together. A lot of people say the Moira and Nate thing makes them feel sick.\n\n\"She was mother earth when she came into Emmerdale, and she is an honest person, but she has changed as time moves on.\n\n\"You do as you get older, you start to learn about yourself and you either accept who you are who you don\u2019t, and a lot of people battle with that as they get older.\n\nRead More Next week's soap spoilers EastEnders\n\nEmmerdale\n\nCorrie\n\nHollyoaks\n\n\u201cShe has needed this kind of shock to make her feel alive again. She has been a bit numb with everything that has happened. She\u2019s not really dealt with things.\n\n\u201cShe has not looked after her own mental health, and there are a lot of mental health issues around the Nate thing.\n\n\"People think it is just an affair, but there are lots of other issues around why she is doing it. It is almost like a cry for help in a really weird way.\n\n\u201cThere are more reasons behind it - it is not just a boy who comes along and gets his top off. Moira isn\u2019t that, she is deeper than that. But she knows it is wrong but she does it anyway.\u201d\n\nNatalie\u2019s 5 favourite Emmerdale moments\n\nFirst day\n\nOne of my favourite moments was my first day on Emmerdale as the Barton family. We were so nervous all five of us, we were sweating buckets when we did a Woolpack scene. I just remember it all being really exciting and we gelled as a family, but it was like getting over that first day at school feeling.\n\nHolly\u2019s death\n\nIt was so harrowing but it was amazing to do.\n\nI met a real family who had been through it, so it was sad work to do.\n\nBut the reaction we got to it was amazing - Emmerdale did it really well.\n\nI found it challenging as an actress - I\u2019m not a mother, but I have got quite a maternal instinct, but it definitely tested me as an actress.\n\nThe head-butt with Charity\n\nI have been so lucky I have had so many stunt things to do.\n\nBut I think the viewers really liked the female-fight aspect to it.\n\nThe Emma death scene\n\nWe were filming up on a real viaduct and we had loads of ropes attached to us.\n\nWe filmed it over a week and there is one shot where I am right on the edge of the viaduct - it was pretty scary.\n\nThe under-water scenes for the boat explosion\n\nJeff and I were both really nervous about it, I am not going to lie. It isn\u2019t in your nature to be underwater with your eyes open, so it was scary.\n\nBut it made me fall in love with my job even more.\n\nWe were working with these super-professional diving guys and they really looked after us.\n\nBut we were totally out of our comfort zones, and I think that is when you do your best work.\n\nI think you have to feel the fear and do it anyway.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Natalie Robb says she's happy being single - unlike her bed-hopping soap character", "authors": ["Amanda Killelea", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660100.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emmerdale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
