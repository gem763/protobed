Retallick bristled towards a British journalist this week when he was reminded of his dubious claim, but Lawes smiled upon being prompted on the press conference moment five years ago and believes that the chance to silence the All Blacks once and for all comes this Saturday in Yokohama.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We will just get on with it.\n\n\"We're excited. None of us have played in a semi-final before, it's a challenge but we're very excited to get out there.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That's fine with us. We are used to that,\u201d said Lawes. \u201cIn terms of the line-out (Barrett) is a good jumper. He's normally a second-row forward. But I think we have addressed that and have the callers and jumpers to deal with it.\n\n\"They have a great pack and have a lot of great players across the board - but so do we. We have two of the best packs in the world going up against each other.\"\n\nEngland have spent the week preparing at the Disneyland Tokyo resort but will travel 30 miles to Yokohama on Saturday afternoon by bus, when the roads are due to have cleared despite the barrage of rain brought by the 20th typhoon of Pacific season.\n\nBut even without the theme park around them, the squad have been able to bond on this two-month journey in Japan like never before, and full-back Elliot Daly believes it is a positive factor in their attempt to take down the reigning world champions.\n\n\"We talk about togetherness all the time and I haven\u2019t felt this together as a team in any team I have played in,\u201d Daly said. \"We are having fun on and off the pitch, and hopefully that shows in the games, and it is the most together we have been.\n\n\"Everyone is different how they go about preparing for big games. Last weekend we built nicely towards the game and individually we got ready and it wasn\u2019t a team thing because we were all right at game time.\n\n\"Everyone in the team knows what they have to do to get to that level and we don't want to let anyone down. We want to be ready come what may at game time.\"", "description": "On the eve of England\u2019s biggest Rugby World Cup match in over a decade, Courtney Lawes vowed that they are ready to put the world on notice by ending New Zealand\u2019s eight-year reign of dominance in Saturday\u2019s semi-final.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/11/courtney-lawes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
