The media\u2019s reaction to the death of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi may have been a turning point.\n\nProgressives in media are so dedicated to opposing Trump, that the Washington Post eulogized the terrorist with more warmth than they have ever afforded President Trump, or even certain high school students caught on camera wearing MAGA hats.\n\nCNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, and the other usual suspects also had spectacularly bad takes on the death of al-Baghdadi, all of which were framed to discredit Trump or downplay his role in the situation.\n\nIn years past, the media tried to remain subtle in their bias but that all changed on election night in 2016. Anyone who was paying attention that night saw the media completely transform in real time. Many of the same cable and network news hosts who played palace guards for the Obama administration for eight years, became members of the angry mob at the palace gate, overnight.\n\nOne day the White House was an institution which could do no wrong and must be protected at all costs, the next it was a potential hotbed of corruption. We suddenly needed journalists who were willing to speak truth to power in supposed defense of our democracy.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, the vast majority of the media is working in direct partnership with the Democrat Party to undo the results of the 2016 election and to remove Trump from office.\n\nThey did something similar with George W. Bush, but back then they at least tried to pretend it was about America\u2019s interests and not advancing their political agenda.\n\nUnder Trump, they\u2019re not even trying to hide it.\n\nThey hate Trump and they want him removed from office. They hate the American people who voted for Trump and insult them repeatedly by calling them racists, xenophobes, and worse.\n\nNone of this is happening by accident. The anti-Trump media, which is most of the media, is waging a psychological war against the American people.\n\nThey are using every resource they have to convince you to hate Trump as much as they do, and they\u2019re doing it every single hour of every single day.\n\nHave you scrolled through the official YouTube accounts of CNN or MSNBC lately? Nearly every story is a negative report about Trump. There is never good news about Trump. Everything he says or does is framed as a scandal or potential crisis.\n\nThis is all being done on purpose. The goal of the media is to wear the public down. They think that if they do this enough times, people will finally submit to their constant \u2018orange man bad\u2019 narrative.\n\nWe had three solid years of wall to wall coverage of the Russia collusion hoax, and the minute that went down in flames, a new narrative sprang up out of nowhere, fully supported by Democrats and dutifully advanced by most of the media.\n\nPeople on the left love to criticize Fox News, but it\u2019s one of the only media outlets where you can hear voices that are both for and against Trump.\n\nName a single pro-Trump personality on any other network. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the left quickly launched a new talking point, proclaiming \u201cthis is not normal\u201d and in a way, they were right. It\u2019s not normal for the losing party, in partnership with the media, to attempt to negate the results of a free and fair election because they didn\u2019t like the outcome.\n\nWhen the Washington Post and The New York Times treat the death of an ISIS leader with more sensitivity than they would for a group of innocent Catholic school students in MAGA hats or the president of the United States, we have crossed a line as a culture and a country.\n\nThe Democrats are still trying to undo the results of the 2016 election three years later, and the media is openly trying to assist them by going negative on Trump every single day.\n\nThey\u2019re right about one thing. This is not normal.", "description": "For years, conservatives have pointed out the liberal biases of .10/30/2019 11:57:04AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Lachance", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/235/a4831884-5f85-4feb-86ff-ebe52e3961e2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
