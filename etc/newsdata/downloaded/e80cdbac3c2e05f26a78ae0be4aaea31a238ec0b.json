Gooding was not charged in relation to those allegations, which date to 2001.\n\nThe New York Post\u2019s \u201cPage Six\u201d first reported on Gooding\u2019s new indictment.\n\n\u201cThe new accuser is just one more splinter that comes out of the woodwork when a celebrity is criminally charged but, none of the splinters will form a plank leading to his conviction because he has committed no crime,\u201d Gooding\u2019s lawyer, Mark Heller, told Vulture. \u201cCuba Gooding Jr. and I will be appearing in the Supreme Court at 9:30 on the morning of Halloween to enter a not guilty plea to the indictment, which will be unsealed that morning.\u201d\n\nBecause the indictment remains sealed, additional information is not available. It\u2019s also unclear whether the new accuser is among the women who have already come forward. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nGooding\u2019s legal troubles began in June, after he allegedly grabbed a woman\u2019s breast at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar and Lounge at the Moxy NYC Times Square Hotel.\n\nLast week\u2019s new counts alleged that Gooding \u201cpinched the buttocks of a woman without her consent\u201d in October 2018 at Tao Nightclub. This accuser, Tao waitress Natasha Ashworth, filed a lawsuit against Gooding on Monday.\n\nAt the end of Ashworth\u2019s shift, when she was waiting at the bar, Gooding \u201capproached [her] and pinched her right buttocks,\u201d court papers claim.\n\nAfter she told Gooding not to touch her, he said, \u201c\u2018Aw that\u2019s no fun,\u2019 proceeding to touch Plaintiff\u2019s arm and attempting to touch the rear of Plaintiff\u2019s body,\u201d she alleges.\n\nAshworth \u201cdeflected\u201d his hand, but Gooding \u201cmade a further attempt to touch the rear of [her] body \u2026\u201d\n\nWhen Ashworth asked Gooding to leave, \u201cyet, again, Defendant attempted to touch the rear of Plaintiff\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nGooding ultimately said he\u2019d never come back to Tao and left; the incident was recorded on video, Ashworth\u2019s suit claims.\n\nGooding is due in court on October 31 for his arraignment on the new allegation.", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. has now been indicted in relation to another accuser in his ongoing groping sexual assault case.
