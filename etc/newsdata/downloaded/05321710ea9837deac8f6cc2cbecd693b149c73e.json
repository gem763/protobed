As I see it, this is a risky bet; if anything, the Micron stock price could be setting up to reclaim the $60 level, where it traded twice last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDon\u2019t Obsess Over the MU Stock Price\n\nStock-chart analysts tend to be bothered by MU stock\u2019s price action in 2019: they\u2019ll either say that it\u2019s too close to its 52-week high to buy now, or else they\u2019ll complain that Micron stock has had difficulty breaking above the $50 resistance level.\n\nRather than get caught up in price-action minutiae, I would suggest that prospective investors look under the hood: as Warren Buffett famously once said, price is what you pay but value is what you get. As far as value goes, MU stock has an ultra-low trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 5.2, which is absolutely outstanding among semiconductor stocks.\n\nMoreover, the trailing 12-month earnings per share comes to $8.65 \u2014 not too bad at all for a stock that\u2019s trading under fifty bucks. All in all, breaking through the $50 price barrier seems entirely realistic, and a number of prominent analysts seem to agree with me on that point: Deutsche Bank has a price target for Micron stock set at $55, while Goldman Sachs has its at $56, Bank of America at $60, and the Royal Bank of Canada at $55; besides, all of the foregoing have either initiated or reiterated a buy/upgrade/overweight rating on MU stock.\n\nFeast on DRAM Chips for Gains in MU Stock\n\nDemand for high-powered, top-of-the-line DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips was under pressure in the second quarter of 2019: the ongoing U.S.-China tariff conflict, the Huawei ban, and a generally uneasy August for the equities market made life difficult for semiconductor companies and particularly for Micron stock. That same 31-stock SOXX ETF lost 2% in the month.\n\nSince 65% of Micron\u2019s revenues come from DRAM chip sales, a turnaround in the industry would benefit MU stock tremendously. Mehdi Hosseini, a financial analyst for Susquehanna, sees such a turnaround coming in the near future:\n\n\u201cOur updated (bottom-up) DRAM supply-demand model suggests a more balanced dynamic in 2020, followed by increased tightness in 2021 \u2026 This bodes well for memory manufacturers, particularly MU.\u201d\n\nTo be honest, there was an oversupply of DRAM chips that began in September of 2018 and persisted through this year\u2019s second quarter. However, like Hosseini, I\u2019m preparing for this trend to reverse; the analyst has specifically projected that the demand for DRAM chips should increase by 22% annually from 2019 through 2021.\n\nAnd when it comes to DRAM chips, Micron is truly at the forefront of the niche. Even an escalating trade war couldn\u2019t stop Micron from releasing its super-powerful LPDDR4X DRAM chip, a 16-gigabyte memory beast whose distinguishing feature is its surprisingly low power consumption. Providing a reduction in memory-system power consumption of 18% to 20%, the LPDDR4X is perfect for smartphones and power-intensive gaming devices \u2014 and could easily be a game changer as the DRAM market finds its footing in the second half of the year.\n\nThe Takeaway on Micron Stock", "description": "I'm an active participant in stock market forums, but even I was surprised to see how much bearish sentiment and venom was directed at Micron (NASDAQ:MU) stock in the second quarter of 2019 as the tariff conflict escalated.
