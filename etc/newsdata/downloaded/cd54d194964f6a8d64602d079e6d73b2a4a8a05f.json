She stops me from being a head-in-the-clouds actor p**ck.\n\nSimon has been working hard to prepare for an upcoming role (Picture: Twitter)\n\nSimon went all out in the gym (Picture: @rebourne_fitness_nutrition)\n\n\u2018As soon as I get home I\u2019m picking up the dog s*** in the courtyard, though I do have a courtyard which is p**ckish, to say the least.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in March, personal trainer Nick Lower shared a picture of Pegg\u2019s new body, writing: \u2018#SimonPegg 6 month body transformation for #InheritanceMovie The brief for this role was lean, VERY lean. It required a specific body shape & look.\u2019\n\nHe explained that Simon had dropped from 78kg to 69kg in his body weight (losing 19 pounds) and gone down to just 8% body fat from 12%, through a mix of stength, circuits and core training and a \u2018sound nutrition plan that worked for him and his goals\u2019.\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk, Nick said: \u2018I took the picture and posted it on my Instagram, and didn\u2019t really know what to expect. It sort of went crazy. For some reason, people still think of Simon as the guy from Run Fatboy Run. But over the last six, seven years, he\u2019s not been anywhere that \u2013 certainly since he turned 40. So a lot of people, to see him in that shape, the everyman, it was shocking.\u2019\n\nSimon praised Maureen for keeping him grounded (Picture: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\nNick, who works with Rebourne Fitness and Nutrition in Hertfordshire, has been working with Simon ever since he finished filming 2013\u2019s Star Trek Into Darkness, and got him into shape for The World\u2019s End.\n\nHowever, for his role as Morgan in the upcoming thriller Inheritance, Pegg was going for a very different look. Nick told us: \u2018It is drastic. It\u2019s different. The remit was, his character has been trapped in a basement for 30 years, so he\u2019s not going to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was kept alive and he did exercise, but the brief was very, very lean. He\u2019s in shape most of the time, but for this movie he had to get down to single figure body fat, which we achieved. We had a set period of time \u2013 about six months to knuckle down. The movie actually got delayed, and we\u2019d peaked a bit early, so we just carried on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We kept his calories in check and he trained very hard. Simon had one rest day, then he would do our sessions and extra cardio. We didn\u2019t do anything magical or out of the ordinary \u2013 we made sure Simon had the right balance of macro nutrients and we trained a lot \u2013 a mixture of strength training and circuit training and some cardio added on to make sure we achieved that calorie deficit.\n\n\u2018Essentially, it\u2019s got to be a mix of strength training. Strength circuits work really well, where you hit as many muscle groups as you can in one session, keeping it high intensity, then move onto 10-15 minutes of cardio or ropes. But then we trained so much we could spread it out a bit \u2013 we would maybe do core and legs on one day, and move onto other sections for two days \u2013 but Simon had the luxury of time for training. He did a lot of cardio on top of that as well.\u2019\n\nNick added: \u2018It\u2019s not maintainable and it\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s going to take a lot of training. Simon may have had one day rest, but he worked hard every day and he was strict, and that\u2019s how he got those results. But it\u2019s a short-term thing, you do not want to do that long-term.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon admitted that the response (and not just Maureen\u2019s) to his body was \u2018so weird\u2019, telling GQ that it \u2018wasn\u2019t meant to be an aspirational thing\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
