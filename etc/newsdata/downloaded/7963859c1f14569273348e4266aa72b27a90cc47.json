REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo\n\nOil prices surged more than 15% following the strikes on two plants, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum processing facility in Abqaiq, knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for the damage, but the U.S. has pointed the finger directly at Iran.\n\nThe Canadian dollar CAD=D3 rose 0.5% in morning trade in Asia to 1.3224 per dollar. The Norwegian krone NOK= rose almost 0.6% to 8.9363 per dollar.\n\nBoth currencies often move together with the oil price because the countries are major oil exporters.\n\nThe attacks wiped out last week\u2019s ebullient risk appetite and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a response.\n\nThe safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc each lifted at least 0.3% on the dollar. The yen JPY=EBS hit 107.60 per dollar and the franc CHF= touched $0.9871. Gold XAU= jumped by 1%.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies .DXY the dollar was 0.2% lower at 98.053.\n\n\u201cIf that part of the reason for last week\u2019s fall in oil and improvement in geopolitical risk sentiment was the news of John Bolton\u2019s sacking ... and thoughts this was a precursor to some form of rapprochement between Trump and Iran, then it is no longer valid,\u201d said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\nBeyond oil, currency markets are awaiting the outcome of central bank meetings in the U.S. and Japan this week and crucial economic data in Australia and New Zealand that could determine the rates outlook in the Antipodes.\n\nMuch of the risk appetite on display last week was driven by signs of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions, with both sides offering olive branches ahead of trade talks next month.\n\nHowever with few solid signs of progress, sentiment remains fragile.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical risks and central bank rhetoric remain key drivers of risk this week,\u201d Australia and New Zealand Banking Group analysts said in a note.\n\nIn the United States, investors who had begun trimming expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut on Wednesday are now certain rates will fall and divided only over how much. FEDWATCH\n\nMarkets also expect the Bank of Japan to push interest rates further into negative territory, with a third of economists polled by Reuters last week expecting stimulus to be ramped up.\n\nJapanese markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.\n\nChina\u2019s premier on Monday said maintaining national economic growth above 6% is difficult, with protectionism weighing.\n\nRetail sales and industrial production figures due on Monday are likely to give further insight into the health of the world's second-largest economy. The Chinese yuan was flat in morning trade offshore CNH=.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 held last week's gains, as fears of Britain crashing out of the European Union without a divorce deal ebbed, while a news report on Friday also raised hopes that a deal could be secured by Oct. 31.\n\nIt steadied just under its highest since July 25 at $1.2491.
