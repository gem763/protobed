Tinnitus is the name for hearing noises, such as ringing, buzzing or hissing, that are not caused by an outside source, according to the NHS. It occurs due to damage to the cochlear hair cells in the inner ear, which stretch and contract in accordance with sound-induced vibrations. Very loud noises - at a nightclub or played over headphones \u2013 can overload these cells, leaving them temporarily or permanently damages. The damage forces other parts of the ear to overwork to compensate for the loss of function, which leads to tinnitus and eventually chronic hearing loss. According to the charity Action On Hearing Loss, around one in 10 UK adults has tinnitus Treatment focuses on counselling and therapies to help people find ways of coping with their condition and reducing any anxiety it causes. Tinnitus retraining therapy uses sound therapy to retrain the brain to tune out and be less aware of ringing and buzzing noises.\n\nAccident: Monique's hearing problems stem from a motorcycle accident she was involved in four years ago in Indonesia\n\nMonique has also shared photographs of herself with her hearing aid to prove they are nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n'I am thrilled to be an ambassador for The Shepherd Centre and help remove the stigma about wearing hearing aids,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nMonique made headlines earlier this year thanks to her unfiltered opinions on The Bachelor.\n\nWhoops!
