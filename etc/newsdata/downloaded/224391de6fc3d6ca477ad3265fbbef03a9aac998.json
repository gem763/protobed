Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi as counterterrorism chief. Saadi worked with American forces to fight the Islamic State, and many viewed his removal \u2014 for which Baghdad offered no explanation \u2014 as Iran expanding its influence by removing officials not loyal to Tehran.\n\nThe protests rapidly evolved into general discontent with the state of the nation, attracting even members of pro-Iran militias who say the state abandoned them after they risked their lives against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI joined Hashd al-Shaabi to save my brothers and sisters in Iraq from the brutality of ISIS terrorists,\u201d a demonstrator identified as \u201cMustafa GZ\u201d told Kurdish media network Rudaw. \u201cPoverty and a lack of services made our lives dark and meaningless, so we went to protest against this government.\u201d\n\nHashd al-Shaabi is the Arabic name for the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a coalition of mostly Shiite pro-Iran militias that Iraq legalized as a formal wing of the armed forces. While many groups participated in the PMF when the militias were dedicated to eradicating the Islamic State, they have since redirected their efforts to cementing Iran\u2019s stranglehold over Baghdad and colonizing territories under Kurdish control.\n\nMustafa, the protester, lamented that his decision to take to the streets and demand \u201cbasic rights\u201d as a veteran of the ISIS war has been met with \u201clive ammunition, tear gas, and sniper shots.\u201d\n\nThe protesters have not issued a central list of demands, but many condemn Baghdad for a lack of social services, poverty, unemployment, nepotism, and government corruption.\n\nThey have accused Iraqi forces of opening fire into crowds indiscriminately, thus elevating the death toll. Eyewitnesses have said the men shooting into the crowds are \u201cIranians speaking in Farsi,\u201d fueling the existing resentment towards Iranian officials that locals reject as invaders.\n\nIraq is primarily Shiite Muslim with a significant Sunni minority; its government in recent years has been Shiite controlled and maintains close ties to the Iranian dictatorship.\n\nThe Iraqi government has been scrambling to find a solution. Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi issued curfews and cut off access to the internet, and masked men in tactical gear temporarily took NRT TV, Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya, and local Al-Dijla channel off the air by force.\n\nOn Sunday, following what he described as an \u201cexceptional Council of Ministers\u201d meeting, Abdul-Mahdi promised a series of measures in answer. But thus far, the promises \u2014 made amid rising violence \u2014 have failed to stop the protests. Some are calling on the United Nations to \u201cintervene to dissolve the parliament, government, and the presidency.\u201d\n\nOf those killed, eight are Iraq law enforcement authorities \u2014 the vast majority are civilians.", "description": "Protests against government corruption\u00a0in Iraq have resulted in\u00a0over 100 deaths and\u00a06,000 injuries as\u00a0of Monday, local media has reported.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/protests-Iraq-Tayaran-square-gov-corruption-1019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
