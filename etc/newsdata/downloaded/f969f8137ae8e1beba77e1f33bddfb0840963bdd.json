He was also banned from holding public office for 13 years.\n\nWhat is the story of Catalan independence \u2013 and what happens next?

For democracy, for Europe, for Catalonia.\u201d\n\nPuigdemont, who led the push for regional independence, was not among those on trial. He fled Spain to avoid arrest at the end of October 2017 and is living in self-imposed exile in Belgium.\n\nIn a communique Barcelona en Com\u00fa, the group led by Barcelona\u2019s mayor, Ada Colau, expressed its indignation at what it called the \u201cunjust sentences\u201d and called for a united response on the part of Catalan political and citizens\u2019 organisations.\n\nPolice have been deployed to Catalonia\u2019s biggest travel hubs, with a large number of officers patrolling Barcelona airport and the city\u2019s Sants railway station to guard against any attempts at direct action in response to the sentences. Police were also gathering at Girona\u2019s main railway station.\n\nA demonstration was under way along one of Barcelona\u2019s main thoroughfares, the Via Laietana, with protesters holding banners demanding the prisoners\u2019 release. A small crowd also gathered at Pla\u00e7a San Jaume, the seat of the Catalan government in Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan association of local authorities, jointly with the association of local authorities for independence have called on their members to suspend all activities for 72 hours.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters holding banners reading \u201cTake the street\u201d and \u201cFree political prisoners\u201d in Barcelona after the nine Catalan leaders were sentenced.

Guardia Civil officers found themselves trapped inside the buildings they were searching and three of their vehicles were vandalised.\n\nThe state prosecutor, Javier Zaragoza, had argued such behaviour constituted \u201cphysical, compulsive and intimidatory violence\u201d, adding: \u201cThe violent nature of an uprising does not mean there has to be either serious or armed violence.\u201d\n\nHowever, defence lawyers rejected such arguments, pointing out that under Spanish law, rebellion involves \u201crevolting violently and publicly\u201d.\n\nThe lesser offence of sedition, meanwhile, is defined as \u201crising up publicly and tumultuously to prevent, through force or beyond legal means, the application of the law\u201d. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years.\n\nThe offence of disobedience carries a fine and a ban from holding public office, but not a jail term.\n\nRajoy reacted to the unilateral independence declaration by using the constitution to sack the secessionist Catalan government and assume control of the region.\n\nThe defendants have already said they will appeal to the European court of human rights if necessary.", "description": "Nine leaders cleared of violent rebellion but found guilty of lesser crimes over roles in 2017 independence referendum", "authors": ["Sam Jones", "Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0e58fe1b16b324b367d5e617d332076e179d28/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11175d90b5b6314de1efa3506fae49da", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
