CHEAP!\n\nWhen you use your daily $100-$200 earphones, you might think what\u2019s all the fuss about the high-end audio products? That\u2019s at least what I used to think, until I tried some really good earphones and headphones such as the Beyerdynamic Aventho wireless.\n\nThe only issue is that they might be too bulky for people on the go. That\u2019s where the AKG N5005 comes in, small and snazzy in-ear monitors (IEMs).. That\u2019s where the AKG N5005 comes in. The pair is selling for just $500, down from $1,000. At half of its original price.\n\nThe IEMs deliver high-quality output with its five-driver hybrid construction. It also comes with four exchangeable sound filters: Bass Boost, reference sound, mid-high boost, and high boost.\n\nThe Bluetooth 4.1 cable supplied in the box will get you eight hours of listening time with a single charge. Along with this, you\u2019ll get a detachable twist cable with universal 3-button remote/mic, a detachable twist 2.5mm audio balance cable, a cleaning tool, a USB charging cable, and a flight adapter. That\u2019s quite a nice package.\n\nThis is a once in a lifetime deal. Get the AKG N5005 for just $500 ($500 off)\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
