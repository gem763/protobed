(Delaware State Police/AP)\n\nWhen she matched with a college athlete on Bumble, the 20-year-old woman couldn\u2019t believe her luck. At first she worried someone might have stolen Clay Conaway\u2019s name and photos to pose as the pitcher on the dating app. Later, convinced it wasn\u2019t catfishing after all, she started excitedly texting her friends.\n\n\u201cOMG I matched with a University of Delaware baseball player,\u201d she wrote, according to the Delaware News-Journal. \u201cHe is so hot I\u2019m screaming.\u201d\n\nBut the woman was left in tears after meeting Conaway at the pole barn where he lived on his parents\u2019 property, according to a summary of the allegations included in a judge\u2019s written decision. In phone calls with friends, she said she thought she\u2019d been raped. She had kissed Conaway willingly as they watched a movie, she said \u2014 and then he\u2019d forced her into sex. He had ignored her anxiety attack and her objections, telling her that \u201cit was fine, they were just messing around.\u201d\n\nNow, Conaway is standing trial on rape charges stemming from the June 2018 incident, the first of a potential six cases involving six different women police say he sexually assaulted. And attorneys for the now-former student athlete are attempting to use the 20-year-old woman\u2019s enthusiastic text messages \u2014 and her presence on Bumble \u2014 to help prove the encounter was consensual.\n\n\u201cShe knew he was on Bumble to hook up,\u201d lawyer Natalie Woloshin said during opening statements Monday at the Sussex County courthouse, according to the News-Journal. \u201cShe knew he wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship. And with all this, she willingly drove over to Clay Conaway\u2019s house.\u201d\n\n[The NFL met with Antonio Brown\u2019s accuser for 10 hours Monday]\n\nIn testimony Wednesday, the woman said she had joined the dating app after a breakup because that\u2019s how her generation meets new people. She said she made it clear to Conaway that she \u201cwas not a hookup kind of girl,\u201d the News-Journal reported.\n\nThe woman reported the alleged assault soon after it happened. When Conaway was arrested in August 2018, other women starting coming forward, telling police that they, too, were victims of his. His arrest also brought to light that the University of Delaware had expelled him last fall after the school concluded that he had \u201cmore likely than not\u201d raped and choked a woman in November 2017, according to university documents obtained by the News-Journal. Conaway, through his attorneys, has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged in the incident, according to the newspaper.\n\nCriminal charges against the 23-year-old man date back to 2013, when he was a star baseball player at Sussex Central High School and was accused of sexually assaulting a sleeping classmate at a New Year\u2019s Eve party, according to the summary of allegations. He allegedly stopped only after someone else in the room intervened by saying, \u201cYou are basically raping her.\u201d\n\nThe cases are being tried separately at the defense\u2019s request. In a July ruling, Judge Richard F. Stokes wrote that trying them together might cause the jury to combine evidence from various crimes and find guilt when it otherwise wouldn\u2019t.\n\n[New York Times apologizes for \u2018inappropriate and offensive\u2019 tweet about Kavanaugh sexual misconduct allegation]\n\nProsecutors had argued for trying them simultaneously to show Conaway\u2019s state of mind and because of their similarities, including how he met the alleged victims. In four of the cases, it was through Bumble and Tinder \u2014 a fact that could play into multiple cases. In an interview with the News-Journal, one of Conaway\u2019s lawyers said the women were there \u201cto hook up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not an apologist for rape,\u201d attorney Joe Hurley said. \u201cNo means no. Red light means red light. They were on a [website] to hook up. \u2026 What a confused world we have.\u201d\n\nDuring opening statements Monday, Woloshin highlighted a lauded Bumble feature: Women are the ones who make the first move. The app touts this nuance as \u201cshifting old-fashioned power dynamics and encouraging equality from the start.\u201d Woloshin pointed to it as an indication that the encounter may have been consensual.\n\nShe read through text messages in which the accuser told friends of her loneliness after a recent breakup. \u201cI need me a mans and I need me a sex life,\u201d read one of the messages. She said Conaway had sent nude photos of himself to the accuser, and that she and her friends discussed his body.\n\nProsecutors argued that the woman, who was on her period, set boundaries before going over to Conaway\u2019s house. After he removed her clothes and her tampon and climbed on top of her, she grew so frightened that she froze, prosecutor Casey Ewart said.\n\n\u201cShe told the defendant multiple times to stop,\u201d the News-Journal quoted Ewart as saying. \u201cHe ignored her and kept going.\u201d\n\nWoloshin and the district attorney\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nConaway could face up to 25 years in prison on each charge. But for now, he\u2019s out on bail after his parents put up four properties worth $300,000 as collateral. His release came with a condition: that he not be left alone with any women who are not family.\n\nRead more:\n\nResident fatally shoots three masked teenagers who were attempting a robbery, police say\n\nThis back-to-school PSA from Sandy Hook Promise is a punch in the gut\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse of teenage girl detailed in lawsuit against his estate executors\n\n\u2018The face of the opioid epidemic\u2019: How a college dropout became a fentanyl kingpin.", "description": "Former University of Delaware pitcher Clay Conaway is accused of sexually assaulting six women.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Brittany Shammas Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
