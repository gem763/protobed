Another sign read: \u201cNo censorship in America\u201d and a third declared: \u201cFreedom is not FREE.\u201d Another man held a sign that said: \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\u201d which are the exact words included in Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly rebuked his GM after his tweet with a tweet saying that Morey does not speak for the team, but the damage was done. The Chinese Basketball Association, headed by former Rockets star Yao Ming, suspended its ties to the Rockets over the tweet. Events in China promoting a Lakers-Nets series were canceled, NBA media partner Tencent said it was evaluating its plans to cover the league and some Chinese corporations have suspended relationships with the NBA.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A group of fans at the Houston Rockets' season opener against Milwaukee held signs and wore shirts in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
