Not Halbussi, not Abdel Mahdi. We want to bring down the regime,\u201d the protester said.\n\nThe scene at Tahrir was chaotic, with some protesters climbing atop multistorey business centres to wave Iraqi flags and others torching tyres in rubbish-littered streets.\n\nLarge tents had been set up and volunteers were distributing food and water to demonstrators.\n\nNotably, women and students were seen in larger numbers.\n\nTwo elderly women in traditional black robes and head scarves hopped up on a concrete barrier and waved the Iraqi flag while dancing to upbeat pop music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for the generation that\u2019s coming,\u201d said one young woman who identified herself as a prenatal nurse.\n\n\u201cOur generation is psychologically tired, but it\u2019s alright as long as this is for the next one,\u201d she said.\n\nSecurity forces were positioned on the edges of Tahrir, while elite Counter-Terrorism Service troops and armoured vehicles were seen in surrounding districts.\n\nThe CTS said it had deployed its units to \u201cprotect vital infrastructure,\u201d and its forces were not seen in Tahrir.\n\nThe persistent protests have kept the pressure up on Abdel Mahdi, as has a new sit-in by parliamentarians tied to populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.\n\nHis Saeroon bloc, parliament\u2019s largest, launched the open-ended measure late on Saturday in order to achieve protester demands, lawmakers told AFP.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Hundreds of protesters hunkered down in the Iraqi capital\u2019s Tahrir Square on Sunday, defying another night of tear gas and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/a4a034_wave-anti-government-protests-is-gripping-iraqi-capital-iraqi-protesters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
