LSU has scored 231 points, which represents the highest point total ever for a Southeastern Conference team through its first four games.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to see that we can do this every game against every team,\u201d LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said Saturday after the Tigers\u2019 66-38 victory at Vanderbilt. \u201cThis is who we are as an offense; we\u2019re going to go try to score every time. We\u2019re going to throw the ball around and we\u2019re going to throw it to open up the run. So I\u2019m happy with where we are right now.\u201d\n\nThe numbers back up Burrow\u2019s confidence.\n\nLSU\u2019s 66 points against Vanderbilt marked its highest scoring output ever in an SEC game that didn\u2019t go into overtime. The Tigers scored at least 40 points in each of its first four games and has reached the 55-point mark in all but one of them.\n\nThat\u2019s a remarkable turnabout for a program that hasn\u2019t finished higher than sixth in the SEC in scoring since 2011.\n\nOnly 15 Football Bowl Subdivision players have caught at least five touchdown passes this season. Three of them are from LSU: Terrace Marshall Jr. (20 catches, 304 yards, 6 TDs), Ja\u2019Marr Chase (20-397-5) and Justin Jefferson (21-392-5).\n\nHere are some other stats to note coming out of the fourth week of the college football season.\n\nUCLA\u2019S COMEBACK\n\nUCLA hasn\u2019t had much reason to cheer the last few years, but it has produced two of college football\u2019s greatest comebacks during that stretch.\n\nThe Bruins found a way to beat Washington State 67-63 after trailing 49-17 in the third quarter. Washington State\u2019s collapse caused the Cougars to fall out of the Top 25 after being ranked 19th at the time of the game.\n\nUCLA\u2019s rally from 32 points down comes two years after the Bruins erased a 34-point deficit in a 45-44 victory over Texas A&M.;\n\nThe largest FBS comeback ever came in 2006, when Michigan State beat Northwestern 41-38 after trailing 38-3 in the third quarter.\n\nSaturday\u2019s UCLA-Washington State contest was the highest-scoring game in Pac-12 history. LSU\u2019s 66-38 triumph over Vanderbilt had the fourth-highest point total for any SEC game that didn\u2019t go into overtime.\n\nWashington State\u2019s Anthony Gordon threw nine touchdown passes and was just two shy of the FBS single-game record owned by David Klingler, who threw 11 touchdown passes for Houston against Eastern Washington in 1990. Gordon had 41 completions for 570 yards, the highest single-game total for any FBS player in each of those two categories.\n\nDUELING 200-YARD RUSHERS\n\nToledo outlasted Colorado State 41-35 in a game that featured a 200-yard rusher for each team. Colorado State\u2019s Marvin Kinsey Jr. rushed for 246 yards and two touchdowns on 23 carries, while Toledo\u2019s Bryant Koback had 19 rushes for 228 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nKinsey\u2019s 246-yard performance was the second-highest single-game rushing total of the season, behind the 256-yard outburst by Oklahoma State\u2019s Chuba Hubbard against Tulsa on Sept. 14.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Jonathan Taylor also exceeded the 200-yard mark Saturday, as he rushed for 203 yards in the Badgers\u2019 35-14 triumph over Michigan. Wisconsin rose from No. 13 to No. 8 and Michigan fell from No. 11 to No. 20 after the game.\n\nTaylor has rushed for at least 200 yards nine times in his 30-game career.\n\nPITTMAN\u2019S PRODUCTION\n\nSouthern California\u2019s Michael Pittman had 10 catches for 232 yards Friday in the 21st-ranked Trojans\u2019 30-23 victory over No. 19 Utah, which was ranked 10th at the time of the game.\n\nThose 232 yards receiving represent the highest single-game total for any FBS player this season. The second-highest total this year is by Chase, who had 10 catches for 229 yards in LSU\u2019s victory over Vanderbilt on Saturday.\n\nWEAVER\u2019S TACKLES\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Evan Weaver had 155 tackles last season to rank second among all FBS players, and he leads the nation in total tackles (63) and tackles per game (15.8) this year. Weaver had a career-high 22 tackles Saturday and stopped Mississippi quarterback John Rhys Plumlee just shy of the goal line on the game\u2019s final play to preserve the 15th-ranked Golden Bears\u2019 28-20 victory.\n\nWeaver was one of two FBS players to exceed the 20-tackle mark Saturday. Texas State\u2019s Bryan London II had 22 tackles as the Bobcats edged Georgia State 37-34 in a game that included three overtime sessions. Utah State\u2019s David Woodward has the highest single-game tackle total of the season, as he made 24 stops Aug. 30 in a 38-35 loss to Wake Forest.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP sports writer Teresa M.
