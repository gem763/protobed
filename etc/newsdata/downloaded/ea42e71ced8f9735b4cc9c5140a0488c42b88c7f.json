The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet GOOG, -0.04% , has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it\u2019s fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google\u2019s dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.\n\nGoogle expects the state authorities will ask the company about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday.\n\nCritics often point to Google\u2019s 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.\n\nEurope\u2019s antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.\n\nOne outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google\u2019s popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.\n\nJoining Paxton, a Republican, in the investigation are the attorneys general of almost all U.S. states and the District of Columbia.\n\nGoogle has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.\n\n\u201cGoogle is one of America\u2019s top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThings that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone \u2014 translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\u201d\n\nBut federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company\u2019s impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google\u2019s markets.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, you could just say, \u2018well Google is dominant because they\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford\u2019s Center for Internet and Society. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s created an ecosystem where people\u2019s whole internet experience is mediated through Google\u2019s home page and Google\u2019s other products.\u201d\n\nExperts believe the probe could focus on at least one of three areas that have caught regulators\u2019 eyes.\n\nA good first place to look might be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes \u2014 because the alternative could be not reaching customers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\u201d King said.\n\nAnother visibly huge piece of Google\u2019s business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.\n\nGoogle\u2019s smartphone operating system, Android, is the most widely used in the world.\n\nEuropean regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.", "description": "Many U.S. states led by Texas are looking into if Google has gotten too big and effective at stomping or acquiring rival companies.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN665_Google_ZG_20190718114449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
