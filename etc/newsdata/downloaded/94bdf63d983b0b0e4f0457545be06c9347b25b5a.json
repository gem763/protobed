It's cruel,' Lindsay said.\n\n'It's heartbreaking to do that to a parent, all I have done the entire week is sob,' she said.\n\nThe Home Office sent a letter to Ms Dutton telling her that she has the right to appeal but must leave in 14 days if not\n\nShe has since separated from Lucy's father, Gavin Burls, 34, who now lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire.\n\nAnd the mother-of-one needs to pay out more than \u00a33,000 to fund an appeal for Lucy while reliant on donations as she describes being at 'wit's end'.\n\nShe said: 'It costs \u00a33,140 to apply to appeal and go to court, I have to pay in the next four weeks.\n\n'I've had to beg, I'm at my wit's end. I have paid \u00a3600 - my elderly neighbour gave me \u00a340 towards the Lucy Fund.\n\n'I have broken down in the last few days, I do not know where to turn.'\n\nShe added: 'I was born in South Africa, as my mum moved there when she was quite young, but I have a British passport and my brother Gareth is married to a Welsh girl.'\n\nHer brother has lived in Wales for 13 years and the family tried to be closer together by moving to the area.\n\nGower MP Tonia Antoniazzi is lobbying Home Secretary Priti Patel to intervene and said: 'Both parents and grandparents have UK passports and all live here. This is a ridiculous situation which needs resolving immediately.'\n\nGower MP Tonia Antoniazzi is lobbying Home Secretary Priti Patel to intervene and branded the situation 'ridiculous'\n\nA Home Office spokesman added: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and on the basis of the evidence available.'\n\nThe spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment if the case was ongoing.", "description": "Mother Lindsay Dutton, 30,\u00a0originally from South Africa and now living in Clydach, Swansea, South Wales, is fighting to keep daughter Lucy, two, in the UK after she does not have right to stay in UK.", "authors": ["Emily Webber", "Liz Perkins For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658254-0-image-a-98_1570978867489.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
