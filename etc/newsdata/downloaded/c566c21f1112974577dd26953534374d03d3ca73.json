I studied in Liverpool and I loved it even though I was an outcast and I was bullied, I really learned a lot,\" he said.\n\n(Image: MEDIA WALES)\n\n\"I've always been interested in graphic design and designing games so that's what I've been doing since I finished school and for the last three years I've been designing my own game.\n\n\"Life has always been on the edge for me because I have no family but I've always managed to pull through and this time I fell short with paying my rent.\"\n\nDaniel, who was raised in Newport, south Wales, and then moved to Liverpool aged 12 when his parents divorced.\n\nSince returning to south Wales in 2016, the designer fell on hard times.\n\n(Image: MEDIA WALES)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe continued: \"I purposely stay away from the city centre because most of the homeless people are up to no good and so many are on crack or spice, I've been offered it around 50 times.\n\n\"Drug dealers will come up to you and offer you the drugs but I've never had a problem with drug or alcohol addiction in my life. That's why I sit underneath the bridge and read my books because I'd rather do something productive with my time.\"\n\nRecent data shows there are around 6.57 homeless people for every 10,000 households in Cardiff alone.\n\nIt means the city has one of the highest populations of homeless people in the UK.\n\nBut Daniel has also been offered floor space at various hostels but he insisted he would rather be alone where he can control who he surrounds himself with.\n\n\"On Friday nights people are more generous because they're drunk so they'll hand me some money or a cheeseburger from McDonalds so that is always helpful,\" he added.\n\n(Image: MEDIA WALES)\n\n\"I never thought I'd be homeless and right now I'm sat wondering how my life turned out like this but hopefully I can get back on track.\n\n\"So many people fall on hard times but they have family to fall back on, I never had that and that's the difference but I can't wait to start working again.\n\n\"Businesses may see risks in hiring a homeless person so I hope an entrepreneur or a small business will give me a chance.\"\n\nHe said while he didn't go to university, he taught himself graphic design and software programming. He added that he has worked on a number of projects over the past few years.", "description": "Daniel Smith, spotted sitting under a bridge in Cardiff city centre, was evicted suddenly in September and is pleading for work", "authors": ["Aamir Mohammed", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551796.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MEDIA-WALES-Daniel-Smith-02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
