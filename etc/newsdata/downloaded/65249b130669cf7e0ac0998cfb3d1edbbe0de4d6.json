It was important for us to dig in and get a first-innings score because there\u2019s some spin out there and it\u2019s really good for us,\u201d he added.\n\nOminously for England, Smith, who has two centuries and a 92 to his name in the series, looked unruffled as he calmly dealt with Joe Root\u2019s attack.\n\nHe brought up his fifty, lavishly driving Ben Stokes for four through cover but the Manchester weather ensured the prospect of a third ton in the series will have to wait.\n\nTravis Head was unbeaten on 18 at the close and England will need to make another positive start on Thursday, if they are to restrict the touring side.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\n\u201cObviously, it was a frustrating day for us, conditions didn\u2019t really suit running into bowl but we stuck at it pretty well,\u201d said Overton, who was making his home test debut after being drafted in ahead of Chris Woakes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably slightly behind...but we come back tomorrow, get a couple of early ones and we\u2019ll be right back in the game.\u201d", "description": "Steve Smith continued his outstanding Ashes form, striking an unbeaten 60 as Australia recovered from a bad start to reach 170-3 at the close of the rain-affected first day of the fourth test against England at Old Trafford on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426212310&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831ME"}
