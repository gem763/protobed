Jansen got booed off the field after giving up Choi\u2019s RBI single and Travis d\u2019Arnaud\u2019s sacrifice fly that tied it 6-all.\n\nThe teams combined to use 18 pitchers, two more than on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers closed to 8-7 in the 11th on Edwin Rios\u2019 RBI single with two outs off Pete Fairbanks. But with runners on first and second, pinch-hitter Russell Martin struck out swinging.\n\nColin Poche (5-5) got the win. Fairbanks earned his second save.\n\nCody Bellinger slugged his 45th homer in the eighth, ending the Dodgers\u2019 three-game skid without a home run. It hit the right field foul pole and extended the lead to 6-4.\n\nThe Dodgers led 5-4 in the sixth after pinch-hitter Joc Pederson singled in the tying run and Chris Taylor scored the go-ahead run on a passed ball by d\u2019Arnaud that scooted off to his left.\n\nDustin May, the Dodgers\u2019 seventh pitcher, put the potential tying and go-ahead runs on in the seventh with consecutive hits by Pham and Nate Lowe. But then May struck out Choi and d\u2019Arnaud, and retired Joey Wendle to end the threat.\n\nIn the eighth, May again allowed the potential tying run aboard on a leadoff single to Avisail Garcia, who was thrown out by catcher Will Smith trying to steal second.\n\nThe Dodgers led 2-1 on Max Muncy\u2019s two-run double in the second.\n\nThe Rays tied it 3-all in the fifth on Pham\u2019s two-run double and took a 4-3 lead in the sixth on pinch-hitter Jes\u00fas Aguilar\u2019s RBI single, with Willy Adames scoring on Bellinger\u2019s throwing error in center field.\n\nLATE SWITCH\n\nFor the second straight game, the Dodgers made a late change to their starting pitcher. RHP Casey Sadler got the nod instead of RHP Tony Gonsolin. Sadler tossed two-thirds of an inning. Gonsolin worked in relief, which is what he\u2019ll do in the postseason if he makes the roster, so the team wants to use him in that role down the stretch. The same thing happened Tuesday when Caleb Ferguson replaced scheduled starter Ross Stripling, who pitched in relief, also his likely postseason role.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDodgers: LHP Rich Hill (left knee strain) will throw to hitters Friday and start Tuesday at San Diego. \u2026 3B Justin Turner is recovering from a sprained left ankle, but no return date has been set. \u201cWhen he does come back, I want to be confident he can sustain it,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRays: After an off day, RHP Charlie Morton (15-6, 3.16 ERA) goes for his career-high 16th victory Friday against Boston.\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (14-5, 3.05) pitches Friday at home against Colorado. He is 22-8 with a 3.41 ERA in 41 career starts versus the Rockies.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Austin Meadows homered leading off the 11th inning, sending Tampa Bay to an 8-7 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers that helped the Rays keep pace in the AL wild-card race and prevented the New York Yankees from clinching the AL East title Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/rays_dodgers_baseball_54885_c0-203-4849-3030_s1770x1032.jpg?0294246ef6521e09a2b7e7f1990e53bf9366ca05", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
