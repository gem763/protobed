According to the home\u2019s agent, Tom Banwell, there has been a structure on the site since Roman times, but the first owner on record is believed to have been Queen Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror. Tewkesbury Abbey, located one mile away, was believed to have been a free standing chapel on the site.\n\nThe building as it stands today is Medieval in origin, but the majority of it was built in the 16th century, according to Mr. Banwell, who also points out that each recent owner has worked on both maintaining and modernizing the building, so that it is \"presented in very good order.\" Its many original features, such as leaded windows, stone arches and wooden doors, have been well maintained and lend the property its charm and warmth.\n\nMore: Former Mayfair Home of Aviation Tycoon Sir Frederick Handley Page Asks \u00a318.75M\n\nStats\n\nThis three-story, 3,196-square-foot property has five bedrooms, three bathrooms and three reception rooms, as well as 825 square feet of outbuildings, which are comprised of a studio, a garden room and a carport with storage. The property sits on 0.4 acres.\n\nAmenities\n\nMuch of the attraction of this home lies in its period charm, but it also benefits from a gated driveway, which leads to a wide parking area as well as open-bay garaging. In addition to the house, there are two garden studios/storage areas positioned in outbuildings.\n\nThe private and colorful gardens are arranged predominantly to the front and side, with a southwest facing aspect, so that they catch the sun all day and well into the evening. The gardens are completed by patios furnished for dining and lounging.\n\nDespite the roughly meter-thick walls and deep window sills, Mr. Banwell points out that the home is \"still very light, as lots of the rooms have dual aspects, catching the sun as it swings around to the south and west.\"\n\nFrom Penta: Porsche Debuts a More Affordable Taycan\u2014and Plans a Plug-In Plane\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nOccupying an elevated position high above the Severn Vale, The Mythe is an accessible hamlet situated just north of the market town of Tewkesbury. Located almost at the end of a no-through lane, King John\u2019s Castle is set in a private location, back from the lane behind tall electric gates.\n\nThe medieval, riverside town of Tewkesbury lies on the edge of the Cotswolds, which has much to offer, from forest hikes to weekend boat rides. Tewkesbury is located where the River Avon and the river Severn meet, so the harbor there is excellent for anyone interested in boating, according to Mr. Banwell.\n\nTewkesbury Abbey is one of the main attractions in this historic town, but it also offers everything in the way of shops, restaurants and schools that a modern buyer could want, with sought-after local schools including Bredon School for boys and girls aged 7 to 18, and the Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College for girls aged 11 to 18.\n\nConnections to the rest of the country are excellent, with easy access to the M5 and the M50 motorway. Bristol and Birmingham are an hour-drive away, with London just a little over two hours.\n\nMore: Deal, No-Deal, Delay: How 3 Brexit Scenarios Will Affect U.K. Home Sales\n\nAgent: Tom Banwell, Knight Frank\n\nView the original listing.
