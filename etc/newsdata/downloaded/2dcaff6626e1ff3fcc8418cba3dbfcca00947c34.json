Video appears to show a number of those captured being shot - despite the fact they were unarmed.\n\nMembers of the Turkish-backed militia can be seen pulling a number of the unarmed civilians from the car which has clearly been hit by a barrage of bullets\n\nThe prisoners can be seen forcefully being pushed to the ground and detained in grabs taken from a video that showed the Turkish-backed militia executing a number of prisoners\n\nPeople with hands marked red to symbolise blood pose with the photo of Hevrin Khalaf, a politician and activist for women's rights who was reportedly killed on October 13 by Turkish-backed militias\n\nAmerican troops have been accused of abandoning their former allies to the Kurds to be ethnically cleansed by the Turkish forces.\n\nAnd as the ceasefire draws to a close there are concerns for civilians who may be caught up in the bloodshed between the opposing forces.\n\nThe gruesome images of the October 13 execution have raised an outcry and led to the subsequent concerns that the offensive has paved the way to ethnic bloodletting and war crimes.\n\nThe footage which captured on camera phones and shows how the unarmed civilians were shot dead on the highway after pulled from their cars by the Turkish-backed militia.\n\nThis grab appears to show the driver being pulled from the vehicle before being executed by the militiamen on the side of the road in northern Syria\n\nThe people who were killed appeared to have been travelling along the M4 in this convoy when it was stopped and they were ordered to get out, before they were executed\n\nIn what human rights activists have described as clear evidence of war crimes the prisoners can be seen being pushed into a pile, kicked and herded by the armed men who shout insults at them before shooting them moments later.\n\nOther footage online shows, Khalaf who had reportedly been stoned, before being executed, lying in the rubble.\n\nAnother video shows her driver being pulled from the car they had been in moments before also being killed.\n\nUnder the 1949 Geneva Convention attacks against civilians not taking direct part in the hostilities are deemed to be a serious violation of international law.\n\nExecution: The militiamen filmed themselves executing this restrained prisoner while shouting abuse\n\nMourners attend the funerals of those who were killed in the roadside execution on October 13. The first casket contained the body of Hevrin Khalaf who had been working as the Secretary General of the Future Syria Party\n\nHours after news of the execution was made public there were reports of at least ten others travelling in a convoy were also killed in shelling by Turkish forces.\n\nA number of those killed and injured were journalists, many working for foreign news agencies, when the convoy they were travelling in was struck as it arrived in Ras al-Ain (Sari Kani).\n\nMembers of Syrian, Kurdish and French news teams were reportedly among those caught up in the attack at the border town that advancing Turkish-allied forces have seized.\n\nThe Turkish-backed militias leading the offensive in Turkey are believed to be made up of Syrian Arabs who consider the Kurds long-time foes.\n\nTurkey has demanded that Kurdish forces withdraw from a border strip 19 miles deep into Syrian territory.\n\nIt intends to use the new 'safe zone' to resettle refugees.\n\nSpeaking at a forum on Monday, Erdogan has criticised his allies for not the military action, which he considers to be a crucial battle against 'terrorists'.\n\n'Turkey does not have an eye on any country's territory ... We consider such an accusation as the biggest insult directed to us,' he said at the event in his country's capital.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters belong to the YPG - an off offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been waging a rebellion inside Turkey since 1984.\n\nThe PKK is blacklisted as a terror group by Ankara, the United States and the European Union.\n\nA convoy of US vehicles is seen after withdrawing from northern Syria on October 21. The US has been criticised for the move which many say has paved the way to Turkey's incursion into Syria\n\nMeanwhile, despite some promises it would consider keeping a small residual US military force to secure oil fields in eastern Syria, the US has continued its departure from northern Syria.\n\nThe US departure from the region is a move that has led to widespread international condemnation - none more so than from the locals who have been caught up in the bloody aftermath of the contentious political decision.\n\nThe Kurds were stunned when President Donald Trump two weeks ago abruptly decided to pull US troops out of border areas, abandoning their allied Kurdish-backed fighters ahead of Turkey's invasion.\n\nAngry over the US withdrawal from Syria, residents of a Kurdish-dominated city pelted departing American military vehicles with potatoes as they drove through the border towns today\n\nA video by the Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of armored vehicles driving through the northeastern city of Qamishli. People in the street hurled potatoes at the vehicles, shouting, 'No America,' and 'America liar,' in English.\n\n'Like rats, America is running away,' one man shouted in Arabic. Another shouted obscenities and talked of babies in Kurdish-held areas who have died in the Turkish offensive.\n\nThe scenes encapsulated the Kurds' feelings of betrayal and added a new indignity to an American withdrawal that has been rushed and saw several close brushes with Turkish-backed forces.\n\nAt another location, near the town of Tal Tamr, a group of protesters raised banners to departing US troops late Sunday, according to an Associated Press video.\n\nOne man blocked the way of a US van with a poster reading: 'Thanks for US people, but Trump betrayed us.'\n\nThe Kurdish-led force was a key ally of the United States in the long and bloody fight that eventually brought down the Islamic State group's rule over northeast and eastern Syria.\n\nDisplaced Kurds can be seen waiting to cross to the Iraqi side of the border in northeastern Syria. Thousands have been displaced since Turkey launched its offensive into the region on October 9\n\nA senior Kurdish official, Redur Khalil, said Monday his forces are complying with agreement and are preparing to complete the withdrawal.\n\nHe called for an international mechanism to protect Kurdish civilians who want to stay in their towns after Kurdish-led fighters leave.\n\nMost Kurdish civilians have fled Ras al-Ayn, fearing killings or repression by Turkish-backed forces, and any still in the territory that the Kurdish fighters are leaving are likely to do the same.\n\nMore than 176,000 people have been driven from their homes in the violence.\n\nAbout 70,000 of those are children, the international aid group Save the Children said Monday.\n\nIt said thousands are taking refuge in schools and abandoned buildings without electricity or in open fields in Kurdish-run areas around northeast Syria.\n\n'Thousands of children and their families have once again had to leave everything they own to flee conflict and take shelter in unhygienic conditions without the basic necessities,' said Sonia Khush, Save the Children's Syria Response Director.", "description": "Four days after the offensive was launched on October 9, footage emerged showing the execution of nine apparently unarmed people on the M4 Highway.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/16/19996928-0-image-a-15_1571671558933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
