REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nHere are some reactions to the ruling:\n\nPRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON:\n\n\u201cAs the law currently stands, the UK leaves the EU on Oct. 31 come what may but the exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal,\u201d Johnson told reporters in New York.\n\n\u201cAnd that is what we are working on. And to be honest it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in parliament or in the courts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs the law stands, we leave on Oct. 31 and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal and I think what the people of the country want is to see parliamentarians coming together working in the national interest to get this thing done and that is what we are going to do.\u201d\n\nSPEAKER OF HOUSE OF COMMONS JOHN BERCOW:\n\n\u201cI have instructed the house authorities to prepare not for the recall, the prorogation was unlawful and is void, to prepare for the resumption of the business of the House of Commons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSpecifically I\u2019ve instructed the house authorities to undertake such steps as are necessary to ensure that the House of Commons sits tomorrow and that it does so at 11:30 a.m.\u201d\n\nHOUSE OF LORDS SPEAKER NORMAN FOWLER\n\n\u201c@UKHouseofLords to resume sitting tomorrow, Wednesday, at 3 p.m. and will also sit on Thursday at 11 a.m.,\u201d the speaker said on Twitter.\n\nOPPOSITION LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBYN:\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him. ... I will be in touch immediately (with the speaker) to demand that parliament is recalled so we can question that prime minister, demand that he obeys the law that has been passed by parliament and recognize that our parliament has been elected by our people to hold our government to account. A Labour government would want to be held to account.\n\n\u201cI invite Boris Johnson in the historic words to consider his position,\u201d Corbyn told delegates at the Labour Party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton.\n\nHe has brought forward his main conference speech to Tuesday afternoon.\n\nACTIVIST GINA MILLER, ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THE LEGAL ACTION:\n\n\u201cCrucially today\u2019s ruling confirms that we are a nation governed by the rule of law, laws that everyone, even the prime minister, is not above,\u201d she said. \u201cMPs should turn up for work tomorrow and get on with scrutinizing this government.\u201d\n\nSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY MP JOANNA CHERRY, WHO BROUGHT CASE IN SCOTLAND\n\n\u201cDelighted that @UKSupremeCourt have followed Scottish court & found that @BorisJohnson acted unlawfully in #Prorogation of U.K. parliament. We must resume immediately & he must resign #Cherrycase #Brexit #StopTheCoup,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\nSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY\u2019S WESTMINSTER LEADER, IAN BLACKFORD:\n\n\u201cThis is an absolutely stunning judgment by the Supreme Court today, none of us anticipated that we would have a result such as this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe must be back in parliament immediately, I know the speaker is going to be talking with all the party leaders, we want to get back to work and quite frankly on the back of this Boris Johnson must resign.\u201d\n\nSCOTLAND\u2019S FIRST MINISTER, SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY LEADER NICOLA STURGEON:\n\n\u201cThis is the most significant and historical constitutional court ruling that we\u2019ve had in all of our lifetimes.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson should resign, this is a prime minister who has been found by the UK Supreme Court to have acted unlawfully, seeking to evade scrutiny without good reason.\n\n\u201cIf the prime minister isn\u2019t prepared to do the decent and honorable thing in tendering his resignation, then I think parliament should quickly come together to force this prime minister from office.\u201d\n\nLIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER JO SWINSON:\n\n\u201cThis confirms what we already knew \u2013 Boris Johnson isn\u2019t fit to be prime minister. He\u2019s misled queen and country, and unlawfully silenced the people\u2019s representatives. I\u2019m on my way to resume my duties in the Commons and stop Brexit altogether,\u201d she said.\n\nFORMER CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER JOHN MAJOR:\n\n\u201cParliament must now be recalled immediately to recommence its work, and to receive the prime minister\u2019s unreserved apology,\u201d Major said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNo prime minister must ever treat the monarch or parliament in this way again.\u201d\n\nCONSERVATIVE LAWMAKER ANDREW BRIDGEN:\n\n\u201cI am deeply, deeply disappointed, for our country and our democracy,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cI am truly ashamed of this parliament, the sooner we have a General election the better.\u201d\n\nLAWMAKER FROM PM\u2019S RULING CONSERVATIVE PARTY:\n\n\u201cObviously, we have to accept it. It just highlights the constitutional imbalance that we now have. (Former Labour prime minister) Tony Blair has a lot of responsibility in this regard. His reforms were ill judged and have caused constitutional damage to the country,\u201d the lawmaker told Reuters on condition of anonymity because Conservative parliamentary enforcers, or whips, have asked Conservatives to offer no comment on the ruling.\n\nDEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY LEADER ARLENE FOSTER:\n\n\u201cWe have always respected the principle of the separation of powers upon which our constitutional law is founded. Therefore the judgment of the Supreme Court has to be respected,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\nOPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY TOP LEGAL ADVISER SHAMI CHAKRABARTI:\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson has been called out today by the Supreme Court, the highest court in these islands. He has behaved like a tin-pot dictator,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson needs to reflect on this judgment and consider his position.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBREXIT PARTY LEADER NIGEL FARAGE:\n\n\u201cThe calling of a Queen\u2019s Speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go,\u201d He said on Twitter, referring to the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser.\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION:\n\nDeclines to comment on \u201cinternal constitutional matters\u201d.", "description": "The United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully when he advised Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament weeks before Brexit - and that therefore the suspension was void.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433333499&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N108", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
