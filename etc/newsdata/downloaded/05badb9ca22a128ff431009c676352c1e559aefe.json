The figure for support rose 7 points, while opposition dropped 6 points.\n\nThe latest numbers nearly match an August 2018 poll, conducted as Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, and Michael Cohen, his ex-personal lawyer, were both convicted of crimes stemming from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. In that poll, 42 percent of voters supported impeachment and 42 percent opposed it. Each of the polls has a 2-point margin of error.\n\nAmong those voters who support impeachment now, 59 percent said Trump committed an impeachable offense, a record high since Morning Consult began asking about it in May 2017. The last high was 52 percent, in the August 2018 survey.", "description": "", "authors": ["Morning Consult", "Morningconsult.Com Voter-Support-For-Impeachment-Grows-Amid-Ukraine-Scandal"], "top_image": ""}
