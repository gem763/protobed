I\u2019m shorter than most of the girls. Even though I\u2019m five-foot-eight, I\u2019m not a runway girl and I totally used to feel inferior to some of my friends. Look at Kendall [Jenner] and Bells [Bella Hadid] and Gigi [Hadid] \u2026 they\u2019re all tall and doing every runway. For a while, there was a part of me that didn\u2019t know if I could have the career I wanted if I couldn\u2019t do runway. I don\u2019t think that anymore.\u201d\n\nShe also said that casting directors have criticized her, saying they didn\u2019t think she was a \u201creal model.\u201d Thankfully, Baldwin, has learned to rise above her insecurities. \u201cYou can make it work and not have to do runway, and I\u2019ve done a good job with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself for building a more commercial career that worked for me and being confident about it.\u201d\n\nBaldwin, who just celebrated her one-year wedding anniversary to Bieber, also clarified past comments she made about their marriage being hard:\n\n\u201cI said that when we had first married. Look, marriage is always going to be hard and I think good relationships are the relationships that you put the work into. Specifically, I said that when there were a lot of new things. I had never lived with someone before. I never had to cohabit with somebody in that way, so I was learning how to share space with someone for the first time. We were trying to bend in each other\u2019s direction and learn what was comfortable.\u201d\n\nPretty good self-reflection for 22!\n\nStay in touch.
