These developments have the potential to fracture our fellowship and impair our communion. I have stated this on numerous occasions at the annual National Bishops\u2019 Conference, but sadly to little effect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy own view is that if people wish to change the doctrine of our church, they should start a new church or join a church 0more aligned to their views \u2013 but do not ruin the Anglican Church by abandoning the plain teaching of Scripture. Please leave us.\n\nI\u2019m gay, married, and not leaving my church | Joel Hollier Read more\n\n\u201cWe have far too much work to do in evangelising Australia to be distracted by the constant pressure to change our doctrine in order to satisfy the lusts and pleasures of the world.\u201d\n\nThe Sydney Anglican diocese is notoriously conservative. As well as their official opposition to same-sex marriage, they do not allow women to be ordained as priests or bishops.\n\nOther, more progressive, sections of the church have rejected Davies\u2019 position. In a letter to ministers on Thursday, the Southern Queensland archbishop\u2019s commissary Reverend Jeremy Greaves said there had been \u201cdeep distress\u201d about Davies\u2019 comments and his views did not reflect that of the Anglican Church in Southern Queensland.\n\n\u201cThe Anglican Church in Southern Queensland has taken a different view, expressing its desire to be a welcoming and safe church for all and together to work through admittedly complex issues on which people hold diverse views,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll God\u2019s children are welcome and affirmed in the Anglican Church Southern Queensland and no one is asked to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treasure the unity of the church and the reconciliation of all people and the whole creation wrought by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.\n\n\u201cAsking people to leave the church undermines this fundamental truth.\u201d\n\nHe also noted the Brisbane Diocesan Synod had recently affirmed that trans and gender diverse people can attend Anglican schools.\n\nJo Inkpin (@blessedimp) What a different #Anglican spirit we have in #southernQld! :-) Very grateful for the continued support of my affirming diocese, and this official commitment to a truly welcoming & safe Church which works with diversity & views calls for people to leave as betraying love & Jesus pic.twitter.com/uAfmbIEBJq\n\nArchbishop of Perth, Kay Goldsworthy said all members of the LGBTIQ community were welcome in the Anglican Church in Perth and said it is \u201ctroubling that the welcome is not universal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Perth Diocese of the Anglican Church has long been a strong supporter of the LGBTIQ community and it is an appropriate time to reiterate and emphasise the message of a 2017 resolution of the Perth Diocese,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt affirmed that \u2018all people are made in the image of God regardless of their race, sex, economic background and political affiliation \u2026\u2019 and offered a heartfelt apology to, and sought forgiveness from, the LGBTIQ Community \u2018whom we have hurt by words and behaviour that have not displayed the love of God\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe said the diocese of Perth is committed to fostering churches where compassion and grace abound.\n\n\u201cWe desire to be places where all people will feel safe. We want to be welcoming of all people.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Melbourne archbishop Philip Freier also said the church would not turn people away.\n\n\u201cThe Anglican diocese of Melbourne welcomes all Christians and anyone else to attend Anglican services in Melbourne. Anglicans hold a wide variety of views on social issues, and that is a matter for their consciences,\u201d he said.\n\nThe position of the Sydney Anglican diocese is not surprising, considering it donated $1m to the \u201cno\u201d campaign during the 2017 postal survey, but it is being seen as a push back against more progressive elements of the church.\n\nNSW Uniting church backs school climate strike, Sydney Anglicans and Catholics decline Read more\n\nIn September, the Synod of the Diocese of Wangaratta in Victoria agreed to allow blessings of same-sex marriages. There was expected to be a blessing of the civil marriage of two gay priests from the area, but it was delayed after the decision was challenged to the church\u2019s appellate tribunal.\n\nThe tribunal will consider whether the blessings go against the Anglican Church\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe church has been grappling with the issue of same-sex marriage during the nearly two years since it became legal in Australia.\n\nNext year the Anglican Church\u2019s general synod will hold a conference alongside its special session where delegates can discuss issues facing the church, including same-sex relationships and marriage, and discuss ways forward.\n\nIn a book of essays published by the church\u2019s general synod in July, some of the church\u2019s leading figures in Australia have debated whether the church can bless same-sex unions, arguing the positions both for and against.", "description": "Churches in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria say they welcome everyone and his comments cause \u2018deep distress\u2019", "authors": ["Josh Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/235d67a0179970cd638893814576c9819c47cc92/0_0_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c88afa91c8c3fa99a55c2c3d9ccc2dda", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
