Then they met.", "language": "en", "text": "The King family stepped carefully up the concrete steps, through the narrow doorway and into a two-story log cabin with a painful past. Inside, they examined every inch. The low ceiling. The peeling chestnut walls. Then, the second floor, a tiny space under a pitched cedar-shake roof, where sunlight slips through small windows onto uneven oak floorboards.\n\nJohn B. King Jr., education secretary for President Barack Obama, climbed up the wobbly ladder for a depressing glance at the sleeping quarters. But he quickly came down and crossed his arms, wondering about the people who lived in this cramped space more than 150 years earlier: His enslaved ancestors. Lydia King. Charles King. Anne King. So many Kings once lived here, on this Maryland farm, still owned by direct descendants of the slaveholder, Thomas Griffith.\n\n\u201cMy ancestors must have had full lives, families, relationships, and joy and sadness, but their experiences were so bound up with their exploitation,\u201d said John, 44, president of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group devoted to closing achievement gaps. \u201cMy wife and our two girls are living a life my ancestors could not have imagined, because of their perseverance. Their daily resistance by living their lives made possible ours.\u201d\n\nFor much of the past year, as the nation marks the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved Africans\u2019 arrival to the English colony of Virginia, the Kings have embarked on an anguished family history research project \u2014 and the most unlikely of friendships with the great-great-great-grandchildren of Thomas Griffith. The Kings have always suspected that the Kings before them were enslaved. But they didn\u2019t learn the exact site of that subjugation until February: a 190-acre farm in Gaithersburg called Edgehill, just 25 miles from John\u2019s home in Silver Spring.\n\n[She was captured and enslaved 400 years ago. Now Angela symbolizes a brutal history. ]\n\nSince then, John and several relatives have visited the farm, connecting with Griffith\u2019s descendants, 50-year-old twin sisters, Frances Becker and Amanda Becker Mosko, who co-own the property. Both families have embraced the opportunity to learn about each other\u2019s past with more clarity, despite layers of discomfort and awkwardness.\n\nThe King family\u2019s overtures to the family that once enslaved their ancestors are highly unusual, according to Chris Haley, director of the Maryland State Archives\u2019 slavery project. Descendants of the enslaved usually don\u2019t connect with descendants of the enslaver unless they\u2019ve discovered a genealogical link.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of many people who reach out and are like, \u2018You know what? My family used to work for your family. Hey, how are you doing?\u2019 \u201d said Haley, who is the nephew of \u201cRoots\u201d author Alex Haley.\n\nAmanda Becker Mosko, right, explains the history of her home\u2019s former slave quarters to the Kings, from left, Amina, Mireya, Melissa and John.

BOTTOM RIGHT: John Becker, left, and John King sit on the porch of the farmhouse on the Becker property. (Photos by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Kings, though, are no ordinary family.\n\nOne great-grandson of the oldest-known enslaved King was Lt. Col. Haldane King, who served in the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of black combat pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps; an older brother, William \u201cDolly\u201d King, was one of the country\u2019s first black professional basketball players; another older brother, John B. King Sr., became New York City\u2019s first black deputy superintendent of schools. Haldane King, the Tuskegee Airman\u2019s oldest child, was an Air Force captain who flew KC-135 refueling planes in the Vietnam War; his sister, Janis King Robinson, ran a rural North Carolina hospital. John B. King Sr.\u2019s grandson, Keith Norris, is a renowned UCLA medical school professor and kidney expert. And then there is John B. King Sr.\u2019s son, John B. King Jr., who became the nation\u2019s second black secretary of education.\n\nThe Beckers feel a mix of pride and shame about their family\u2019s past on the Montgomery County property, which their sixth great-grandfather purchased nearly 250 years ago, shortly before the Revolutionary War. The land was passed down to Thomas Griffith, who owned it for 42 years and relied on enslaved labor to run the property.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to apologize but we really can\u2019t apologize, because we didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Amanda, who lives in Pennsylvania, where she helps run her husband\u2019s cemetery restoration business. \u201cI don\u2019t know if an apology would even mean anything to [the Kings] because we really should be apologizing to their ancestors.\u201d\n\n\n\nWilliam \u201cDolly\u201d King, who joined the Harlem Yankees in 1941, was one of the country's first black professional basketball players. (World Photos)\n\n\u201cWe were just born here,\u201d said Frances, who lives at the farmhouse with her father and sells vintage auto parts.\n\n\u201cFriends have asked us, \u2018What do they want? Do they want money?\u2019 \u201d Amanda said. \u201cWe said, \u2018They just want us to be careful with their history.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd they want to be careful with their own history, too. Frances points to Griffith\u2019s sons, who fought for the Confederacy.\n\n\u201cI still appreciate all the veterans in our family and consider Confederates as veterans, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI still have questions about Thomas,\u201d who owned 15 people ranging in age from 9 to 50 before emancipation. \u201cWhy did he do it? I feel bad that he did it. I\u2019d like to think positively that he didn\u2019t hurt the slaves.\u201d\n\n[Two centuries ago, University of Virginia students beat and raped enslaved servants, historians say]\n\nThe Kings have had to gently nudge the Beckers to refer to their ancestors as \u201censlaved people\u201d rather than \u201cslaves,\u201d so that they are not defined by a dehumanizing label. They were also troubled by the old furniture and farm supplies stored in the log cabin. (The Beckers cleaned everything out after the Kings\u2019 first visit.)\n\n\u201cBut Amanda and Frances have been really eager to learn through this process,\u201d John said. \u201cHaving taught high school social studies and having spent my life in education, I thought about how illustrative this experience is of our need to do a better job of teaching in this country about the history of African Americans and the institution of slavery.\u201d\n\n\n\nEstelle L.

(University of Maryland Eastern Shore)\n\n\u2018The gift of this history\u2019\n\nJohn King was in his first year as education secretary when he got a call in 2016 from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. The historically black college said it had discovered that his paternal grandmother, Estelle King, graduated from the school\u2019s predecessor in 1894, before becoming a nurse. Would he want to give a speech at the school? Sure, he said.\n\nThe call prompted a dive into his family\u2019s past. Last year, he enlisted the help of Christine McKay, a retired archivist from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture who had once discovered Obama\u2019s father\u2019s letters, some of which he\u2019d written from Kenya imploring universities in the United States for financial aid.\n\nMcKay wanted to know everything about the Kings. She started with John\u2019s great-great-grandmother, Lydia King, who was born about 1822. She combed the records of the Freedman\u2019s Bank \u2014 established after the Civil War for freed people \u2014 and found two of her accounts, suggesting she\u2019d probably been enslaved. The records also listed the names of four of Lydia\u2019s children: John, Sophia, Anne and Charles.\n\nMcKay consulted the Maryland State Archives, which keeps voluminous records chronicling the state\u2019s history of slavery, which spanned from shortly after its Colonial founding in the 17th century to November 1864, when the state abolished it. (The Emancipation Proclamation of Jan. 1, 1863, freed enslaved people only in seceded states, exempting border states such as Maryland, where there were more than 87,000 enslaved blacks in 1860.) In her search, McKay found a slave census.\n\nThe King family tree A Maryland clan traces its roots to slavery. Many members of John B.

It also disclosed a much bigger revelation: the name of their owner, Thomas Griffith.\n\nQuickly, McKay located the Griffith property in Gaithersburg. Then she learned the property was still in the same family. She even found huge ledgers at the Maryland State Archives full of yellowed paper showing the tax records of enslavers, listing names of the enslaved and their monetary values; the amount next to Lydia\u2019s name, for instance, was $300 in 1853 and then, a couple of years later, $600.\n\nShe also came across an article by a local historian reporting that John\u2019s enslaved great-great-aunt Anne King, then just 15, alerted authorities that Griffith had entertained a visit by a \u201cnicely-dressed stranger.\u201d Thanks to her tip, Griffith was arrested, charged and prosecuted in a military trial in Baltimore for \u201cgiving aid\u201d to a \u201cknown rebel officer.\u201d Griffith was described in the article as a \u201cone-armed farmer.\u201d\n\nFinally, in February, McKay emailed all of her findings to John.\n\n\u201cWow!\u201d John wrote back that night. \u201cThis is amazing. My wife, daughters, and I were all nearly moved to tears by this information. It is incredible to know this history and fantastic to think we can actually go see the property. I cannot thank you enough for the gift of this history.\u201d\n\nBut what next? Cold-call the Beckers? He decided to spread the word among the other Kings first.\n\n\n\nJohn King, center, walks with Amanda Becker Mosko and her father on their property, called Edgehill. The Becker family has owned the land for nearly 250 years. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t wait for permission\u2019\n\nWhen Janis King Robinson, the retired hospital executive in North Carolina, got her cousin John\u2019s email, she knew she had to see the farm in Maryland as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cNobody in this family is shy,\u201d Janis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t wait for permission.\u201d\n\nShe was already traveling to Washington the next month to visit the National Museum of African American History and Culture. After she was done, she figured she\u2019d make an impromptu stop at Edgehill.\n\n\u201cMy husband said, \u2018Without permission?\u2019 \u201d Janis recalled, laughing. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re going to be just fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey Googled the address and made their way to Gaithersburg. They found Griffith Road and then turned onto a long gravely route that led to Edgehill.\n\nThe couple parked and saw the two-story white farmhouse with the greenish-blue shutters. The log cabin loomed right over their parking spot.\n\n\u201cIt took a minute to grab my breath,\u201d Janis recalled.\n\nThen, she approached the door to the main house and knocked.\n\nWhen Frances heard the sound, she thought it might be the person who\u2019d responded to her Craigslist ad hawking 50-gallon water barrels.\n\n\u201cMy name is Janis King Robinson,\u201d she told Frances. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to interrupt your day, but we\u2019ve been recently informed that our ancestors were enslaved here.\u201d\n\nFrances was floored \u2014 and anxious. She never expected to meet the descendants of the people who lived in the log cabin.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Frances told her visitor, \u201ccome on in.\u201d\n\nAs they toured the property, Frances kept referring to Janis\u2019s ancestors as \u201cslaves,\u201d the piece of land where the enslaved were buried as \u201cthe slave cemetery,\u201d and the log cabin where the enslaved slept as \u201cthe slave quarters.\u201d Janis told her, \u201cIt\u2019s important to say they were \u2018enslaved.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a work in progress,\u201d Frances told her.\n\n\u201cShe was as warm and inviting as a human could be,\u201d Janis recalled later. \u201cMy visit there was profoundly spiritual.

(Photos by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018They lived a good life\u2019\n\nLast month, John, his wife, Melissa Steel King, and their two daughters walked slowly behind the Beckers\u2019 farmhouse. They were on their way to the grave of the man who\u2019d enslaved their ancestors.\n\nWhen they reached the gravesite, John paused and read the inscription on Griffith\u2019s headstone: \u201cIn Memory of Thomas Griffith. Born 15th of Sept. 1803, Died 28th of Jan. 1870.\u201d Engraved above his name was a weeping willow.\n\n\u201cThe weeping willow means they lived a good life,\u201d Amanda told the Kings.\n\nJohn said nothing.\n\nFrances said she hoped Griffith treated his enslaved people well.\n\n\u201cSince the slave quarters are so close to the main house, we are thinking they were interdependent on each other and they would have known each other well,\u201d Frances said. \u201cI am putting a 21st-century positive spin on this, but I hope that my ancestors were decent enough people.\u201d\n\nJohn thought about the bravery of his great-great-aunt Anne, who told authorities that Griffith was consorting with Confederates on his property.\n\n\u201cThe family\u2019s participation in the Confederacy,\u201d he said later, \u201cis so telling about their desire to defend the institution of slavery.\u201d\n\nThe Beckers led the Kings to a forested area by the family swimming pool. They stood along a path and gazed at a patch of land. This, the Beckers told them, is where the enslaved Kings are probably buried in unmarked graves. Oak and walnut trees dotted the area, which was smothered below with brush, poison ivy and wild rose hips.\n\nGrowing up, Amanda told the Kings, she\u2019d play by herself along the path and hold tea parties. When she and her sister got older, they\u2019d venture into the bushy area and look for headstones.\n\n\u201cNobody ever stumbled on a headstone?\u201d Melissa asked.\n\nShe tapped her neck with her finger over and over, while John rubbed his chin.\n\nThe Beckers said they\u2019d been told that their grandfather Vestus Wilcox, a lieutenant commander in the Navy, tossed the missing headstones over a hill somewhere. But they didn\u2019t know for sure. The Kings asked, is it possible to conduct a search? Amanda said she and her husband were exploring the possibility of purchasing radar equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be detective work,\u201d Frances said. \u201cWe can find it.\u201d\n\nBefore the Kings left, Amanda fetched something from the house. It was a copy of a slave census Frances had found, listing the names and ages of the enslaved Kings.\n\nStanding by the log cabin, John\u2019s oldest daughter, Amina, 15, grabbed the paper and everyone huddled around her. She and her sister, Mireya, 13, were now scanning the names. The youngest Kings were looking at the names of the oldest-known Kings, all enslaved.\n\nAmina stopped at two of the names: King, Anne F 15; King, William M 13.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Amina said to her sister. \u201cThey were the same age as us.\u201d\n\n\n\nMireya King, 13, walks past an old chicken coop at Edgehill.
