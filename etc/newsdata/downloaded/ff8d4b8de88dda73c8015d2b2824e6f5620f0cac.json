Having now agreed a three-month extension with the EU, the U.K. will head to the ballot box in a bid to break its Brexit paralysis.", "description": "Goldman Sachs has closed its bullish position on sterling with the U.K. set for a general election on December 12.", "authors": ["Elliot Smith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103796285-GettyImages-141373502.jpg?v=1532564070", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
