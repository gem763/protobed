Elizabeth Warren on recently and asked her a simple question. \u201cHow are you going to pay for it?\u201d Colbert was referring specifically to Warren\u2019s radical Medicare for All plan. \u201cAre you going to raise taxes on the middle class?\u201d\n\nWarren, who\u2019s been rising in the polls, wouldn\u2019t answer. She can\u2019t answer honestly, if she wants to have any hope of being president. Nor can any of the other Democrats running president be honest about their agendas. That\u2019s made clear by a recent Harvard/Harris Poll, the results of which got far too little attention.\n\nColbert wasn\u2019t the first person to press Warren for an answer about middle-class taxes. She dodged the same question during the Democratic debate last week. All she would say is that \u201ccosts are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down.\u201d\n\nCost wasn\u2019t the question. A middle-class tax hike was.\n\nThere is no question that taxes would go up on the middle class \u2014 by a fantastic amount \u2014 if Warren were able to get Medicare for All enacted.\n\nAt $3.2 trillion a year \u2014 which is a completely unrealistic lowball estimate \u2014 you could double everyone\u2019s income tax, and double corporate income taxes, and you\u2019d still be a trillion dollars short.\n\nThat\u2019s just for Medicare for All. Warren and most of the other candidates have also embraced the even more radical Green New Deal, along with free college, free preschool, free housing, with each pretending that only \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d will have to pick up the tab.\n\nAs a Heritage Foundation report noted, even if you took every penny earned by every taxpayer who makes more than $200,000, you would cover only half the costs of all this largesse.\n\nJoe Biden, despite his attempts to portray himself as a centrist, is hardly better. On health care, he\u2019s even more dishonest than Warren. Biden claims he just wants to make a little tweak to Obamacare by creating a \u201cpublic option.\u201d But he knows, as does everyone who\u2019s looked into it, that the public option would very quickly become the only option. That\u2019s why the actual centrist Democrats who were still around in 2010 refused to let Obama include it Obamacare in the first place.\n\nThe rest of Biden\u2019s agenda is a slightly watered-down version of those proposed by Warren, Bernie Sanders, and the rest. It will still require enormous tax hikes \u2014 a fact he never seems to mention.\n\nWhy all the deception? A recent Harvard/Harris Poll of 2,531 registered voters shows why.\n\nUnlike other polls, this one attempted to gauge support for Trump and a Democratic opponent without using any names. The question just described their respective agendas.\n\nHere\u2019s the text:\n\n\u201cWhich candidate are you more likely to vote for:\n\n\u201cA presidential candidate who stands for the green new deal on climate change, Medicare for all, free college tuition, opening our borders to many more immigrants and raising taxes to pay for these programs.\u201d\n\nOr \u2026\n\n\u201cA presidential candidate who stands for lower taxes and reduced government regulations, strengthening our military, strengthening our border to reduce illegal immigrants, standing up more to China and Iran and seeking better trade deals for the US.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to come up with a more concise description of what President Donald Trump and any of the leading Democratic candidates stand for.\n\nThe result: A stunning 61% say they\u2019d vote for Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nAmong independents, 65% chose the Trump agenda, as did every age group except those 18-34, who split 50-50. Even among Democrats, more than a third said they\u2019d vote against the candidate pushing the current Democratic agenda.\n\nThe poll went further and broke out specific policy issues. There wasn\u2019t one item on the Democratic agenda that came in the top six. Only 38% say they were likely to vote for a candidate who promised to \u201craise taxes to pay for these programs.\u201d On the other hand, 83% said they\u2019d likely support a candidate who promised to lower taxes.\n\nHow will the eventual Democratic nominee overcome this huge gap in support for the two visions for the country? Lie about Trump\u2019s agenda? Deceive voters about their own? Or some combination of the two?\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
