Not meeting Putin is a story nearly all of us could tell, but Grazer came closer than most, right into the ante-room of the Russian President\u2019s office, in fact.\n\nGrazer\u2013producer and founding partner, along with friend and director Ron Howard, of Imagine Entertainment\u2013had gone to Moscow for one of what he has dubbed his \u201ccuriosity conversations,\u201d which are pretty much just what they sound like. You may be one of the great power players in Hollywood, responsible for such cinematic classics as A Beautiful Mind and Splash, and such TV hits as Arrested Development and Friday Night Lights, but that doesn\u2019t mean you know everything. So Grazer tries to sit down with accomplished people and simply ask them questions. \u201cI lay out the ground rules,\u201d he says, \u201cand basically I say, \u2018I\u2019m going to research you; it\u2019s not going to be hard. This won\u2019t be your worst date.'\u201d\n\nOf course, \u201caccomplished people\u201d doesn\u2019t have to mean nice people, and Putin was always high on Grazer\u2019s wish list. In 2016 he got his shot, when friends in Hollywood connected him with friends in Russia who threaded the Kremlin needles and got him his audience. But, as Grazer recounts in his new book Face to Face: The Art of Human Connection, it all came apart in the final seconds, when he was about to be ushered into Putin\u2019s presence and his Kremlin handler explained to the press secretary what the purpose of the meeting was.\n\n\u201cWe are here because Brian loves our country,\u201d the escort explained. \u201cHe would like to do a film about our President. He feels as if for 20 years, people in the West have been misled about what happens in Russia, which he loves.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

I came here simply to meet the President.\u201d By immediate and mutual agreement, the meeting was scuttled, and today, Grazer tells the story with a measure of regret.\n\n\u201cSometimes in your blind passion of wanting something to happen, you ignore cues,\u201d he said when I met him for coffee at his hotel during his recent working visit to New York. \u201cYou go ahead and do it anyway and it ends up bad. This was like a Hitchcock movie.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t pretend I come to the topic of Grazer with anything like pure objectivity. I worked closely with him and Howard during the production of Apollo 13, which was based on the book I co-authored with mission commander Jim Lovell\u2013and I loved getting to know those guys. But in exchange for my lost detachment, I got a close-up look at how one of Hollywood\u2019s most prolific production tandems works.\n\nSince its founding in 1986, Imagine has earned nominations for 43 Academy Awards and 196 Emmys for its movies and TV shows. In 2016, the company ended its production deal with Universal Studios and is now producing its own content in multiple genres across multiple platforms, while keeping a foot in traditional movie and TV production.\n\nA big part of the team\u2019s success and the kind of work they produce is a certain lack of pretense, an unembarrassed ingenuousness that is captured in the entertaining life lessons that fill Face to Face. Grazer came to Hollywood by way of a zigzag academic route, majoring in psychology at the University of Southern California, switching to cinema and television, then graduating and spending a year in law school before starting in TV production. But it\u2019s the psych-major part of him that may have the most influence on his work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in the hows and whys of human communication,\u201d he says. \u201cHollywood is 1,000% that\u2013almost more than talent. There are agents who only say good things because they know it produces oxytocin.\u201d\n\nSome of Grazer\u2019s experiences in communication have come to him in unexpected ways. In his book, he tells a story\u2013quite bravely, it must be said\u2013of having a conversation with Jonas Salk, the developer of the first polio vaccine. Grazer deeply admired Salk, and worked hard to get a spot on the great man\u2019s calendar. A meeting was at last arranged, in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Grazer spotted Salk across the room, approached him with a nervousness that quickly bloomed into full-bore panic and, when he was finally in front of him, proceeded to throw up. Salk, he writes, responded like the doctor he was, physically supporting him, asking a waiter for orange juice to boost his blood sugar and helping him clean up.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s kind of the most embarrassing thing that could happen,\u201d Grazer says. \u201cBut he probably thought, \u2018Wow this guy really cares.\u2019 I think that moment made him really engage.\u201d Engage a lot. After their initial, messily brief meeting, they scheduled a later, eight-hour curiosity conversation at Grazer\u2019s home that also included George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.\n\nIt\u2019s that embrace of human fallibility and vulnerability that is at the core of so many of the most memorable characters in the stories Imagine tells: the Nobel laureate who can master math but not his own mind, the astronaut who is denied his only chance at a lunar landing. (Grazer writes about the 1996 Oscars ceremony at which Apollo 13, nominated for Best Picture, lost. Lovell, two seats away from him, reached over and clasped his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t make it to the moon either.\u201d)\n\nOne of Grazer\u2019s favorite insights in Face to Face belongs not to him, but to Oprah Winfrey, who has interviewed thousands of people in her career, and found that nearly all of them\u2013Presidents, royalty, billionaires\u2013have the same question when the camera goes off: \u201cWas that O.K.?\u201d No matter who we are, we want to please and we carry that innate, even sweet fear that we\u2019re failing to please. \u201cIt means you care,\u201d Grazer says, \u201cso I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be asking \u201cIs this O.K.?\u201d a lot soon, as Imagine continues to expand far beyond its roots. Its new content will include more multicultural movies, pre-school TV, documentaries\u2013like the recently released Pavarotti and the earlier Grammy-winning Beatles doc Eight Days a Week\u2013and even podcasts and Broadway adaptations of Parenthood and A Beautiful Mind.\n\nGrazer and Howard are 68 and 65 respectively, both keeping a teenager\u2019s pace, but the question inevitably arises of whether the partnership that has churned out nearly four decades of work is beginning to think about the body of work that will endure in the decades that will come after them. Grazer answers philosophically.\n\n\u201cHonestly, very honestly I just live in the present,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t really know if tomorrow\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nHe very much seems to be enjoying all of his todays. I\u2019m put in mind of a moment several years ago, when I was seated at a table with Grazer at the annual TIME 100 Gala, the dinner at which this magazine celebrates the 100 most influential people in the world. The gala is, by any measure, a glittery affair\u2013especially for journalists who, to be frank, don\u2019t get out all that often. But Grazer surely gets out all the time\u2013to Oscar ceremonies, White House screenings, overseas premieres, royal audiences.\n\nAll the same, during the dinner, I spotted Grazer looking about, smiling, taking in the faces, wholly in the moment. He caught me looking, and he beamed. \u201cThis is just great!\u201d he said. As a cradle-to-grave outlook on life, that\u2019s a pretty hard one to beat.\n\nWrite to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the September 30, 2019 issue of TIME.", "description": "Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer of 'Splash' and 'A Beautiful Mind' explains why he wants us all to be more curious about other people.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Kluger"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brian-grazer-face-to-face-the-art-of-human-connection-crop.jpg?quality=85", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
