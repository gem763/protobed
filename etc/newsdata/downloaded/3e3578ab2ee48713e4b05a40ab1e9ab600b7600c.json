And where the heck is it?\u2019 \u201d Steadman said.\n\nThe house, one of a handful of Yankee Barn Homes in the area, was like nothing he had seen in Washington.\n\nThe New England-based company has been turning old barns into new houses for nearly 50 years. Company representatives did not have records indicating where the barn used to build the house came from, but they told him it was an industrial area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDistinguished homes for sale in the D.C. region share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Yankee Barn Home in Fort Washington | The 1978 post-and-beam house in Fort Washington, Md., was built with materials repurposed from an old barn. It is listed at $485,000. (Stefan Walter)\n\nSteadman was taken aback by a comment his home inspector made when inspecting the house before he purchased it. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have more money in nails in this one house than I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u2019 \u201d Steadman said.\n\nIt turned out the nails, which were also repurposed from the barn, were hand-forged by a blacksmith. The nails weren\u2019t the only unusual aspect of the 1978 house.\n\n\u201cHe was pointing out . . . how old the trees were and the way they were cut and nailed. They just don\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Steadman said. \u201cI had no idea what he was talking about until he started showing me around. It was fascinating. It\u2019s like living in a historic home except it was built in the late \u201970s.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe focal point of the main living space is the massive brick fireplace. Steadman was told that the original owner wanted to re-create a fireplace she had seen in a children\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the first things you notice when you walk in,\u201d Steadman said. \u201cIt\u2019s commanding.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that it wasn\u2019t designed properly to draw smoke. The second owner tried installing a fan but eventually put in a wood stove. Steadman said the heat from the stove is enough to warm the entire room in the winter.\n\nAD\n\nUntil he bought the house in Fort Washington, Steadman wasn\u2019t familiar with the area. Now he and his wife, Leanne Erdberg Steadman, are huge fans.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Fort Washington, it\u2019s on the river,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fort is a national park, and it\u2019s less than a mile down the road. I\u2019m an outdoors person. We like to run, cycle and hike. I didn\u2019t know this existed. I didn\u2019t know you could have miles of hiking trails within a mile of your house and still be 25 minutes from D.C.\u201d\n\nEven though neither one of them is a golfer, the Steadmans like that the house backs up to National Golf Club. The course is a great place for twilight walks.\n\nAD\n\nSteadman said he feels fortunate his first house was big enough indoors and outdoors to accommodate large gatherings.\n\n\u201cIt does entertain well in terms of the space,\u201d Steadman said. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s important because it allows us to bring friends and family together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,920-square-foot house, on a half-acre, is listed at $485,000.\n\nListing agent: Kaye Placeres, RLAH Real Estate\n\nPrevious House of the Week\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nAD", "description": "HOUSE OF THE WEEK | Fort Washington house was built in the1970s with repurposed barn materials.", "authors": ["Kathy Orton", "Reporter", "Editor Covering The Washington Metropolitan Area Housing Market"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/o_r-cjBuq702lpeQ98oVsigFLfc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V5FDNGXGYII6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
