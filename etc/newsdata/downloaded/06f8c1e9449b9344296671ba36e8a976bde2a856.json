That\u2019s something I haven\u2019t really had. I can\u2019t wait for us to actually get some NBA minutes on the court to start creating that bond on the court.\u201d\n\nLOAD MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Mavericks have hinted that they might ease in Porzingis a bit, even after giving him extra time to recover from the injury after deciding he wouldn\u2019t play the rest of last season following the seven-player trade.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cI think it\u2019s conceivable that back-to-backs will be something we look at early in the season.\u201d\n\nTHE OTHER 7-3 GUY\n\nThe Mavericks also added 7-3 Boban Marjanovic, whose career began in Texas with rival San Antonio four years ago. The Serbian finished last season in Philadelphia, helping the 76ers reach the second round of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cSince he walked in the door about six days ago from the world championships, has been a huge breath of fresh air,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cHe came in smiling and hugging everybody. He said, \u2018I landed in Dallas, it just feels like a great place, I love it here already.\u2019 That\u2019s a winner.\u201d\n\nTHE SHOOTERS\n\nSeth Curry is back after playing last season in Portland. Stephen Curry\u2019s younger brother had his career breakthrough with the Mavericks in 2016-17 before missing the next season with a stress fracture in his leg. He chose the Trail Blazers over the Mavericks two summers ago. Tim Hardaway Jr., the second-biggest acquisition for Dallas in the Porzingis deal, could be the starting shooting guard.\n\nTHE VETERAN\n\nJ.J. Barea is back with an 11th season with the Mavericks after missing about half of 2018-19 with a torn Achilles tendon. With Nowitzki\u2019s retirement after setting a record by spending all 21 of his seasons with the same franchise, Barea is the last remaining player from the title team. He spent three seasons with Minnesota after Dallas won the championship.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kristaps Porzingis can now count in days what he once couldn't even really count at all: his return to the court for a real game for the first time since a knee injury nearly 20 months ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/mavericks_media_day_basketball_97654_c0-195-3677-2338_s1770x1032.jpg?8a91787157d1f06bb140b4bd6377da7651fb145b", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
