He took no questions from the media. In fact, he described the operation in five sentences:\n\nToday, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\n\nIn contrast, Trump gave a detailed description of the raid, what he saw and heard while watching the operation from the Situation Room, details of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, and answered numerous questions.\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering, crying, and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased them down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it in addition. Test results gave certain, immediate, and totally positive identification. It was him,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, and total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid. Much having to do with ISIS origins, future plans, things that we very much want,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also talked about the details leading up to the raid, telling reporters al-Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks before, shedding insight into U.S. intelligence capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe knew about where he was going, where he was heading. We had very good information that he was going to another location. He did not go,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo or three efforts were canceled because he decided to change his mind, constantly changing his mind.\u201d\n\nHe said finally they saw he was held up in a compound \u2014 which U.S. intelligence knew a lot about.\n\n\u201cWe knew it had tunnels. The tunnels were dead ends for the most part. There was one we think wasn\u2019t, and we had that covered just in case,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the breach of the compound.\n\n\u201cWhen we landed with eight helicopters, a large crew of brilliant fighters ran out of those helicopters and blew holes into the side of the building, not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby-trapped,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey blasted their way through the house in a very heavy wall. It took them literally seconds. By the time those things went off they had a beautiful big hole and they got everyone by surprise.\u201d He said 11 children were taken into custody. He also said that a number of adults died, and some were taken into custody. He said the number of those killed would be announced soon.\n\nTrump said the flight to the compound took about an hour and 10 minutes, including travel over dangerous territory. He said the aircraft took gunfire coming in, which was \u201cimmediately terminated.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning, they were shot from the airships,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described al-Baghdadi\u2019s last moments.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward. He was whimpering, screaming, and crying,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also revealed that a canine was involved in the operation, and was hurt in the tunnel, but was evacuated. \u201cA beautiful dog, a talented dog, was injured and brought back.\u201d\n\nHe said the raid began at 5 p.m. ET on Saturday. \u201cThe liftoff started moments after that.\u201d\n\nTrump also described efforts to identify al-Baghdad after his death.\n\n\u201cThey went in with lab technicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey brought body parts back with them. There was not much left. The vest blew up. They did an on-site test and it was a very quick call that took place about 15 minutes after he was killed and it was positive.\u201d\n\nTrump also revealed there were two wives with Baghdadi who were killed. He said they were wearing vests that did not detonate, making it difficult for U.S. forces.\n\nHe also revealed there was a robot that went into the tunnel. \u201cWe had a robot just in case because we were afraid he had a suicide vest on and if you get close to him and he blows it up, he\u2019s going to die. He had a very powerful suicide vest.\u201d\n\nHe said back in the situation room, he and the team were getting full reports literally on a minute-by-minute basis.\n\n\u201cThey gave us a report: \u2018Sir, there\u2019s only one person in the building. We are sure he\u2019s in the tunnel. Trying to escape. But it\u2019s a dead-end tunnel\u2019\u2026when he blew himself up the tunnel collapsed on top of everything and his children. So he led his three children to death.\u201d\n\nHe talked about the uncertainty of the situation as it was unfolding.\n\nWe weren\u2019t 100 percent sure about the tunnel being dead-ended. It\u2019s possible there could have been an escape hatch somewhere along we didn\u2019t know about. So we moved very, very quickly. These people, they were moving \u2014 they were chasing.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Trump shared details of the raid that led to the death of terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a nearly 50-minute live press conference", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/6437d6_trump-baghdadi-37995-president-donald-trump-listens-question-as-he-speaks-e1572200506398-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
