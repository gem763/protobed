Our staff stand ready to provide assistance if needed.\"\n\nThe latest trouble involving England fans abroad follows similar scenes during recent trips to Amsterdam, Dortmund and Porto.\n\nTravelling supporters had been urged by UK police and the Football Association to behave themselves ahead of the game amid fears they would be drinking heavily ahead of the Friday 8.45pm off time.\n\nUntil night fell, there had been little trouble, with police involvement limited to telling fans to remove flags from buildings.\n\nBut ugly scenes erupted just before 7pm local time after hundreds of fans took over a small square in the city's Old Town, chanting and singing.\n\nBottles were pelted at officers before a recorded warning was played in English telling those gathered to \"obey the law\" and that face coverings and pyrotechnics are illegal.\n\nCzech police then advanced, firing stun grenades as English fans were forced back through a small archway.\n\nAbout 10 men were pinned into a corner and made to lie face down, while another was seen being held on the floor nearby as officers secured the scene.\n\nA pool of blood was left on the cobbled street where one man was pinned to the ground.\n\nAt least one England fan was injured and he was seen receiving treatment in the back of an ambulance, while others were marched one by one with hands behind their backs into a police van.", "description": "A total of 18 England fans were arrested over football-related disorder in Prague.
