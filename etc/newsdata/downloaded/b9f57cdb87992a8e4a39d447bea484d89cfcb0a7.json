Overall, the remained just above the 50 boom/bust line but just printing at 52.0 versus 53.1 forecasts.\n\nThere is a good reason to think that Germany may be teetering on the verge of recession now as the manufacturing sector continues to contract. Today\u2019s news also makes it perfectly clear that Germany desperately needs some fiscal stimulus to offset the massive demand shock from the growing global geopolitical tensions and the slowdown in trade. German officials remain reluctant to increase the budget, but the longer they wait the worse the situation may become. It\u2019s clear that monetary policy has run out of gas and fiscal tools are needed to jump-start the economy.\n\nThe EURUSD meanwhile tumbled below the 1.1000 figure again but found support ahead of the 1.0950 level, but its just a matter of time before the unit retests the multi-month lows near the 1.0900 handle unless Germans start to shift their policy.\n\nMeanwhile, in the UK the markets are awaiting the ruling of the Supreme Court on the legality of PM Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament. Although the ruling may go against the government Mr. Johnson may use other means to keep Parliament out of session. At this point, however, the political maneuverings has become noise as the clock ticks towards the hard Brexit deadline.\n\nhas moved away from the 1.2500 level but has generally held bid as the market remains optimistic about a deal. However, with September nearly gone, the pressure on politicians will grow and if the pair loses the 1.2300 figure that will be a sign of markets losing hope.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, DAX.
