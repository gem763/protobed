Here\u2019s Why We Can\u2019t Stop Watching it.", "language": "en", "text": "Not so on \u201cFriends.\u201d Matters of behavior and economic inequality only seemed to bring them together. Take the show\u2019s 29th episode. Everybody goes out for a nice dinner to celebrate Monica\u2019s promotion, and Phoebe, Joey and Rachel order the cheapest items on the menu, then balk at evenly dividing the bill. Income turns those three against the other three, until Monica loses her job and Joey valiantly offers to pay for her $4 coffee \u2014 with Chandler\u2019s money. The theme song didn\u2019t lie: They really were there for each other , punch lines and all. That thereness was the show\u2019s intangible hook. The writers could engineer plots for the directors to orchestrate. But these six actors working together, on anything, on nothing \u2014 it was the highlight of many a person\u2019s week. That thereness was phenomenally elastic, too. These were six people who could snipe at one another, who could fight and lie and practice what we\u2019d now call radical honesty yet keep so many secrets, who can break up (many times, in many ways) but, as a sextet, keep snapping back together. I like them that way, as half a dozen. I like them in tandems and trios, as human math problems, as chemistry experiments. Maybe 10 times I\u2019ve watched Chandler, Joey and Monica break down and confess to the other three that, yes, Chandler did pee on Monica\u2019s jellyfish sting.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many takes that sequence took or how much caffeine was consumed. But it\u2019s never less than a marvel of harmonized hysterics. That kind of exclamatory, high-energy comedy could happen in any configuration of the cast because it was the best such collection in the history of television. Other hall-of-fame comedies, like \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and \u201cCheers,\u201d had wits and jesters and clowns mixed in among the goody-goodies and grumps. Some, like \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and the first few seasons of \u201cDesigning Women,\u201d were all zingers, personality and delivery before the whole thing went to schtick. A few permanently watchable jewels like \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cFrasier\u201d sneaked in a combo platter of slapstick, vinegar and fuzzies. But the proportions were bigger on \u201cFriends.\u201d They went for more, more often, and rarely missed.", "description": "With one of the best casts in TV history, \u201cFriends\u201d makes excellent comedy look easy.", "authors": ["Wesley Morris"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/arts/08Friends-cover/08Friends-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
