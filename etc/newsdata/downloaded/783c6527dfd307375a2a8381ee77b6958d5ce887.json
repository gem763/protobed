However, while searching for said someone, it was Chantelle Atkins (Jessica Plummer) who caught Jags\u2019 (Amar Adatia) eye, and it subsequently came to light that they knew each other \u2014 as he\u2019d went on a date with her years earlier while they were in school. With a connection having been made between the two characters, could Jags end up proving instrumental getting Chantelle away from domestic abuser Gray (Toby Alexander-Smith)?\n\nYes, after their run-in with Ben (Max Bowden) several weeks back, Kheerat (Jaz Deol), Vinny (Shiv Jalota) and Jags Panesar arrived in Albert Square tonight, and they made clear their intention of tracking down their sister \u2014 who was revealed to be none other than Iqra\u2019s (Priya Davdra) girlfriend, Ash (Gurlaine Kaur Garcha).\n\nThe trio of siblings split up, and they proceeded to search the market, the park and The Queen Vic. Vinny eventually tracked Ash down, and the pair had something of a heart-to-heart \u2014 although Ash reinforced how she\u2019s never returning home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, another interesting discovery was made this evening, as \u2014 during his hunt for his sister \u2014 Jags set his sights upon Chantelle, and \u2014 although the two never exchanged any words \u2014 it was incredibly clear that he recognised her.\n\nJags recognised Chantelle (Picture: BBC)\n\nA conversation with Kheerat later provided us with an explanation, as it came to light that Jags and Chantelle had went to school together \u2014 and that they once even went out on a date.\n\nWith both Kate Oates and Jon Sen having proven their ability at expertly linking separate narrative threads on more than one occasion, it\u2019s safe to assume that this connection will be of huge importance going forward.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s worth noting that this is really the first time we\u2019ve learned something about Chantelle\u2019s life prior to her marriage to Gray.\n\nSince moving into the Square, Gray has isolated Chantelle in every way possible. With the exception of the time she spends with her family, her every move is monitored by her abusive husband \u2014 who\u2019s made clear that he\u2019d rather she remained at home where he can keep an eye on her.\n\nJags\u2019 arrival will provide for yet another interesting dynamic to be explored should the two characters get reacquainted, and thus it could allow for viewers to see a different side of Chantelle.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Gray will inevitably feel threatened by Jags\u2019 presence on the Square. The solicitor has demonstrated how insecure he is in the past \u2014 something which he tends to take out on his wife \u2014 so learning that one of her ex\u2019s lives close by will no doubt be a huge source of conflict for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMind you, the Panesars have proven that you don\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of them, so he\u2019ll need to be careful that he doesn\u2019t release his pent-up aggression in front of any one of the siblings.\n\nSpeaking of which, perhaps Jags will prove instrumental in exposing the abuse Chantelle has been suffering at the hands of Gray? It\u2019s certainly a possibility \u2014 especially if they end up bonding or reminiscing about days gone by.\n\nIt\u2019s also a possibility that Jags could be familiar with Gray as well. The two shared a glance during tonight\u2019s episode, and the subtext certainly seems to suggest there was more to said glance than meets the eye \u2014 quite literally \u2014 but whether or not they\u2019re affiliated remains to be seen.\n\nEither way, linking the Panesars with Chantelle has opened up a multitude of narrative possibilities, and that\u2019s something that EastEnders has been excelling at since Kate and Jon came on board.\n\nWhether or not the abuse will be exposed by Jags remains to be seen, but Chantelle may have found herself a friend at the very least, and it\u2019ll be great to see this new dynamic explored further.\n\nEastEnders continues Thursday 31stOctober at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Mel Owen exposes Sharon Mitchell and Keanu Taylor\u2019s secret publicly?\n\nMORE: 12 soap spoiler pictures: EastEnders engagement, Coronation Street feud, Emmerdale betrayal, Hollyoaks revenge\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jags arrived in Walford to find his sister, but he ended up making another huge discovery.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chantelle-Gray-Atkins-and-Jags-Panesar-in-EastEnders-1ead_1572377714.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
