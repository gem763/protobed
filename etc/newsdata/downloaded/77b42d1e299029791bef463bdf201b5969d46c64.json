The maintenance work was completed prior to the incident.\n\n'The site is secure and is surrounded by a walled and gated compound.\n\n'There is no direct access to the chimney from ground level. The ladders which are currently attached to the structure are temporary and were installed by the contractor to facilitate access to complete the maintenance repairs.\n\n'These start from a height of 15 foot above the ground. We are working with our specialist contractor to remove the ladders.\n\n'We are continuing to support the Police with their investigations and our thoughts are with those affected by the incident at this sad time.'\n\nToday flowers have been left at a wall which surrounds the chimney as people pay their respects to the man who has lost his life. There is currently a small police presence with two vans parked next to the chimney.\n\nThe failed rescue operation had been witnessed by hundreds on the ground, as bystanders watched rescue teams bring the victim to the ground. Counselling services have offered in Carlisle for support for anyone affected by the incident.\n\nSome claims on social media this morning suggested several bystanders had taken deckchairs to the scene to watch the tragedy unfold. It was also claimed in a nearby supermarket people stopped to watch the rescue operation with coffee.\n\nIt is unclear how long ago the maintenance work on the chimney stack was completed. Cumbria Police, who have launched an investigation, said the results of their inquiry will be passed to the Coroner.\n\nOperators use a hydraulic platform at Dixon's Chimney in Carlisle, Cumbria, as part of the attempted rescue operation\n\nThe operation began when emergency services, drafted in from as far afield as Glasgow and Lancashire, were called at around 2.20am yesterday morning.\n\nResidents living near the former cotton mill chimney in Shaddongate heard the man's cries and raised the alarm.\n\nSome local reports suggested the man may have climbed up the ladder to the top of the chimney hours earlier, although it is not clear why.\n\nScott Mattinson, 24, and his fianc\u00e9e Nadene, 25, live in a flat next to the Chimney and heard 'wailing' from 10.30pm. They 'thought nothing of it' but were woken by more noise at 1am.\n\nThe couple dismissed shouting as coming from a 'drunk outside' and went back to sleep. Then at 3am they realised police were outside.\n\n'We looked out of the window and saw blue lights flashing,' said Mr Mallinson, who soon realised there was a man at the top of the chimney.\n\n'We saw this man, flailing around in a bit of a panic,' he said.\n\nLocal residents were then evacuated from the immediate area.\n\nOne business owner, who's is based close to the chimney, was visibly upset as she recalled what she had witnessed.\n\nShe said: 'At about 3.30am the helicopter had lights on the chimney. There were police cars and fire engines around. You could see the commotion around the area.\n\n'I was looking on Facebook at about 4am to see if anyone was saying anything and there was nothing.\n\n'At about 8am I saw the man trapped at the top of the chimney. He was upside down. I could see a leg and an arm sticking out from the side of the chimney.\n\n'The man's shirt was hanging off halfway down the chimney. The emergency services were doing everything they could.'\n\nThe woman, who does not want to be named, said she spent the majority of the day inside because of the police cordon.\n\nShe said: 'I was giving the community support officer stood outside coffee. He couldn't look up at the man.\n\n'I couldn't believe how they got him down. That was scary, that was the worst part. Everybody saw it. You can see it from everywhere, from every part of town.\n\n'It's really affected the community today. Next door used to play music in the morning but today it's off. I just hope they find out why he went up there. I think a lot of people who saw it might need help today.'\n\nFrom first light it became clear that the emergency services faced one of the most challenging rescue operations imaginable.\n\nThe man, who had no clothing on his upper body, was hanging upside down and had only been saved from falling to his death by his boot becoming trapped between the ladder and the chimney wall.\n\nThe man communicated with emergency services earlier in the day but had gone silent for several hours before he was brought down\n\nHe is thought to have scaled the ladder under cover of darkness and probably become trapped when he lost his balance at the top.\n\nPolice initially were able to check he was alive by communicating with him via a drone with a speaker attached.\n\nSuperintendent Kennerley said: 'We asked him to do some basic commands and he cooperated, so we could see he was still able to understand what we were saying.'\n\nPolice said they knew the man's name and officers were with his family.\n\nThe incident happened on the coldest night of the autumn so far in sub-zero temperatures and as the day progressed fears for his safety increased as the man become 'unresponsive.'\n\nNot knowing if he had lost consciousness or was dead, rescue efforts continued with a rescue helicopter, firefighters, mountain and urban rescue teams, who specialise in working at height, called in to help.\n\nTwo failed attempts were made to reach him from above.\n\nEfforts to rescue him directly from a helicopter and then by dropping a specialist rescue team 'on to the chimney' had to be abandoned for fear of the backdraft from the aircraft causing the man to fall to the ground.\n\nAn appeal was put out for a cherry picker tall enough to reach him and one arrived from Glasgow by early afternoon for a fresh rescue bid.\n\nShocking footage showed the man dangling upside down near the top of Dixon's Chimney in Carlisle, Cumbria\n\nIt is unknown why the man had scaled the chimney in the early hours of the morning\n\nBy this time police said there was 'no signs of life' and hopes he could be saved were fading rapidly.\n\nUsing the giant cherry picker, another ladder was fixed to the opposite side of the chimney near the top.\n\nTwo members of the Lancashire fire and rescue team were then able to clamber on to the top of the chimney and set up a 'safe systems of work' before reaching the man and turning him around. By this time he had been dangling upside down for more than 14 hours.\n\nThe next problem was how to transfer the man into the cherry picker. With hundreds of people watching from a distance, this final act in the drama was carried out in fading light.\n\nDixon's Chimney was restored by Carlisle City Council in 1999. Originally it was 305 ft tall, but in 1950 it was shortened to 290 ft\n\nAt 4.30pm there were groans from stunned onlookers as the seemingly lifeless man was gently lowered on ropes down the side of the chimney to rescuers in the cage of the cherry picker about 80ft below.\n\nHe was then brought down to the ground.\n\nThe listed structure, which was built in 1836 top prevent huge amounts of smoke generated by the adjacent cotton factory becoming noxious to the rest of the city, was once reported to be the eight largest chimney in the world.\n\nRoads around the structure, built in 1836 and a prominent local landmark, was closed.\n\n**Do you know the victim or why the tragedy happened?
