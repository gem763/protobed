Instead, it was dreamed up by resume-writing firm Novor\u00e9sum\u00e9 to show how even the most prolific and varied career can be distilled into a single page. By employing smart design and concise language, it manages to list all of Musk's qualifications and achievements \u2014 and still has room left over for interests and hobbies.\n\nWe've long argued that resumes are made stronger by keeping them brief and to the point. The example below proves that anyone can cover their professional achievements in a single page if they actually try. Here it is in all its glory.\n\nTo be honest, we're not entirely sure about the skill and competency bars - who scores themselves? - but otherwise this is a pretty solid career summary.\n\nOf course, it's sometimes prudent to include additional information that is relevant to the job at hand; especially if you're stepping into a different industry.
