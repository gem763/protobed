Rather, a FOIA request satisfies the statute\u2019s 'reasonably describes' requirement so long as it 'enable[s] a professional employee of the agency who [i]s familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort,\u2019 \u201d a group of seven government oversight groups wrote in a January complaint to the Interior Department.\n\nThe changes in the final rule come as the Interior Department has faced mounting scrutiny over its public records policies, including an investigation by the Interior inspector general into its use of an \u201cawareness review\u201d policy that allows political appointees to view documents in which they are referenced prior to release. Neither the draft of Interior\u2019s FOIA policy nor the finalized rule mentions that policy, which was issued separately.\n\nDuring the drafting of its FOIA rule, Interior took notes from both the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for ways to deal with a surge in public records requests. EPA\u2019s latest FOIA update has been the subject of its own heavy criticism.\n\nThe Interior Department called the revisions just part of a broader goal to create an \"efficient and more transparent\" FOIA process at the agency.\n\n\"The FOIA is often explained as a means for citizens to know \u201cwhat their government is up to,\u201d said Jorjani in a statement. \u201cThis non-partisan regulatory reform went through a robust public notice-and-comment process and is a major step forward in ensuring transparency and accountability in the FOIA program.\u201d\n\nWhile conservation and government watchdog groups were happy with the changes, they said concern still lingers over how the Interior Department, and its newly confirmed solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, will implement FOIA requests internally.\n\n\u201cThe most concerning stuff seems to be gone,\u201d said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that they haven't even been following their own rules previously. Even if this rule got rid of the really bad stuff, Jorjani has not been afraid to ignore the rules when it\u2019s politically expedient or would be embarrassing for [Interior Secretary] David Bernhardt.\u201d\n\nKevin Bell, staff counsel for the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said the intent to withhold rather than provide more public information still remains clear in Interior\u2019s latest FOIA rule.\n\n\u201cWhile the impact of some sections may have been softened, the intent of this regulation is still to provide less information to fewer requesters on a slower basis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Interior Department did not return a request for comment on the reasons behind the changes to the final rule.", "description": "The Interior Department has removed heavily criticized language from the final version of its public records rule that some worried would give officials too much leniency in withholding documents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bernhardtdavid_070819upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
