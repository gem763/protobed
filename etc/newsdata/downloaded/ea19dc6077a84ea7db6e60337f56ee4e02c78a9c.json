A normal part of childhood has turned into a political agenda. Just in time for Christmas shopping, toymaker giant Mattel introduced a gender-neutral doll.\n\nMattel is going the way of other large corporations as far as trying to prove just how woke it is. This is a toymaker, though, and its market is children. When Mattel jumps on the woke wagon it is because of adult decisions and what toy developers and marketing experts think will sell to children. For example, the description of the new doll makes it sound as though it answers a need felt by \u201chalf the world\u2019s kids.\u201d The dolls look like \u201ca slender seven-year-old with short hair\u201d.\n\nThe doll can be a boy, a girl, neither or both, and Mattel, which calls this the world\u2019s first gender-neutral doll, is hoping its launch on Sept. 25 redefines who gets to play with a toy traditionally deemed taboo for half the world\u2019s kids. Carefully manicured features betray no obvious gender: the lips are not too full, the eyelashes not too long and fluttery, the jaw not too wide. There are no Barbie-like breasts or broad, Ken-like shoulders. Each doll in the Creatable World series looks like a slender 7-year-old with short hair, but each comes with a wig of long, lustrous locks and a wardrobe befitting any fashion-conscious kid: hoodies, sneakers, graphic T-shirts in soothing greens and yellows, along with tutus and camo pants.\n\nSo any feminine features of say, a Barbie doll, are eliminated so that boys will be comfortable playing with dolls. This is where I point to the obvious and say that boys have played with dolls for quite some time \u2013 they are called action figures. They, too, have wardrobe options and fun additional accessories. Little boys have played with G.I.Joe in past generations and today\u2019s kids have a vast variety of options in the superhero market. I just find it hard to believe there is a huge outcry for genderless Barbies out there.\n\nThe development team at Mattel claims it\u2019s science, you see, and kids don\u2019t want \u201cgendered\u201d toys.\n\nTo develop the dolls and their accessories \u2014 all components are original, and research and design took 18 months \u2014 Mattel worked with physicians and experts knowledgeable about gender identity as well as 250 families across the country, including children of all gender identities. \u201cWe talked to them about what they had in dolls currently and what they were looking for,\u201d Culmone said. What did the researchers learn? \u201cThe kids didn\u2019t want to be told that boys had to play with cars and girls had to play with dolls,\u201d Culmone said. As for the parents, researchers found a growing concern around gendered toys for their children \u2014 though a generational divide on the subject was certainly evident, Chidoni said. \u201cWhile this was something that was really innate to the kids, it was something that, in some cases, was a little bit harder for their parents to understand,\u201d she said.\n\nIt feels like we\u2019ve been here before. Didn\u2019t the same kind of debates about boys and girls and the toys they choose to play with come in back in the days of the early feminist movement? Weren\u2019t we told to give little boys dolls to play with and little girls trucks? It turned out, though, that given a choice boys and girls naturally select traditionally \u201cgendered\u201d toys. It is probably a biological trait \u2013 you know, science.\n\nBarbie dolls are marketed to 3 \u2013 12-year-olds. This doll is carefully not called a gender-neutral Barbie, but a product in a new line of dolls \u2013 Creatable World. Unlike Barbie, this new doll is \u201crelatable\u201d not \u201caspirational\u201d.\n\nThe new line, introduced on Wednesday and called Creatable World, is intended to reflect our culture \u201cas the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity,\u201d said Kim Culmone, the Mattel executive who led the team that designed the new dolls. Available in different skin tones, each doll comes with two wigs of different lengths \u2014 hair types include curly, straight and braided \u2014 and several wardrobe options that allow children to style the doll with \u201cshort or long hair, or in a skirt, pants or both,\u201d Culmone said. Each kit, as they\u2019re called, costs about $30.\n\nIn our world, dolls are as limitless as the kids who play with them.

That\u2019s simply nonsense, though, and one reason for the decision to produce a gender-neutral product includes the argument that President Trump\u2019s administration is changing public policy as it concerns the LGBTQ agenda.\n\nAnd while Mattel doesn\u2019t want to wade into political waters on the subject \u2014 \u201cwe see this as something that\u2019s all about play and not about politics,\u201d Chidoni said \u2014 gender identity has become highly politicized in recent years. The Trump administration has reversed transgender-friendly policies of the Obama administration regarding schools, prisons and military service. And in recent years, many school districts have faced contentious legal challenges over which bathrooms transgender students should be allowed to use.\n\nThis doll wasn\u2019t developed during the Obama administration, though, and those years were when the whole bathroom argument came into play with the transgender community. This is all about the politicization of sexual identity. The party of science wants to bend science certainities into a world where more than two genders exist. Basic biology refutes that. The transgender community is a miniscual one within the total general population. Pandering to the woke parents who wish to shove a political agenda on their children is abusive. Biology dictates that there are two sexes, genders. It\u2019s all the rage to dip into the transgender world now because of the normalization seen in our culture. The entertainment industry is busy pretending that this is all perfectly normal behavior and not the behavior of a small minority in the general population. This kind of decison of a major toymaker falls into line with that agenda.", "description": "A doll for everyone", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2ee6f19c-3719-45cb-8240-3ef159ff0cbd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
