Currently, the closest competitor to NatWest's deal is Barclays' 60 per cent loan-to-value two-year fix at 1.21 per cent, while the closest to Barclays' 85 per cent deal is Post Office Money's 1.56 per cent two-year fix.\n\nMonthly payments on the same mortgage as above would be \u00a3801 on the Barclays deal and \u00a3 805.50 on the Post Office rate.\n\nMoneyfacts's Darren Cook said: 'Higher loan-to-value fixed mortgage rates may be creeping up, but the affordability of these products may be helped by the fact that of the 107 two-year fixed rate products at maximum 95 per cent loan-to-value available to first-time buyers, 98 are available up to a maximum mortgage term of either 35 or 40 years.\n\n'This enables borrowers to lower their monthly repayments by spreading the cost, which as a result makes them more affordable \u2013 helping to pass stringent affordability tests when applying for a mortgage.'\n\nStretching out a mortgage over a longer term like this drops monthly repayments, reducing outgoings and lets the borrower qualify for a larger loan, but it also adds to the cost a borrower will pay over the life of the loan.\n\nFor example, the average two-year fixed rate mortgage at 60 per cent loan-to-value is currently 1.80 per cent.\n\nTaken over 25 years, the monthly repayments on a \u00a3200,000 mortgage would be \u00a3828, while the monthly repayments if it was taken over 40 years would be just \u00a3585, some \u00a3243 cheaper each month.\n\nHowever, over the lifetime of the mortgage the borrower on the latter would pay \u00a332,199 extra in interest.\n\nSome mortgages allow borrowers to make overpayments each month (usually up to 10 per cent of the mortgage balance over a year) and on a longer term mortgage, this can have the same effect as shortening the term - it can help clear your loan more quickly and you'll end up paying much less in interest.\n\nFor some, taking a longer-term loan but making regular overpayments could be the most flexible option.\n\nNot all deals allow for this facility and you'll have to check whether or not yours does.
