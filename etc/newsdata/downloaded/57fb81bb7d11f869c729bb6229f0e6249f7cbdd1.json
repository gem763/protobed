Absolutely not. Think about how uncomfortable it would be to sit on a long-haul flight wearing seven pairs of trousers. Think of the sweat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we do commend Gel for taking a stand against those far too strict baggage rules.\n\nGel told Vice: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to pay the fee for the excess baggage because it was only 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs).\u2019\n\nGel is glad she avoided the fees, but wouldn\u2019t suggest anyone copies her travel hack. It wasn\u2019t much fun.\n\n\u2018It was really hot,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t recommend other people do it.\u2019\n\nMORE: Adopting as a single woman at 40 is the best thing I have ever done\n\nMORE: Nando\u2019s launches new Mozam wrap inspired by the Mozambique flag\n\nMORE: Mindfulness can help you get over your biggest fears\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Gel Rodriguez didn't want to pay up for her carry-on luggage being over the weight limit... so she got creative.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90414985_1571390555.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
