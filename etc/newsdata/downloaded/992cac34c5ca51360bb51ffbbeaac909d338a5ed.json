(Eric Espada/Getty Images)\n\nLamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are that good.\n\nOr the Miami Dolphins, tanking or not, are that bad.\n\nOr both.\n\nThe 2019 season got off to a predictable start Sunday in South Florida for both the Ravens and the Dolphins. Jackson, the second-year quarterback who unseated former Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco last season in Baltimore, showed off his improved passing and the Ravens beat the Dolphins, who are firmly entrenched in a rebuilding process.\n\nNo one could have guessed, however, just how lopsided this would be, as Jackson threw five touchdown passes and the Ravens won, 59-10.\n\nWeek 1 of the NFL season is all about overreactions. So no one should jump to immediate conclusions. But for one Sunday, at least, Jackson looked like a league MVP candidate. And the Dolphins looked like a team already on the clock for the top overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.\n\n[Nick Foles knocked out of Jaguars debut with injury to his left shoulder]\n\nThe Ravens led, 42-3, in the first half. Coach John Harbaugh, taking no chances, dialed up a fake punt with a 35-3 lead. Jackson threw four first-half touchdown passes, two of them to rookie wide receiver Marquise Brown. Jackson ended the day with a perfect passer rating of 158.3 and gave way to backup Robert Griffin III to finish.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns were the darlings of the NFL\u2019s offseason and entered this season as the favorite in the AFC North, in the minds of many. But the Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers, the division\u2019s traditional powers, seemed amused \u2014 or perhaps bemused \u2014 during training camp about all that Browns hype. So be it, they seemed to be saying. The story will be told on the field once the season gets underway.\n\nAnd while the Browns were struggling Sunday to a season-opening loss at home against the Tennessee Titans \u2014 could it really be the same, old Browns? \u2014 Jackson and the Ravens were sending an early-season message in Miami. Harbaugh perhaps overpromised during training camp, talking about how the Ravens would revolutionize how offense is played in the NFL. But, at least in the opener, Jackson and the Ravens delivered.\n\n[How the NFL\u2019s pass interference instant replay rule will work in 2019]\n\nJackson was dynamic last season as a rookie, taking over for an injured Flacco and helping the Ravens back to the AFC playoffs. But that was accomplished with Jackson\u2019s mobility in a run-first offense that complemented Baltimore\u2019s dominant defense. Jackson had six touchdown passes all of last season.\n\nHe nearly matched that total Sunday as part of a 17-for-20, 324-yard passing performance. Everyone knows what Jackson can do as a runner. The Ravens\u2019 big task this season will be limiting Jackson\u2019s carries and not exposing him to too many hits. But the real key to the season will be how much polish Jackson has added to his game as a pocket passer. He doesn\u2019t need to be great in that department. Merely competent probably would be good enough, given what else he can do. He is off to a terrific start.\n\nIt all clicked Sunday for the Ravens. Brown had touchdown catches of 47 and 83 yards. He finished with four catches for 147 yards to live up to his \u201cHollywood\u201d nickname. Tight end Mark Andrews also topped 100 receiving yards, with eight catches for 108 yards. Mark Ingram ran for 107 yards in his Ravens debut. Griffin threw a touchdown pass after taking over for Jackson.\n\nAnd the Dolphins had no answers. They vehemently denied that they were in tanking mode even after trading left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills to the Houston Texans for a king\u2019s ransom of draft picks, including two first-rounders and a second-round choice. And, granted, Miami Coach Brian Flores and his players undoubtedly will do all they can to win games this season. These wins and losses go by Flores\u2019s name, after all, and the players are playing for jobs.\n\nBut the Dolphins, it appears, are truly dreadful. They possess four first-round selections and four second-round choices over the next two NFL drafts. They could be headed to having the No. 1 overall pick in next year\u2019s draft, which would give them the right to take the prospective franchise quarterback of their choice.\n\nFor now, though, it\u2019s Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback, at least until Flores opts to give an opportunity to Josh Rosen, the former top 10 pick by Arizona obtained by the Dolphins after the Cardinals decided to turn things over to Kyler Murray. Rosen made a late appearance Sunday. And there\u2019s not much help for the quarterback, whether that\u2019s Fitzpatrick or Rosen.\n\nIt will be a long, long season for the Dolphins and their fans. That much seemed certain Sunday. Draft night can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAntonio Brown agrees to deal with Patriots hours after release from Raiders\n\nFalcons extend Julio Jones, making him the NFL\u2019s highest-paid wide receiver\n\nThe Aaron Rodgers-Matt LaFleur debut wasn\u2019t dazzling but the new-look Packers did just enough", "description": "Led by their second-year quarterback, the Ravens overwhelmed the hapless Dolphins.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Pm", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
