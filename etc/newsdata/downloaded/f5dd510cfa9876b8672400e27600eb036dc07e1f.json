The model is, arguably, the biggest change for the Corvette since the sports car was first introduced in 1953.\n\nPlacing the engine behind the seats allows the Corvette's hood to be lower.\n\nThe Corvette has changed a lot over the years, but it has always remained a front-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports car. The new 2020 Corvette has its engine behind the seats, a change that radically alters the car's appearance and, certainly, how it will feel to drive.\n\n\"In terms of comfort and fun, it still looks and feels like a Corvette, but drives better than any vehicle in Corvette history,\" said GM president Mark Reuss.\n\nPutting the engine behind the driver and passenger -- called a rear mid-engined layout -- places the heaviest single part of the car much further to the rear and closer to the driver's seat, making the car feel as if it's centered around the driver. Also, the occupants sit further forward in the car, closer to the front wheels.\n\nThe new Corvette will not be available with a manual transmission, only an eight-speed automatic.\n\nWithout having to look out over a bulging hood housing an engine, the driver will have much better visibility. A square-shaped steering wheel will allow for a clear view of the Corvette's large digital gauge cluster. Having more weight over the back wheels will also help with acceleration.\n\nRead More", "description": "General Motors has unveiled the eighth generation of the Chevrolet Corvette.
