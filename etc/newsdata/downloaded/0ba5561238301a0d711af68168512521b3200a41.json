Martin Center for Academic Renewal", "language": "en", "text": "A sense of urgency has taken hold of higher education leaders nationwide. Reports of declining community college graduation rates and the lack of skilled workers have led policymakers and college leaders to sound the alarm and vow to do whatever it takes to lower the high rate of \u201cdropouts\u201d and equip students to meet the labor demands of an evolving economy.\n\nFor example, in a policy brief about non-completing students written for myFutureNC (an organization focused on educational attainment), Anita Brown-Graham and Catherine Moga Bryant describe the \u201chigh numbers of non-completers in North Carolina\u201d and argue that \u201cwhile many enroll, too few North Carolina students who attend two- or four-year institutions complete their programs.\u201d According to Brown-Graham and Bryant, the two primary reasons for why students fail to complete a credential in community college are \u201cinadequate preparation and difficulty navigating the higher education system.\u201d\n\nBut is community college student performance as dire as Brown-Graham and Bryant suggest? After all, 42 percent of North Carolina\u2019s community college students do graduate, transfer, or are still enrolled with 36 credits after six years. And while it\u2019s true that the majority of community college students do not complete credentials, are all \u201cnon-completers\u201d failing to find meaningful employment?\n\nAs it turns out, the story is much more complex than many college officials acknowledge.\n\nIn their analyses of why students don\u2019t finish their studies, policymakers overlook an important subset of the community college population: students who want to take a few courses, but who don\u2019t intend to earn a credential or transfer. These students, sometimes referred to as \u201cskills builders\u201d or \u201cupskillers,\u201d only take the few specific courses they need to gain new skills for employment or to advance in their careers. Skills builders commonly take courses that train students in specific work-related fields such as information technology or business management.\n\nUniversity of Michigan professor Peter Riley Bahr closely studies skills builders and criticizes how policymakers often define success in terms of credential completion. In his 2016 study entitled The Labor Market Returns to a Community College Education for Non-Completing Students, Bahr stated:\n\nCommunity college students who do not complete a credential\u2026 are presumed incorrectly to be a relatively homogenous group\u2026The members of this group are far from homogenous with respect to the ways that they use the community college\u2026 in contradiction to popular notions, students who leave community college without a credential have not necessarily failed to achieve their goals or dropped out.\n\nInstead of solely measuring student success based on credential attainment, Bahr argues that job earnings and employment retention are also valuable measures. A paper he co-authored in 2013 states:\n\nThere are also significant metrics of success related to workforce development\u2014like gains in earning and job retention\u2014which can occur outside of the [community college] completion framework. Examining non-completion pathways and better measuring employment outcomes can help colleges develop stronger programs that reflect the diverse goals of their students.\n\nFor his research, Bahr conducted a study of over a million California community college students during a six-year period who met the following criteria:\n\nWere first-time college students\n\nWere between the ages of 18 and 50\n\n\u201cHad at least one non-zero quarterly earnings record in the 10 quarters prior to college entry and at least one non-zero quarterly earnings records during or after enrollment in the [California Community College] system.\u201d\n\nFar from being mere dropouts or a deadweight to society, Bahr found that skills builders in certain fields experienced notable financial gains or \u201creturns\u201d for the college credits they earned.\n\nFor example, students who took six college credits in public and protective services increased their annual earnings by $1,952; six credits in engineering and industrial technologies resulted in an annual wage increase of $1,600; for business and management students, $808; and for information technology courses, $524.\n\n\u201cGiven that the cost of two three-credit courses in a California community college is a mere $276, these returns are large indeed,\u201d wrote Bahr.\n\nAdditionally, Bahr said that some of his previous research indicated that \u201cabout one in six students in California\u2019s community college are highly successful non-completers.\u201d That means that, according to Bahr\u2019s findings, nearly 17 percent of the students who might be considered \u201cfailures\u201d were found to be \u201chighly successful\u201d in the workforce.\n\nUnfortunately, little is known about the success of non-completers in North Carolina. That\u2019s partly because the community college system primarily uses credential completion as its metric of student performance, which is evident in its 2019 Performance Measures for Student Success report. The report evaluates all 58 of its colleges based on the following seven measures:\n\nBasic Skills Student Progress\n\nStudent Success Rate in College-Level English Courses\n\nStudent Success Rate in College-Level Math Courses\n\nFirst Year Progression (progress toward credential or transferring)\n\nCurriculum Student Completion (students aiming to earn an associate\u2019s degree)\n\nLicensure and Certification Passing Rate\n\nCollege Transfer Performance\n\nThose measures, which were agreed upon by \u201ccollege leaders, subject-matter experts, and research professionals,\u201d fail to take into account non-completing skills-builder students\u2014 despite the fact that the community college system has the ability to analyze some student wage data. In fact, the system already tracks the earnings of career and technical education students which it analyzes in this NC Perkins database. The database seems to be the closest the system has gotten to documenting student performance outside of the credential completion framework.\n\nThe NC Perkins data suggest that, in specific fields, there are non-completers in North Carolina who possibly experience an increase in earnings. There are several categories where the percentage of \u201cstudent placement\u201d in \u201cemployment, military service, or apprenticeship program\u201d is higher than the percentage of students who earned credentials. The data are summarized in the following table:\n\nBill Schneider, the North Carolina Community College system\u2019s associate vice president of research and performance management, told the Martin Center that the system is working to compile additional data about student success and make it publicly available in the coming months\u2014hopefully that will include more precise information about the earnings of non-completers.\n\nIn the end, the state of community college success doesn\u2019t seem to be as grim as policymakers paint it to be. As Bahr has shown, students who choose to leave college without a degree or certificate comprise a significant portion of the community college population, and they shouldn\u2019t all be considered \u201cfailures.\u201d Doing so creates an inaccurate picture of community college performance, which disadvantages students in two ways.\n\nFirst, it distracts\u2014or blinds\u2014officials to the real needs of students and how colleges can best serve them. Secondly, it feeds into the completion crisis narrative which contributes to policymakers\u2019 excessive focus on credential attainment. That excessive focus on credential attainment hurts the employment prospects of skills builders who, despite being competent workers, might appear \u201cless qualified\u201d on paper.\n\nPolicymakers should discard their narrow\u2014and superficial\u2014view of community colleges\u2019 mission. People attend community colleges for a wide number of reasons: to explore their interests, to figure out whether college is for them, to earn credits toward a four-year degree, to earn a workforce credential, or simply to gain new, specific skills. It\u2019s time that these leaders recognize that only some of those goals fit into the current \u201cmust complete\u201d narrative.\n\nShannon Watkins is senior writer at the James G.
