Alani told investigators he had been involved in a contract dispute with the airline, and had disabled the system so he could get more overtime working to fix the problem. He was charged with \u201cwillfully damaging, destroying or disabling an aircraft.\u201d\n\nBut prosecutors presented what they said was new evidence in court, alleging that Alani lied about traveling to Iraq in March to visit his brother, whom he had previously told a colleague was a member of ISIS, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nThey also said that they had found an ISIS video on Alani\u2019s phone showing an execution, accompanied by an Arabic text message from Alani to somebody else asking Allah to take revenge against non-Muslims, according to NBC News. They also said he had sent $700 to somebody in Iraq.\n\nIn response, Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley denied Alani bond. \u201cI have evidence before me that suggests you could be sympathetic to terrorists,\u201d he said, ruling Alani posed a danger to the community and a flight risk. If convicted on Friday, Alani faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAlani\u2019s defense said his actions did not endanger the people on board the airline. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe he intentionally endangered the safety of people,\u201d said assistant federal public defender Christian Dunham, arguing that the flight had a backup navigation system. \u201cI think the government is blowing this out of proportion.\u201d\n\nThe plane ended up not taking off after the incident on July 17. As it sped down the runway, pilots were alerted to an error and aborted takeoff, and the plane was returned for maintenance at which point a piece of foam was discovered glued into the flight\u2019s navigation system.", "description": "Prosecutors said a mechanic accused of tampering with an American Airlines flight in Miami had terrorist sympathies.", "authors": ["Billy Perrigo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HpG28fwbDJuEgmdgcSNrsw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/197e71e7086e81ef7347e274300d101b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
