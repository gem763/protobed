Engineers felt the project was an unethical use of AI, and Google allowed its contract to elapse in March of this year.\n\nArtificial intelligence remains a core future growth plank for Google more generally.\n\nPichai said in a first-quarter earnings call this year that almost three-quarters of Google's advertising clients are using automated ad technologies which make use of machine learning and AI. The firm makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising, reporting $33 billion in revenue for the second quarter. Google's fast-growing cloud business also uses AI. And its new health division is part of the firm's efforts to commercialise research produced by its AI lab, DeepMind.\n\nLaura Nolan, a former Google engineer who was recruited to Project Maven and subsequently resigned over ethical concerns, told Business Insider via email that while Pichai may be speaking out of self-interest, she agrees that blanket AI regulation may be too broad an approach.\n\n\"Laws shouldn't be about specific technological implementations, and AI is a really fuzzy term anyway,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Sandra Wachter of the Oxford Internet Institute also told Business Insider that the contexts in which AI is used change how it should be governed.\n\n\"I think it makes a lot of sense to look at sectorial regulation rather than just an overarching AI framework. Risks and benefits of AI will differ depending on the sector, the application and the context. For example, AI used in criminal justice will pose different challenges than AI used in the health sector. It is crucial to assess if all the laws are fit for purpose,\" said Wachter. She said that in some cases existing laws could be tweaked, such as data protection and non-discrimination laws.\n\nHowever, both Nolan and Wachter cited specific areas which may require new laws to be written \u2014 such as facial recognition.\n\n\"Algorithmic decision-making is definitely an area that I believe the US needs to regulate,\" Nolan said. \"Another major area seems to be automated biometric-based identification (i.e. facial recognition but also other biometrics like gait recognition and so on). These are areas where we see clear problems emerging due to new technological capabilities, and not to regulate would be to knowingly allow harms to occur.\"\n\n\"The use of AI in warfare absolutely needs to be regulated \u2014 it is brittle and unpredictable, and it would be very dangerous to build weapons that use AI to perform the critical function of target selection,\" she added.", "description": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai argued existing laws could be repurposed to regulate AI sector by sector, rather than creating new ones.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc7a559b14bf404247504f2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
