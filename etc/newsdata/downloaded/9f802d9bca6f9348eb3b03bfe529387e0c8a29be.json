Another son, Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n, may also have been captured, but his status remains unconfirmed and there are rumors he may have been killed in a battle with Mexican soldiers.\n\nAlfonso Durazo, Mexico\u2019s top public security official, issued a statement saying authorities encountered Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n at a house in Culiac\u00e1n in the afternoon, but were forced to retreat amid a shootout with cartel members. The statement acknowledged the ongoing violence in the city but made no mention of Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo. One Mexican news outlet reported that a lawyer for the Guzm\u00e1n family also confirmed that Ovidio was freed.\n\nA U.S. law enforcement official told VICE News: \u201cbelieve the news.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican government reportedly plans to hold a press conference at 6 a.m. local time on Friday to explain the situation.\n\nVideos circulating on social media showed utter chaos in Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Sinaloa and a stronghold of the state\u2019s namesake cartel. In the footage, what appear to be cartel gunmen are seen firing heavy weapons in the streets, apparently at military or police, while panicked civilians run. Mexican police and soldiers have reportedly blocked off highways into the city and many major streets, leaving the city on lockdown.\n\n\u201cThe city's taken, the airport is paralyzed,\u201d one Culiac\u00e1n resident told VICE News, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of cartel reprisals. \u201cWe've never lived anything like this ever, and whoever says this is not new is lying.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe resident said he was eating lunch near the state prosecutor\u2019s office when gunfire first erupted around 4 p.m. local time this afternoon, a timeline that squares with other accounts and videos posted on social media. The civilian source said several people were wounded in the encounter, but Mexican government officials have not confirmed any injuries or deaths.\n\nSeveral sources on the ground in Sinaloa have reported to VICE News that 39-year-old Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n, El Chapo\u2019s eldest son, may have also been targeted in the military operation, with rumors flying that he had either been killed or captured, with some claiming he too was briefly in custody but either escaped or was released.\n\nOne unverified video shared on Twitter purportedly showed a cartel radio handset with gunmen threatening to harm the families of Mexican soldiers unless Iv\u00e1n is released.\n\n\"Let him go, and go home in peace, nothing will happen to you,\u201d one voice says on the recording. \u201cIf not, you're fucked\"\n\nAnother voice then says, \"Get to the families, to the families, if he's not back, fuck them.\"\n\nHad Ovidio remained in Mexican custody, he would have potentially faced extradition to the United States to stand trial in the same Brooklyn courtroom where his dad was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year. Sources confirmed that a photo of Ovidio in custody \u2014 showing him with bushy black hair, a light blue collared shirt, and necklaces \u2014 was legitimate. Other similar images had also been circulating on Twitter. One source said Ovidio had suffered a minor head injury during the arrest, another said he was \u201ccompletely fine.\u201d\n\nListen to the VICE News podcast \"Chapo: Kingpin on Trial\" for free on Spotify.\n\nOvidio \u2014 one of at least 15 sons fathered by El Chapo \u2014 was indicted on drug trafficking charges on Feb. 21, just a week after his father was convicted of leading the Sinaloa cartel for over three decades, using brutal violence to build the organization into Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal group. In El Chapo\u2019s absence, his sons \u2014 known as Los Chapitos or Los Menores \u2014 have taken over their father\u2019s faction of the cartel, with Ovidio and Iv\u00e1n playing key roles.\n\nA conflict has reportedly been brewing in recent months between El Chapo\u2019s sons \u2014 known for their flashy lifestyles and brash attitudes \u2014 and Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, the longtime co-leader of the Sinaloa cartel, who prefers to be more low key. And on a visit to Sinaloa last year, sources told VICE News that the sons had also been feuding with their uncle, Aureliano \u201cEl Guano\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who controls the mountainous area around Chapo\u2019s remote hometown, a key source of heroin and methamphetamine production.\n\nAmid the mayhem this afternoon in Culiac\u00e1n, city residents feared the worst about what could happen in the fallout from the latest developments. One message circulating on WhatsApp warned citizens to shelter in place because gunmen from across the region were gathering to fight for Chapo\u2019s sons and their allies.\n\n\u201cThere are armed people from all the municipalities of Sinaloa, people of Chihuahua, Durango and Guadalajara, [coming] to rescue the children of El Chapo and two more capos who are unknown,\u201d the message said. \u201cThat is why the state government has not given information because they do not know what to be careful do not leave your house if you have nothing to do on the street.\u201d\n\nMiguel Fernandez Flores contributed reporting.\n\nCover: El Chapo's son Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n in Mexican military police custody on Wednesday, October 17, 2019.", "description": "The Sinaloa cartel leader\u2019s son was detained by the Mexican military but released amid a shootout.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da91907ff38620009ee4042/lede/1571363101809-ChapoSon.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
