But officials have also been careful to manage expectations and say Monday\u2019s summit is also a run-up event to the 2020 UN climate summit that the UK will host in Glasgow.\n\nStill, there is some sense of increased urgency.\n\nThe goal of \"carbon neutrality\" -- where most emissions are eliminated and those that remain are offset by planting new trees (and potentially carbon capture technology in the future) was considered so radical in 2015 that it was left out of the text of the Paris agreement.\n\nNow, though, it has become a rallying cry for countries like the United Kingdom and France as well as major corporations, who are leading the charge in countries like the US where the political leadership have sought to distance themselves or even undermine the cause.\n\nAhead of the summit, 87 firms under the \"We Mean Business\" coalition pledged to slash their emissions.\n\nThe UN published a report on the eve of the summit that said the five-year period ending 2019 was set to be the hottest ever, the latest grim reminder that climate change is already a reality.\n\n\"Our global carbon credit is maxed out,\" said Dave Reay, a professor and chair in Carbon Management at the University of Edinburgh, commenting on the report.\n\n\"If emissions don't start falling there will be hell to pay.\"", "description": "Some 60 world leaders convene on Monday for a UN summit on \"climate emergency\" aimed at reinvigorating the faltering Paris agreement, at a time when mankind is releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than at any time in history.
