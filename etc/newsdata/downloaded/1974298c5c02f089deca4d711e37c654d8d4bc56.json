But Mr. Bolton, who left his post last month, expressed concern that Mr. Giuliani \u201cwas a key voice with the President on Ukraine,\u201d which could hamper efforts to strengthen the relationship, according to a copy of Mr. Anderson\u2019s opening statement obtained by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMr. Anderson, a longtime foreign service officer, attended the meeting with Kurt Volker, his boss at the time and then-U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. Mr. Volker, who has resigned from his post, testified to House committees earlier this month.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s warning\u2014as described by Mr. Anderson\u2014suggests the former national security adviser was aware of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s influence over the president on Ukraine policy several weeks before a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump would press his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and other matters, echoing calls Mr. Giuliani had made for months. Mr. Bolton, in an unusual move, didn\u2019t listen in on the call.\n\nMr. Anderson is one of two State Department officials testifying on Wednesday. His successor, Catherine Croft, also will speak to House committees as part of the impeachment inquiry investigating whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani abused the power of the presidency to press a foreign country to investigate a political rival. Mr. Trump has defended his actions as appropriate and has decried the investigation as a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nThe State Department cited a White House counsel directive in an effort to block both witnesses from testifying, according to their lawyers. But both were served with a subpoena and therefore obliged to comply, their lawyers said.\n\nMr. Anderson is expected to tell investigators that he relayed Mr. Bolton\u2019s message about Mr. Giuliani to George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state who testified this month.\n\nFive days after that June 13 meeting in which Mr. Bolton expressed concerns about Mr. Giuliani, officials met again at the U.S. Energy Department, where Mr. Volker, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor discussed how to navigate U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. Among the topics, Mr. Anderson said, was \u201chow to address Mr. Giuliani\u2019s continued calls for a corruption investigation.\u201d After the meeting, Mr. Anderson spoke with Mr. Taylor\u2014who testified last week about his concerns over the calls for investigations and Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in Ukraine policy\u2014and the two \u201cagreed on the importance of not calling for any investigations\u201d for Ukraine to undertake.\n\nMr. Anderson left his role working for Mr. Volker on July 12, when Ms. Croft took it over. Neither Mr. Anderson nor Ms. Croft is the whistleblower whose complaint, filed in August, helped spark the impeachment inquiry, their lawyers said.\n\nBoth officials will testify that Mr. Trump had a longstanding aversion to Ukraine. Mr. Anderson said that when Russia escalated its conflict with Ukraine by seizing Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, State Department officials prepared a statement condemning Russia for the move. Senior White House officials subsequently blocked the statement from being released, Mr. Anderson said. Mr. Volker issued a tweet that day criticizing Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nThe State Department issued a statement the next day condemning \u201cthis aggressive Russian action.\u201d\n\nMs. Croft, a foreign service officer since 2010 who served as the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine director before she was asked to succeed Mr. Anderson in May 2019, said Mr. Trump repeatedly described Ukraine as corrupt while deciding whether to provide the country with Javelin missile systems in December 2017. Mr. Trump made similar comments in a September 2017 meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, she said.\n\nMs. Croft\u2019s testimony also reveals an intriguing new subplot related to the effort by Mr. Giuliani and others to oust the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Mr. Trump ultimately ordered her removed this past spring after hearing concerns from Mr. Giuliani and others that she was obstructing efforts to push for a Ukrainian investigation into Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Ms. Yovanovitch, in testimony earlier this month, described a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d against her by Mr. Giuliani and others.\n\nWhile she was serving on the NSC from July 2017 to July 2018, Ms. Croft said she received several calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told her Ms. Yovanovitch \u201cshould be fired.\u201d Mr. Livingston described Ms. Yovanovitch as an \u201cObama holdover\u201d and linked her to George Soros, a Democratic megadonor, Ms. Croft said. Ms. Yovanovitch strenuously disputed allegations of political bias in her congressional testimony.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear to me at the time\u2014or now\u2014at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d Ms. Croft said. She said she reported the calls to her boss, former NSC official Fiona Hill \u2014who testified this month\u2014and to Mr. Kent. She didn\u2019t hear of any action taken in response.\n\nMs. Croft didn\u2019t specify when Mr. Livingston contacted her. In June 2018, Justice Department records show, Mr. Livingston registered to represent a firm linked to Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister who at the time was running for president against Volodymyr Zelensky, the current president, and Mr. Poroshenko. Over the following months, Mr. Livingston contacted dozens of government officials in an effort to arrange meetings for Ms. Tymoshenko in Washington, among them Messrs. Trump, Bolton and Volker as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to public records.\n\nMs. Tymoshenko met with Messrs. Volker and Anderson in December 2018, accompanied by Mr. Livingston, the records show. The following day, another lobbyist at Mr. Livingston\u2019s firm introduced her to Mr. Giuliani. They discussed, among other matters, \u201cthe provision of US assistance to Ukraine,\u201d according to her website.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be determined if Mr. Livingston was pushing for the ambassador\u2019s removal on Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s behalf. Ms. Yovanovitch during her tenure had fraught relations with some senior Ukrainian officials, who viewed her as aligned with Mr. Poroshenko. When Ms. Tymoshenko came in third in the presidential election this spring, she accused Mr. Poroshenko of cheating.\n\n\u2014Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "National security adviser John Bolton warned U.S. diplomats in June that Rudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, could pose an obstacle to improving relations with Ukraine, according to prepared testimony by a State Department official.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121923/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
