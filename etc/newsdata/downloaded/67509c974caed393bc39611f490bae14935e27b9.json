Kevin Foley/Handout via REUTERS\n\nA joke-telling rocker with a New York swagger and a heart of gold, Money recently revealed on his reality television series \u201cReal Money\u201d that he had esophageal cancer. The remaining episodes of the show, in its second season on AXS TV, deal with his cancer.\n\n\u201cI thought I was just going in to get a checkup, and he told me I got cancer,\u201d Money said in an episode that was taped in August and aired on Thursday.\n\nMoney said the news hit him \u201creally, really hard\u201d but that he decided to reveal the diagnosis because \u201cI want to be honest with everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to live a long time? Who knows, it\u2019s in God\u2019s hands. But you know what? I\u2019ll take every day I can get. Every day above ground is a good day,\u201d Money said.\n\nMoney was born Edward Joseph Mahoney on March 21, 1949, in Brooklyn, according to his website.\n\nHis father was a police officer, and the website said Money served as a New York City police officer for two years, although in a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Money agreed he only entered the police training program.\n\n\u201cI would have been a very lenient cop,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1968 he moved to Berkeley, California, where he began performing in local clubs, the website biography said.\n\nAfter changing his name to Eddie Money in 1976, he met rock promoter Bill Graham, who helped the careers of the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and other major acts. Graham would serve as mentor and manager to Money.\n\nHis debut album \u201cEddie Money\u201d came out in 1977 with the big hits \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise\u201d and \u201cBaby Hold On.\u201d In all he sold more than 28 million records, his website said.\n\nHis hit \u201cThink I\u2019m in Love\u201d was also a breakthrough video in the early days of MTV, and the 1986 album \u201cCan\u2019t Hold Back\u201d featured the No. 4 hit \u201cTake Me Home Tonight\u201d in which Money sings a duet with Ronnie Spector, helping revive the former Ronette\u2019s career.\n\nDespite spending most of his life on the West Coast, where he became a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Money retained some of his Brooklyn accent and carried himself as a wisecracking New Yorker.\n\nHe was also known to be generous with up-and-coming rockers.\n\nMusician Paul Collins, who met Money in the late 1970s and co-wrote two songs with him, credited Money for promoting his band the Beat, enabling it to sign its first record contract with Graham as its manager.\n\n\u201cHe said we New Yorkers need to stick together out here in California. They\u2019ll eat you alive,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe told everybody he knew that I was a great songwriter until we signed with CBS Records and Bill Graham.\u201d\n\nMoney is survived by his wife, Laurie Money, and their four sons: Zachary, Joseph, Desmond and Julian.", "description": "American rock star Eddie Money, whose hits including \"Two Tickets to Paradise\" and \"Baby Hold On\" formed part of the power pop soundtrack of the late 1970s and early 1980s, died in Los Angeles on Friday at age 70, his family said in a statement.", "authors": ["Daniel Trotta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429507255&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1TJ-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
