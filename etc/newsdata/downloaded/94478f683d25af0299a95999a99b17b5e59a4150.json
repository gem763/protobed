In the end EU leaders struck a compromise where an extension will last three months, but might be cut short if a deal is agreed after all.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk announced the decision this morning after a meeting of EU ambassadors lasting barely half an hour.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK's request for a Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020.\n\n\"The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.\"\n\nBoris Johnson was forced to request the three-month delay by MPs - who also rejected his attempt to rush through a Brexit deal in just three days. But even a delay it wasn't his choice, asking for it still broke the PM's pledge.\n\nThe flailing Tory Prime Minister had said last month: \"There are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\"\n\nIt comes as MPs hold a showdown vote from 5pm tonight over whether to hold a Christmas snap election.\n\nLabour are expected to vote down Boris Johnson's bid to hold a snap election on December 12 - because they say it'd leave open a no-deal Brexit .\n\nBut just as that motion dies, a separate bid is gaining momentum from the SNP and Lib Dems which pushes for a December 9 election instead.\n\nCrucially, because it's a Bill this second bid would only need half of all voting MPs to back it - not the 434-MP 'super majority' that Boris Johnson needs tonight.\n\nA vote could be held on the fresh election bid as soon as tomorrow, and pass even if it doesn't have Labour backing. No10 said it would consider backing \u201csomething like\u201d this option if it loses tonight\u2019s vote.\n\nFurious Labour blasted the Lib Dem and SNP bid as a \"ridiculous stunt\" as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell raged: \"Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of 2010 is being re-established.\n\n\"They are back together, selling out the People\u2019s Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal.\n\n\"The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back.\"\n\nBut despite Labour's fury and initial Tory brush-offs the fresh election bid appeared to be gathering momentum.\n\nYesterday, Tory chairman James Cleverly branded the Lib Dem plan a \u201cgimmick\u201d while Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan also called it a \u201cstunt\u201d.\n\nYet last night government aide Bim Afolami said: \"I'm not necessarily averse to it.\" And today schools minister Nick Gibb did not rule out backing a move similar to the Lib Dems', despite accusing the party of \"disobeying\" the 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\nA source also told Reuters the election bid was a factor that persuaded EU leaders to get a three-month extension over the line.\n\nLabour has insisted it won't back an election until no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.\n\nThat had been widely thought to mean a no-deal on October 31.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn has since suggested it also includes a threat of a no-deal in 2021 - one which is wrapped up in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nThere was a slim chance Labour - which has told MPs to abstain or vote against an election tonight - could change its tune before tonight's vote.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was due to summon a meeting of his shadow cabinet later today.\n\nThis breaking news story is being updated.", "description": "The October 31 leaving date is officially dead despite Boris Johnson's vow to 'die in a ditch' after the announcement by European Council chief Donald Tusk", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20736059.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
