Some 49,000 employees in the United Auto Workers (UAW) union continue to carry picket signs, as negotiations between the union\u2019s office and the automaker\u2019s board appear to have hit a snag.\n\n\n\nProposing a new deal whereby job security for the Detroit plant workforce is more seriously considered in the next 4-year workers\u2019 contract \u2014 as well as a more generous sharing of company profits, which are expected to fetch $1.79 per share in the company\u2019s Q3 earnings report (due out on Tuesday, October 29th) \u2014 is where the current impasse lies. Reportedly, GM came back with a counter-proposal union officials said resembled an earlier, already rejected offer. Things are now reported to \u201chave taken a turn for the worse,\u201d according to UAW Vice President Terry Dittes.\n\n\n\nWorkers are concerned the company may pull up stakes and invest in a new plant south of the border. Currently, 22% of GM autos sold in the U.S. are built in Mexico. For their part, GM is interested in cutting costs to levels of those they see with foreign automakers who have built plants in cheaper areas in the U.S. south. The UAW is currently supplying $250 per week to striking workers as the impasse continues, roughly 20% of average normal pay.\n\n\n\nGM is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated company, with a Value-Growth-Momentum grade of B. Over the past 4 quarters, the company has beaten estimates all 4 times at an average of 27.7% above expectations. In fact, the company has only missed estimates twice in the last 5 years \u2014 most recently in Q2 2018. Earnings of $1.79 per share would represent a year-over-year drop of 4.3%, whereas expected revenues of $36.65 billion would demonstrate 2.4% growth.\n\n\n\nMark Vickery\n\nSenior Editor\n\n\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?
