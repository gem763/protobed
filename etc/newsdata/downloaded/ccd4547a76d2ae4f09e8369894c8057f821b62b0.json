(Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images)\n\nFreshman defensive tackle Antonio Alfano has not played for Alabama in 2019. And it seems that he won\u2019t be seeing the field anytime soon.\n\nAlabama coach Nick Saban said Alfano has \u201ckind of disappeared a little bit\u201d during his Wednesday news conference. Per Rivals\u2019 Bama Insider, Alfano has not been seen on the field during the portion of practices open to the media over the last two weeks.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of disappeared a little bit,\u201d Saban said Wednesday. \u201cI talked to our team today about the fact that \u2014 people make mistakes. We all make mistakes. I make mistakes, probably everybody in this room makes mistakes. We make mistakes as parents. We make mistakes as coaches. We make mistakes in just about everything that we do.\n\n\u201cBut I think you compound the problem when you don\u2019t confront the mistakes that you make and you create greater consequences for yourself because of the choices and decisions that you make after you make a mistake. And so hopefully this will be a learning experience for all the guys in our team.\u201d\n\nAlfano was the top DT in 2019 class\n\nAlfano was one of the top recruits in the entire class of 2019. The New Jersey native was ranked as the No. 1 defensive tackle in the class and the No. 5 overall recruit. He was the No. 2 player in Alabama\u2019s class behind running back Trey Sanders, the No. 3 player overall in Rivals rankings.\n\nIf Alfano ends up missing significant time, Alabama will have received little to no production from two of the top five recruits in the country in 2019. Sanders is set to reportedly miss the entire season because of a foot injury he suffered in preseason practice.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot many programs can thrive if it signs two of the five best players in the country and doesn\u2019t get much immediate impact from them. Heck, not many programs can even sign two of the five best players in the country in the same recruiting class to begin with. But this is Saban\u2019s Alabama we\u2019re talking about.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Antonio Alfano was the No. 5 player in the class of 2019 and the No. 2 player in Alabama's recruiting class.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VNDjWie.sE5DgdciBFJ9pA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTEuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FlRqYABFXkwEexs2XuzAyQ--~B/aD0xMTQxO3c9MjExMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d7f15260-d4fa-11e9-8fff-78090e0958db", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
