(Helayne Seidman/for The Washington Post)\n\nSol Stein, a best-selling novelist who later developed software programs for writers but was perhaps best known as the publisher of major works by James Baldwin and Che Guevara, died Sept. 19 at his home in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 92.\n\nHe died of complications from dementia, said his wife, Edith Shapiro.\n\nMr. Stein had a varied career, beginning in the 1950s with the Voice of America, where he helped formulate anti-communist programming that was broadcast to dozens of countries around the world.\n\nHe also wrote plays and moved into publishing, first at Beacon Press, where in 1955 he edited Baldwin\u2019s \u201cNotes of a Native Son,\u201d a collection of essays about the African American experience that became a literary classic.\n\nMr. Stein had known Baldwin since they were students at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and staff members on the school literary journal.\n\n\u201cSo much happened in our work together that his color disappeared, my color disappeared and it stayed that way for the rest of our lives,\u201d Mr. Stein told the New York Times in 2004.\n\n\n\nStein opened publishing company Stein & Day in 1962. (Helayne Seidman/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI was crazy about Jimmy\u2019s mother,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cShe was my second mother. She struck me as colorblind. I never had the feeling I was the white kid visiting. I was Jimmy\u2019s friend.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Stein wrote \u201cNative Sons\u201d about their friendship and the gen\u00adesis of Baldwin\u2019s book. Mr. Stein included copies of dozens of letters he and Baldwin exchanged during the writing and editing of \u201cNative Son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese letters, capturing the men at a pivotal moment in their careers and friendship,\u201d critic Wendy Smith wrote in Kirkus Reviews, \u201cremind us that a cultural landmark like \u2018Notes of a Native Son\u2019 is also the product of a fallible, questing human being who misspelled words and worried about his relatives just like the rest of us.\u201d\n\nAfter several years at Beacon, Mr. Stein formed an independent publishing company, Stein & Day, in 1962. His business partner and the corporate vice president was his wife at the time, Patricia Day. Over the next 25 years, Stein & Day published hundreds of books, including works by such well-known figures as David Frost, Jack Higgins, Budd Schulberg, Marilyn Monroe and F. Lee Bailey. The firm\u2019s first major bestseller was \u201cAmerica America,\u201d an autobiographical 1962 novel by film director Elia Kazan, who later made it into a movie.\n\nIn 1968, Mr. Stein was caught up in a complex international scramble to publish the diaries of the charismatic Argentine-born revolutionary Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara. After helping organize Fidel Castro\u2019s takeover of Cuba in the 1950s, Guevara sought to inspire revolutionary movements around the world.\n\nHe dropped out of sight for a few years before ending up in Bolivia, where he aimed to build a guerrilla network that would sweep across the South American continent. With help from the CIA, Bolivian military forces captured and killed Guevara in October 1967.\n\nAmong his belongings was a diary, which the Bolivian government seized, setting off a bidding war for publication rights. Castro released a truncated copy of the diary that made its way to Cuba, and questions about copyright caused several publishing houses to back away.\n\nCompeting versions appeared in magazines and a paperback edition, but in 1968 Stein & Day published \u201cThe Complete Bolivian Diaries of Che Guevara\u201d after obtaining rights from the Bolivian government. The book detailed the travels, hopes and struggles of the revolutionary many people considered a martyr.\n\n\u201cGive a thought once in a while,\u201d Guevara wrote to his parents, \u201cto this little twentieth century soldier-of-fortune.\u201d\n\nWhile publishing the works of others, Mr. Stein had a thriving writing career of his own. He completed his first novel, \u201cThe Husband\u201d (1969), in 17 days by rewriting one of his plays. His 1971 novel, \u201cThe Magician,\u201d inspired by his childhood interest in magic, was a page-turning legal thriller that sold more than a million copies\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular read,\u201d critic Webster Schott wrote in the Times. \u201cStein picks up new characters, spins anecdotes, finds new events as though he had a bottomless hat from which to draw surprises.\u201d\n\nAll of Mr. Stein\u2019s nine novels were published by companies other than Stein & Day.\n\n\u201cI have 100 other authors every year,\u201d he said in 1985, \u201cand if I publish myself I am in competition with them.\u201d\n\nSolomon Stein was born Oct. 13, 1926, in Chicago and moved as a child to New York. His father was a jewelry designer, his mother an interpreter who eventually worked for the United Nations.\n\nMr. Stein entered college at 15, served in the Army during World War II, then graduated in 1948 from the City College of New York. He received a master\u2019s degree in English literature from Columbia University in 1949.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, he worked at the Voice of America in New York and later became an official at the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, an organization secretly funded by the CIA. The committee, a loosely organized group of leading intellectuals, opposed ideological extremism from both the left and right. Mr. Stein helped edit a book critical of Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), the senator who recklessly charged countless government workers with being communist sympathizers.\n\nMr. Stein wrote two plays in the 1950s that had short Broadway runs, \u201cNapoleon\u201d and \u201cA Shadow of My Enemy,\u201d then worked at Beacon Press before launching Stein & Day.\n\n\u201cPublishing has gotten away from being a cottage industry to be a grouping together of many firms under a corporate umbrella,\u201d he told United Press International in 1985. \u201cWe are the last independent to play the bestseller game principally because the large firms shy away from anything that controversial.\u201d\n\nStein & Day filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1987, then folded two years later.\n\n\u201cI lost $2.8 million \u2014 everything I owned except the house I mortgaged heavily, trying to save our company,\u201d Mr. Stein said.\n\nHe was deeply embittered by the experience, which he chronicled in a scathing nonfiction book, \u201cA Feast for Lawyers\u201d (1989). Among other choice terms, he called bankruptcy lawyers \u201chuman scavengers\u201d and \u201cvulture capitalists.\u201d\n\nHis marriages to Sondra Klein and Patricia Day ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife since 2000, Dr. Edith Shapiro; four sons from his first marriage; three children from his second marriage; two stepchildren; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nAfter leaving the publishing business, Mr. Stein wrote several guides to writing and taught in colleges, including the University of California at Irvine. He also developed a software program, WritePro, to teach fiction-writing techniques to aspiring writers. The program sold tens of thousands of copies and led to several spinoffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had 36 years of editing, and at the same time I\u2019ve had nine novels published,\u201d he said in 1990. \u201cSo in a sense what I\u2019ve got is not the attitude of a teacher, or of a failed writer, but that of the craftsman who wants to pass along that craft to others.\u201d\n\nMr. Stein had a boisterous personality that sometimes clashed with the egos of his authors, including Kazan. They worked for months editing Kazan\u2019s novel \u201cThe Arrangement,\u201d about a business executive facing an existential crisis, which became a No. 1 bestseller in 1967. Kazan later made it into a film starring Kirk Douglas and Faye Dunaway.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when \u2018The Arrangement\u2019 was being written when chairs were being flung around and he wouldn\u2019t talk to me,\u201d Mr. Stein said in 1968. \u201cHe wrote me: \u2018You bucher, why don\u2019t you go off and write your own book?\u2019\n\n\u201cI wrote back: \u2018When you can spell butcher, you can call me a butcher. I\u2019ll write a book when you get your seat off my typewriter.\u2019 So when the chance came I sat down and wrote my own book.\u201d", "description": "He edited Baldwin\u2019s \u201cNotes of a Native Son\u201d and wrote best-selling books of his own.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lH-dW4R6QJytQz7r0-YQ9i4VaRs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DRHYQLHAPUI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
