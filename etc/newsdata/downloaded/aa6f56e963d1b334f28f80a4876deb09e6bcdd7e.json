He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, Conway told Fox News she will be \"responding soon\" to the story.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY'S HUSBAND MAKES AWKWARD APPEAL FOR 'SOMEONE' ON TRUMP'S 'RUNAWAY TRAIN' TO STOP HIM\n\nConway has rarely commented on her relationship while serving in the White House, as her husband continues his pointed criticisms. The two appeared to have mostly avoided criticizing one another, although Conway did tell Fox News in July that she \"totally disagreed\" with an op-ed her husband had written.\n\nA somewhat awkward moment occurred in October when George Conway called for \"someone\" on President Trump's team to stop him. \"Someone on this runaway train needs to pull the emergency brake. Who\u2019s it going to be?\" he asked, criticizing Trump's mental state.\n\nThe White House adviser also appeared to tell Yilek the White House would \"cover\" her personal life as Yilek did with the Conways.\n\n\"So, listen, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here. If it has nothing to do with my job, which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious, then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here,\" she said.\n\nCONWAY BLASTS DEMS' 'TIRED' CLAIMS OF RACISM, SAYS SHE 'TOTALLY DISAGREES' WITH HUSBAND'S SCATHING OP-ED\n\nDuring the call, Yilek repeatedly offered for Kellyanne Conway to speak to her editor, but she refused. Instead, she peppered Yilek with questions about why the reporter said she was caught in the middle of a conflict between her husband and her boss.\n\nTRUMP GOES NUCLEAR ON KELLYANNE SPOUSE GEORGE CONWAY: 'HUSBAND FROM HELL!'\n\n\"When I was young and starting in my career, I was in the friend-making business. And I\u2019ve worked super hard. You could have put that in paragraph two also. But I\u2019m not caught in the middle of anything except trying to understand somebody whose title is breaking news reporter, what that means,\" the White House adviser said.\n\nAfter Yilek again offered her editor, Kellyanne Conway continued questioning her. \"I\u2019d be [inaudible] to tell him you have no answer when asked why you were characterizing somebody\u2019s feelings, having never talked to that person. If you have some psychology degree [inaudible].\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know that that is characterizing your feelings to say you are put in the middle if your husband and your boss are attacking each other,\" Yilek said.\n\nDuring the conversation, Conway argued that the president hadn't addressed her husband for months. Trump famously called George Conway the \"husband from Hell\" in March and claimed he was jealous of his wife's success.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPart of the call included Conway asking about the way Yilek performed her job. \"OK, then let\u2019s talk about your job. What is your job exactly? Is your job to rely upon derivative reporting without picking up the phone and trying to ask questions or write things that are relevant?\" she asked.\n\n\"In other words, you characterize me as being caught in the middle of something that I\u2019m not caught in the middle of. So, why would you do that? Are you an expert on my marriage? Are you an expert on my job? Are you an expert on the way this White House works? Are you an expert on Twitter? I mean, what exactly are you an expert on that would qualify you to say, to characterize the way I feel?\"", "description": "White House adviser Kellyanne Conway ripped into a female reporter on Thursday, criticizing the way she did her job and how she acted as a young woman.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
