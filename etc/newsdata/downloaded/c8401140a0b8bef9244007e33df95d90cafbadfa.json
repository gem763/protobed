Mitt Romney (R-UT) to push for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment amid the Ukraine phonecall controversy.\n\nDeutsch said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that Romney \u201cwould be an American hero\u201d if he came forward in support of impeaching Trump.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I think it\u2019s important that the Democrats, this new Rudy story, obviously, there\u2019s so much to unpack there,\u201d Deutsch stated. \u201cBut the good news/bad news is the Democrats continue to move forward on impeachment is they still can\u2019t lose that one-sentence strategy. The more this thing airs out, if you will, and fans out, you start to in a strange way, it gets worse but it also dilutes the simple one-sentence message, \u2018The president [sought] a foreign power to get dirt on his opponent at the expense of our national security.\u2019 We can\u2019t still lose that one headline. And that\u2019s critical for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAnd I want to also go back to one point you made earlier, Joe. I don\u2019t understand how somebody like a Mitt Romney does not come forward. It is such an obvious thing to say. Right now you would be an American hero, and you can say, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve supported the president\u2019s policies and this is painful, but I work for the voters and for the Constitution.\u2019 It astounds me as a branding guy and a guy who has managed people\u2019s careers that none of these people get that. It\u2019s not even brave. It\u2019s smart politically.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]o me, is the one guy who is bulletproof,\u201d Deutsch added, saying, \u201cRepublicans would line up behind him.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Friday, MSNBC contributor Donny Deutsch called on Sen.
