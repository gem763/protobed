But it is also improving at one of the fastest rates of any region apart from the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nBut the report says a major source of concern for the global economy is the low rate of growth in productivity, defined as the amount of goods and services produced for a given amount of inputs such as labour, capital or other resources.\n\nDespite multiple attempts by governments and central banks to boost productivity rates, factors such as growing business uncertainty and lower demand have squeezed productivity growth.\n\n\"The injection of cash by the world's four major central banks may have even contributed to divert more capital towards the financial market rather than to productivity-enhancing investments,\" WEF said.\n\nThe world is not on track to meet any of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed to under the United Nations in 2015, it added.\n\nThat being said, the WEF maintains that greater technological integration and complementary social policies could help governments support growth in their economies.\n\nThe report says East Asia, Europe and North America have the highest levels of technological adoption, which measures penetration rates for mobile phone and internet usage, and broadband fibre installation among others.\n\nBut Sub-Saharan Africa is growing more rapidly in this respect than anywhere else.", "description": "The World Economic Forum\u2019s latest survey shows some East Asian countries have benefitted from the US-China trade war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/13/4b7c276560bb4c628a9005a9d5e762e3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
