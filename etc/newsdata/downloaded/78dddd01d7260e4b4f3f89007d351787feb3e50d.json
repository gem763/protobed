The United Auto Workers union is leading its first strike against the automaker since 2007. (J.D. Pooley/Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nOnce, as a striking union member, I put a sign on my 10-pound Yorkshire terrier that read: Only dogs should accept bones.\n\nWalking that picket line with no paycheck coming was scary, and yet it was one of the most empowering things I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nThe union mattered then, and it does now. In collective bargaining, there is power.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nRight now, about 49,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) labor union are on strike against General Motors. It\u2019s the union\u2019s first walkout against the No. 1 U.S. automaker in over a decade, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe union points out that GM workers gave up pay raises and made other concessions to help the automaker recover from its 2009 bankruptcy. And now that the company is making record profits, employees want to share in the upside. They want affordable health care, job security and a path to permanent seniority for temporary workers.\n\nIn an interview with AP, one Michigan GM employee said he\u2019s fighting for his co-workers: \u201cIt\u2019s not right when you\u2019re working next to someone, doing the same job and they\u2019re making a lot more money. They should be making the same as me. They\u2019ve got families to support.\u201d\n\nRead: GM walkout brings factories and warehouses to a standstill\n\n\u201cNegotiations have resumed,\u201d GM said in a statement. \u201cOur goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nNext month, more than 80,000 employees of Kaiser Permanente may follow their auto union brethren. Unless a contract is signed, the workers will stage a nationwide, seven-day strike on Oct. 14.\n\nKaiser Permanente made more than $5.2 billion in profits during the first half of 2019, according to the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, which is composed of labor groups in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Hawaii, Virginia, Maryland and the District.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for Kaiser to let a strike happen when it has the resources to invest in patients, communities and workers,\u201d said Eric Jines, a radiologic technologist at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that Bernard Tyson, Kaiser\u2019s chief executive, issued a statement complaining that the union set a date for the strike in \u201can overt effort to gain leverage in bargaining.\u201d\n\nTeachers across the country have been walking off their jobs or calling in sick in protest for smaller classes, better wages and more resources to help their students.\n\nGM, Kaiser, teachers \u2014 workers are increasingly standing up and striking for themselves.\n\nAbout 485,200 workers were involved in major work stoppages in 2018, the highest figure since 1986, reported The Washington Post\u2019s Andrew Van Dam.\n\nRead: Teacher strikes made 2018 the biggest year for worker protest in a generation\n\nIn fact, union approval is near a 50-year high, according to a Gallup poll released last month. Sixty-four percent of Americans approve of labor unions, up 16 percentage points from a 2009 low.\n\n\u201cHigher public support for unions in the past few years likely reflects the relatively good economic conditions in place, particularly low unemployment,\u201d Gallup said.\n\nThe lowest union approval rating was from 2009 through 2012, a time marked by the Great Recession and years of high unemployment afterward, Gallup said.\n\nIt\u2019s not that workers want to strike. It should be a last-resort negotiating tactic.\n\nBut if I may speak for other union workers, we get it, corporate America. Making a profit is increasingly hard when global competitors can get cheap labor. But at the same time, the folks who contribute a great deal to helping you make those profits ought to share in the profitability upswing.\n\nWe certainly catch a bad break in the economic downswings. Even if you survived a layoff, it\u2019s hard watching co-workers walk out with their boxed belongings. Or, you may have a pension but new hires don\u2019t.\n\nSo, as former labor secretary Robert Reich wrote in a post for Salon: \u201cIf you have a job, join a union. And if you don\u2019t have a union, start one.\u201d\n\nReich says it\u2019s all about power. Management has most of it. They set the rules and the pay raises \u2014 if there are any. But being in a union can help balance this power dynamic.\n\n\u201cAs an individual your voice is limited, but there is power in numbers,\u201d Reich wrote. \u201cToday, unions are more important than ever to the survival of the middle class.\u201d\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nDo unions still matter?

But I asked: Who do you blame for the increase in student loan debt?\n\nPhillip Zemke of Milan, N.Y. wrote, \u201cThe question is really, who is profiting? The interest rates seem onerous for an essential loan for something that may or may not have a market value.\u201d\n\n\u201cI borrowed over $100,000 to obtain two degrees,\u201d wrote Mike Worden of Houston. \u201cI alone am responsible for that amount. I would encourage soon to be and current college students to read Vicki Robin\u2019s \u2018Your Money or Your Life.\u2019 I wish I had read and acted upon the author\u2019s advice when I was going to college (both as a traditional college student and later as a more determined nontraditional student). If I had, I might not still owe $40,000 in consolidated student loan debt. But the choice to take the debt on was mine and mine alone.\u201d\n\nRead my review of Robin\u2019s book: How much money do you really need to feel rich?\n\n\u201cThe blame falls on everyone involved,\u201d wrote Casandra from Nashville. \u201cI accepted the student loans so that I could earn a good living. I\u2019ve had to place my loan in forbearance a couple of times due to loss of income. I do not remember ever knowing what interest rate I signed up for over 20 years ago but right now the almost 6% interest that I am being charged is ridiculous. Sadly, I will be taking these loans into retirement or not retiring at all.\u201d\n\nChuck Yanus of Crossville, Tenn. wrote, \u201cWho is responsible for the student debt \u2018crisis\u2019? I would say all the actors involved \u2014 the schools with their outrageous cost structures, the lending institutions that charge ridiculous rates during low interest times, the government, which should not even be in the education funding business, and yes, the students and parents who take out those loans without considering the real, bottom line costs. Is it a tremendous burden for the people who signed a contract to repay those loans? Absolutely, but so is the burden associated with repaying a mortgage, or a car loan, or some other personal loan.\u201d\n\nColor of Money Columns This Week\n\nKnowledge isn\u2019t power.\n\nThe right knowledge is power.
