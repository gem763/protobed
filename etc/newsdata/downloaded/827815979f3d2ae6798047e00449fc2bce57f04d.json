The board also could declare \u201cany similar event\u201d as a change of control, under that plan.\n\nInsurance-banking giant Suncorp\u2019s share performance plan also defines a change of control event as occurring at 50 per cent.\n\nMore discretion for the board\n\nAsked why a change had occurred, Collection House chairman Leigh Berkley said in a statement the 25 per cent ownership change marked \u201cadditional discretion\u201d for the board.\n\n\u201cThe default position remains that if the board does not exercise its discretion, upon a 50.01 per cent change of control, unvested rights will automatically vest and any trading restrictions will cease to apply,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is aligned with the Corporations Act provisions relating to takeover bids which are generally triggered when more than 20 per cent of the voting shares in a company are proposed to be purchased by a prospective bidder.\u201d\n\nThe change comes after Collection House chief executive Anthony Rivas in September exercised 1 million performance rights under the old plan, worth $1.24 a share each.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat had required Collection House meeting targets linked to compound annual growth, starting at exceeding 5 per cent in earnings per share over three years.\n\nCollection House had met that target but only with an accounting change boosting the latest financial results. Analysts had determined that Collection House\u2019s earnings would have actually gone backwards without the accounting change.\n\nMr Rivas had, however, earlier voluntarily foregone 2 million in performance rights.\n\nThe new performance rights are different in that they incorporate more than just EPS targets of growth of at least 5 per cent each year to 2020. This time almost 40 per cent of the performance rights are linked to \u201cnon-financial\u201d hurdles such as customer and staff engagement.\n\nMr Berkley told The Australian Financial Review that Collection House \u201cdoes not anticipate any significant accounting changes for the sector in the short to medium\u201d. The last accounting change was mandated and any further differences would \u201cbe evaluated by the board\u201d, he said.\n\nThese changes were sparked after taking advice from consultants and adopted some recommendations from the financial services royal commission, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile the royal commission recommendations are primarily directed to the banking, insurance and superannuation industries, Collection House believes some of the principles also hold true for its industry,\u201d he said.", "description": "A new bonus plan says someone buying 25 per cent of a company could constitute a \"change of control\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3365%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e165dd3f2f57fad4fcb65a287643cbe95c2c9662", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
