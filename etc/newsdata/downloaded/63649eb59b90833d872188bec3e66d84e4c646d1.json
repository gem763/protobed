The courts aren't bothered - it's a simple contract.\"\n\nMark appealed his case, arguing signs at the car park didn't make clear what drivers had to do and filed pictures as evidence.\n\nBut he lost the case - with an independent body ruling that the onus was on him to have checked the rules.\n\nThe fine went up to \u00a3100 - but he still refused to pay.\n\nMark added: \"At the time, the opinion online about these firms were all different.\n\n\"These are just private companies, just ignore it, was what I was hearing from people. You can just call their bluff and allow them to take you to court.\n\n\"So I said to Civil Enforcement, I'm not prepared to pay this fine, take it to court and I will deal with the courts as opposed to you. I didn't hear anything back from them.\n\n\"It was another two years before anything else occurred.\"\n\nIn November, last year, I was trying to get in a position to buy my own house.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live /SWNS.COM)\n\n\"I was going through the finances when it was confirmed that my credit score was going to be updated.\n\n\"When I checked, it had dropped substantially and there was a County Court Judgement and a \u00a3300 plus charge against my name.\"\n\nHorrified Mark discovered Civil Enforcement had continued sending requests for payment to his old address, but after receiving zero response, got the courts involved.\n\n\"I took a significant drop in my credit score, I was now unable to open up a new line of credit with anyone and at that time my hopes of buying a house were gone,\" he said.\n\nMark said it then became a mad scramble trying to lift the order against him and settle the case once and for all.\n\n\"I had nothing, no paperwork, nothing,\" he said. \"I was going in blind, trying to find anything about the case.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I eventually tracked it down - I knew that if you can provide evidence that you didn't get the paperwork then you have grounds of another appeal.\n\n\"So I had to go through all the motions of that, stuff going back and forth with the courts.\"\n\nAnother court hearing was due for later this year, but the entire episode was finally dropped this summer after Mark reached a deal with Civil Enforcement Ltd.\n\n\"I had a really good chance of getting rid of the CCJ (at appeal) so I told them I would give them \u00a3100 - and they accepted that; case closed.\"\n\nBut Mark says the emotional impact of fighting and defending himself for as long as he did, was huge.\n\n\"It went on, for a long time - it was really stressful,\" he said.\n\n\"I spent entire days off work sorting the paperwork - the stress of it was huge.\n\n\"It really, really affected me. I had a family member helping me with it all. It was just horrible.\n\n\"It took a very long time before we got to the point where they closed the case.\"", "description": "Mark White, 34, says he went through hell and back fighting a legal battle which at one stage destroyed his credit rating", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Plymouth Live", "Swns.Com", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748589.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_FINED_LIFE_003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
