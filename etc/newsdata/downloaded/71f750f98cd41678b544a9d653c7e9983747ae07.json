Maybe it\u2019s a big lump on one of the branches.\n\nYou know immediately the tree is doomed, infected by the deadly swollen-shoot disease. Even worse, the plants around it are probably contaminated too, but you can\u2019t be sure because the symptoms can take years to appear.\n\nSwollen shoot is unique to West Africa, where about three-quarters of the world\u2019s cocoa is grown. The disease was identified nearly a century ago, yet scientists say a cure is years away and early detection methods are only just being introduced. This year, a devastating outbreak in the world\u2019s No. 2 cocoa grower is renewing urgency to find a solution.\n\nGhana has cut its crop forecast by 11% this season because of the disease, people familiar with the matter said previously. About 16% of the country\u2019s cocoa crops are infected, according to George Ameyaw, a senior scientist at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The crop is grown in often remote and mostly poor areas by hundreds of thousands of small-scale farmers. Swollen shoot reduces yields on infected trees and eventually kills them.\n\n\u201cI wish more people would understand the sort of magnitude of the lives impacted,\u201d said Judith Brown, a virologist studying swollen shoot at the University of Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting people who rely on it 100% for their income.\u201d\n\nFrancis Gyaben, who grows cocoa near Ghana\u2019s southwest border with Ivory Coast, said about 60% of his 20-acre (8-hectare) farm has been ravaged by the swollen shoot virus. \u201cI\u2019ve been reduced to a young man starting life again, I\u2019ve lost most of my source of livelihood to this virus invasion,\u201d Gyaben, 60, said by phone. \u201cI know some of the remaining trees have been affected by the disease and it\u2019s only a matter of time that it becomes evident.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Ghana\u2019s output this year was severely affected by swollen shoot, Ivory Coast is headed for a record crop, so the affect on global cocoa prices has been muted.\n\nStill, if swollen shoot isn\u2019t brought under control in the long term, more cocoa production will shift to South America and the Caribbean, said Brown, whose research includes identifying different species of the virus using genome sequencing. Optimistically, it could take 15 years to make real progress in managing the disease, she said.\n\nFor now, farmers manage the virus by chopping down, burning and replacing trees that show symptoms. Yet that often has little effect in containing the disease, which is spread by tiny white insects called mealybugs.\n\nTo help address the problem, scientists from Africa, Europe and the U.S. formed an international task force to share information, said Herve Bisseleua, a scientist and director at the World Cocoa Foundation\u2019s Ghana office.\n\nGovernments and chocolate companies including Nestle SA and Mars Inc. are also working through several initiatives on ways to improve how cocoa is grown. In one example, the Ghanaian government has tested the use of \u201cbarrier crops\u201d \u2013 adding other plants such as citrus trees among cocoa crops so that the virus isn\u2019t so easily transferred from leaf to leaf.\n\nThe Ghana Cocoa Board announced in July it will work with scientists at Israel\u2019s Volcani center to find solutions to the disease. Drones could also be a useful tool to help detect signs of the disease in plantations, according to Brown.\n\nThe efforts to fight swollen shoot are having some effect, with early-detection tools now being introduced in Ivory Coast and Ghana, according to Bisseleua. Still, there\u2019s a long way to go.\n\n\u201cThe gravity of the potential impacts should not be underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cNo cocoa producing area has really experienced this before.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The \"swollen shoot\" disease is unique to West Africa.
