REUTERS/ Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo\n\nThe 28-nation EU set up a blacklist and a gray list of tax havens in December 2017 after revelations of widespread avoidance schemes used by corporations and wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills.\n\nBlacklisted states face reputational damage and stricter controls on transactions with the EU.\n\nAs part of the regular review of the lists, the ministers decided to drop the UAE from the EU blacklist that covers jurisdictions that have failed to cooperate with the EU on tax matters.\n\nThe Marshall Islands has also been removed from that list, which still includes nine extra-EU jurisdictions - mostly Pacific islands with few financial relations with the EU.\n\nThe UAE, the largest financial center which was blacklisted, was removed because in September it adopted new rules on offshore structures, the EU said, giving it a clean-sheet on its tax practices.\n\nThe Gulf state charges no corporate taxes, making it a possible target for firms seeking to avoid paying tax in the countries where they actually operate.\n\nThe EU does not automatically add countries that charge no tax - a sign of being a tax haven - to its blacklist, but it requested the UAE introduce rules that would allow only companies with a real economic activity there to be incorporated in order to reduce risks of tax dodging.\n\n\u201cSWEET TREATS\u201d\n\nUnder an initial version of the overhaul, the UAE exempted from the requirement \u201call entities in which the UAE government, or any of the Emirates of the UAE, had direct or indirect ownership (no threshold) in its share capital\u201d, an EU document said.\n\nThat reform was deemed insufficient by EU states and prompted an amendment, adopted in September, that excluded from the requirement only companies in which the UAE government owns directly or indirectly a 51% share of the capital.\n\nThis reform was considered by EU ministers as sufficient to remove the UAE from the blacklist.\n\nJurisdictions that remain blacklisted are Belize, Fiji, Oman, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Vanuatu and the three U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands\n\nMajor economic partner Switzerland was removed from the EU gray list covering countries that have committed to change their tax rules to make them compliant with EU standards. It has delivered on its commitments, the EU said, and therefore is no longer listed.\n\nThey also removed the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, Albania, Costa Rica and Serbia from the gray list, leaving around 30 jurisdictions on the list.\n\nCountries in the gray list could be moved to the blacklist if they fail to deliver on their commitments.\n\n\u201cThe EU has whitewashed two of the world\u2019s most harmful tax havens,\u201d Chiara Putaturo of Oxfam, an anti-poverty group, said in reference to the decision of delisting Switzerland and Mauritius.\n\n\u201cDespite recent reforms, both countries will continue to offer sweet treats to tax-dodging companies,\u201d she said.", "description": "European Union finance ministers agreed to remove the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and Mauritius from the bloc's lists of countries deemed to be acting as tax havens, a move that activists called a \"whitewash\".", "authors": ["Francesco Guarascio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439181407&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990KG", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
