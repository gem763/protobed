He said:\n\n\u201cBlockchain, digital assets, and other developments hold great promise for our economy. Now is the time for LabCFTC to play an even greater role as we work to develop and write the rules for these transformative new products. That reality requires engagement at the highest levels within the CFTC, which is why I am elevating LabCFTC to be an independent operating office of the agency and a direct report to me.\u201d\n\nLabCFTC director: regulators are responsible for progress in innovation\n\nFounded by then-chairman Chris Giancarlo, LabCFTC is currently led by director and CIO Melissa Netram. Netram was an exec of regulatory affairs at Silicon Valley-based financial services firm Intuit before Tarbert appointed her to the new position.
