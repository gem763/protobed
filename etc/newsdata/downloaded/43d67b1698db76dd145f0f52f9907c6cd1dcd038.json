Recent defeats in court and in parliament for Prime Minister Boris Johnson have reduced the risk of a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31, a key risk event that has supported haven appetite in recent weeks. However, opinion polls suggest a general election \u2013 which most analysts expect before year-end, could still return a government more than willing to take the U.K. out of the EU without a transitional deal.\n\nElsewhere, fell 0.5% to $18.54 an ounce, while fell 1.5% to 941.40 an ounce.\n\nprices, a proxy for industrial demand which generally present a mirror image of haven assets, fell 0.4% to $2.59 a pound.", "description": "Gold Prices Dip but Holding Gains After Trump Sparks Risk-Off Move", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA660DP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
