But the machinations further confirmed to Brussels that Johnson has \u201clost control of events\u201d, senior EU sources said.\n\nThe behaviour of the prime minister last week in the Commons, where he described fears of Labour MPs about their safety as \u201chumbug\u201d, surprised EU officials and diplomats who had hoped the UK was serious about striking a deal.\n\nThere is now concern that the government is seeking simply to ramp up a \u201cblame game\u201d, sources said, with the chances of an agreement now seen as being \u201cvery low\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf he was going to compromise himself to find a deal with us, you would not be talking up the word \u2018surrender\u2019 all the time\u201d, said one EU diplomat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit minister Stephen Barclay.

This isn\u2019t very diplomatic language \u2013 it is mad,\u201d said a second EU source.\n\nBarclay told Barnier that the UK would table concrete proposals on Thursday, after the prime minister has made his speech at the Conservative party conference.\n\nThe UK insists that the status quo cannot continue on the island of Ireland in a post-Brexit scenario but that the extra checks and controls can be done away from the border.\n\nBarnier told diplomats for the EU27 last week that the UK had \u201cgiven up on the concept of preventing a border in Northern Ireland as well as the necessity of preserving the all-island economy\u201d.\n\nHe told the diplomats: \u201cYou can\u2019t base peace on promises \u2013 it will turn the border into a bargaining chip.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s capitals, in response, have expressed their \u201calarm\u201d to Barnier at the prime minister\u2019s \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude towards the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nJohnson\u2019s discussions in New York with Donald Tusk, the European Council president, have led the member states to conclude that there is a \u201cdeliberate choice in London to bring back a border\u201d, which would \u201cimperil stability\u201d, sources said.\n\nBarnier also rejected Barclay\u2019s attempts last Friday to open up talks about contingency plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit., to the British government\u2019s notable frustration, sources said.\n\nThe Brexit secretary had insisted that on his visits to EU capitals, a desire had been voiced for bilateral talks on how to manage the risks of leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nThe EU negotiator told the member states that the UK was looking to deliver the same benefits of the withdrawal agreement \u201cbut by different means\u201d.\n\nIn a letter exchange with Barclay, published last Friday evening, Barnier told the Brexit secretary: \u201cWe will not enter into any negotiations with the United Kingdom on these matters.\u201d He said the only offer he could make to the UK was to answer any specific questions it had over the EU\u2019s unilateral plans to protect itself from the chaos.", "description": "Brussels fears prime minister has \u2018lost control\u2019 of events and warns that hopes of an agreement are now \u2018very low\u2019", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c2a0ec908496adbb77c87a55cf671c7fe17533e/0_234_2371_1422/master/2371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=453653ecdec1720c9d4360768e780b8d", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
