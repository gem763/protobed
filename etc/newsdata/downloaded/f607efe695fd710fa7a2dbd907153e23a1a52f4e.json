I am not lucky. I am very happy running my personal best. But I still can do this (world record). I don\u2019t give up. It is encouraging for the future.\u201d\n\nBekele was part of a group, including fellow countrymen Birhanu Legese and Sisay Lemma, that quickly broke from the pack with a quick pace.\n\nLegese, winner of this year\u2019s Tokyo marathon, then gradually shook off Bekele and then Lemma after the 30km mark.\n\nBut Bekele battled back, leaving Lemma in his wake and then reined in Legese to cruise ahead but missed the world record time by two seconds despite a thrilling sprint towards the finish line.\n\n\u201cI was recovering (from injury) only three months ago. My preparation was not 100%. Fantastic result but I feel sorry missing marathon record by two seconds,\u201d Bekele said.\n\nLegese took second place in 2:02:48, becoming the third fastest marathon runner ever. Lemma was third, another 48 seconds behind.\n\nIn the women\u2019s race Ethiopian Ashete Bekere beat Mare Dibaba in a sprint to the finish to win with a time of 2:20:14 and complete the Ethiopian sweep.", "description": "Former Olympic and world champion Kenenisa Bekele staged a thrilling comeback to win the Berlin marathon on Sunday, dramatically missing out on the world record by two seconds after recording the second fastest time ever.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435148540&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S07B-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
