Rather, he said, it is a crucial piece of the puzzle of financing Canada\u2019s transition to a clean energy economy.\n\n\u201cWe purchased it for a reason,\u201d said Morneau. \u201cWe now see how it can help us accelerate our clean energy transition by putting any revenues that we get from it into a transition to clean energy. We think that is the best way we can move forward in our current context.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal government bought the existing pipeline for $4.5 billion in 2018, in a bid to overcome the opposition of the British Columbia government to the expansion.\n\nFederally, the NDP and Greens \u2014 the two parties with the most in common with the Liberals on climate change \u2014 think the expansion should be cancelled. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh underlined that point in a statement Thursday about a phone call the previous day with Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley.\n\n\u201cMs. Notley repeated her support for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and I told her that I continue to oppose the pipeline expansion,\u201d Singh said, though he added: \u201cWhile we disagree on TMX, we share concern for the workers.\u201d\n\nThe NDP has enough seats to support the Liberals through any confidence votes. While the NDP leader has said he wants tougher climate action, Singh has stopped short of using the pipeline as a line in the sand, suggesting that ship has effectively sailed.\n\nMorneau said construction on the pipeline is underway and the decision to go forward has been made, which means there is really no way to use it as a bargaining chip in the minority government.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that we have much common ground between the other parties that have been elected to the next Parliament,\u201d said Morneau.\n\n\u201cWe will be seeking consensus on how we can move forward on that common ground. This project we\u2019ve already moved forward on. It\u2019s one that we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re moving forward on, we\u2019ve actually already gone through that process.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the expansion is supposed to be done by the middle of 2022. The Liberal platform forecasted taking revenues of $125 million from Trans Mountain Canada in 2021-22 and then $500 million in each of the next two years.\n\nEventually, Morneau said the plan is to sell it back to the private sector and all of the revenues from the sale will then go to clean energy development and other climate change action projects.\n\nThe one specific promise the Liberals made that they connected to pipeline revenues was a $300-million annual fund for natural climate solutions including tree planting, as well as conservation and restoration of forests, grasslands, agricultural lands and coastal areas.\n\nConstruction on the pipeline was halted in September 2018, after the Federal Court of Appeal overturned federal approval citing insufficient environmental and Indigenous consultations.\n\nCabinet undertook new rounds of both and approved the expansion a second time in June.\n\nConstruction on the pipeline then resumed in August, starting with work on the marine terminals in British Columbia and pumping stations in Alberta. The first 50 km of actual pipeline will start being laid in the Edmonton area shortly, a spokesperson for Trans Mountain Canada said Wednesday.\n\nThus far, more than 2,200 workers have been hired.\n\nThe pipeline runs from a terminal east of Edmonton to a marine terminal in Burnaby, B.C. The expansion will see a second pipeline built roughly parallel to the first that can carry almost twice as much crude oil every day.\n\nThere is however a new federal court challenge underway from Indigenous communities who argued the secondary consultation process undertaken by the government earlier this year was a sham.", "description": "Morneau says pipeline is not fodder for negotiating with other parties in the minority government", "authors": ["Mia Rabson", "The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trans-mountain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
