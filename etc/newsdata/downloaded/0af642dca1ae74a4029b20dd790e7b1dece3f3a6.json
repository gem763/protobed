I'm so f***ing glad we got Osuna!'.\n\nTaubman was referring to the team's mid-season acquisition of star pitcher Roberto Osuna, who recently served a 75-game suspension for domestic violence.\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated's Stephanie Apstein, who reported the story, one of the women Taubman was addressing was wearing a purple bracelet for domestic violence awareness.\n\nHouston Astros assistant general manager Brandon Taubman insisted in a statement on Tuesday that he was 'misinterpreted' when during a highly-publicized locker room incident on Saturday\n\nThe Atstros are pictured during their victory in the American League Pennant in Texas on Saturday night\n\nOn Tuesday, Taubman released a statement conceding that he used 'inappropriate language' during the incident, but insisted that he was in no way condoning domestic violence.\n\n'This past Saturday, during our clubhouse celebration, I used inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed,' he stated.\n\n'My over-exuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue.\n\n'Those that know me know that I am a progressive and charitable member of the community, and a loving a committed husband and father,' he continued.\n\nThe story was first reported by Sports Illustrated's Stephanie Apstein (pictured). The magazine stood by her report when the Astros initially tried to discredit it\n\nThe assistant general manager concluded: 'I hope that those who do not know me understand that the Sports Illustrated article does not reflect who I am or my values. I am sorry of anyone was offended by my actions.'\n\nTaubman's statement garnered criticism for being a 'non-apology', with the Astros coming under added fire.\n\nShortly after the team was forced to issue a statement of their own, claiming that the incident was now under investigation.\n\nThey stated: 'Domestic violence is extraordinarily serious and everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behavior -- whether intentional or not -- that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence.'\n\nTaubman was referring to the team's mid-season acquisition of star pitcher Roberto Osuna, who recently served a 75-game suspension for domestic violence\n\n'It was a stunning turnaround for the team, who initially stated that Apstein and Sports Illustrated were fabricating their initial story.\n\n'The story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible,' the team stated on Monday night.\n\n'An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated's attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.'\n\nTaubman released this statement on Tuesday afternoon, prompting the Astros to reply stating that they had commenced an investigation into the incident\n\nHowever, the magazine stood by Apstein and her report - hitting back at the Astros, saying: 'Sports Illustrated unequivocally stands behind Apstein, her reporting and the story, which was subsequently corroborated by several other media members present at the scene.\n\n'Any implication that SI or any of its journalists would 'fabricate' a story in its detail or intent is both disappointing and completely inexcusable.'\n\nSeveral other reporters from other organisations were in the clubhouse at the time and claimed that Apstein's report was accurate.\n\n'Can confirm,' Hannah Keyser of Yahoo Sports tweeted on Monday.\n\n'The Astros called this [Sports Illustrated] report misleading. 'It is not. I was there. Saw it. And I should've said something sooner,' Hunter Atkins, a reporter with the Houston Chronicle, also posted on Twitter.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle cited eyewitnesses who described Taubman as holding a cigar and standing with two or three other men when he screamed toward the group of women. No interviews were taking place at the time and no players were in the vicinity, the Chronicle reported, with about eight feet separating the Astros official from the startled reporters.\n\nOsuna allegedly assaulted the mother of his son in May 2018. The woman returned to her native Mexico shortly after and charges were never filed by Toronto prosecutors against Osuna, who was a member of the Blue Jays at the time.\n\nAfter serving his 75-game suspension, Osuna was traded to Houston in July of 2018 and subsequently led the American League with 38 saves and an impressive 2.62 earned-run average this season.\n\nThe drama appears to have affected the Astros, who lost Tuesday night's game against the Washington Nationals.", "description": "The team's assistant general manager Brandon Taubman is facing the possibility of a suspension after he admitted using 'inappropriate language on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Andrew Court", "Alex Raskin For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/04/20066548-0-image-a-12_1571802866381.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
