He used thermal cameras to explore issues around refugees in Europe, and has used military infrared film to examine the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an obsolete technology historically used to make camouflaged combatants visible.\n\nSimilarly, in this work the UV fluorescence technique renders camouflage within nature more visible, bringing out unseen detail and making the familiar unfamiliar.\n\nImage copyright Richard Mosse Image caption Parasa indetermina with Aretaon asperrimus\n\nImage copyright Richard Mosse Image caption Dionaea muscipula with Mantodea\n\nFor Mosse, this unearthly light, as he describes it, becomes profoundly beautiful, heightening the perception of an interdependency of life within a complex and fragile eco-system.\n\n\"My subject, the tactile cloud forest mosses, lichens, spider webs, bark, corporeal orchid flesh and the dazzling carapaces of insects, once illuminated by this unearthly light, became profoundly beautiful,\" says Mosse.\n\n\"Wandering through the forest at night with a UV torch, I was enchanted by an unseen glowing world of natural activity.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Mosse Image caption Katydid with Nepenthes\n\nMosse builds his images from multiple individual frames, sometimes using 50 or more exposures to build large-format gallery prints.\n\nImage copyright Richard Mosse/Altman Siegel Gallery Image caption Exhibition view of Acineta superba\n\nImage copyright Richard Mosse/Altman Siegel Gallery Image caption The work is currently on show at the Altman Siegel gallery, San Francisco, USA.\n\nAll photographs copyright Richard Mosse.", "description": "Richard Mosse's ultraviolet photography of rainforest flora.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1466E/production/_109266538_10_rm-ph19-02_drosera-toakaiensis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
