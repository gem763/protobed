What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Invibes Advertising SA (EPA:ALINV) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Invibes Advertising\n\nWhat Is Invibes Advertising's Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2018 Invibes Advertising had debt of \u20ac1.90m, up from \u20ac1.11m in one year.
