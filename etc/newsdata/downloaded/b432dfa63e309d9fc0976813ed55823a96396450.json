A close confidant of fellow countryman Lynton Crosby, Mr Levido is director of politics and campaigning at Conservative Campaign Headquarters. He will be pivotal in decisions on how the Tories try to defeat Labour and win a majority. He is a protege of Sir Lynton, the electoral strategist known as the \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 who worked on Mr Johnson\u2019s two winning London mayoral campaigns. In 2015 and 2017, Mr Levido was in charge of Tory campaign messages. He recently served as the Australian Liberal Party\u2019s deputy director and was at the heart of the campaign that saw Scott Morrison clinch a surprise win. Under plans drawn up by Mr Levido, the Tories are targeting 50 swing seats and defending 50. He has told ministers he wants to secure a \u2018functional\u2019 majority. Privately, he has described Mr Johnson\u2019s \u2018fundamentals\u2019 as \u2018very positive\u2019. \u2018The numbers are moving in the right direction,\u2019 he said.\n\nOnward said without the support of Workington Man, a party cannot win a majority. The Labour-held constituency in which these characteristics are most common among voters is the Cumbrian town of Workington, making it the ultimate bellwether seat in the next election.\n\nWorkington is a longstanding Labour seat held by Sue Hayman, which voted Leave and has a 4,000 majority.\n\nWill Tanner, director of Onward, said: \u2018This election will be the most volatile in living memory and no party should be complacent. But it is clear that the Conservatives\u2019 path to victory runs through working-class rugby league towns like Workington, Warrington and Wigan, which usually do not give them a second thought \u2013 as well as the party\u2019s leafy heartlands in the South of England.\u2019\n\nThe seven towns that were founding members of rugby\u2019s Super League \u2013 Castleford, Halifax, Oldham, St Helens, Warrington, Wigan, Workington \u2013 have returned only one Tory MP in every ten elections since 1918 and currently have a median Labour majority of 13,273. As well as looking to the North, the Tories are chasing gains in Wales, where there are a number of marginal seats up for grabs in pro-Brexit areas.\n\nBut there are also considerable dangers for Mr Johnson.\n\nHe faces the threat of a Liberal Democrat resurgence in Remain areas in London and the Home Counties \u2013 and could see votes going to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party in the North.\n\nGains in Wales could also be cancelled out by losses in Scotland, where the pro-independence SNP is expecting a series of wins.\n\nJeremy Corbyn too faces the threat of being squeezed, with Remain supporters defecting to the Lib Dems and Leave backers going to the Brexit Party or the Tories.\n\nLord Hayward, a Tory peer and election expert who correctly called the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, said: \u2018Because there are so many parties potentially involved in so many seats, this is a hugely unpredictable election.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaving the House of Commons, London, after MPs voted by 438 to 20 to back a Bill enabling the election to take place on December 12\n\n\u2018There are some certainties \u2013 the SNP will gain ground in Scotland. The Tories will be under severe pressure from the Lib Dems in the Home Counties and the South West, while Labour is going to face a real difficulty in university seats.\u2019\n\nYesterday election expert Sir John Curtice said he expected parties other than the two major ones to have a record number of MPs after the election.\n\n\u2018I think the safest prediction is that we will have a record number of non-Conservative and non-Labour MPs in this Parliament,\u2019 he told LBC.\n\n\u2018We could have more than 100 MPs that do not belong to either of the other two parties. That matters for two reasons. The first is that it makes it difficult for either Conservative or Labour to win an overall majority if you\u2019re taking the fact that 100 of the seats are already spoken for.\n\n\u2018Secondly, it matters because this is an asymmetric election. It\u2019s an election that Boris Johnson has to win.\n\n'If he does not get a majority or something very close to it, he will not be able to stay in government because the Conservatives do not have any friends elsewhere.\n\n\u2018This is not an election that Labour have to win to stop Brexit, but it is an election that they and the other opposition parties simply need to deny the Conservatives a majority.\u2019", "description": "A think-tank said the swing seats were populated by older, white, non-graduate male voters living in towns in the North of England with strong rugby league traditions.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20349424-0-image-a-3_1572386469515.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
