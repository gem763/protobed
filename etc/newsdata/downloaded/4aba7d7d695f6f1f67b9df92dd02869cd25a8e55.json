Against UCLA, he became the first to rush for 100 yards or more in the opening quarter of a game (103) and the first to record at least 200 yards passing and 100 yards rushing in a first half. His 141 yards rushing in the half were the most by an OU quarterback through two quarters.\n\nTYING TEBOW\n\nHouston quarterback D\u2019Eriq King has passed and run for a touchdown in 14 straight games, tied for the longest streak in FBS history with Florida\u2019s Tim Tebow (2006-08).\n\nGETTING THEIR KICKS\n\nThree kickers made 57-yard field goals, tied for longest in the nation since 2016.\n\nPenn State\u2019s Jordan Stout kicked his against Pittsburgh, Illinois\u2019 James McCourt hit his against Eastern Michigan and Texas\u2019 Cameron Dicker made his against Rice.\n\nStout broke Penn State\u2019s 44-year-old school record of 55 yards set by Chris Bahr. McCourt tied the Illinois record, and Dicker\u2019s field goal was the longest by a Texas kicker since 1985.\n\nSACK MAN\n\nBoise State\u2019s Curtis Weaver tied the school record with four sacks against Portland State, most by a Broncos player since 1996. Weaver is tied for the national lead with six sacks, and his career total of 26 1/2 is highest of any active Football Bowl Subdivision player.\n\nAN ALL-AROUND GUY\n\nSouthern Mississippi\u2019s Jaylond Adams became the first player this season to go over 300 all-purpose yards. He had career highs with 11 catches for 180 yards and ran back a kickoff 100 yards. Those were the highlights of his 322-yard performance, the best by a Southern Miss player since 1982.\n\nKansas State freshman Malik Knowles also had a 100-yard kick return against Mississippi State.\n\nCONVERTING ON THIRD DOWN\n\nArizona converted a nation-high 15 third downs on 21 attempts against Texas Tech, the most since Tulsa converted 16 against Oklahoma State in the 2017 opener.\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 season conversion rate went from 48 percent (12 of 25) to 58.7 percent (27 of 46), good for fifth in the FBS.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There have been four 200-yard rushing games this season, and two of them belong to Oklahoma State's Chuba Hubbard.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/oklahoma_st_tulsa_football_71303_c0-84-2000-1250_s1770x1032.jpg?299aef161871dd3e8e2369fbee176c61f9e10561", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
