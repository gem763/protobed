They also say there are plausible mechanisms by which optimism might have an effect.\n\nThe team say the results are interesting since optimism is largely influenced by non-genetic factors, meaning it might be possible to shift people\u2019s mindsets and, potentially, improve their health outcomes \u2013 although that idea is still being researched.\n\nProf Alan Rozanski of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, first author of the research, said boosting optimism meant more than simply telling people to \u201cthink positively\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have multiple ways to help them including [developing skills for] problem solving, developing the muscle of positive thinking through interventions like gratitude, and using cognitive behavioural therapy,\u201d he said.\n\nPublished in the journal Jama Network Open, the research examines results from 15 studies encompassing a total of almost 230,000 participants. Ten of the studies explored a link between optimism and the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or death from heart disease, while nine looked at the risk of death from any cause. All were published between 2001 and 2017, and followed participants for anywhere between two and 40 years.\n\nWill I be healthier if I\u2019m optimistic?

The vast majority of studies showed a link between an upbeat outlook and a lower risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of death during their study period \u2013 although the size of the association differed.\n\nWhen the results of different studies were taken together, the team found that compared with the least optimistic participants, the most optimistic had a 35% lower risk of cardiovascular events and a 14% lower risk of early death.\n\nLinks remained even when the team looked particularly at the impact of depression, exercise, education, or the length of time participants were followed \u2013 although in some cases the size of the link was affected. What\u2019s more, 12 of the 15 studies found a dose response \u2013 in other words, the more optimistic you are, the lower the risk of either outcome.\n\nRozanski said there were a variety of possible mechanisms for the links, including that more optimistic people tended to lead healthier lives, such as having better diets, being proactive and anticipating problems, while there was evidence that they also had lower blood pressure and less inflammation than more pessimistic people. Another factor, he said, could be that optimistic people were better at problem-solving and coping with adversity.\n\nHowever, the new research has limitations \u2013 not least that some of the studies measured optimism in different ways, and followed up with participants of different ages and over different periods of time, while almost all were conducted in the US or Europe.\n\nHowever, the team say their results are backed up by other studies showing links between optimism and a lower risk of other health problems, including heart failure and respiratory disease infection.\n\nRozanski said optimism was only one of many factors linked to health outcomes, meaning problems could not be prevented simply by positive thinking, and there was much more to explore.\n\n\u201cI think it would be valid to look at other mindsets \u2013 gratitude, sense of life purpose \u2013 or, on the negative side, what does a strong sense of regret or resentment do to people?\u201d he said. \u201cWe in medicine need to start to look at the importance of mindsets and its intimate relationship to health.\u201d", "description": "Review of 15 studies finds link between positive outlook and cardiovascular health", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/197082176d38a8d36f8af505fcf908a9fa4a5550/621_730_7021_4212/master/7021.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0890345a834a340d0bb4ecb363941b4e", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
