This animal is darker.\n\n\"All we know at this stage is it is dark-coloured.\n\n\"There are varying estimates of size, between five metres and 10 metres.\n\n\"That is consistent in description with a humpback and also other types, including a minke whale.\n\n\"We are working with British Divers Marine Life Rescue, who are monitoring the behaviour of the whale and the type of species.\n\n\"It is not an everyday sight, although we have had a number of whales in the Thames.\"\n\nHe also added it is \"too soon to assess\" how long the whale could be in the river for.\n\nThe British Divers Marine Life Rescue service confirmed the sighting of the whale.\n\nA member of the team said: \"We observed the humpback whale in the Thames Estuary for just over three hours today, the whale was diving and surfacing at approximately 5-6 minute intervals, slowly moving down river with the outgoing tide.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe whale has been nicknamed Hessy by some Twitter users.\n\nOne account, called Girl About the Thames, wrote today: \"Hessy The Thames Humpback Whale was sighted at Ford Dagenham this morning. Unfortunately it\u2019s headed further in.\"\n\nPolice Constable Dempster, a member of the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit, spotted the sea creature during an overnight patrol.\n\nHe tweeted: \"It was spectacular! Was gobsmacked it was so big. Would estimate about 15 meters.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDavid Callahan, who spotted the whale further along near Rainham, Essex tweeted: \"It looked to be about eight metres long.\n\n\"Remarkably undisturbed by container ships going up and down. Just kept on diving. It's hard to imagine much food for it there.\"\n\nThe sighting comes after a beluga whale, normally found in the Arctic, was spotted in the River Thames near Gravesend, Kent, in September 2018.\n\nIt remained in the river for about nine months before it eventually made its way out towards the North Sea.\n\nNamed Benny by animal lovers, it attracted a large number of visitors who came down to the shore to watch it.", "description": "The whale, already nicknamed online Hessy, was seen between Crayford Ness and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in Dartford, Kent", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Shaun O Riordan", "Swns", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530945.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_THAMES_WHALE_03.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
