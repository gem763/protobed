Thank god they weren\u2019t a judgmental bunch of b*****ds!\u2019\n\nNathalie replied: \u2018I worked in retail\u2026\n\n\u2018Unfortunately people really love to see (what they perceive) as someone\u2019s downfall\u2026. I was quite regularly teased by customers or experience them enjoying bossing me around\u2026. but I got my payslip every month and I paid my bills whilst forming a thick skin and an iron will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Having a job is an achievement but it really is a privilege. In many places in the world people can\u2019t get a job that pays them anything near a living wage. These tabloids will criticise people who collect benefits but in the next article humiliate someone for working.\u2019\n\nNathalie went on to nab the role of Missandei on Game Of Thrones and has since starred in two The Fast and The Furious movies as Ramsey and landed the role of Maya in Four Weddings and A Funeral.\n\nKatie has been working at B&M since leaving EastEnders (Picture: BBC / Kieron McCarron)\n\nKatie, who played Hayley Slater on EastEnders last year, has not taken on any new acting roles and has opted to provide for her two children Lillie May, 10, and eight-year-old Alfie, rather than fight her way through an uncertain and difficult industry.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve taken a step back from acting. I\u2019ve got a job and I\u2019m looking after my kids,\u2019 she told Daily Star Sunday.\n\nMore power to her.\n\nAmongst those who have supported Katie are Hollyoaks and The Fall star Bronagh Waugh, who tweeted: \u2018Since leaving Hollyoaks I have had some amazing TV & film gigs but I\u2019ve also had loads of times of being out of \u201cwork\u201d so have worked as a nanny, a cleaner, and a teacher and I am proud of every single one of those jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know her but Katie Jarvis seems like a BOSS.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
