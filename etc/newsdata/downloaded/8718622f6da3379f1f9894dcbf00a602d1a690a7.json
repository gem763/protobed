In 2017 alone, the US military purchased about 269,230 barrels of oil per day and emitted more than In the same year, the Air Force purchased $4.9 billion worth of fuel and the Navy $2.8 billion, followed by the Army at $947 million and Marines at $36 million. If the US military were a country, it would sit between Peru and Portugal in terms of volume of fuel purchasing, according to data form the World Bank country liquid fuel consumption. In 2014, the scale of emissions was roughly equivalent to total emissions from Romania according to the Department of Defense data obtained by the researchers. The Air Force is by far the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. In addition to using the most polluting types of fuel, the Air Force and Navy are also the largest purchasers of fuel.\n\nAs fresh water stores in underground aquifers are depleted and sea levels rise, salt water is drawn into the aquifers making them undrinkable.\n\nThe report recommends the Army begin developing new technologies to capture \u2018ambient humidity\u2019 from the atmosphere via the United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), something that could cost up to $100 million.\n\nThe current strategy for supplying troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and parts of Africa with water relies on contractors to supply bottled water, shared use of local wells, and Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units which treat unsafe water.\n\nEven with these measures the Army is \u2018precipitously close to mission failure concerning hydration of the force in a contested arid environment.\u2019\n\nIn arid environments the average soldier uses 7.9 gallons of water per day, the equivalent of 66 pounds, including three gallons of drinking water.\n\nTo minimize the added burden of carrying more water as temperatures rise, the report suggests using micro water collectors to harvest some of the estimated 13 trillion liters of water in the atmosphere.\n\nIt takes 66 pounds of water to support the average Army soldier in an arid environment each day, a figure that will increase as temperatures rise\n\nThese devices are boxes lined with a layer of metallic filtering, called metal-organic frameworks or MOFs, which capture water particles as air passed through them during the night.\n\nDuring the day, sunlight transforms the captured water particles into vapor that\u2019s channeled into a condenser where it\u2019s converted back into water.\n\nThe report also considers a number of other challenges posed to the military by climate change, including the development lightweight vehicles to better traverse unstable landscapes, planning for increased conflict in the north as Arctic ice melts, and the spread of infectious diseases driven by growing insect populations.\n\nYou can read the full report here.", "description": "The US Army has released a wide-ranging new study examining the threats climate change, something for which  the military is 'precariously unprepared for' and needs to address urgently.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20148666-0-image-a-29_1571947063068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
