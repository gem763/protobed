Police told Ali to refer the matter to the relevant department.'\n\nWhen he was told to 'leave it to police', he took matters into his own hands by putting up 60 wanted posters, which saw the pair hand themselves in\n\nHe said that he'd been 'worried stick' for two weeks, not least because a busted change machine has hit the business' finances hard.\n\nBut on September 16, Mr Sadjady received an email from police saying the pair had 'handed themselves into Shepherds Bush Police station'.\n\nHe later found out that they had done this just three days after the alleged raid on his business - long before they were arrested.\n\nBut the email from a PC added they 'were not arrested by the officers due to some sort of misunderstanding. I'm not entirely sure why they were not arrested there and then'.\n\nAnd on September 17, police wrote to the launderette manager: 'Both suspects were arrested last night. They are going to be interviewed a bit later this morning.'\n\nHe is worried other criminals will view his launderette as a 'soft target'.\n\nThe 41-year-old admitted that he's also worried about the precedent set by the police for allowing the two criminals to 'hand themselves over'.\n\nMr Sadjady said: 'Obviously, I'm glad that some kind of arrest has been made.\n\n'But it wouldn't have happened without me and Ali guiding them at every step.\n\n'We spearheaded the investigation. We sent the police the tapes. We put up dozens of posters in the areas and warned locals about the pair.\n\n'We even managed to track them down to an address and told police about it.\n\n'I worried for those two weeks that they might come back.\n\n'They burgled us on a Sunday night, and it wasn't very late. They were probably riddled with drugs, and weren't afraid of being caught.\n\n'What if someone had been there? The guy had a hammer.'\n\nHe added: 'Even now, I'm concerned that their friends will come over.\n\n'If people can get away with small crimes like this, what of big crimes?'\n\nThe Met Police confirmed they were contacted at around 8.15pm 'following a theft at an unmanned self-service launderette'.\n\nThey also confirmed that two suspects 'entered the premises and forced open a change dispensing machine, stealing a quantity of cash before fleeing.'\n\nA spokesman added: 'On 4 September two people attended a central London police station in relation to the incident.\n\n'They were spoken to and their details taken; neither were arrested at that stage.'\n\nMargaret Connors, 46, and and Danny Brand, 36, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to charges of theft at Highbury Magistrates' Court on September 18.\n\nThey failed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on October 9 for sentencing, and a warrant has been issued for their arrests.", "description": "Amir Sadjady, 41, rang the police half an hour after burglars used a hammer to smash open the cash machine at his west London launderette on September 1.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/11/19734234-0-image-a-2_1571133644701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
