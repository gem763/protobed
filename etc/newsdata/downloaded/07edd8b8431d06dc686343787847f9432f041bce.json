However, a Foreign Relations Committee aide said votes on Hong Kong-related measures were expected in the chamber in the coming weeks.\n\nThe third measure passed by the House is a non-binding resolution recognizing Hong Kong's relationship to the United States, condemning Beijing's \"interference\" in its affairs, and supporting the right of the city's residents to protest.\n\nThe fourth was another non-binding House resolution commending Canada for its actions related to a U.S. request to extradite Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada in December.\n\nMeng is charged in the United States with bank fraud and is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings about Huawei's business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.\n\nThe United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. Many Republican and Democratic members of Congress say they view the company as a security threat.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by massive marches and at times violent protests involving teargas, petrol bombs and live rounds, over concerns Beijing is tightening its grip on the city and eroding democratic rights.\n\nBeijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, like the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.", "description": "All four measures passed by unanimous voice vote, as members of Congress \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 said they wanted to take an aggressive stance on China and show support for Hong Kong following four months of unrest in the city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103507686-GettyImages-75279164.jpg?v=1571185948", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
