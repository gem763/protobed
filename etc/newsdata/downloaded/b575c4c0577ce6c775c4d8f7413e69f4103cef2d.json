It\u2019s been a few years since her last fashion effort with the brand, but the actor and designer has teamed up with Opening Ceremony once again this time for a denim capsule collection that launches today. It\u2019s based on Chloe\u2019s nostalgia for her favorite vintage jeans and inspired by Japanese street style as depicted in the iconic magazine FRUiTS. \u201cEach time I have worked on a collection, it is always pieces that I want to wear personally and I want to see my friends in,\u201d said Chlo\u00eb. \u201cAlso, the desire to create pieces that can work on all shapes and sizes. This collaboration is a result of that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe collection is full of the vintage-inspired shapes Chlo\u00eb is famous for wearing, from a jacket with leg o\u2019 mutton sleeves, to flarekick jeans and a ruffled mini dress. It\u2019s all been washed using an eco-conscious, oxygen-based process that eliminates chlorine, thus producing zero harmful drain water. \u201cThere is a lot more to come, but I also think that brands can do sustainable work and have best practices when choosing a factory, while not necessarily putting a label on it,\u201d Opening Ceremony\u2019s Humberto Leon told i-D. \u201cThis should be second nature to everyone.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only green aspect of the collection \u2014 in conjunction with the launch, OC is partnering with Cotton\u2019s Blue Jeans Go Green recycling program, which turns used denim into natural cotton fiber insulation. You\u2019ll be able to donate your denim at the store through November.\n\nYou can see the collection photographed below, inspired by FRUiTS, on the streets of Florence. \u201c FRUiTS is an exhaustive source of material, celebrating young people pushing the limits for decades,\u201d Chlo\u00eb told i-D, and we would say the same of her. Here, Chloe and Humberto tell us about their long running collaboration, the joys of denim, and schoolgirl chic.\n\nThe Chlo\u00eb Sevigny for Opening Ceremony Fall/Winter 2019 collection will launches today\n\nopeningceremony.com and Opening Ceremony stores in New York and Los Angeles, and Tokyo.\n\nChlo\u00eb\n\nWhat's changed in terms of what you want to design since the last time you worked with Carol and Humberto?\n\nTheir knowledge of sustainable factories and factory practices is very much at the forefront of how they move forward in their design process. Hopefully all of the fashion world will follow suit.\n\nLet's talk about FRUiTS \u2014 what do you love about the publication? How has it inspired you?\n\nPeople watching has always been my main source of style inspiration. FRUiTS is an exhaustive source of material, celebrating young people pushing the limits for decades.\n\nWhat inspired the silhouettes of the jackets?\n\nWe wanted the looks to be able to be worn as suits. I also wanted to provide a more \"girly\" cut with the puffy sleeves, and a more androgynous look with a boxy cropped cut.\n\nHas school girl-chic always been an inspiration to you?\n\nSchool girl-chic is a classic look that never falters. It\u2019s flattering and simple.\n\nWhat made you want to focus on denim?\n\nThe mini collection is an homage to the great history of Japanese denim, to fantasy and playfulness.\n\nWhat cut of jeans is in? What's out? We must know!\n\nI\u2019ve never subscribed to \u201cout\u201d or \u201cin\u201d, people should wear whatever they feel empowered by. Nothing is as attractive as confidence.\n\nHumberto\n\nWhy did you think it was time to collaborate with Chlo\u00eb again?\n\nChlo\u00eb is my all-time favorite collaborator because no one has more original style than her. A lot of these projects we have worked on together just start from organic conversations and talking about what we love.\n\nWhy did denim feel like the right direction to go in?\n\nWhenever we hang out Chlo\u00eb is always wearing denim, so it was a natural direction for us. Chlo\u00eb really wanted to explore denim as a fabrication and to see how we could produce it sustainably. We started with Japanese denim because there is such a strong history around denim manufacturing and looms in Japan. We found an incredible manufacturer who could do an almost no-water ozone wash of denim.\n\nYou've got a storied relationship \u2014 what's it like for you and Carol working with Chlo\u00eb?\n\nEvery time we collaborate it really just starts with us as friends talking about things we like. It's always exciting to see these conversations come to live with items people around the world can buy.\n\nWhat's the starting point for a Chlo\u00eb collaboration \u2014 does she come in with inspirations?\n\nChlo\u00eb comes in with drawings and ideas of what she wants and then we go back and forth on how to make her ideas come to life. She was very specific about the denim washes she wanted and was involved in everything from the stitching details to the types of collars.\n\nFRUiTS encapsulated a kind of individualism in fashion \u2014 is this something you still see?When I worked with FRUiTS a couple years ago to tell the story of street style, Shoichi Aoki loved staying in different areas and capturing how people put outfits together. It\u2019s very similar to how Chlo\u00eb and I grew up, when all these kids found clothing in thrift stores or on the street and put together incredible outfits. Chlo\u00eb and I share a love for what street style meant to us back in the day. It\u2019s changed a lot today, and Shoichi and I talked a lot about that when we worked together.\n\nIs this collection a hint that OC will be incorporating more sustainable practices into its work?\n\nThere is a lot more to come, but I also think that brands can do sustainable work and have best practices when choosing a factory, while not necessarily putting a label on it. This should be second nature to everyone. For example, we do produce all of our jersey in Portugal and the government enforces a water recycling program with those factories. It\u2019s a good start, but we just don\u2019t feel the need to talk about it, because by default we should be thinking this way.", "description": "The eco-conscious denim collection is inspired by Japanese street-style and 'FRUiTS' magazine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dae1b9f5c1f5f000a321fc9/lede/1571691429201-oc-x-chloe_5.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.421xh;0xw,0.0965xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
