About 40% of the global population lives within 100 kilometers of a coast, it says, and 1 in 10 live in areas less than 10 meters above sea level.\n\nGoldman highlighted three cities which would be subject to those storm surges and in the future could face harmful flooding \u2014 New York, Tokyo, and Lagos. Miami, Alexandria, Dhaka, and Shanghai face major flood risks due to being less than 11 meters above sea level.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nGoldman's researchers said that when starting the study they took a broad consensus that human activity, namely emission of greenhouse gasses \"is causing the earth to warm in ways that are affecting the climate.\"\n\nNatural ecosystems would be damaged, and risks to human health would rise, as well as pressures on food and drinking water.\n\nAgriculture would also be massively affected: \"Warmer temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns could reduce yields and nutritional quality as well change growing seasons and agricultural zones around the world.\"\n\nGoldman gave some fairly stark warnings about potential outcomes:\n\nMore frequent, more intense, and longer-lasting heatwaves. The consequences will affect human health, productivity, economic activity, and agriculture. \"Higher surface temperatures could exacerbate the warming process by causing permafrost to melt, releasing further methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe consequences will affect human health, productivity, economic activity, and agriculture. \"Higher surface temperatures could exacerbate the warming process by causing permafrost to melt, releasing further methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.\" Destructive weather events, including storms, winds, flooding and fires. It's not just New York, Tokyo and Lagos. \"Other major low-lying coastal or already flood-prone cities include Shanghai, Dhaka, Mumbai and Karachi \u2013 each of which has a population of 15 million people or more.\"\n\nIt's not just New York, Tokyo and Lagos. \"Other major low-lying coastal or already flood-prone cities include Shanghai, Dhaka, Mumbai and Karachi \u2013 each of which has a population of 15 million people or more.\" Changing disease patterns. \"Warmer temperatures could cause disease vectors to migrate from the tropics to regions where people have less immunity; this is true not only for viruses like malaria and dengue fever but also for water-borne and food-borne diseases.\"\n\n\"Warmer temperatures could cause disease vectors to migrate from the tropics to regions where people have less immunity; this is true not only for viruses like malaria and dengue fever but also for water-borne and food-borne diseases.\" Shifting agricultural patterns and food shortages. \"Livestock could be affected by higher temperatures and reduced water supplies. Ocean acidification is likely to put stress on aquatic populations and affect current fishing patterns. Some of these changes are already underway. Some climate scientists, for example, estimate that coral reefs will be all but extinct over the course of the century due to ocean acidification.\"\n\n\"Livestock could be affected by higher temperatures and reduced water supplies.

These dynamics could affect everything from the availability of drinking water for people to a shortage of water for livestock and crops (with negative effects for the food supply) to decreases in hydroelectric power generation.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nThe bank said that all those factors would \"affect economic activity, damage infrastructure \u2013 from buildings to transportation to water and waste-management systems \u2013 and disproportionately harm vulnerable residents.\"\n\n\"Despite the uncertainty around the timing and scale of the impact, it may be prudent for some cities to start investing in adaptation now,\" Goldman says. \"Urban adaptation could drive one of the largest infrastructure build-outs in history. Given the scale of the task, urban adaptation will likely need to draw on innovative sources of financing.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs", "description": "A Goldman Sachs report on the impact of climate change on cities across the world makes for grim reading.\u00a0 Rising temperatures would lead to changing...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d8b4acc2e22af27691d55f8-1744/screen-shot-2014-08-14-at-65331-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
