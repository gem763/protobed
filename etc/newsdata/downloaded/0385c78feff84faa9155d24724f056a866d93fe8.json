The last one, in March, attracted up to one million marchers.\n\nOrganisers said there was no question of plans for the demonstration being changed because of the Commons sitting, pointing out that permission has already been granted for the march and the rally in Parliament Square.\n\n\"It makes the march even more important than ever,\" said a spokesman. \"It makes the march absolutely pivotal.\"\n\nMr Johnson is expected to meet Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, on Thursday, but with no realistic hopes of a breakthrough to reach a deal.\n\nIn a TV interview on Tuesday evening, Mr Varadkar attacked the UK\u2019s proposals for \u2018two borders\u2019 to avoid the need for the backstop, to guarantee no hard border.\n\n\u201cEssentially what the UK has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with prime minister May\u2019s government over two years and have sort of put half of that now back on the table and saying that\u2019s a concession. Of course it isn\u2019t,\u201d he protested.\n\nDavid Sissoli, the president of the European Parliament, was also downbeat after meeting Mr Johnson in No 10.\n\n\u201cI came here in the confident hope of hearing proposals that could take negotiations forward. However, I must note that there has been no progress,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs I explained to Mr Johnson, the parliament will not agree to a deal at any price. We will not agree to a deal that undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process or compromise the integrity of our single market.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is preparing a dramatic Saturday sitting of parliament later this month in a last-gasp attempt to avoid having to ask the EU for a Brexit delay.
