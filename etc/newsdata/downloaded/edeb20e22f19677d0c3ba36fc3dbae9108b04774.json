Don\u2019t tell your children one thing and do the opposite\n\n\u201cParenting is hard,\u201d says Anne-Lise. \u201cBe aware of your bad habits, children will copy them.\u201d There\u2019s lots of good advice about social media and smartphone usage that we should all pay more attention to. For example, keeping the bedroom clear of computers and mobile phones and not looking at screens in the hour before going to sleep. So don\u2019t tell your kids to put their phone down and go for a walk if you\u2019re not doing it yourself. You need to lead by example. You could even go for that walk together.\n\n4. Social media can build girls\u2019 self-belief\n\n\u201cThe way that social media works today is that the more you consume, the more you get served exactly the same content. The campaign we\u2019ve devised is called Disrupt your Feed,\u201d says Edwina Dunn. \u201cThe study we did was to take young girls and to say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to change what you love consuming but we\u2019re going to introduce up to four new women who may be in a sphere of (their) interest \u2013 like science, like saving the planet, like business\u2019 \u2013 and measured these girls over a period of a year to see whether that had changed their outlook and their belief in their future career opportunities. The research\u2026 basically showed an absolute link between new feeds that were more in their sphere of interest and an outcome that led them to believe that they could do this.\u201d\n\nWoman's Hour is on BBC Radio 4 on weekdays at 10am and at 4pm on Saturdays.
