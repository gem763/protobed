Burroughs noted that Harvard has a diverse group of admissions staff, which includes Asian Americans, that reviews a diverse pool of applicants.\n\nThe judge also pointed out that several admission officers had testified there was no racial animus or prejudice in the school\u2019s admissions process.\n\n\u201cConsistent with this, the court finds no persuasive documentary evidence of any racial animus or conscious prejudice against Asian Americans,\u201d wrote Judge Burroughs, an Obama appointee.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, a group known for challenging affirmative action policies, filed the lawsuit on behalf of Asian American students who said Harvard was trying to keep them out of the institution because of their ethnicity. They argued that the university should be looking at economic diversity among applicants instead of placing a heightened focus on racial diversity.\n\nEdward Blum, a conservative attorney leading the challengers, said he will appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the documents, emails, data analysis and depositions [Students for Fair Admissions] presented at trial compellingly revealed Harvard\u2019s systematic discrimination against Asian American applicants,\u201d Mr. Blum said in a statement, CNN reported.\n\nHarvard admits about 2,000 students a year, and in 2019 received 35,000 applications.\n\nThe judge said the school, though it uses race in the admissions process, does not have a specific quota for students from various racial groups.\n\n\u201cThe court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster,\u201d Judge Burroughs wrote.\n\nGroups supporting racial diversity in the admissions process said the ruling reassures schools that a \u201climited and measured consideration of race\u201d is valid and important.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling rightly recognizes that race-conscious admissions is both lawful and indispensable for ensuring institutions are open and available to students from all walks of life, including racial minorities,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\n\u201cRace-conscious admissions allows Harvard \u2014 and colleges across the country \u2014 to cultivate diverse campus environments that move our country forward,\u201d Ms. Clarke added.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions also has a case pending against the University of North Carolina over its use of race-based admissions standards.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
