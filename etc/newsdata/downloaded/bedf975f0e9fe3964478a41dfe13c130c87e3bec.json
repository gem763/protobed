That is why the government is preparing several measures to tackle it,\" she said.\n\nCombined with blazes in Sumatra, at least 800,000 acres of land in Indonesia have burned this year, Indonesia's National Board for Disaster Management said\n\nThe Malaysian leader said the country stood prepared to help Indonesia tackle the problem, Bernama reported.\n\nSingapore also issued a health advisory last week due to heightened air pollution from the blazes in Indonesia, warning residents to stay indoors.\n\nIndonesian forest fire season is in full swing\n\nThe blazes in Indonesia occur annually. Paper and palm oil plantations farm their crop in the rich peatlands of the Sumatran coast and the island of Borneo.\n\nEvery year, the farmland is dried out and burned to prepare for the following year's crop and to clear forests. Peat, dry and rich in carbon, can burn for weeks.\n\nAt its peak, air pollution in Indonesia has reached levels as high as 1,000.\n\nEarlier this week, Indonesia's National Police announced 185 people had been arrested for their role in the expansive fires. Nearly 100% of the fires \"occurred due to human factors,\" a spokesman said.\n\nThose found guilty of setting the fires can be fined up to 10 billion rupiah, or $700,000, and managers of firms setting them may face up to 10 years in jail. But identifying suspects has proven difficult, and the fires have continued.", "description": "As smog from Indonesia's sprawling forest fires chokes neighboring Malaysia, authorities there have distributed 2 million face masks to students in affected areas, state news agency Bernama reported Thursday.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911115915-malaysia-pollution-0910-super-tease.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
