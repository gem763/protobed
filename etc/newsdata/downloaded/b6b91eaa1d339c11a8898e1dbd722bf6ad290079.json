But the world champion delivered an impressive time with his final throw of the dice to be in contention for victory tomorrow.\n\n\"I am extremely happy about today,\" said Leclerc. \"It was a very good lap but there were some moments where I thought I lost the car, but I got it back.\n\n\"We came here knowing that it would be a difficult track for us but the team has done an incredible job to bring the package we needed. I had a tough Friday, it was not my day, and I didn't feel comfortable in the car, but the hard work has paid off.\"\n\nHamilton added: \"I don't know where Ferrari picked up their pace today. Charles put some great laps in and it needed something special in the end.\n\n\"It was as much as I could get out of the car but I am happy to be on the front row and in the mix with them so we can divide them. We can be aggressive tomorrow.\"\n\nVettel looked on course to secure his first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix in June, but an underwhelming final lap saw him drop to third, two tenths off the pace of his team-mate.\n\n\"I cannot be happy with that last lap,\" he said.\n\nRed Bull driver Alex Albon will start from sixth ahead of McLaren's Carlos Sainz. Lando Norris finished 10th in the sister McLaren.\n\nPA", "description": "Charles Leclerc secured a hat-trick of pole positions to put his Ferrari at the front of grid for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix.
