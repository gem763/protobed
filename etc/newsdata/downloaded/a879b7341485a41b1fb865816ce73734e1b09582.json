Patrick Foy of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife told ABC News that in the 23 years he's worked at the agency, he's only heard of three similar incidents of mountain lions breaking into homes.\n\n\"While it is not common, it is not unheard of,\" Foy said.\n\nWith permission from the homeowner, who initially suspected an actual burglar, officials used a two-by-four plank of wood to break the bathroom window, creating enough space for the lion to escape without injury. Soon after, officials banged on the bathroom door, creating enough noise to scare the mountain lion outside.\n\nThe cat's leap from the second floor was shown in a video posted to Facebook by the Tuolumne County Sheriff.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, as long as mountain lions aren't exhibiting aggressive behavior, they tend to be \"shy and extremely stealthy\" and don't pose a threat to public safety.", "description": "Mountain Lion breaks into California home before leaping out of bathroom window.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/General/mountain-lion-breakin-ht-ps-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
