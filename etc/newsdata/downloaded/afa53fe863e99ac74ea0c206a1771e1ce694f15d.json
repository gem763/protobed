In addition to murder in the second degree, he was also found guilty of two counts of criminal weapon possession.\n\n\u201cThomas Gilbert Sr. was a beloved member of his family and business community when his own son murdered him in a coldblooded killing,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said Friday in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut now, thanks to my office\u2019s prosecutors, the defendant has finally been held accountable, and he will serve a life sentence for this unconscionable crime. While nothing can undo the tragedy of Mr. Gilbert\u2019s death, I hope that the resolution of this case helps his loved ones as they continue to heal from this devastating loss.\u201d\n\nGilbert's attorneys never denied the fact that their client killed his father; rather, they argued with an insanity defense, and according to CNN, on Friday, Shelley Gilbert, the victim's wife and defendant's mother, said that she wanted her son \"to be given as light a sentence as possible.\"\n\n\"As I've said many times in court, we've been trying to get Tommy into a hospital for 15 years,\" she said. \"He's too sick to be able to judge. He needs to be in a hospital, had he been so my husband would still be alive.\"\n\nShe also said she plans to appeal the sentencing.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "His mother plans to appeal the ruling.", "authors": ["Caroline Hallemann"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iRA8o.zb.7RSXskm7vUF.w--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/de54a82da3c7e4ee8000a0ec0e829893", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
