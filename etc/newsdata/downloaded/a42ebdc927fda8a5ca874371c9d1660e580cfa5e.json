Pretty grim stuff.\n\nIn an interview with Video Games Chronicle explaining how the game\u2019s character customisation will work, CD Projekt Red level designer Max Pears said that Johnny Silverhand (the character played by Reeves) will not be one of the many characters that the protagonist, V, can form a sexual or romantic relationship with.\n\nSilverhand, a cybernetically augmented punk musician, was introduced in the original pen-and-paper roleplaying game Cyberpunk 2020 and will function as a major support character in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nKeanu Reeves being a major character in a nerd-ass RPG based on a 1980s pen-and-paper game is just about almost as strange as directors Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn playing characters in the upcoming and already utterly bizarre-looking Death Stranding. What a time to be alive.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is set to be released on Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Google Stadia in April next year.", "description": "Keanu Reeves is off the table as a romantic partner in upcoming futuristic dystopian RPG 'Cyberpunk 2077', out April next year.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/keanu-1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
