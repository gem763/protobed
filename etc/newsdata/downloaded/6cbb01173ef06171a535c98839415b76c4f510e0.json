Photo: Tiffany A. Bloomfield\n\nIf you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ve probably wondered what famous people add to their carts. Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the hand sanitizer and the electric toothbrush. We asked Jacqueline Woodson, whose new novel Red at the Bone comes out today, about the book, wine, and pens she can\u2019t live without.\n\nuni-ball Rollerball Pens, Fine Point, Black Ink I just love these pens \u2014 I\u2019ve been using Uniball for the past 15 years, probably. They have a fine point and it\u2019s so easy to write with them. I actually write both by hand and on the computer, so when I\u2019m in the writing zone I don\u2019t even want to be aware of my pen, I want to just think of it as an extension of my hand. I have them at my desk, I have one in my pocket right now \u2014 they don\u2019t leak, so I don\u2019t worry about ink stains \u2014 and I have them on the standing desk upstairs, and I have them beside my bed. $15 at Staples Buy\n\nAarke Premium Carbonator We had stopped using our Soda Stream because we\u2019re boycotting it, and were without a soda maker. We drink a lot of seltzer and hate the idea of single use plastic bottles, so this came in the mail as a birthday present for my partner last September, and it\u2019s beautiful. We have a place up in Brewster, and we were actually putting it in our car and taking it back and forth, and then I just broke down and bought another one for up there. $200 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nParnassus Books Short Sleeve T-shirt Parnassus is one of my favorite bookstores. It\u2019s an independent bookstore in Nashville, Tennessee, and when I did an author visit there some years ago, they gave me this shirt. One of the things that makes it so special to me is the fact that Ann Patchett owns that bookstore and we go way back to the \u201990s. The connection between my writing life and my independent bookstore life is really deep because the independent bookstores were some of the first to really support me when the bigger bookstores were like, We don\u2019t know you from a can of paint. I just wear the Parnassus shirt all the time. I wear it when I go running, I wear it when I\u2019m sitting on the stoop. I feel proud to have this huge Parnassus logo on my chest because it represents my love of independent bookstores. $15 at Parnassus Books Buy\n\nBrown Estate 2016 Chaos Theory Brown\u2019s is a black-owned vineyard in Napa Valley, and it\u2019s absolutely the best wine I\u2019ve ever tasted. It\u2019s my favorite wine. Whenever there\u2019s a celebration, we bring out the Brown. Their zinfandels, their whites \u2014 every single bottle we open is amazing, and I love that it\u2019s a black-owned vineyard and the fact that it\u2019s small. It\u2019s the only wine that I order online. They have a 2016 cab that\u2019s great, and then they have a Big Dam Cab from 2014 \u2014 I don\u2019t drink it that often because it\u2019s $125. The one I get the most that I actually can afford is the Chaos Theory, which is only $40. These aren\u2019t wines you drink every day; these are wines that you have when some really good friends are over, and if they aren\u2019t really close you don\u2019t share it! $40 at Brown Estate Buy\n\nI have memberships to Apollo, Schomberg, BAM, the Botanic Gardens, and the Brooklyn Museum. I just love that you can get a membership and support the arts. It pays back, too: Not only am I supporting the arts, but I get to see shows that are discounted or free, and I get to be on the mailing list for all of these lectures. For a long time, especially when I was younger, I took for granted that these institutions existed and gave back to communities. They\u2019ve made a huge difference in the everyday way of being able to afford New York City. I think a lot of people think they have to do something expensive to have a good time in this town, and that\u2019s not the truth.\n\nA Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith This is a copy that I bought recently from the Brooklyn Public Library. The book takes place in Williamsburg, and I grew up in Bushwick. It was one of the earliest books I read about a neighborhood in close proximity to where I was growing up, and even though there was a 40-year difference between when me and Francie were living, I just love that it\u2019s a story about this girl who loves reading, who loves sitting on her fire escape, who also loves spending time with her brother, who loves her Brooklyn neighborhood. Her life mirrored mine in so many ways, even though there was a racial divide and a divide in time between us. When I wrote Another Brooklyn it was paying homage to both James Baldwin\u2019s Another Country and Betty Smith\u2019s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It\u2019s also great to be able to walk through neighborhoods that are so filled with literature. We have Community Bookstore in Park Slope, which is about four blocks from where I live, and then we have Greenlight Bookstore in Fort Greene; Word, which is in Greenpoint; and Stories Bookshop on Bergen, where I stop in whenever I walk by and get something for my son because I want to support the store. And on Fifth Ave in Brooklyn, we actually have a small independent comic book shop, too. I remember a time when independent bookstores were disappearing, and I love living in a time when they\u2019re expanding. $19 at Brooklyn Public Library Buy\n\nLundberg Family Farms White Long Grain Rice $6 (was $8, now 25% off) $6 at Fairway Buy\n\nWe\u2019ve been doing Sunday family dinner for 17 years now. Basically it\u2019s a gathering of our extended family, and this inter-generational thing that has gone on for a long time. We sit around our long, long table, and we talk about our week and what we\u2019re grateful for, and have deeper conversations about everything from economic class to race to struggling in fourth grade. It\u2019s really grounding. The meal is completely curated \u2014 it\u2019s not potluck, we\u2019ve lived through the age of people bringing lentil loaves and shit \u2014 and we decide who\u2019s going to make the main course, what the sides will be, who\u2019s going to bring the dessert. The last time we did Korean beef bowls, and some had beef, some had chicken, and some had tofu, and we had daikon and spinach and brown rice and white rice. People made their own bowls, and there was also a platter of collard greens, and always a salad.\n\n\u201cSomeday I\u2019ll Love Ocean Vuong\u201d Broadside Ocean Vuong and I recently did a conversation together. That came about because someone told me about him, so I went online and listened to him read one of his poems and was just completely blown away. I got a galley of his book On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous and read it in three days \u2014 I\u2019m sure someone else could read it in a day but I\u2019m a really slow reader \u2014 and the language in it is so stunning. I was like, who is this guy? So I wrote his editor a letter and said this book has blown me away, please congratulate Ocean Vuong and tell him I look forward to meeting him someday. Then he was going on book tour, and his publisher asked if I would be in conversation with him at the Strand. I loved him as much in person as I did reading his words. And then as a thank you \u2014 like, who does this?\u2014 he sent me this broadside and said \u2018I had brought it to give you at the Strand but I was too shy, so I\u2019m putting it in the mail to you.\u2019 And you know...tears. It\u2019s so beautiful.\n\n[Editors note: The broadside is currently unavailable, but Ocean Vuong\u2019s On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous is available here.] $20 at Copper Canyon Press Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
