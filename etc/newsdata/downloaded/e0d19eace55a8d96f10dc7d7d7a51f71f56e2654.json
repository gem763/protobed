It was his third goal in four matches for France, but his header was cancelled out late on by Kaan Ayhan in a 1-1 draw.\n\nGiroud had scored an important winner against Iceland on Friday but Deschamps did not feel he could manage two starts in four days, having managed just 187 minutes for his club this season.\n\n\u201cYou know, Olivier suffers his situation. Before January, nothing will move,\u201d Deschamps told a press conference.\n\n\u201cAfter, it will be up to him to see. I hope he will have more playing time.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot take away his goals, his good performances. He scores, he makes others play well.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps said Olivier Giroud\u00b4s lack of pitch time with Chelsea is impacting on his international selection (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cHe knows he is under pressure, but he always responds.\u201d\n\nFrance laboured at home to Turkey, who remain Group H leaders ahead of their opponents on 19 points because of a superior head-to-head record after a 2-0 win in Konya in June.\n\nThey had 23 shots but only nine were on target, producing only one goal.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we needed to win that game,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cWe had the chances, they didn\u2019t, but it is what it is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good point. We\u2019ll have to finish the job in November,\n\n\u201cWe are the two best teams in the group. Qualifiers are always complicated, it\u2019s a long road.\n\n\u201cWe should have been more efficient. They defended a lot and they deserve to be where they are.\u201d\n\nFrance face Moldova next month while Turkey host third-placed Iceland.", "description": "The veteran striker came off the bench to score in a 1-1 draw with Turkey.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715204-1571094279-191_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
