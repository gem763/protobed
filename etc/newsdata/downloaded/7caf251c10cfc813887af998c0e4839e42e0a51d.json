But during a more than 6-hour spacewalk to repair batteries on the ISS last week, McClain discovered that a medium-sized spacesuit fit her better than a large.\n\n\"McClain learned during her first spacewalk that a medium-size hard upper torso \u2014 essentially the shirt of the spacesuit \u2014 fits her best. Because only one medium-size torso can be made ready by Friday, March 29, Koch will wear it,\" NASA said in a statement Monday. Astronaut Nick Hague will take McClain\u2019s place.", "description": "It was slated to take place on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/CKHun7vb18sDetHX3KPiJtWzqzE=/0x134:1920x1214/1920x1080/2019/03/25/1553555675126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-25"}
