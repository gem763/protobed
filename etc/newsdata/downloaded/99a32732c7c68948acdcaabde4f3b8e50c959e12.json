He was wearing Texas A&M apparel, but ESPN cited an athletic department spokesman in reporting the man is not an Aggies student-athlete.\n\nManziel played two years at the school, completing 68.9 percent of his passes in throwing for 7,820 yards and 63 touchdowns and rushing for 2,169 yards and 30 scores on 345 carries. The first freshman to win the Heisman, Manziel finished fifth in the voting the next year.\n\n\u2014Defensive lineman Antonio Alfano, Alabama\u2019s top recruit in the Class of 2019, hasn\u2019t shown up for practice this week amid disciplinary issues.\n\nCoach Nick Saban addressed Alfano\u2019s status with reporters Wednesday night, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s kind of disappeared a little bit. I talked to our team today about the fact that people make mistakes. We all mistakes. ... But I think you compound the problem when you don\u2019t confront the mistakes that you make and you create greater consequences for yourself because of the choices and decisions that you make after you make a mistake. So hopefully this will be a learning experience for all the guys on our team.\u201d\n\nAlfano, from New Jersey, was suspended for an undisclosed reason for last Saturday\u2019s game against New Mexico State and wasn\u2019t on the sideline. He is allowed to practice during the suspension but has missed three practices this week.\n\n\u2014Indiana quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will be a game-time decision Saturday at No. 6 Ohio State.\n\nThe redshirt freshman is dealing with an unspecified injury, described by Hoosiers coach Tom Allen as \u201csomething not feeling right.\u201d Penix has completed 38 of 60 passes for 523 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions in two games this year.\n\nAllen was stingy with the details but did say the injury shouldn\u2019t be long term and that it did not occur in last weekend\u2019s 52-0 victory over Eastern Illinois.\n\n\u2014Less than two weeks after starting Cal\u2019s season opener, redshirt freshman tight end McCallan Castles said he is entering the NCAA transfer database.\n\nCastles started the Golden Bears\u2019 27-13 victory against UC Davis on Aug. 31, but had dropped to third on the depth chart behind sophomores Jake Tonges and Gavin Reinwald.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 235-pound Castles, who caught one pass for 15 yards in 2018, did not have any receptions in two games this year.\n\n\u2014After surrendering 80 points in its first two games, Florida State added former South Florida head coach Jim Leavitt to its defensive staff.\n\nLeavitt, 62, will have the role of defensive analyst and will be tasked with helping defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett with game-planning, Seminoles coach Willie Taggart said.\n\nLeavitt was Taggart\u2019s defensive coordinator during the latter\u2019s lone season as coach at Oregon in 2017.\n\n\u2014Former Ohio State coach Urban Meyer hasn\u2019t ruled out a return to coaching after stepping down from his post earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not there at the moment,\u201d Meyer told Cleveland.com when asked if he\u2019d consider coaching in 2020. \u201cLike you said, next year can I say that? We\u2019ll talk again next year and we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nMeyer\u2019s response is a change from where he was in May, when he told The Columbus Dispatch, \u201cAll I\u2019m going to say is I believe I\u2019m done (coaching). I think I\u2019m done.\u201d", "description": "Police at Texas A&M haven't exactly got their man in the theft of a Johnny Manziel uniform from the Hall of Champions at the school's football stadium on campus in College Station, Texas, but they have identified a man they want to interview.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
