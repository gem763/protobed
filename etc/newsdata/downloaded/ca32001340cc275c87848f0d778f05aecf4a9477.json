A \u201cpoor\u201d (less than 100 percent of the FPL) family of four would have an income of $25,000 or less. Compare these incomes to average infant child care costs and one wonders, how do these families afford it?\n\nThe answer: Most of them don\u2019t pay for child care. As shown below, the majority of poor and low-income children from birth to age 3 are cared for by a parent or by an unpaid caregiver, such as a grandparent or other relative. The majority of their more affluent counterparts are in paid child care.\n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using the Early Care and Education Usage and Households\u2019 Out-of-Pocket Costs: Tabulations from the National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE), OPRE Report #2016-09, August 2016\n\nOne explanation for these care arrangement gaps is that stay-at-home parents give up earnings from work, thus increasing the likelihood that their household\u2019s total income is low or poor. But a larger share of poor and low-income children also receive unpaid child care compared to higher-income children, such as by a grandparent or other relative. When parental and unpaid care are combined, only 32 percent of poor children and 36 percent of low-income children receive paid child care.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this means that the high costs of child care are mostly borne by higher-income families. What does this mean for public policy? One implication is that a universal child care program like that proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren would benefit a number of relatively high-income families. The number of low-income families that would benefit is up for debate.\n\nPresumably, a universal child care program would allow some stay-at-home low-income parents who would prefer to work if not for child care costs to find employment. A universal child care program would also allow some parents to switch from unpaid care to paid care if that is what they want. However, it is unclear how many parents prefer unpaid arrangements with a family member to paid center-based care. And for low-income workers in particular, many job schedules can be unpredictable and do not match up with the typical 9 to 5 center-based schedule.\n\nAdditionally, a universal child care program in Quebec, Canada found that the program shifted a number of children from parental or informal care to formal care, which ultimately hurt children and families. From an NBER digest:\n\n\u201cDisturbingly, the authors report that children\u2019s outcomes have worsened since the program was introduced along a variety of behavioral and health dimensions. The NLSCY [the survey used for the study] contains a host of measures of child well being developed by social scientists, ranging from aggression and hyperactivity, to motor-social skills, to illness. Along virtually every one of these dimensions, children in Quebec see their outcomes deteriorate relative to children in the rest of the nation over this time period.\u201d\n\nThe view that low-income families are burdened with high child care costs is not quite true. Most low-income families don\u2019t pay for child care, either due to parental preference or because of the cost. And some receive government assistance to help offset the cost. Policymakers should debate the most appropriate way to help low-income parents who want to work afford child care. But they should also recognize that an expansive program like universal child care will shift many children from unpaid to paid child care, potentially introducing some children to negative outcomes. Rather than a universal program, the right balance might be to target with limited assistance those parents who want to work but cannot afford child care otherwise.", "description": "Policymakers should recognize that universal childcare will shift many children to new services, potentially introducing some children to negative outcomes.", "authors": ["Angela Rachidi"], "top_image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RTX178P4-e1571256621567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
