I don\u2019t tally,\u201d she told me during an interview after her appearance at a NARAL Pro-Choice America event on Thursday, when I asked how many ongoing suits Massachusetts currently has against the administration. \u201cWe just bring cases we need to bring.\u201d She has filed dozens of cases on everything from \u201cvoting to the census to health care to immigration to the environment and . . . on women\u2019s access to health care.\u201d\n\nState attorneys generals have always worked cooperatively in major litigation against private firms, as they are doing against pharmaceutical companies in the opioid crisis \u2014 and as they have done against the tobacco companies, lenders after the financial crisis and in all sorts of consumer protection cases. \u201cWhat happened and what you saw after the 2016 election was the emergence of a group of AG\u2019s,\" she explained. \"It is highly unusual to find ourselves at a time having to take on the federal government, to stand up for the rule of law, protect democracy, protect people\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe courts have been allies in the fight to restrain Trump\u2019s agenda,\" she said. \"The courts have really been the place we\u2019ve gone to toe the line on some of these illegal and unconstitutional actions.\u201d She and the other attorneys general have been quite successful in bringing suits, usually with requests for preliminary injunctions. \u201cIt is critically important we had this branch to go to stop abuses by the executive branch,\u201d she said. Multiple iterations of the Muslim travel ban and environmental regulations were stopped by states\u2019 actions in court.\n\nWhile it is \u201ctoo soon\u201d to tell the impact of Trump-appointed judges, the rate of confirmations and the spotty qualifications of some remain a long-term concerns. In this context, Healey credits the role of state courts, laws and constitutions that can retain rights and protections when the federal government rolls back.\n\nOn health care, Massachusetts and other states have multiple actions pending around the country seeking to preserve the Affordable Care Act and/or stop administration efforts to undermine or whittle away the protections in the law. On a more basic level, she finds the administration\u2019s conduct on health care extraordinary. Healey explains, \u201cThe Republicans have tried to take away healthcare how many times? 97 times? 100 times? You saw the American people come forward to say, \u2018Don\u2019t take away our healthcare.\u2019 \" Nevertheless, the Trump administration continues court actions to obliterate the ACA and slash Medicaid. \u201cWhat you see is Democratic AG\u2019s stepping into the fore,\u201d she said. Healey also said she hopes for \u201cmore sensible policy making\u201d and an end to efforts to take away what they cannot take away through legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMassachusetts has joined California and other states in seeking to maintain the waivers that California gets (and other states sign onto) to allow higher air-quality standards than the federal government requires. The feds now want that to end, and to reverse progress made in various states with the full cooperation of the auto companies. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid policy. It\u2019s stupid economically and it\u2019s really morally reprehensible,\u201d Healey says. She finds the administration\u2019s response \u2014 suing the auto companies for cooperatively keeping air-quality standards high \u2014 a ridiculous use of resources.\n\nI asked Healey about the scandal enveloping the White House and Justice Department. Healey says she finds it \u201cvery troubling, very disturbing and [I] think it should be a significant cause of concern any American.\u201d She reiterates that the attorney general is the people\u2019s lawyer, not Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and yet, time and again, it has been Trump\u2019s personal interests that have prevailed. Healey says it is \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d that so many lawyers at Justice Department, the White House and elsewhere seem to have been involved or at least have been mute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just within the White House DOJ,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look what\u2019s happening in the Congress, too. Any number of those senators are lawyers themselves or have lawyers working for them and yet for them to continue to turn a blind eye to an administration that does not respect the rule of law. . . .\u201d\n\nHealey worries that corrupt conduct gets normalized. \u201cI did it, so what?\u201d seems to be the new defense, she observed. \u201cWe need a time out and a reset about what is right and what is wrong.\u201d She fears we have gone \u201castray\u201d and rather than adhere to our constitutional traditions we are \u201creplicating authoritarian regimes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Warren does win the presidency, it\u2019s quite possible that Healey will occupy a prominent role, or perhaps try to run to replace Warren as senator. I asked Healey whether she thought Republican Gov. Charlie Baker would, in that event, have an obligation to appoint a Democrat on a temporary basis. For the first time during the interview, she replied briskly: \u201cNo comment.\u201d For now, she\u2019s a principal legal antagonist of the administration and an enthusiastic Warren supporter. Remember her name, however. I\u2019m quite certain that Massachusetts attorney general will not be the highest office she holds.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaura Healey: Why I and other attorneys general are saying no to Purdue Pharma\u2019s settlement\n\nDavid Byler: Elizabeth Warren has a plan for how to get ahead of Joe Biden.
