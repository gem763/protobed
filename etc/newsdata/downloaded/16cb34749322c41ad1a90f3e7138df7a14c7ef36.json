You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the Home Office said that while the medical treatment she was receiving was \u201cunlikely\u201d to be available to the same standard in India, this did not entitle her to remain in the UK \u2013 and that she could receive \u201cpalliative care\u201d in her home country if the appropriate treatment wasn\u2019t available there.\n\nLawyers and politicians said the case demonstrated how UK immigration rules were permitting the government to \u201csend people to their death abroad\u201d as part of the hostile environment.\n\nIt marks the latest in a string of cases in which Home Office decisions to refuse immigration applications have been met with outrage from campaigners.\n\nMs Esapathi, who came to the UK on a study visa in 2010 and proceeded to work in the arts industry before she fell ill with Crohn\u2019s disease, said she would be \u201crisking her life\u201d if she had to leave the country.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who has set up a campaign to support immigrants and those with chronic illnesses, said: \u201cI thought there was no way they could dispute my application. I wasn\u2019t expecting them to say that \u2018Even if the drugs aren\u2019t available then you could receive palliative care\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be rational. I don\u2019t think they would put me on a plane if they actually saw me. I have tubes all over me. But then I also read stories about them coming to get people with no time to get legal representation.\u201d\n\nThe east London resident had initially been living in Britain on student and work visas, but when she fell ill she reapplied under human rights medical grounds. Her application was refused in September 2018 while she was unconscious in hospital, and her appeal was refused two months later.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She currently relies on a drip and has to have a bag attached to her stomach, and is waiting to undergo further surgery in the summer.\n\nIt comes after a Pakistani father was denied treatment under UK immigration rules. Nasar Ullah Khanwas, 38, was told he could not have a transplant because he had overstayed his visa.\n\nIn a separate case, an American woman with two disabled British children was threatened with removal last month, meaning they would have been taken into care. The decision was later quashed by the High Court.\n\nThe Home Office refusal letter to Ms Esapathi\u2019s appeal, issued on 3 December, stated: \u201cWhereas it is accepted that the health care systems in the UK and in India are unlikely to be equivalent, this does not entitle you to remain here ... Should it be the case that your illness deteriorates or you are unable to access treatment, you have not shown a lack of palliative care or family support available in India.\u201d\n\nIt also claimed there were \u201cno insurmountable obstacles\u201d to her continuing relationship with German national Mr Mangler, who is settled in the UK, overseas, despite the couple stating in their application that his job as a volcanologist \u201cdepended on him staying in the UK\u201d.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIn March 2019, the Home Office was made aware of fresh evidence in this case and this is currently being reviewed.\u201d\n\nA letter from a number of surgeons at St Mark\u2019s Hospital, where Ms Esapathi was operated on, states that her \u201dsurgical and medical management is highly complex\u201d and that it is \u201cof vital importance\u201d that her care continued to be coordinated and performed there.\n\n\u201cThis also means that, both now and after her surgery in 2019, Bhavani will not be able to travel due to her ongoing need for specialist care in our hospital as her recovery after her next operation is likely to be protracted and complex,\u201d it adds.\n\nDescribing her current physical condition, Ms Esapathi said: \u201cI\u2019m in a pretty vulnerable state right now with somewhat of an open stomach.\n\n\u201cI would do anything to just be able to have a conversation with the Home Office, because when you\u2019re just exchanging letters they say things that are completely untrue and you have no way to refute that or to have a dialogue about it.\n\n\u201cAll of this is making my condition worse. You\u2019re meant to avoid stress, but I can\u2019t help my body\u2019s reaction to certain things. I\u2019m currently in hospital and haven\u2019t been able to put on weight \u2013 stress is a big part of it.\n\n\u201cIt would be a risk to my life if I had to leave. I won\u2019t have any of the drugs that literally allow me to move. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask to not want to die.\u201d\n\nDiane Abbott, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, said such cases revealed the \u201ccruel and insensitive\u201d treatment by the Home Office under the Conservative government.\n\n\u201cUnless the government end the hostile environment policies, we will continue to see unnecessary distress inflicted on vulnerable people,\u201d she added.\n\nChai Patel, legal director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the Home Office\u2019s decision to issue Ms Esapathi a removal order when she was in a coma was \u201dinhumane and cruel\u201d, but \u201cnot surprising from a department where officials are trained in how to reject human rights claims, and incentivised to issue removal orders\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
