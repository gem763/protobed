He also said: \u201cIt is important to realise that, while we calmly take our time to change the law, one thing which won\u2019t change is our ability to trade freely with Europe.\u201d\n\nRight before adding: \u201cIt would not be in any nation\u2019s interest artificially to accelerate the process and no responsible government would hit the start button on a two-year legal process without preparing appropriately. Nor would it be in anyone\u2019s interest to hurry parliamentary processes. We can set the pace.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWe can only wonder, then, which of the following outcomes has taken Mr Gove more by surprise. Was it a) actually being a member of a government that did the thing no responsible government could do?\n\nOr was it b) finding himself, and this really is a miracle, as the actual head of \u201cno-deal planning\u201d, which is to say planning for an outcome that he himself had made clear couldn\u2019t possibly happen?\n\nAnd I suppose we must then wonder, do we care? Is it in fact biologically possible to care at all what Michael Gove says about anything? Given the overwhelming evidence that it is, all of it, always, how can we put this... complete bollocks?\n\nWell, maybe we should care. Not least as the chasm between what Michael Gove thinks will happen and what then does happen is a black hole of light years\u2019 width into which all our little lives must now be sucked.\n\nNo light escapes from it and so none has been shed on the many mysteries at the start of what can only be described as a busy week in British politics. And a week, as it happens, in which one or two of those \u201cparliamentary processes\u201d are, much to Gove\u2019s surprise, finding themselves a touch on the \u201churried\u201d side.\n\nA good moment then for day one of Michael Gove\u2019s big \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d advertising push. He\u2019s spending \u00a3100m of your money on it. There are big \u201cGet Ready\u201d signs up on the side of shopping centres. (An interesting choice, location wise, for where to market the fact that the thing people have to \u201cget ready\u201d for is there not being anything in the shops to buy, but that is such a comparatively low-level embarrassment we barely have time to get into it).\n\nAnd it is on day one \u2013 traditionally an important day for advertising campaigns \u2013 that the thing we are to be \u201cgetting ready\u201d for is, wait for it, the self-inflicted collapse of the government and the actual suspension, in Britain, of the rule of law.\n\nIndeed, for anyone casting a filmic eye over the possibilities of Brexit, it may be worth noting that at the very moment a handful of manual labourers were plastering the words \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d up on the walls of the Westfield London shopping centre, Michael Gove was himself live on the BBC, explicitly refusing to answer whether the government still considered itself bound by new laws made by parliament.\n\nNew laws, let\u2019s be clear, that could be passed on Tuesday, by opposition MPs, to prevent no-deal Brexit. Laws which would, if passed, retroactively make Michael Gove\u2019s 2016 speech less ridiculous. Whole chunks of it could be rendered true again. Some of the things Michael Gove had said couldn\u2019t possibly happen, could actually not happen.\n\nAnd yet, here was Michael Gove himself, saying the government he was part of, the second one in a row that is about to do something \u201cno responsible government\u201d could possibly do, would refuse to obey any law that wouldn\u2019t make Michael Gove look ridiculous. (He was also, while he was here, gently tweaking those 2016 soundbites to the rather pithier, \u201cEveryone will have the food they need\u201d, but as with earlier, no time for that embarrassment now either.)\n\nAnd not just that. We now know that any Conservative MP prepared to stand in the government\u2019s way, and deliver the sane Brexit the Brexiteers themselves promised, by passing legislation that would rule out the thing they said could never happen, would now be stripped of the party whip and deselected at the next election, which at time of writing, could feasibly be happening in the next couple of hours.\n\nIs it the most delicious of Brexit ironies yet? Well there\u2019s stiff competition for that, but we\u2019ll spell it out anyway.\n\nThe Conservative Party has now suffered a full takeover by what was once known as Vote Leave. It is threatening to break up the Tory Party, a party which the person doing the breaking up, Dominic Cummings, has never quite got round to actually joining.\n\nAnd how do we know the Vote Leave takeover is complete? Because anyone trying to deliver the Brexit that Vote Leave actually promised will now forcibly be chucked out.\n\nIndeed, let that be a harsh lesson for anyone considering joining, or indeed merely voting for, the Conservative Party any time in the next few weeks.\n\nIt is now, as of Monday 2 September 2019, a party that expels anyone that tries to keep their promises.\n\nBest of luck in that election, lads.", "description": "In April 2016, in a speech that genuinely rivals Neville Chamberlain\u2019s \u201cpeace in our time\u201d as the most comprehensively wrong one in British political history, Michael Gove was of the view that the UK voting Brexit and somehow ending up outside the EU\u2019s free trade zone \u201cis as credible as Jean-Claude Juncker joining Ukip\u201d.", "authors": ["Tom Peck"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/16/gove-front-5.jpg"}
