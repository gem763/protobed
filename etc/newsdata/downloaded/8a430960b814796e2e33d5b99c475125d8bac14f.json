It is unclear if the probe is part of regular checks or a special investigation.\n\nGoogle has been generating huge profits with its Play Store app but pays no tax in Korea because it claims to have no official place of business here. It uses the same ruse in Europe, where it is only registered in Ireland.\n\nOther industry insiders said the NTS may be seeking to scrutinize the earnings of top YouTube content creators in Korea. Some of them generate huge profits from ads on YouTube, which is owned by Google, but are not taxed like other businesses.\n\nProfits made by Korean YouTubers are tallied by Google's offices overseas and wired to the individuals.\n\nA Google staffer declined to comment.\n\n", "description": "Tax Officials Raid Google Offices", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2018-12-13"}
