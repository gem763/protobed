Congenital heart disease is a general term for a range of birth defects that are present at birth. The most common heart defects include: Septal defects: When there's a hole between two of the heart's chambers, which is known commonly as a 'hole in the heart'. Coarctation of the aorta: Where the main large artery of the body, is narrower than normal Pulmonary valve stenosis: When the pulmonary valve is narrower than the normal. This valce controls the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs. Transposition of the great arteries: When the pulmonary and aortic valves and the arteries they're connected to have swapped positions.\n\nThe authors themselves noted that they had found a statistically significant increase in only one very rare subset of CHD, which was attributed to maternal drinking, not paternal drinking.\n\nThe authors wrote that they 'did not find a statistically significant association between parental alcohol exposure and the remaining phenotypes of CHDs because of the limited number of included studies for specific phenotypes.'\n\nAs noted, fathers who didn't drink at all seemed to be at higher risk for children with CHD than those who drank moderately.\n\nGreater risk of CHD among drinking fathers compared to non-drinkers didn't start to appear until seven drinks or more a day.\n\nIn the past, studies that have attempted to draw a similar connection between intoxicants and birth defects have been proven unreliable.\n\nFamously, a study of 23 babies from the 1980s inaugurated the belief that mothers who used crack during pregnancy greatly increased the likelihood of birth defects.\n\nA later longitudinal study found that it was poverty in general and not crack-use specifically that caused birth defects.", "description": "A recent study that claimed men who drank while trying to conceive with their partners were at greater risk of children with heart disease turns out to have been based on presumptions not science.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19504784-0-image-a-6_1570653685284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
