It may sound sad, but they're used by millions", "language": "en", "text": "Really, it was only a matter of time. We have apps to control central heating, help us get fit, deliver food and find love, so it\u2019s no wonder the latest life-improving tech is targeting our ability to make friends.\n\nIn a crowded marketplace, many apps zero in on particular groups, such as mums, over-50s, travellers or dog lovers.\n\nAnd, with today\u2019s greater emphasis on wellbeing and alleviating anxiety and depression, it\u2019s only right that the value of good, active friendships is going up.\n\nFEMAIL investigates which phone apps could help you find friends in your local area\n\nStudies have shown a large circle of friends can improve confidence and happiness levels and even give you a higher pain threshold. But do we really need an app to find these friends?\n\nHow can conversing with a profile picture, however well attuned to our own personality, compare to the joy of meeting someone in real life? Here, we road-test some of the best friendship apps vying for your business . . .\n\nFOR BUSY GIRLS\n\nPEANUT\n\nPeanut can help busy girls make friends with each other\n\nWhat it does: Helps you meet local mums, share parenting tips or just complain about your children to sympathetic ears. Input your and your offspring\u2019s age so it has a better shot at matching you with someone at a similar point in motherhood and life. Next, pick categories that best describe you, from \u2018outdoorsy\u2019 to \u2018always on vacay\u2019, to build a profile.\n\nAny good? It\u2019s a kind community recommended by the NHS, with forums on topics including speech disorders, baby clothing rental apps and the school run, as well as a group for military mums. I found information about swimming classes \u2014 and four potential friends.\n\nSticking point: None, to be honest.\n\nPrice: Free.\n\nFOR PLATONIC RELATIONSHIPS\n\nPATOOK\n\nPatook helps you find platonic relationships\n\nWhat it does: Patook (Armenian for \u2018little hug\u2019) uses artificial intelligence to detect anything that sounds like a romantic advance, to prevent flirting. Sixty per cent of users are women, and the app has a simple format \u2014 just a deck of profiles to browse and an inbox to chat.\n\nA points system matches potential friends by asking questions, such as your pet peeves, interests and profession \u2014 as well as what traits you look for, such as their gender, languages they speak, their education level and their marital status, to bolster your chances of success.\n\nAny good? Popular with those working long hours for the NHS, introverts, single parents, mid-lifers and some with debilitating conditions that prevent them getting out and meeting others, such as multiple sclerosis.\n\nSticking point: To get better matches, you\u2019re encouraged to have long conversations with multiple users and generally use the app lots, which takes time.\n\nPrice: Free.\n\nFOR FINDING YOUR 'TRIBE'\n\nWE3\n\nWE3 aims to find a person's 'tribe'\n\nWhat it does: First, a questionnaire deciphers your personality, goals, beliefs and values, then complex computer algorithms are used to place three people into one group chat (called \u2018tribes\u2019). This helps those who find making one-on-one friendships awkward. Profiles are private, so only those matched with you can see you.\n\nAny good? You have to pass through three lengthy levels of questioning to be matched to a tribe, then another two before you can start one of your own.\n\nSigning up felt like being cross-examined by a psychologist. It did work, though. I was matched with two intriguing women within 5km of home, a management consultant and a research fellow.\n\nSticking point: You need to set aside half-an-hour to enter enough information to make it useful. You\u2019re only matched with your own gender unless you pay.\n\nPrice: Free, but you can buy credits (\u2018stars\u2019) from \u00a31.89 that let you start more tribes of your own. A premium service from \u00a36.99 a week also lets you start groups with the other gender.\n\nFOR THE OVER 50S\n\nSTITCH\n\nStitch is for people over the age of 50\n\nWhat it does: A bit of everything. Look for friendships, romance or travel partners, browse local events or join open discussions.\n\nAny good? It\u2019s easy-peasy to navigate and message its wide database of worldwide users. You can take part in lengthy and energetic discussions on topics such as politics, online dating, sex, science, being a widow, genealogy and vaccines.\n\nSticking point: Basic membership is free, but so limited (you can browse just one profile a day and cannot direct message or take part in discussions) that it\u2019s hardly worth it. To get the most from the app, you\u2019ll have to pay.\n\nPrice: Free for basic membership and \u00a354.99 a year for full access.\n\nFOR FEMALE TRAVELLERS\n\nTOURLINA\n\nTourlina is for linking up female travellers\n\nWhat it does: Enables women to find female travel companions with mutual interests, or meet up with like-minded app users at home or abroad.\n\nAny good? It prides itself on being safe and reliable, and is one of the few apps that require user verification. It\u2019s pitched at both backpackers and luxury travellers and spans 160 countries.\n\nUsers include women whose friends have become mothers and effectively burned their passports, divorcees and those working abroad. You can specify the age of your preferred co-traveller.\n\nSticking point: Flexibility is needed with dates, and your planned destinations should be mainstream (Europe or America) to ensure a decent match.\n\nPrice: Free to download and message one person, and \u00a315.99 for a year of unlimited chats.\n\nFOR DOG LOVERS\n\nTHEDOGAPP\n\nTheDogApp is for fellow dog lovers\n\nWhat it does: Sign up with pictures, your details (name, location, interests) and those of your four-legged friend (name, gender, breed, birthdate and size) to join a community of dog aficionados for breeding tips, canine- friendly businesses, hotels and restaurants, get-togethers and dog banter.\n\nAny good? It has had positive reviews. Come for the cute pictures of sleeping dogs and stay to join groups on breeds, dog news and fashion trends.\n\nSticking point: As yet there\u2019s no way to private-message users.\n\nPrice: Free.\n\nFOR NEIGHBOURLY FOLK\n\nNEXTDOOR\n\nNextdoor is for neighbourly folk\n\nWhat it does: It\u2019s an ultra-local version of Facebook, for those who want to get to know their neighbours without door-knocking them, stew in hand.\n\nAny good? Surprisingly so. Find people on your street (five on mine in North-West London had signed up), buy and sell things, hire nearby professionals or babysitters, and get neighbourhood recommendations as well as crime and safety alerts.\n\nSticking point: You are encouraged to make your street address (not necessarily the door number) and name public for accountability, so it\u2019s not for those who like to hide behind anonymity.\n\nPrice: Free.", "description": "Really, it was only a matter of time.
