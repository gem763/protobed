Meanwhile, the state\u2019s largest utility cut electricity to millions of residents as a precaution to prevent more areas from igniting.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that officials were deploying \u201cevery resource available\u201d to respond to the wildfires, including a large blaze in Northern California\u2019s wine country powered by gusts that topped more than 80 mph.\n\nElsewhere, two grass fires burning in the San Francisco Bay Area briefly halted traffic on a bridge. The flames came dangerously close to homes in Vallejo. Another grass fire closed a stretch of interstate that cut through the state capital as smoke obstructed drivers along the busy stretch.\n\nIn the south, a wildfire in the Santa Clarita area near Los Angeles destroyed 18 structures.\n\nThe biggest evacuation was in Northern California\u2019s Sonoma County where 180,000 people were told to pack up and leave.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacific Gas & Electric PCG, -30.56% shut off power to 2.3 million people across 36 counties starting Saturday evening. Electricity is expected to be restored by Monday.The fear that the winds could blow embers and spread fire across a major highway prompted authorities to expand evacuation orders that covered parts of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 that was devastated by a wildfire two years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation that any of us ... can remember,\u201d the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office tweeted Sunday morning. \u201cTake care of each other.\u201d\n\nSoda Rock Winery in the #AlexanderValley is a victim of the #KincadeFire Sunday morning as critically strong winds pushed the fire over Highway 128. @NorthBayNews @NWSBayArea pic.twitter.com/yVqwKYt6eO \u2014 Kent Porter (@kentphotos) October 27, 2019\n\nHundreds of people arrived at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa by Sunday. Some came from senior care facilities. More than 300 people slept inside an auditorium filled with cots and wheeled beds. Scores of others stayed in a separate building with their pets.\n\nAmong them was Maribel Cruz, 19, who packed up her dog, four cats and fish as soon as she was told to flee from her trailer in the town of Windsor, which is about 60 miles north of San Francisco. She also grabbed a neighbor\u2019s cat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just nervous since I grew up in Windsor,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the wind cooperates.\u201d\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick urged residents in the evacuation zone that stretched from the wine country to Bodega Bay on the coast to get out immediately, citing the 24 lives lost when fire swept through the region in October 2017.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve heard people express concerns that we are evacuating too many people, I think those concerns are not valid at this point,\u201d Essick said at a news conference Sunday, noting that the winds pushed fire toward the towns of Healdsburg and Windsor overnight.\n\nDani Foster, of Santa Rosa, went to the fairgrounds after moving only about a mile every hour in a traffic jam on the freeway headed out of town.\n\n\u201cTo think of (the fire) coming over Healdsburg and Windsor and into Santa Rosa, that\u2019s a little overwhelming and scary,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be that big.\u201d\n\nThe Healdsburg area lost one of its historic attractions to the flames Sunday when embers carried by the winds sparked a blaze that engulfed the Soda Rock Winery whose buildings included a general store and post office founded in 1869. The winery was about 10 miles outside the town of Healdsburg.\n\nThe Kincade Fire began Wednesday night and was only 10% contained Sunday morning, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It has burned 47 square miles and has destroyed 79 structures.\n\nStrong winds hit Sunday as gusts reached 93 mph in the hills north of Healdsburg and topped more than 80 mph in many other areas, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nNine people, including a toddler, were injured after heavy winds toppled a 30-foot tree at a farmers\u2019 market in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Martinez. Six were taken to a hospital but the injuries were not life-threatening, police said.\n\nThe windy conditions, which were expected to continue until Monday, could potentially blow embers and spark fires up to a mile away. Fire officials said they feared that if the Kincade Fire crosses U.S. 101, it could ignite an area that hasn\u2019t burned in 80 years.\n\n\u201cThe fuel in that area is extremely dense, they\u2019re extremely old and dry,\u201d said Steve Volmer, a fire behavior analyst with CalFire.\n\nThe parched vegetation from the unseasonably hot weather and low humidity was already igniting various spots elsewhere.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, two grass fires shut down a 6-mile stretch of Interstate 80, including a bridge between the cities of Crockett and Vallejo. An ember from one fire possibly sparked the other, but fire officials said they won\u2019t know until an investigation is complete.\n\nAbout 200 people were evacuated from California State University Maritime Academy in Vallejo, which is 55 miles south of Geyserville where the massive Kincade Fire is burning.\n\nSmoke from another grass fire Sunday forced the closure of a stretch of Interstate 80 running through Sacramento\u2019s downtown.\n\nTo the south, a wildfire dubbed the Tick Fire destroyed 18 structures Thursday in the Santa Clarita area north of Los Angeles. Nearly all the 50,000 residents ordered to evacuate were allowed back home after Santa Ana winds began to ease.\n\nAs of Sunday, the Tick Fire was 65% contained.\n\nWhat sparked the current fires is unknown, but PG&E said a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville malfunctioned minutes before that blaze erupted Wednesday night.\n\nThe utility acknowledged a tower malfunction prompted a strategy change for determining when to kill high-voltage transmission lines, Andrew Vesey, CEO of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said Friday.\n\nThe possible link between the wine country fire and a PG&E transmission line contained grim parallels to last year when most of the town of Paradise burned, killing 85 people in the deadliest U.S. blaze in a century.\n\nState officials concluded a PG&E transmission line sparked that fire.\n\nPG&E said this weekend\u2019s shut-off was affecting about 940,000 homes and businesses. The city of San Francisco was not in line for a blackout amid shut-offs for most of the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country and the Sierra foothills.\n\nMany residents facing blackouts had barely recovered from a previous shut-off that cost some businesses tens of thousands of dollars in losses.\n\nNapa County officials also opened several evacuation centers, including one at Napa Valley College, where overnight winds had gusted so strong they toppled four blue portable toilets. Ellie Brown and Cody Rodriguez, both age 20 of Santa Rosa, were trying to find space in their second evacuation center, after finding one in Petaluma too crowded.\n\n\u201cIt has brought a lot of anxiety,\u201d said Rodriguez, who lived for a week at a Santa Rosa shelter during the 2017 fires. \u201cI was like \u2018I don\u2019t want to go through this again.\u2019\u201d", "description": "California\u2019s governor declared a statewide emergency with nearly 200,000 people ordered to flee their homes because of wildfires fueled by historic winds,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU072_kincad_ZG_20191027154115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
