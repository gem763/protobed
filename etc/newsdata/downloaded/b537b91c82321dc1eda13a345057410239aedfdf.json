That is the lowest rate since the 1970s, according to an analysis of data done by the city's experts.\n\nThe number of children living in poverty declined 6 percentage points over the same period, to 23.8% last year.\n\n\"We are putting more money in the hands of working families and creating a fairer city for all,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has made income equality a cornerstone of his administration since starting in 2014. He pointed to programs like universal pre-K and a push for a $15 minimum wage as a factor in the city's strong economy.\n\nThe decade-level data analyzed by the city used census data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which found the poverty level at 14.5% in 1969, and 20.2% in 1979, according to a spokeswoman. It was 18.8% in 1989 and 21.9% in 1999.\n\nNew York City's economic growth follows similar trends around the country, even as the city's population has declined. Between 2013 and 2018, the median household income in the U.S. rose 10% to $61,937. In New York City, it increased 13% to $63,799, according to census data.\n\nMatthew Klein, executive director of the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity, said that while economic growth mirrored gains across the country, it was the city's own programs that helped reduce poverty.\n\n\"New York City operates in the national context, but I think what's important is the focus on people at the lower end of the income ladder,\" he said.\n\nA report released by Comptroller Scott Stringer in May showed the city's economy remained strong in the first quarter of 2019, buoyed by low unemployment. Unemployment in New York City stood at 4.1% in 2018, down from 4.6% a year earlier, according to census data.\n\nThe city still has a wide gap between the richest and poorest residents, according to a report released this month by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nThe report -- which used the \"Gini coefficient,\" a measurement of income distribution -- found the income disparity between the two groups had made only modest gains since Mr. de Blasio took office.\n\nMr. Klein said the Gini coefficient doesn't fully capture the gains made by the lowest earners, as well as the middle class, and captures progress at a slower rate.\n\n\"You can have a strong economy but not see much progress for those at the bottom of the income spectrum,\" he said. \"And we're seeing there is progress there and that's what we're most excited about.\"\n\nWrite to Katie Honan at Katie.Honan@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 30, 2019 18:22 ET (22:22 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
