Mast, a retired Army Ranger, to be evicted from office at VA after grilling officials", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., a retired Army Ranger, spoke out on Thursday after he was evicted from his congressional office space in the West Palm Beach Veteran Affairs Medical Center.\n\nThe move came after Mast, who lost his legs in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2010, grilled a Department of Veteran Affairs official at a hearing earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThey [the Department of Veterans Affairs] told us that we got to be out in December. We\u2019re hoping that we can change that,\u201d Mast told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nMast said he hopes VA Secretary Robert Wilkie will \u201cgo out and make a change\u201d to the eviction decision.\n\nVA SECRETARY WILKIE ASSURES VETERANS 'THEY ARE SAFE' FOLLOWING STRING OF SUSPICIOUS DEATHS AT GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL\n\nMast had opened the first-ever congressional office inside a VA facility back in January, looking to make \u201ca better path forward to advocate for all our veterans.\u201d\n\nIn April, after three veterans took their lives within five days of each other at VA facilities in two states, Mast directed tough questions to Veterans Affairs officials during a hearing.\n\n\u201cWe need to flip that place upside down in order to change the whole climate of what\u2019s going on there and if the people in charge aren\u2019t willing to do that, then they\u2019re not doing the right thing,\u201d Mast said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cThere are 435 representatives sitting in the Capitol. Everyone, of which is saying, on a weekly basis, they want to effect 22 suicides a day, they want to make the VA a better place for people to get their healthcare needs, they want to make it a better place.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone of them should be begging to be in those doors and the VA should be begging them to be in there so that we make sure every veteran that walks in there is treated with compassion. They\u2019re treated by competent people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Department of Veteran Affairs press secretary issued a statement to \u201cFox & Friends,\" contending that the office space is needed for medical care.\n\n\u201cThe VA\u2019s primary mission is delivering medical care to veterans and the physical spaces within our facilities are used for that mission. The department will use the space previously dedicated to 6 members of congress for the provision of medical care services. Moreover, no law authorizes the Department to dedicate its space for Members of Congress to provide constituent services. Past bills authorizing the Department to do so have not been enacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur job is oversight and if they don\u2019t let us in there to do that, then there is a real problem.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
