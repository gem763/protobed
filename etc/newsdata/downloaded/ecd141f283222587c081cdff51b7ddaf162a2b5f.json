We know that there are statewide races happening this year in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, so we\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nThat was news to Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat seeking reelection, whose campaign says it has neither spoken with nor coordinated with Ms. Abrams or Fair Fight.\n\nHer group has, though, reached out to the Louisiana Democratic Party with an offer of \u201cassistance with regards to voter protection efforts of the Louisiana Democratic Party,\u201d said Stephen Handwerk, the state party\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cThe Louisiana Democratic Party has long run programs that assist eligible voters to exercise their franchise free from impediments. We are grateful for the assistance from Fair Fight and their industry leading experts,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nBobby Moak, chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, said he just learned of Fair Fight\u2019s existence at a recent conference in Los Angeles and he is slated to meet with them this week to discuss possible action in the Magnolia State.\n\n\u201cI look forward to their being here,\u201d Mr. Moak said. \u201cWe need all the help we can get.\u201d\n\nFair Fight has partnered with the Democratic Party in Georgia to form a PAC called the Legislative Victory Fund, but no such partnership exists in Louisiana or Mississippi, according to party officials.\n\nFair Fight did not reply to multiple requests for comments about its activities and plans.\n\nMs. Abrams became a hero to liberals during her failed gubernatorial bid last year. She accused Republican Brian Kemp, then the secretary of state, of making it harder for Democrats to vote.\n\nThat is a message Democrats have aimed at GOP-led states across the country, complaining that voter-ID laws, attempts to clean voter rolls and President Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric and policies are all really efforts to prevent people from casting votes.\n\nMs. Abrams flexed her popularity for the Democratic National Committee last week, firing off a fundraising plea warning that GOP plots are rigging elections nationwide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed the consequences of the GOP\u2019s voter suppression tactics,\u201d Ms. Abrams wrote, continuing a point she has maintained since losing by more than 50,000 votes in a Georgia gubernatorial election that saw both overall turnout and black turnout set records.\n\n\u201cAs Democrats we have an opportunity to fix what is so deeply broken in too many of our elections nationwide,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the GOP is ready to double down on its voter suppression playbook this year and in 2020.\u201d\n\nOn its website Fair Fight, a 504(c) 4 nonprofit group, describes its work as bringing \u201cawareness to the public on education reform, advocates for election reform at all levels, and engages in targeted voter registration and other voter outreach programs and communications.\u201d\n\nRep. Ralph Abraham, a Republican angling to unseat Mr. Edwards in Louisiana\u2019s election this year, says she\u2019s unlikely to accomplish anything positive in the Pelican State.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disturbing that a person who has encouraged voting by illegal immigrants is now targeting Louisiana\u2019s election,\u201d said David Weinman, the Abraham campaign spokesman. \u201cThis is just more proof that the radical left will stop at nothing to protect their main ally in the Deep South: John Bel Edwards.\u201d\n\nThe campaign of Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone, another Republican running against Mr. Edwards, said Ms. Abrams\u2018 tactics are unlikely to play any better among Louisiana\u2019s electorate than they did with Georgia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cVoters soundly rejected Abrams\u2018 campaign and liberal platform in Georgia,\u201d said Anthony Ramirez, a spokesman with the Rispone campaign. \u201cThe National Democratic Party is clearly afraid of Eddie and will do whatever they can to save John Bel.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
