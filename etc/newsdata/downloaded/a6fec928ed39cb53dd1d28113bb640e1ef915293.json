I\u2019ve said as recently as a few weeks ago that as legislation progresses, we will make request for a section 30 order. We see rising support for independence,\u201d she told Marr.\n\nWhen asked about a possible timetable, Sturgeon said: \u201cIt\u2019s likely to be over the next matter of weeks. It is coming soon.\u201d\n\nAs well as not backing Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, the SNP\u2019s Westminster MPs would not enter into a formal coalition with any party after a potential general election, she added.\n\nOn backing Labour if Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party was elected without an overall majority, Sturgeon said she would only work with someone who agreed there should be another independence referendum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t favour coalitions. We would favour a progressive type alliance. But I would say this to Jeremy Corbyn, or any Westminster leader who is looking to the SNP for support, if you don\u2019t accept Scotland\u2019s right to choose at our choosing \u2013 don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone to me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday Show about a possible partnership with the SNP after a general election, Corbyn said: \u201cWe are not going into coalition with anybody.\u201d\n\nHe added that an independent Scotland was not a good idea economically, and if he was prime minister he would not consider offering a second referendum in the first few years he was in office, as it was \u201cnot a priority\u201d for Labour.\n\nTo hold another referendum, the Scottish parliament must also first vote on whether it wants to pursue the section 30 order.\n\nAfter the 2014 independence referendum, in which 55% of voters chose to remain in the UK, a section 30 request submitted in 2017 was turned down by Theresa May, the then prime minister. May said at that stage it was not the right time for another ballot because it was too early to judge the outcome of Brexit.\n\nSturgeon has so far been categoric in not backing Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal, and none of her party\u2019s 35 MPs support it either.\n\nShe said: \u201cProposals that are on the table from Boris Johnson and any likely amendment of them would not be acceptable to the SNP. It would take Scotland out of the EU, out of the single market, out of the customs union with all the damage that would do and against our will.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish first minister\u2019s preferred strategy for Westminster in the next few weeks and months would be to back a vote of no confidence in Johnson, securing an extension to article 50 and then holding a general election.\n\nDespite Scottish independence not having a specific debate slot on the conference floor at the three-day event, speculation is mounting that the SNP MP Angus MacNeil and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny, may try and publicly call for more attention to a \u201cplan B\u201d proposal.\n\nThis strategy demands Scotland begins independence negotiations with the UK if the SNP wins a majority of seats at a general election. A victory would be a mandate to negotiate, campaigners say.\n\nSturgeon expressed her continued reluctance towards the idea on The Andrew Marr Show, despite saying she recognised it would make her life easier in the short term to just tell SNP supporters what they wanted to hear.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe process we undertake to chose our own future has to be capable of delivering independence. I\u2019ve campaign for independence all my life. If I thought there was a quicker way, an easier way, a plan B, I would have taken it by now.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is have a process that firstly allows us to demonstrate there is majority support in Scotland for independence and secondly we have to have a process that is legal and accepted, otherwise our independence will not be recognised.\u201d\n\nShe said Catalonia had demonstrated that it was possible to hold a referendum but not necessarily become independent.\n\n\u201cI have to deal with reality,\u201d she said.", "description": "SNP leader says there is rising support for independence at start of party conference", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d36025c2677ad0e7cb64b6be2413da834901e4d/1761_68_4549_2729/master/4549.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c967b3cf547bdacabbc0e31e0f9282c0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
