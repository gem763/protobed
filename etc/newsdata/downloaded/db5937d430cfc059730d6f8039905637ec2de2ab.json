It was used successfully last year to discover the full legal advice on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, and later to have the Treasury's economic forecasts published openly.\n\nThis time, thanks to Dominic Grieve, it\u2019s a double whammy.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Second, the true horror of the no deal planing assessments \u2013 Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 must be published in full. Then we can judge if Michael Gove was right to call it a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario or whether it is, in fact, a realistic \u201cbase case\u201d. As we hacks say, they will have to cough.\n\nThus, we may also soon find out the truth about the advice that the prime minister and his ministers gave to the Queen about this very prorogation of Parliament. In short, the documents would show if Boris Johnson was lying to his sovereign as well as the Commons and the British people about why we have had this unusually long suspension of Parliament \u2013 something the Speaker, John Bercow, spoke out about in unprecedented terms as unacceptable rule by executive fiat.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Or was it a ruse to prevent Parliament from doing its job \u2013 that is, prorogation for another nefarious Brexit-driven purpose?\n\nDid the prime minister fib? Did he abuse the independence of the civil service? Did he mislead us? What does achieving Brexit \u201cby all means necessary\u201d as the spin goes actually mean? What has Dominic Cummings been up to?\n\nIn the various legal actions taken by Gina Miller and others to gain a judicial review of the suspension the most disturbing aspect was the refusal by civil servants to swear signed affidavits about their advice and behaviour for the legal hearings on Edinburgh, Belfast and London. That resistance was unusual, and highly suggestive of something deeply rotten going on.\n\nMPs and the public have a right to know the truth. The Supreme Court surely does too.\n\nIn response ministers are muttering about private company emails out if their range, GDPR, human rights, privacy and the public interest, but the Humble Address is a clear instruction, and they are not allowed excuses and evasions.\n\nMinisters work for us; we need to know about prorogation and Yellowhammer, and the truth will out.\n\nParliament is awakening. It is a little like the Watergate affair in the US; when Congress, long ignored by an \u201cimperial\u201d presidency, at long last stirred itself to demand disclosure of tapes and documents and take evidence and dig and dig again into the scandal, it found itself with the public behind it and with the constitution on its side.\n\nNow it is our MPs who are finding their voice and holding our rulers to account.
