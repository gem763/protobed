So, is another boom just about to begin?\n\nThe last property price boom began in 2011\n\nThe last property price boom began in 2011, although the length of the boom changed from city to city:\n\nIn Darwin and Perth, it was an uptick that fizzled out quickly, lasting less than three years.\n\nFor Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, the boom was significant.\n\nSydney was the main beneficiary with prices increasing by 70% between November 2011 and September 2017.\n\nIn most major cities, it ended pretty much as soon as the banks began enacting tighter lending standards just before the Financial Services Royal Commission began in late 2017.\n\nNervousness about access to finance was the main factor driving a complete shift in sentiment towards housing.\n\nThe correction phase\n\nIn the aftermath of the housing boom, we\u2019ve experienced a correction.\n\nPrices may have increased in Sydney by 70% since 2011, but they have now dropped back by 12% since the boom ended.\n\nIn Melbourne, prices didn\u2019t see the highs of Sydney, but the decline so far has also been less.\n\nPrices in Adelaide and Brisbane didn\u2019t rise by much, but also didn\u2019t really decline much either.\n\nHobart prices increased significantly during the boom, but most likely due to the structure of the economy changing , so it seems unlikely prices will see a large decline any time soon.\n\nSigns of a recovery\n\nThe current correction does look like it is coming to an end, primarily because there has been a lot of stimulus into the market.\n\nThe first positive sign was when search activity on realestate.com.au started increasing just after the federal election in May, with policy ensuring greater certainty for property investors.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve experienced three interest rate cuts in fast succession and three restrictions removed by APRA on home loan lending and income tax cuts, which has resulted in increased buyer activity.\n\nWhilst whispers of the downturn coming to an end has encouraged buyers back into the market, there is a supply problem as listing volumes are particularly low \u2013 the buyers are back but sellers aren\u2019t.\n\nThe supply demand imbalance is reflective of an early cycle that will lead to strong price rises in premium suburbs, although it\u2019s not currently showing up across all capital cities.\n\nSupply an issue, but prices will remain low\n\nAlthough a housing market recovery is underway, conditions are very different this time around and at this stage, it is unlikely we will see a surge in pricing equivalent to the most recent boom.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the economy is weak. Interest rates are very low because unemployment is rising.\n\nOn one hand, low interest rates are good for house prices as people can borrow more money, but if households are worried about job loss, this will restrict the amount they will choose to borrow.\n\nIf unemployment rises too much, this could quickly lead to very negative conditions where people are forced to sell. This scenario seems very unlikely, but it is a consideration.\n\nIn addition to the weak Australian economy, there are a lot of other structural differences to the previous housing recovery and boom.\n\nInvestor activity has dropped significantly and is unlikely to get to the same levels we saw at the peak of investor lending in 2015.\n\nOffshore buyers have also pulled back significantly with Chinese buyers in particular showing very little signs of re-emerging.\n\nHome loans are cheaper now, but they are still difficult to secure \u2013 banks are slowly easing up on restrictions but the focus on responsible lending is unlikely to change any time soon.\n\nThe number of houses available for sale is still low, but should start to increase again as the market gains a bit more momentum.\n\nConfidence in the quality of new apartments is still an issue and will take some time to be resolved.\n\nSo what can we expect?\n\nPremium Sydney suburb prices are increasing rapidly with many achieving double digit growth over the past 12 months.\n\nInterestingly, Gold Coast premium property has also staged a recovery, likely driven in part by Sydney money.\n\nMelbourne seems likely to follow \u2013 premium prices are yet to move but search activity is very high relative to listings.\n\nElsewhere in Australia, it seems more about stabilisation rather than a return to boom conditions. Don\u2019t expect a surge in pricing, instead this recovery will be slow and steady.", "description": "The most recent housing boom was pretty much over by the end of November 2018, but with three interest rates cut this year some are predicting prices will rise again.", "authors": ["Nerida Conisbee"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30094337/Gold-Coast-apartment-2000x1500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
