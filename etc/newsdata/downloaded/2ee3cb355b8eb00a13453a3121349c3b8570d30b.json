His father Stanley came out in support of Extinction Rebellion, his partner Carrie is a vocal advocate of action on the climate emergency. They are many of the diverse voices that are speaking for the urgent threat that we face.\n\n\u201cExtinction Rebellion of course has hippy activists but we\u2019re also a movement of mums, doctors, lawyers, builders, priests and rabbis that are uncooperative and will continue to make great sacrifices until our three demands are met.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And so I immediately asked the faint hearts in my private office, \u2018What would Margaret Thatcher do?\u2019\n\n\u201cIf she could take the extraordinary risk of sending a task force halfway around the world through tumultuous seas to recapture the Falklands, I think she would have crossed the road to speak at the Banqueting Hall.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI hope that when we go out from this place tonight and we are waylaid by importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters, we remind them that she was also right about greenhouse gases.\n\n\u201cThe best thing possible for the education of the denizens of the heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs that now litter Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park would be for them to stop blocking the traffic and buy a copy of Charles\u2019s magnificent book so that they can learn about a true feminist, green and revolutionary who changed the world for the better.\u201d\n\nProtesters brought chaos for commuters on Monday, closing down several streets around Westminster, as part of coordinated actions taking place around the world.\n\nThe Met Police said it had arrested 280 demonstrators by 9.30pm on Monday night, more than double the 122 arrests made on the first day of similar protests last April.\n\nDemonstrators shut down roads around parliament and Whitehall in London and succeeded in bringing traffic to a standstill with roadblocks on Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, Victoria Street, Whitehall, Horse Guards Road and the Mall.\n\nThey are the latest in a string of demonstrations against climate change. Last month, millions of young people flooded onto the streets of cities around the world, inspired to take action by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nExtinction Rebellion says it expects peaceful protests over the next two weeks in more than 60 cities from New Delhi to New York. Demonstrators will call on governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and halt a loss of biodiversity.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion\u00a0have\u00a0hit back after after Boris Johnson described them as \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d, saying the PM\u2019s own family are environmentalists \u2013 with his father, Stanley,\u00a0openly supporting their protests.\u00a0 \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s depiction of us as uncooperative crusties made us smile, it\u2019s not the Boris Johnson we know,\u201d\u00a0 Ronan Harrington, a political strategist at", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/10/pri88037098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
