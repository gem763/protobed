The letters said the immigrants must leave the country within 33 days or face deportation.\n\nOn Monday, the agency said in a statement that while limiting the program was \u201cappropriate,\u201d officials would \u201ccomplete the caseload that was pending on Aug. 7.\u201d\n\nThe statement said deportation proceedings had not been initiated against anyone who had received the letter. However, it did not say whether it would continue to grant immigrants extensions to stay in the country or whether the program would be continued after current applications are processed.\n\nWhen asked for clarification, an agency official said the agency \u201cis taking immediate corrective action to reopen previously pending cases for consideration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether a very limited version of deferred action will continue forward at USCIS is still under review. More information will be forthcoming,\u201d said the official, who only agreed to speak on background.\n\nAmong those who had been affected by the administration\u2019s decision to end the program was Maria Isabel Bueso, 24, who has participated in several medical studies, including a drug trial that resulted in a treatment for her rare disease, which causes dwarfism and other physical deformities.\n\nOn hearing she had a chance to stay in California, rather than return to Guatemala, where the drug is not available and she cannot receive the required medical care, Ms Bueso said, \u201cThis is amazing. This is great news to wake up to.\u201d\n\nNew York Times\n\nRead more\n\nJournalist stopped by US border agent 'for being part of 'fake news'\n\nUS border patrol officer pleads guilty to hitting migrant with truck\n\nMan dies in front of 11-year-old daughter at detention camp\n\n\u2018Traumatised\u2019 child migrants stopped from washing in US border centres", "description": "The Trump administration announced on Monday it would reconsider its controversial decision to force immigrants facing life-threatening health crises to return to their home countries, an abrupt move last month that generated public outrage and was roundly condemned by the medical establishment.On 7", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OlRb4WO_yvR_okg0WMfu_Q--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/baa47a34b1cf0c8d568bf492a261c9fa"}
