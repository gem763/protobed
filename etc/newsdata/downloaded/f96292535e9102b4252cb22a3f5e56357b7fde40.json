Korea, leaving 5 dead The year's 18th typhoon is fast-moving and powerful. Mitag swept across the southern part of Korea yesterday and is now moving out towards the East Sea, forecast to leave the country by the afternoon. We start things off by turning to our Lee Kyung-eun standing by one the line to provide some updates. Kyung-eun, what's the latest? Hi, Daniel. The typhoon is continuing to move out towards the East Sea,\u2026 and as of 10:30 a.m. it is over waters some 70 kilometers Northwest of Ulleungdo Island. With the exception of this area and the easternmost island of Dokdo, the country will gradually be freed from the influence of the typhoon, with the remaining typhoon warnings expected to be lifted. But the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarter has maintained its disaster alert status at its second highest level, as strong winds will persist for the time being. During its pass over the country, it has quickly drenched the affected areas with heavy downpours. The eastern coastal areas were the hardest-hit, with some regions receiving up to five-hundred millimeters of precipitation. Gangwon-do Province received as much as one-hundred-50 millimeters, while the rest of the country saw between five to 30 millimeters of rain. Torrential rain and strong winds are causing serious problems in the affected areas. Could you give us an update on the damages? So far, the typhoon has left five people dead and one missing,\u2026 while injuring four others. Serious floodings have affected houses, roads, and waterways, and caused landslides as well as a power outage. To prevent any further damages, the government has closed down 21 national parks and hundreds of hiking trails. Also, it suspended more than one-hundred maritime routes in Busan and Jeju Island. In the meantime, local governments are providing shelters for thousands of citizens. But, all flights have been resumed, as of 6 a.m. today. That's all I have for now. Back to you, Daniel.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
