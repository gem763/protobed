While business and residential investment, net exports and inventories all declined, real personal consumption expenditures rose at a 4.7% annual rate, the largest increase in 4 1/2 years, contributing 3.1 percentage points to the 2% real gross domestic product growth.\n\nConsumer sentiment surveys suggest that all is not well. What if the consumer starts to rein in his spending, which accounts for almost 70% of GDP?\n\nMark Hulbert explains: Here\u2019s why sour consumer sentiment could sweeten stocks\n\nGlobal commerce is slowing in response to the trade war with China and an overall increase in tariffs. Residential investment has declined in eight of the last nine quarters and in 10 of the last 13, even with rock-bottom mortgage rates.\n\nBusinesses are deferring capital investment until there is more certainty on the trade front. Manufacturing is already in recession, with factory output declining in the last two quarters.\n\nAlternative sources of growth\n\nWithout consumer spending to steady the ship of state, it\u2019s hard to see alternate sources of economic growth.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index posted its largest decline in almost seven years in August, diving 8.6 points to 89.8, the lowest level since October 2016. Both sub-indexes \u2014 one an assessment of current conditions, the other of expectations \u2014 declined last month.\n\n\u201cThe recent decline is due to negative references to tariffs, which were spontaneously mentioned by one-in-three consumers,\u201d according to Richard Curtin, director and chief economist at the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers.\n\nNow read this: Bad news for parents: Trump\u2019s trade war with China will hit back-to-school supplies\n\nAnd that was before the latest tariffs, mostly on consumer goods, went into effect on Sept. 1. The 15% tariff on roughly $112 billion of Chinese goods targets everything from apparel to footwear to toys to electronic products. President Donald Trump announced plans to increase existing tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods from 25% to 30% on Oct. 1. And there\u2019s more to come on Dec. 15, at which point almost all Chinese imports will be subject to tariffs.\n\nPeter Morici explains: How to win the trade war with China\n\nTwo surveys, two narratives\n\nThe other closely watched survey of consumer confidence, conducted each month by the Conference Board, tells a different story.\n\nThat index rebounded 10.4 points in August to 135.7, the highest reading of the year. The present situation index, which reflects respondents\u2019 appraisal of current business and labor market conditions, jumped to its highest level in almost 19 years. The expectations index posted a modest decline.\n\nWhich survey is telling the true story?\n\nThe widening spread between what consumers think about today and what they think about tomorrow is a warning sign.\n\nAs it turns out, the message \u2014 in this case, a warning sign \u2014 is contained in the divergence between the two surveys, according to economists at Deutsche Bank Securities.\n\n\u201cThe present wide gap between the current conditions component of these surveys\u201d \u2014 with the Conference Board measure running well ahead of its University of Michigan counterpart \u2014 \u201chas reliably preceded recession in the past,\u201d the economists write in a recent research report.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the widening gap between the Conference Board\u2019s expectations and present situation indexes is flashing a similar warning. The extreme negative reading right now, which suggests that \u201cconsumers are more optimistic about today than about the future,\u201d has presaged a recession in the past, according to Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok.\n\nFeeling good\n\nTo be sure, consumers have every reason to feel good about their present situation. The unemployment rate is hovering near a half-century low. Wages are rising. The biggest problem isn\u2019t finding a job but finding qualified workers to hire, according to businesses.\n\nAre consumers that good at sniffing out turns in the business cycle that we should pay attention to these cautionary signs from confidence indexes?\n\nIt sure seems that way. Consumer confidence \u2014 specifically the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index \u2014 was added to the index of leading economic indicators in 1989.\n\nWhen the LEI was revamped in 2012, the consumer sentiment component was replaced by \u201cconsumer expectations about business conditions,\u201d a hybrid measure that was shown to perform better at turning points, according to Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at the Conference Board. (The hybrid measure is an average of responses from the Michigan and Conference Board surveys.)\n\nTo the extent that expectations about tomorrow drive spending today, it\u2019s not hard to understand why expectations, be they about one\u2019s own financial condition or that of business, provide an early warning sign of turns in the economy.\n\nIf tariffs and trade are behind the slide in the University of Michigan survey, as Curtin suggests, then sentiment is apt to deteriorate further.\n\nContrary to frequent flights of \u201ctrade optimism\u201d underpinning the stock market, the trade war isn\u2019t about to resolve itself anytime soon. On Sept. 1, China retaliated with tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports.\n\nISM warning\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 49.1% in August, the first sub-50 reading \u2014 implying a contraction in manufacturing activity \u2014 in three years. All of the sub-indexes except supplier deliveries were below the 50 threshold.\n\nThe new export orders Index fell 4.8 points to 43.3, the lowest in over 10 years. And only a handful of industries reported growth last month in each of the various categories. For example, three of the 18 manufacturing industries reported an increase in new orders. (The ISM new orders index is also a component of the LEI.)\n\nThe proliferation of downbeat economic news, both domestically and globally, is imposing a big burden on the consumer to keep the expansion going.\n\nTo the extent that a widening, negative gap between the Conference Board\u2019s consumer expectations and present situation indexes has preceded previous downturns and confirms the message emanating from another prominent leading indicator of recession, an inverted yield curve, policy makers need to be on high-alert for any signs that the consumer is throwing in the towel.", "description": "Consumer spending is keeping the economy moving, but what happens if consumers pull back?.", "authors": ["Caroline Baum"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN353_retail_ZG_20190715125328.jpg"}
