According to the group, Schiff should be investigated for multiple violations for his code of conduct.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint calls into question Schiff's repeated abuse of power and \"his overt efforts to seek incriminating information from Ukrainian sources about the President of the United States.\"\n\n\u201cMr. Schiff should be publicly censured for his illegal actions, and should lose his chairmanship due to his self-serving abuse of his position on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,\" Tea Party Patriots Action Honorary Chairman Jenny Beth Martin said in a statement. \"He has used his position to investigate the leadership of a rival political party while claiming it is his oversight duty \u2013 this is a fundamental lie.\"\n\n\"His oversight responsibility includes ensuring that US intelligence agencies do not operate domestically to influence US elections \u2013 not drumming up fabricated whistleblower accounts to influence the 2020 election,\" Martin said. \"His actions have undermined the public trust in our valued intelligence services, and caused lasting damage to the reputation of the intelligence services. He can no longer be chairman.\u201d\n\nThree examples are cited:\n\n1) Schiff's repeated lied about the role his staff on the House Intelligence Committee played in the whistleblower complaint filed against President Trump. Schiff repeatedly denied that he or his staff met with the whistleblower, which turned out to be false.\n\n2) Schiff blatantly made up his own version of call that took place between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite the unclassified, unredacted transcript being made public.\n\n3) Schiff sought damaging information about the president from Ukrainian sources. He even used Intelligence Committee staffers to obtain the materials.\n\nRead the full complaint below:", "description": "Oh, snap!.10/08/2019 20:38:26PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
