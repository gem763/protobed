Both are right-handed, so it appears the Cardinals just think Mart\u00ednez will be better with more at-bats against Monday starter Stephen Strasburg than Molina. The Cardinals\u2019 longtime catcher is 3-for-11 with one strikeout against Strasburg while Mart\u00ednez is 0-for-1 with a walk. Mart\u00ednez is usually a pinch-hitter, but the Cardinals have four hits this series and Mart\u00ednez has half of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals have center fielder Victor Robles back in the lineup after he exited in Game 2 of the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He had a mild right hamstring strain but ran the bases \u201cfull tilt\u201d on Monday and \u201clooked really good,\u201d according to Manager Dave Martinez. His return restores flexibility to the Nationals as fill-in Michael A. Taylor shifts back to the bench in his pinch-run/defensive-replacement role.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Washington Nationals return home for the first-ever National League Championship Series game at Nationals Park on Monday.\n\nThe environment promises to be raucous after the Nationals\u2019 dominant starting pitching propelled them past the St. Louis Cardinals in their first two games. The 2-0 series lead means that the Nationals are two wins away from their first World Series berth, with the next three games (if necessary) scheduled for Nats Park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be loud,\u201d reliever Daniel Hudson said with a smile. The veteran right-hander rejoined the team in Game 2 after missing the first game to be with his wife, Sara, for the birth of third child, a girl named Millie. Hudson added, of the series, \u201cHopefully we can cap this thing off with a win this week.\u201d\n\nIf the Nationals win their next two games, or if they win two of their next three, they would not need to return to St. Louis. This would give them perhaps some added rest as the American League slugs it out (the New York Yankees and Houston Astros are currently tied, 1-1). But first, the Nationals must win Monday, and that starts with a star-studded matchup on the mound between two of the best pitchers in baseball, Stephen Strasburg and Jack Flaherty.\n\nFlaherty has been unstoppable in the second half, posting a 0.91 ERA since the all-star break, but Strasburg has been nearly unhittable in the playoffs (his 1.32 postseason ERA among the best ever). This unstoppable-object-meets-immovable-force battle could go a long way toward determining the tone of the series in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLineups\n\nNationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nKurt Suzuki C\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nStephen Strasburg P\n\nCardinals\n\nDexter Fowler CF\n\nKolten Wong 2B\n\nPaul Goldschmidt 1B\n\nMarcell Ozuna LF\n\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez RF\n\nYadier Molina C\n\nTommy Edman 3B\n\nPaul DeJong SS\n\nJack Flaherty P\n\nSeries overview\n\nGame 1 at St. Louis \u2014 Oct. 11: \u2014 Oct. 11: Nationals 2, Cardinals 0\n\nGame 2 at St. Louis \u2014 Oct. 12: \u2014 Oct. 12: Nationals 3, Cardinals 1\n\nGame 3 at Washington \u2014 Monday, 7:38 p.m.\n\nGame 4 at Washington \u2014 Tuesday, Oct. 15, 8:05 p.m.\n\nGame 5 at Washington \u2014 Wednesday, Oct. 16, 4:08 p.m. (if necessary)\n\nGame 6 at St. Louis \u2014 Friday, Oct. 18, 8:08 p.m. (if necessary)\n\nGame 7 at St. Louis \u2014 Saturday, Oct. 19, 8:08 p.m. (if necessary)\n\nPregame reading\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 rotation encountered a knife fight and brought a bazooka.

Outfielder goes against his instincts, channels his inner George Constanza to produce two-run double to give Nats some breathing room to take 2-0 lead in NLCS.
