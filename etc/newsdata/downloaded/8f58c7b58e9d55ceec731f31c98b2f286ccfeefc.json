According to the survey from Deezer: \"60% of people reported being in a musical rut, only listening to the same songs over and over, while just over a quarter (25%) said they wouldn't be likely to try new music from outside their preferred genres.\"\n\nThat's probably how a music video for a song that was initially released in 1987, just reached one billion views on YouTube. But can you guess which one it is? You're probably thinking, \"oh that's easy it is Michael Jackson or Madonna\" but you'd be so very wrong!\n\nIt is Guns N' Roses' power ballad Sweet Child O' Mine!\n\nThis makes the video - which depicts the band rehearsing in the Mendiola's Ballroom at Huntington Park \u2013 the first track from the 1980s to do so.\n\nThe song appeared on the band's debut album Appetite for Destruction and averaged 590 000 daily views this year according to the BBC.\n\nTheir 1992 hit November Rain remains the only video from that decade to make the \"billion views club\".\n\nTheir band now boasts more than 6.7 million YouTube subscribers, while Appetite for Destruction is still the best-selling US debut album ever, shifting more than 30 million copies worldwide.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO FOR SWEET CHILD O' MINE HERE:\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
