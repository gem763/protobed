The Houthi rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, but Pompeo pointed his finger at Iran for backing and ultimately orchestrating the strike.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif resoundingly denied the accusation, and Democrats rebuffed Pompeo's equating Iran with the Houthi rebels. Ben Rhodes, White House foreign policy adviser under President Barack Obama, tweeted in response to Pompeo's claim: \"The Houthis are not the same as Iran and the Saudis are fighting a war against them in Yemen. This is an incredibly dumb, dishonest and dangerous thing to say.\"\n\n\"So let\u2019s be honest \u2014 there is a war going on between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. The Saudis are bombing and shooting at the Houthis everyday, with our help. What we should probably be doing is working to end the war, not expecting that one side will unilaterally stop fighting,\" Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy tweeted Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration found a reliable ally in Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who suggested Saturday striking Iranian oil refineries in retaliation for the attack in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn response, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Sunday any violent retaliation on Iran would be a mistake, arguing it was a \"regional conflict.\"\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.
