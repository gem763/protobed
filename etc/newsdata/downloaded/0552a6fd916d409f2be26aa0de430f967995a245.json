No conviction and there was no sentencing hearing, nor would there ever be for Mr. Epstein.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 66-year-old financier, who was indicted in July for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, was found dead in his Manhattan Correction jail cell on the morning of Aug.10. On Thursday, Southern District of New York Judge Richard M. Berman disposed of Epstein\u2019s charges.\n\nSurvivors and their attorneys have since turned their efforts to filing civil cases against his estate.\n\nSo far, lawyers Brad Edwards and Stan Pottinger have submitted suits on behalf of four women, who are choosing to stay anonymous, Edwards said.\n\nAllred said she plans to file lawsuits \u201cin the next two weeks\u201d on behalf of at least five clients -- all of whom were children when they were sexually abused, she added.\n\nWhen asked what she\u2019s seeking, Allred explained, \u201cthe truth,\u201d as well as \u201cjustice, which they were denied in the criminal justice system.\" Lastly, she said, accountability.\n\n\u201cThey had to pay for their medical bills, therapy bills, lost wages and pain and suffering,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cThe cost of the wrongs should be borne by the wrongdoer. And in this case, the wrongdoer was Jeffrey Epstein and his estate should bear the cost of the wrong and should compensate the victims for the very, very substantial harm.\u201d\n\nSome of her clients, she added, are still incurring costs related to the damage caused by Epstein\u2019s sex abuse.\n\nEpstein, who was worth more than $550 million, owned properties in Manhattan, New Mexico, Paris and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nHis Upper East Side townhouse sits on East 71st Street near Fifth Avenue, and is worth a reported $55.9 million.\n\nBut despite the sprawling six-floor home\u2019s tony location, experts told the New York Post the building \u201cwill be a difficult house to sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you separate out what is alleged to have gone on, it is easily a $75 million house,\u201d Douglas Elliman\u2019s Richard Steinberg told the Post.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what the \u2018E\u2019 factor will be.\u201d\n\nInvestigators are still probing claims that Epstein worked with co-conspirators, including Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of supplying Epstein with child sex slaves.\n\nEpstein's attorney, Reid Weingarten, did not immediately respond to FOX Business's request for comment.", "description": "Survivors and their attorneys have turned their efforts to filing civil cases against Jeffrey Epstein's estate.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Jeffrey-Epstein-T.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
