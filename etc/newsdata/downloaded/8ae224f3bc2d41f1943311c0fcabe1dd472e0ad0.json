Angelica Lozano, as they celebrated her victory was widely circulated on social media.\n\n\"Claudia's election opens up new horizons for LGBT+ people across Latin America,\" said Matt Beard, executive director of international LGBT+ rights group All Out.\n\n\"As the first openly LGBT+ mayor of a capital city in the region, her election sets the foundation for the LGBT+ community ... to aspire to and achieve positions of political leadership, including the very highest office.\"\n\nParts of South America have made progress on LGBT+ rights in the past decade, including passing laws allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.\n\nBut less progress has been made on increasing the participation of LGBT+ people as elected officials in local and central government.\n\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota,additional reporting Oscar Lopez in Mexico City Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
