Yeovil followed in solidarity.\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\nNo worrying about the score or leaving it to officials. No worrying about what the FA might do or how it might affect the competition. Direct action. Enough.\n\nTheirs was a real statement, in stark contrast to the bizarre triumphalism last Monday night in Bulgaria where England claimed some sort of moral victory. There was something of the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes around the claim, widely accepted, from the top of the FA that the Three Lions had somehow made a stand by highlighting an issue already well documented.\n\nThey finished the game and got out of Dodge, allowing UEFA to follow the tired old ineffectual procedure that gets them off the hook.\n\nHaringey have given the FA a tough decision to make.\n\nDo the governing body back them \u2013 as they should? Or will they do what they did to Padiham FC of the North West Counties League 12 months ago?\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThat team walked off during a game against Congleton in protest at the racist abuse keeper Tony Aghayere had been receiving from members of the crowd. Padiham were the ones fined.\n\nIn April of this year FC Wymeswold striker Linford Harris was also fined \u2013 and hit with a 10-match ban \u2013 after he was racially abused by fans in a County Cup final against Cosby United. His team-mates had walked off the pitch in solidarity. They too were charged. Because, of course, they were the problem.\n\nSteve Bruce, as Sheffield United manager in 1999, took his players off in an FA Cup tie against Arsenal because he didn\u2019t get the ball back after kicking it out for an injured Arsenal player to be treated. He was rewarded with a replay.\n\nWe\u2019d have all been behind England\u2019s stars had they come off in Bulgaria. Gareth Southgate and his men would have set a standard for a new generation from the top of English football.\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\nWalking off would have sent a powerful message on behalf of clubs like Haringey and Padiham and men like Linford Harris. Instead the top of the game is still clinging to banners, slogans, hashtags, protocols, T-shirts and talk. Lots and lots of talk.\n\nStill on TV, radio and in print we wring our hands and ask what can be done to boot out racism when we know the answer.\n\nDock points. Throw clubs and countries out of competitions. We\u2019ve called for it for Bulgaria, Montenegro and countless others, let\u2019s accept it for our English clubs in the cup competitions and our domestic leagues. Let\u2019s not allow tribalism to replace the unity of the past week. In the Championship eight months ago Birmingham were hit with a nine-point deduction after being found guilty of breaking the Football League\u2019s spending rules.\n\nBradford, Grays and Whyteleafe are among a number of clubs kicked out of domestic club competitions for fielding ineligible players.\n\nIf the authorities can\u2019t be as tough on racism then players must continue to protect themselves by either walking off or agreeing to be taken off.\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\nFor five decades they have either been let down or conditioned to believe you beat the racists by smashing five or six goals past the opposition.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t worked for past generations and it isn\u2019t working now. The young black men of English football must realise their collective strength, just as the #MeToo movement has empowered women across industry and entertainment.\n\nNow, from the bottom of football\u2019s food chain, Haringey Borough have laid the foundations for a new standard. Players must keep walking off as they have done \u2013 until football embraces its duty to protect them.", "description": "Haringey Borough walked off the pitch during their FA Cup tie with Yeovil Town after their players were targeted by racial abuse", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "James Fearn Ppauk", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655332.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Haringey-Borough-v-Yeovil-Town-London-UK-19-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
