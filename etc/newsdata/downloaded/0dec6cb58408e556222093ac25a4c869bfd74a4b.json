On that date, the Queen will deliver a speech laying out what Johnson has called a \u201cbold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe Queen approved the suspension Wednesday afternoon British time. \u201cThere will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through,\u201d Johnson wrote in his letter. \u201cBut that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition!\u201d\n\nParliament usually holds a three-week break in September, allowing time for political parties to hold their annual conferences, but there was widespread expectation that the break would be scrapped this year to allow more time to debate Brexit. The Queen\u2019s suspension of Parliament has been little more than a formality for decades, and Johnson has now created a situation in which her position is inherently politicized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson appears to have learned a lesson from the tenure of his predecessor, Theresa May, who was also elected by the Conservative Party and not the British public, and who at various times was torpedoed by Parliament in her efforts to deliver Brexit. He has maneuvered to avoid that fate by limiting the amount of debate and political machinations that MPs can undertake \u2014 hampering their ability to scuttle a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJohnson recently has backtracked on his comments that the chances of a no-deal Brexit were \u201ca million to one\u201d and now says the odds of such an outcome are \u201ctouch and go.\u201d He has vowed to deliver Brexit one way or another by October 31st.\n\nThe prime minister was a key player during the Leave campaign in 2016 that preceded the popular vote to quit the European Union. His de facto limiting of the Brexit debate is likely to please his hardline, anti-EU supporters who think that it could force the EU to make concessions to prevent the damage of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThere is absolutely no guarantee, however, that the EU would offer those concessions. The two sides remain at loggerheads, especially over the question of the border separating the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland. The EU repeatedly has told the British government, under both May and Johnson, that there will be no renegotiation of a deal the two parties agreed on back in November 2018.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, a no-deal Brexit would be much worse for the UK than it would be for the EU. Continued signs of the massive damage that a no-deal Brexit could cause are hovering around the edge of the debate. As Johnson announced his suspension of Parliament, the pound started crashing against the dollar. And earlier this month, a bomb targeting police officers was discovered near Northern Ireland\u2019s border with the Republic of Ireland, a sign that militant violence could resurge in the region if a \u201chard border\u201d returns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpposition MPs and former cabinet officials were outraged by Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the maneuver as a \u201csmash and grab on our democracy to force through a no-deal.\u201d Former Chancellor Philip Hammond called Johnson\u2019s decision was a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d and \u201cprofoundly undemocratic,\u201d a statement echoed by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.\n\n\u201cHowever it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\u201d Bercow said. \u201cAt this time, one of the most challenging periods in our nation\u2019s history, it is vital that our elected Parliament has its say.\u201d\n\nThere might be an even more nefarious aim to Johnson\u2019s cancellation, however: forcing a general election.\n\nIf MPs are outraged enough by Johnson\u2019s move, they might call a vote of no confidence, setting the stage for a general election right before the Brexit vote. Then, Johnson can essentially re-litigate the Brexit referendum and paint himself as the only leader who can deliver Brexit on the final day of October. This, in turn, would allow Johnson another four years before he\u2019d need to call a general election again and potentially, make for 13 years of uninterrupted Conservative rule.\n\nOf course, with Brexit, no one ever really knows what\u2019s going to happen next. Johnson could call a general election tomorrow. Or he could be ousted by his cabinet and party in a vote of no-confidence. Or he could lose his nerve at the last minute in October, and return to the earlier deal.\n\nThe only certainty at this point is some form of chaos.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1000604034.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
