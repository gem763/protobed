Courtesy the artist and MACK.\n\nGregory Halpern was born in Buffalo in 1977. When he was a teenager, he became enthralled by a book of photos called \u201cTriptychs\u201d by Milton Rogovin, a Buffalo native who didn\u2019t pick up photography until he was in his 50s. Since then, Halpern has had a particular fascination with photo books. He\u2019s widely known for the artist\u2019s books he has created with his photography throughout his career.\n\nHis new book, \u201cOmaha Sketchbook,\u201d was originally released as a spiral-bound artist\u2019s book made up of laser prints by J&L Books, a publisher founded by photographer Jason Fulford and artist Leanne Shapton. That version of the book is no longer widely available. Now reissued by MACK Books, it\u2019s again available to a wider audience. And it\u2019s a unique book for several reasons.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is that the book looks as though it\u2019s made of construction paper. The photos are printed very small. This is intended to be a facsimile of the way Halpern originally approached the work. As he was working on the project, he would print the contact sheets and then paste them into a sketchbook made of construction paper he found in Omaha.\n\nThe next thing you might notice is that the book is almost all about men.\n\nIn an interview with fellow photographer Matthew Leifheit, editor of Matte magazine, on the Magnum Photos website, Halpern addresses this:\n\nThe book depicts men almost exclusively. And they are often doing things traditionally associated with masculinity, or with a certain kind of masculine ideal. There are also of course quieter or more ambiguous moments \u2014 a man dancing, a man standing alone in the dark, a man staring out the window. I\u2019d say I\u2019m simultaneously fascinated by and repulsed by certain traditional displays of masculinity. I can just as quickly get sucked into a boxing match on television as I can be maddened by the male privilege assumed by some of my students, or even little boys on the playground. I have two daughters, the youngest of whom was born the night [Donald] Trump was elected, and it\u2019s been impossible not to see the world through the eyes of a young girl ever since. And to see my own privilege and blindness as well.\n\nUltimately, \u201cOmaha Sketchbook\u201d isn\u2019t merely an examination of male life in the American Midwest, but a meditation on \u201cAmericanness\u201d overall. At least that\u2019s how Amanda Maddox from the J. Paul Getty Museum sees it.\n\nShe has written of Halpern\u2019s work:\n\nThroughout his career, Gregory Halpern has explored the elusive, inchoate notion of Americanness. It is both a difficult subject and a lofty prospect for any photographer and it remains an absolutely essential line of investigation, particularly in the context of the current political maelstrom. Traveling to the nation\u2019s heartland \u2014 a vague construct increasingly synonymous with the Bible belt \u2014 Halpern continues to mine this idea of Americanness in a place bounded by prairie and steeped in pioneer history. His work in the Midwestern city of Omaha reveals America as pluralized, fragmented, and teeming with its own \u201cbrand of hypermasculinity,\u201d as he terms it: adolescents on the cusp of promise or obscurity, land that seemingly leads to nowhere, a sense of unending time and a dark side to domesticity. Halpern\u2019s efforts to visualize America yield an opportunity to learn about the country by staring back at images of it that breed their own complexity.\n\n\n\nGregory Halpern.
