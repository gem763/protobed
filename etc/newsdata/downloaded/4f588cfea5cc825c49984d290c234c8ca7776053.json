The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates business activities, is also reportedly investigating the firm's advertising.\n\n\"We believe you have a continuing responsibility to take action to address the epidemic of youth use of your products, some of which appears to have been a direct result of your product design and marketing campaigns, whether or not some of these practices have been discontinued,\" the FDA wrote.", "description": "US regulators have sent a warning to the e-cigarette company, as health officials probe deaths.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3BA7/production/_108617251_gettyimages-1032883954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
