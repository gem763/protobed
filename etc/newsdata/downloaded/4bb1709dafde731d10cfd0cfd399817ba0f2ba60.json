On Sunday night, scenes of chaos engulfed Sadr City, the Baghdad stronghold of influential Shiite leader Moqtada al-Sadr, who called for the government to resign.\n\nAt least 13 demonstrators died in Sadr City, where the military recognised \u201cexcessive force outside the rules of engagement\u201d had been used.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Tragic loss of life\u2019 \u2013\n\nAccording to official figures, the week of violence in Baghdad and across southern Iraq killed more than 100 people, mostly protesters but including several police, with more than 6,000 others wounded.\n\nUncertainty over the identify of the perpetrators persists, with authorities blaming \u201cunidentified snipers\u201d.\n\nAmnesty International said Wednesday that the authorities\u2019 pledge to set up an investigation into the deaths was \u201calready ringing hollow as protesters continue to be harassed and threatened into silence\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has condemned the violence.\n\nDuring a call with Mahdi, Pompeo said \u201cthose who violated human rights should be held accountable\u201d, the State Department said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe secretary lamented the tragic loss of life over the past few days and urged the Iraqi government to exercise maximum restraint.\n\n\u201cPompeo reiterated that peaceful public demonstrations are a fundamental element of all democracies, and emphasised that there is no place for violence in demonstrations, either by security forces or protesters.\u201d\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also called Abdel Mahdi to express worry over the violence.\n\n\u201cI raised concerns about the response to recent protests \u2013 the need to respect peaceful protest & media freedoms,\u201d he wrote on Twitter Wednesday.\n\n\u2013 Internet shutdown \u2013\n\nWhile calm has returned to the country, uninterrupted internet access has not.\n\nCyber-security NGO NetBlocks blamed the state for imposing \u201ca near-total telecommunication shutdown in most regions, severely limiting press coverage and transparency around the ongoing crisis.\u201d\n\nFor a week, internet access has been progressively limited. First, access to certain social media sites disappeared, followed by internet connections for telephones, computers and even virtual private network (VPN) applications.\n\nSince Tuesday, connection had intermittently returned to Baghdad and the south of the country.\n\nBut on Wednesday, NetBlocks reported on Twitter that the internet was \u201ccut again across most of #Iraq\u201d, adding that social media and mobile services were \u201chighly disrupted\u201d.\n\nProviders had told customers earlier in the day they were unable to provide a timetable for a return to uninterrupted service, information on restrictions, or any other details.\n\nIraqi authorities have not commented on the restrictions, which according to NetBlocks have affected three quarters of the country. In the north, the autonomous Kurdish region has remained unaffected.\n\nThe tentative calm returning to Baghdad comes ahead of Arbaeen, the massive pilgrimage this month that sees millions of Shiite Muslims walk to the holy city of Karbala, south of Baghdad.\n\nNearly two million came last year from neighbouring Iran, which has urged citizens to delay their travel into Iraq in light of the protest violence.\n\nIts supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday \u201cenemies\u201d were trying to drive a wedge between Tehran and Baghdad, in an apparent allusion to the protests.\n\nThe demonstrations and accompanying violence have created a political crisis in a country torn between its two main allies \u2014 Iran and the United States.\n\nWith political rivals accusing each other of allegiance to foreign powers, President Barham Saleh called Monday for \u201csons of the same country\u201d to put an end to the \u201cdiscord\u201d.\n\nHe called for a \u201cnational, all-encompassing and frank dialogue\u2026 without foreign interference.\u201d", "description": "Baghdad (Iraq) (AFP) \u2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi on Wednesday promised a full probe into last week\u2019s violence that left more than", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/04600b_calm-has-returned-streets-iraq-week-anti-government-protests-met-violence-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
