That parallels with an increase in syphilis among women of childbearing age.\n\n\u201cThis is a failure of the public health system and private health care system, and we have the tools to prevent it,\u201d said Dr. Gail Bolan, director of the CDC's STD Division.\n\nIn all, there were nearly 2.5 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis in 2018, a 30 percent increase from 2013.\n\n\u201cMost people have no signs of symptoms so they don\u2019t know they\u2019re infected, and it becomes a challenging problem to identify everyone infected and get them treatment,\u201d said Bolan.\n\nMany STD clinics that were effective at treating diseases closed during the 2007-2009 recession and never reopened. For state government\u2019s strapped for money, public health funds are often the first to be cut during economic downturns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the erosion of the public health infrastructure,\u201d Bolan said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLow-income patients who are uninsured or underinsured often struggle to find care in the private care system and at times are unable to get appointments for treatment until weeks after testing positive for STDs.\n\nThat raises the risk of patients falling through the cracks, not following up on appointments and potentially spreading the infection.\n\nA record-high 1.8 million chlamydia cases were reported to the CDC in 2018, an increase of 2.9 percent from the previous year, making it the most common STD in the U.S.\n\nRates increased 19.4 percent between 2014 and 2018.\n\nChlamydia rates are highest among adolescents and young adults, particularly women, with two-thirds of cases among people between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\nThe CDC recommends women younger than 25, and women who are at greater risks for infection, be screened annually for the disease.\n\nAnd more than 115,000 cases of all stages of syphilis were reported to the CDC last year, a 13 percent increase from 2017 and the highest number since 1991.\n\nThat includes more than 35,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease. In 2018, rates of primary and secondary syphilis increased nearly 14 percent from the previous year.\n\nMost of those cases were among men who had sex with other men, according to the report.\n\nBut rates also rose among women by 30 percent from 2017 to 2018.\n\nThat increase is linked to a spike in the number of babies born with syphilis.\n\nIf pregnant women aren\u2019t treated for syphilis, the baby can be born with it, resulting in stillbirths, preterm birth, and physical and mental disabilities.\n\nCongenital syphilis is treatable, but the CDC said it suspects some health care providers are failing to screen pregnant women for the disease early in pregnancy, or women are not getting prenatal care.\n\n\u201cThe resurgence of syphilis, and particularly congenital syphilis, is not an arbitrary event, but rather a symptom of a deteriorating public health infrastructure and lack of access to health care,\u201d Bolan wrote in her report.\n\n\u201cIt is exposing hidden, fragile populations in need that are not getting the health care and preventive services they deserve. This points to our need for public health and health care action for each of the cases in this report, as they represent real people, not just numbers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, gonorrhea rates are rising fast, with an 83 percent increase in cases from 2009 to 2018. Rates are highest among men, particularly those that have sex with other men.\n\nIn 2018, more than 583,000 cases were reported to the CDC, an increase of 5 percent from the previous year.\n\nPublic health groups have sounded the alarm on increasing STD rates for years.\n\nThe National Coalition of STD Directors is urging Congress to increasing funding for STD prevention services by $70 million, calling it the \u201cbare minimum\u201d it will take the CDC to support an effective response to an ongoing public health crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have an STD crisis in the U.S. because prevention programs were sold short for years,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the group. \u201cOur first line of defense is underfunded and overwhelmed, leaving Americans vulnerable to STD outbreaks, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nThe government funding bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House included an increased in funding for STD services but it\u2019s unclear if the Senate bill will follow suit.\n\n\u201cSTDs have real health and human costs. Babies dying from preventable conditions, like congenital syphilis, is not an outcome we can accept,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThis is a heartbreaking symptom of our nation\u2019s STD crisis. Without a radical shift in how we prioritize sexual health in the United States, we can only expect things to get worse.\"", "description": "Rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) reached a record high in 2018, resulting in more babies born with syphilis, according to a report released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Contr", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cdc_2014getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
