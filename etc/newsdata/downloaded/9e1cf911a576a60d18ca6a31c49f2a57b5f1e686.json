He jokes it would be more alarming if he were also wearing a kilt, the standard uniform of the Highland Games, while tossing a round 16-pound weight attached to a long handle.\n\nThe Highland Games are built around classic Scottish Highland sports, or \u201cheavy events\u201d such as the hammer toss and caber toss, an event where competitors lift a full-length log upright, run with it and toss it as straight as possible so it flips end-over-end. \u201cThe neighbors are lucky I don\u2019t own a caber yet,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Kasson, who is 6-foot-4 and weighs 285 pounds, competed in amateur Strongman competitions in his 20s. \u201cEssentially you\u2019re picking up or moving ridiculously heavy stuff,\u201d he says.\n\nJust as his Strongman career was ending, a friend told him about the Highlander, a competition founded in Scotland comprised of Strongman events and Highland Games events.\n\nMr. Kasson throws a weight for distance in the 2018 Scottish Highland Gathering & Games in Pleasanton, Calif.

A centuries-old Scottish tradition, the games are now held throughout the world. Many competitors, including Mr. Kasson, have no Scottish heritage.\n\n\u201cStrongman competitors are so serious to the point the events aren\u2019t fun,\u201d he says. As for his newer sport: \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of guys in kilts throwing sticks and stones in a field, so you really can\u2019t take yourself too seriously. It\u2019s more like a party.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old turned pro in 2014 and competes in up to 18 events a year. He says he\u2019s made just over $5,000 in prize money this year: \u201cMy wife wouldn\u2019t let me do this if I wasn\u2019t getting paid.\u201d Mr. Kasson also works full time as a physical therapist in Lincoln, which comes in handy considering he\u2019s suffered ACL and MCL injuries and kneecap dislocations over the years.\n\n\u201cThe Highland Games work explosive power and speed rather than raw strength, so the events are easier on my knees,\u201d he says. But given the injury risk, he considers himself lucky to have access to rehab facilities.\n\nHe is the reigning Highland Games Heavy Events world champion and will defend his title at the New Hampshire Highland Games & Festival, Sept 20 to 22 in Lincoln, N.H.\n\nMr. Kasson warms up for a light weight for distance throw with 28 pounds. He says body mechanics is key to efficient throwing. VIDEO: Dana Damewood for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Workout\n\nMr. Kasson\u2019s training consists of nine 90-minute sessions a week. He doubles up on Saturdays, Sundays and Tuesdays and takes one rest day. Training consists of a warm-up, 20 to 40 training throws, then another 10 to 20 focused throws, then gym work, followed by a cool-down with foam rolling and a cold-tub session.\n\nEarly in the season, he tries to get as strong as possible, performing dead lifts, squats, bench and overhead presses and Olympic lifts like the snatch or clean and jerk. He drastically changed his training this year to focus more on throwing leading into the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really monotonous,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m throwing 150 to 200 reps a week in all of my disciplines combined.\u201d His strength sessions focus more on how fast he can move the weight versus how much weight he can get up. Given that his events entail hurling heavy objects, \u201cit\u2019s all about being explosive and getting as much power as you can, as quickly as possible,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Kasson studies videos to break down the biomechanics of throwing techniques. \u201cYou need to know when to apply force or when to be relaxed and let things flow,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a real yin and yang to it.\u201d He typically competes in eight events: a standing stone put and open stone throw (think shot put), light (28-pound) and heavy (56-pound) weight throws for distance, light (16-pound) and heavy (22-pound) hammer toss, the caber toss, and weight for height. That\u2019s where the athlete tosses a 56-pound weight with one hand over a crossbar.\n\nMr. Kasson has suffered knee injuries from lifting heavy weights. When training in his home gym, he now focuses on explosive speed rather than the amount of weight.

His hearty breakfast includes a bagel, four eggs, smoked salmon and spinach. Lunch is usually leftovers from dinner: a lean protein and carbs. But if someone brings in burgers and malts to the office, he occasionally indulges. He consumes at least two protein shakes throughout the day. Dinner might be grilled chicken thighs over salad with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots. His splurge is cake doughnuts.\n\nThe Gear and Cost\n\nMr. Kasson estimates he invested $3,000 on his home gym equipment, which includes a power rack, about 1,000 pounds of plates, various bars, dumbbells, kettlebells weighing up to 203 pounds and medicine balls. He also has hammers, shot puts and stones.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What activities have you embraced after dealing with knee injuries? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cMy kilt is a far cry from the traditional dress\u2014a kilt made of 8 yards of fabric,\u201d he says. \u201cThe guys who throw in them look great, but they are super heavy.\u201d Mr. Kasson sticks to a bare-bones, $60-$70 kilt and long-sleeved top that protects him from the sun. He wears Adidas javelin shoes.\n\nFor the hammer throw, he bolts blades onto the bottom of steel-toed work boots. Gloves aren\u2019t allowed in the games, so he uses a mixture of pine gum rosin and turpentine on his hands to make sure his hammer doesn\u2019t slide from his grip.\n\nHe uses a Whoop strap fitness tracker, mostly to ensure he\u2019s getting eight hours of sleep ($28 a month). He wears braces on his knees for training and competitions.\n\nThe Playlist\n\nMr. Kasson\u2019s guilty gym pleasure is dubstep, a club sound known for its distinctive bass line and refracted rhythms. \u201cI just like the beat,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only time I listen to it is in the gym.\u201d\n\nTraining After an ACL Injury\n\nAbout 250,000 people suffer from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries each year in the U.S., according to the University of North Carolina Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nThe ACL is an important stabilizer in the knee. After an injury, cross-training is key to becoming strong and active again, says Deena Poll Goodman, a physical therapist and owner of Goodman Physical Therapy in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cOftentimes we strengthen muscles that are already strong, like the quads, to get them stronger, and forget about the smaller muscles or muscles on the opposite side of that body part,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, hamstring length and strength is just as important to the knee as spine mobility and back strength.\u201d\n\nA rehab program should start with lighter weights and stretching, she says. \u201cThe concept of supporting the joints above and below the knee\u2014the ankle and the hip\u2014is important when training to maintain balance and not cause strain,\u201d Ms. Goodman says.\n\nShe suggests incorporating swimming or pool exercises, band exercises to strengthen hips and outer thighs and Pilates-based reformer or mat exercises for trunk stability into a routine. She says standing on a half foam roller can help increase the firing of the joint and muscles in the knee.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workout?
