The vote will decide whether Britain leaves the EU by the current 31 October deadline. If the bill fails, Johnson will be legally bound to write to Brussels asking for an extension to the timetable, although both sides have expressed reluctance about a further delay.\n\nThe outcome is the only thing on the minds of investors in UK assets. Sterling was trading at its highest levels since mid-May on Friday at 8.15am UK time. The pound was flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1574 (GBPEUR=X) and down 0.1% against the dollar to $1.2873 (GBPUSD=X).\n\nThe pound is trading against the dollar at levels not seen since mid-May.

The leaders of all major opposition parties came out against the deal shortly after it was announced on Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: The biggest issue at the heart of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal\n\nLabour shadow chancellor Johnn McDonell told the BBC on Friday morning: \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad deal we can\u2019t support it.\u201d He said Labour MPs would face a three line whip, meaning they will be compelled to vote against the deal.\n\nSammy Wilson MP, the Brexit spokesperson for Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cI can give you absolute assurance we will not be voting for this deal when it comes before the Commons tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe DUP\u2019s support for the deal is crucial, as the ruling Conservative Party does not have a majority in the House of Commons. Without DUP support, the government will be relying on opposition rebels voting against their own parties in support of the deal.\n\n\u201cThe PM must be hoping that more Labour MPs, in addition to the five that backed Mrs. May\u2019s deal along with the three former Labour independents, will have a change of heart,\u201d wrote Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note sent to clients on Thursday.\n\n\u201cReportedly, about 20 Labour MPs are considering backing the deal, fearing that otherwise they will lose their seats in a pre-Brexit general election. The number of Labour MPs prepared to support Brexit, however, has been consistently over-estimated over the last year.\u201d\n\nTombs predicted Johnson would fall short by 15 votes. Betting markets are also pricing in a defeat.\n\nREAD MORE: High drama on Brexit sparks volatility for pound\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank and ING said that, although the deal is likely to fail, the sheer fact that a deal has been struck is good news for the pound. Both argued that a hard Brexit now looks less likely.\n\n\u201cThe reason we think that tomorrow\u2019s vote is less important to the pound than the striking of the deal itself is that all the major UK parties now support either a second referendum which is unlikely to have no deal on the ballot paper (Liberal Democrats, Labour, SNP), or a concrete deal with the EU (Conservatives),\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note sent to clients on Friday.\n\nStill, analysts said the outcome of Saturday\u2019s vote would likely lead to volatility for the pound. UBS said last week that a \u201cbenign deal\u201d could see the pound climb as high as $1.35, while a rejection would likely send the pound lower.\n\n\u201cThe next move in GBP hinges on the UK parliament vote this weekend,\u201d Petr Krpata, ING\u2019s chief European foreign exchange strategist, wrote.", "description": "MPs will on Saturday vote whether to approve Boris Johnson's new deal, with the Prime Minister widely expected to lose.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xx5fppeOWo8LMgOwo.1SVQ--~B/aD0zNDAwO3c9NTEwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/51aac140-f17a-11e9-bceb-71fc3343a381", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
