We didn't know that our grandfather owned [the house] until a policeman knocked on our door in November 2017,' Graeme told A Current Affair in March.\n\nMr Henry Downie was the last owner of the property. His descendants (pictured) withdrew their appeal against the lower court decision on Tuesday\n\nThe home boasts a alfresco entertainers' backyard (pictured) with plenty of natural light\n\nThe family claimed to be the rightful owners and applied for an injunction, arguing Mr Gertos' acquisition of the property was not 'open', a criteria stipulated in the conditions for squatters rights.\n\nMr Gertos said he offered the family $300,000 to drop their claim of ownership over the house.\n\n'I was flexible and I do wish this matter resolved, but unfortunately they did not see it that way,' he said.\n\nHe said without his intervention the house would have become a 'rat-infested squalor'.\n\nIn June this year, Mr Gertos won a Supreme Court case to keep the home.\n\nThe Malleny Street house is now listed with Mint Property Agents principal Paul Errichiello.\n\nBill Gertos was awarded ownership after he won the Supreme Court case earlier this year\n\nMr Gertos claimed earlier this year that without his intervention, the house would have become a 'rat-infested squalor'.\n\nSet in a quiet cul de sac, the 'Federation fa\u00e7ade' has refurbished interiors and the scope to extend.\n\nIt's closely located to parks, schools as well as Ashfield and Canterbury train stations.\n\nMr Errichiello declined to comment on the circumstances of the sale when contacted by The Daily Telegraph.\n\nBut property records reveal the savvy developer was trying to sell the house for about $1.45million.", "description": "Bill Gertos came across the humble abode in 1998 when he was visiting a client on Ashbury Street in Sydney's inner-west.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek", "Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20346598-0-image-a-2_1572382722165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
