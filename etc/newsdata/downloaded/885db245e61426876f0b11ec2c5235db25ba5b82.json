But the rest of it is great, too.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nI can\u2019t recommend the iPhone 11 Pro (and its little brother, the standard iPhone 11) enough. Apple really knocked it out of the park this year.\n\nInitially, I really wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like this upgrade. I was coming from the iPhone X, a phone I considered nearly perfect in terms of size and design. Given how neither the size nor the design changed in the iPhone 11 Pro, I was worried it wouldn\u2019t feel like much of an \u201cupgrade\u201d at all.\n\nThankfully, I was wrong.\n\nHere\u2019s why I love the iPhone 11 Pro \u2013 and recommend it to everyone.\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s talk about looks.\n\ncaption The iPhone 11 Pro in midnight green. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nYes, the iPhone 11 Pro looks completely identical to the iPhone X from the front.\n\nBut on the back, I love \u2013 and I mean love \u2013 Apple\u2019s new color for these premium phones, which it calls \u201cmidnight green.\u201d I\u2019ve never owned a phone that appears ever-so-slightly different every time I take it out. Sometimes it looks gray, sometimes it looks like an army green. I am in love with it.\n\nWhoever at Apple was responsible for the iPhone colors this year deserves a raise.\n\nThe camera system on the back also looks really neat.\n\ncaption The triple-lens camera system on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nWhen Apple first debuted this phone, the internet quickly responded with memes showing how the new rear-camera system looked like a stove top.\n\nIn person, I actually think it looks really cool, especially how the glossy camera bump contrasts with the matte back of the phone. It gives off an optical illusion that the camera is actually debossed, or sunken into the phone, when the opposite is true.\n\nBy the way, the camera bump feels way less noticeable this year, despite a much larger rear-camera system.\n\nAside from the design, I really love how this phone runs. It is buttery smooth when launching and switching between apps \u2014 and on only 4 GB of RAM!\n\ncaption Me, trying to match the color of my iPhone 11 Pro with my sweater. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nLots of internet pitchforks were raised when the iPhone 11 Pro debuted, since some people believed a \u201cpro\u201d iPhone should have 6 GB of RAM or more. But it just goes to show how little people on the internet truly know about smartphone hardware.\n\nCompared to many Android phones out there, Apple does much more with much less, so to speak, because it controls every layer of the experience, from hardware to software. The iPhone 11 Pro is a prime example of how this tight integration leads to a better user experience.\n\nRead more: The 7 most disappointing features in iOS 13\n\nBut the highlight of this phone, hands down, is the camera.\n\ncaption I was able to take photos of Nuit Blanche, a once-a-year art festival in Toronto that runs all night, thanks to the iPhone 11 Pro. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nApple truly outdid itself this year, improving the front- and rear-facing cameras so much that I can feel confident shooting in any environment.\n\nNo, really: In light or dark settings, or shooting close or far away subjects, the iPhone 11 Pro excels no matter what you throw at it.\n\nI\u2019ve captured some shots I\u2019ve simply never been able to take on my phone before, especially in low-light \u2013 or no light! \u2013 settings. It blows me away every time.\n\nVideos are equally sensational, if not more so since details can be captured in stunning 4K, at a lifelike 60 frames per second.\n\nJust take a look at some of these photos, taken in extremely difficult lighting situations.\n\ncaption Nathan Philips Square, in downtown Toronto. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nNo joke, this room was pitch black, with the exception of the stage lights.\n\ncaption The Music Hall of Williamsburg, during a concert. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nPhotos taken at night, or in low-light situations, look extremely similar to how they looked at the time \u2014 something I\u2019ve never been able to say about any smartphone camera I\u2019ve used.\n\ncaption The Centre for the Performing Arts at the Four Seasons in Toronto. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nOverall, I\u2019m a huge fan of the iPhone 11 Pro. It feels like a truly worthy upgrade for anyone who owns an iPhone X, or any iPhone prior to that.\n\ncaption This fried chicken was shot with, and is just like, the iPhone 11 Pro: Crispy, juicy, surprising, and delicious. source Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nLots of people are getting excited about next year\u2019s iPhone, which is said to be the first to support the new 5G wireless standard, but let\u2019s be real here: 5G is nowhere close to being ready, in most of the US and the world, and next year\u2019s iPhone is always going to be better than this year\u2019s. Personally, I prefer to live in the \u201cnow,\u201d and in that sense, the iPhone 11 Pro is the best smartphone in the world, and is absolutely worth buying if you\u2019re on the fence.\n\nYou can always upgrade again in the future if you like that phone, but the iPhone 11 Pro feels like the most refined version of the iPhone X generation. At a $999 starting price, it\u2019s not cheap, but you won\u2019t regret buying it.", "description": "Business Insider - I've had the iPhone 11 Pro for three weeks now.
