The judges did not set a specific deadline for the redrawn districts but said the process should be \"expeditious.\"\n\n\"The Court respectfully urges the General Assembly to adopt an expeditious process ... that ensures full transparency and allows for bipartisan participation and consensus to create new congressional districts that likewise seek to achieve this fundamental constitutional objective,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe complaint filing came after the same panel of judges ruled in a separate lawsuit that state legislative districts violated the rights of Democratic voters and needed to be withdrawn before the 2020 election. GOP leaders did not appeal this decision and returned with new maps two weeks later, with many of the new districts passing, The News & Observer reported.", "description": "A state court\u00a0on Monday threw out North Carolina's congressional map,\u00a0arguing the state's 13 districts were an example of \"extreme partisan gerrymandering\" in a decision that could have\u00a0major consequences in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/northcarolinaamendments_062818hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
