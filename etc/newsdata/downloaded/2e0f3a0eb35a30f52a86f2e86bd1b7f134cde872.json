Some radiation was released, but officials said it was within acceptable levels. Yet many who live in the area are convinced that their health problems in later years were related to the accident.\n\nWITF YouTube\n\nThe event ushered in a new era of nuclear regulations, while also ending an era of growth in the U.S. commercial nuclear sector. Since the accident, no commercial reactors have been built in the U.S.\n\nExelon officials said some of the plant's approximately 675 employees will keep working at the plant to move the nuclear fuel as it cools.\n\nMost will stay around until the end of the month, enough time to move fuel out of the reactor and into a massive vat of water called a spent fuel pool.\n\nAfter that, staffing will be reduced to 300 employees, who will move the fuel to concrete and stainless steel \"dry casks.\"\n\nEnergy 40 Years After Three Mile Island Meltdown, Nuclear Energy Safety Concerns Remain 40 Years After Three Mile Island Meltdown, Nuclear Energy Safety Concerns Remain Listen \u00b7 5:56 5:56\n\nBy 2022, about 50 employees will remain, tasked with the long, slow process of winding down the plant and ensuring that the nuclear waste is kept away from people for tens of thousands of years.\n\nIn 2017, Exelon said it would close if it couldn't get a key subsidy from the state that would help it compete with an energy market flooded with cheaper natural gas.\n\nState lawmakers proposed two bills to save the plant, pointing to the valuable long-term assets nuclear power brings to the table, such as carbon-free emissions, fuel supply diversity and reliability.\n\nCritics argued that the bailouts distorted the competitive wholesale electricity marketplace and said that nuclear power should not be lumped in with clean, renewable energy \u2014 noting the emissions from mining uranium and the fact that the U.S. lacks a plan for disposing of its radioactive nuclear waste.\n\nFor those who live nearby, the possibility of the plant's closure has loomed for years.\n\nKendra Nissley has spent the past 12 years running a dairy farm across the river from the plant in Londonderry Township, Pa.\n\nFrom her farm, high-voltage power lines stretch down to a substation that collects electricity from the plant. It's a reminder that Three Mile Island produced 3% of the state's total power, with nuclear plants making up 40% of a pie that also includes natural gas, coal, hydroelectric and wind.\n\nNissley said the steam rising from two cooling towers \u2014 as well as the two inert cooling towers, tied to the crippled reactor \u2014 have been a reminder of both what nuclear power has provided to the community, and its risks.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brett Sholtis/WITF Brett Sholtis/WITF\n\nNissley said the farm won't be affected much by the closure, but some of her neighbors are losing their jobs. Exelon said it has offered them jobs elsewhere, but that's not an option for some people who have bought homes, raised families and built lives for themselves around Three Mile Island.\n\n\"They express a lot of sadness at losing their longtime job, and we share in some of that sorrow with them,\" Nissley said.\n\nDown the road from Nissley's farm, Londonderry Township Manager Steve Letavic said he has been planning for this day for at least two years.\n\nHe has let five township jobs sit vacant, knowing he would lose tax money needed to fund those positions.\n\nLetavic is planning for a loss of about $50,000 a year for the municipal fire company \u2014 money that Exelon used to help raise through an annual charity golf tournament. He's expecting to lose another $120,000 in tax revenue this year.\n\n\"We're a small town with a $2 million budget. Every little bit matters, right?\"\n\nThe township of 5,200 people also recently voted to open up some undeveloped land to commercial construction in an effort to make up some of the lost tax dollars. Letavic said he's in talks with a developer that wants to build a logistics center, and another that wants to put in a planned community.\n\nThe closure comes on the same day as a global climate strike calling for \"immediate steps to stabilize the environment,\" noted Matt Wald at the pro-nuclear Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\nThe closure is a setback for U.S. efforts to cut its reliance on fossil fuels, Wald said in a news release.\n\n\"The essential problem is that our electricity system is intensively managed to a goal, but the goal isn't clean air or protecting our climate,\" Wald said. \"The goal is least-cost electricity, as if electricity were a commodity regardless of its source.\"", "description": "The plant is best known for the partial meltdown of one of its nuclear reactors in 1979.
