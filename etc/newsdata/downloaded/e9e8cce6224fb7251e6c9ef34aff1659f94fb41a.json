Google\u2019s about to make that a whole lot easier.\n\nGoogle announced today it\u2019s rolling out a new machine learning-based language understanding technique called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT. BERT helps decipher your search queries based on the context of the language used, rather than individual words. According to Google, \u201cwhen it comes to ranking results, BERT will help Search better understand one in 10 searches in the U.S. in English.\u201d\n\nMost of us know that Google usually responds to words, rather than to phrases \u2014 and Google\u2019s aware of it, too. In the announcement, Pandu Nayak, Google\u2019s VP of search, called this kind of searching \u201ckeyword-ese,\u201d or \u201ctyping strings of words that they think we\u2019ll understand, but aren\u2019t actually how they\u2019d naturally ask a question.\u201d It\u2019s amusing to see these kinds of searches \u2014 heck, Wired has make a whole cottage industry out of celebrities reacting to these keyword-ese queries in their \u201cAutocomplete\u201d video series\u201d \u2014 but Nayak\u2019s correct that this is not how most of us would naturally ask a question.\n\nAs you might expect, this subtle change might make some pretty big waves for potential searchers. Nayak said this \u201c[represents] the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search.\u201d Google offered several examples of this in action, such as \u201cDo estheticians stand a lot at work,\u201d which apparently returned far more accurate search results.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is something most of us will notice \u2014 heck, I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I hadn\u2019t read Google\u2019s announcement, but it\u2019ll sure make our lives a bit easier. The only reason I can see it not having a huge impact at first is that we\u2019re now so used to keyword-ese, which is in some cases more economical to type. For example, I can search \u201cWhat movie did William Powell and Jean Harlow star in together?\u201d and get the correct result (Libeled Lady; not sure if that\u2019s BERT\u2019s doing or not), but I can also search \u201cWilliam Powell Jean Harlow movie\u201d and get the exact same result.\n\nBERT will only be applied to English-based searches in the US, but Google is apparently hoping to roll this out to more countries soon.\n\nUnderstanding searches better than ever before on Google\n\nRead next: Why some scientists believe the world is a giant bubble-bath filled with infinite universes", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGoogle-Search.jpg&signature=8ccc6a5adefdf7652a3800fc76a4d672", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
