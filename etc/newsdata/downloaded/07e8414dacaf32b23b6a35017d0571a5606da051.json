Stand with Kong,\u201d set off a firestorm within the NBA and in China, prompting authorities there to cancel publicity events and news conferences and to ban the last week of an exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJames, known for being outspoken on social justice issues, was unusually deferential on the matter, telling reporters Monday that freedom of speech can sometimes have negative ramifications.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with \u2026 Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation, and he spoke,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd so many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\u201d\n\nAmid resounding backlash over his comments, James doubled down, tweeting: \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, James said \u201cnobody stopped and considered what would happen\u201d after Morey\u2019s tweet, and that he \u201ccould have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nKanter, a Turkish national who\u2019s been an outspoken critic of Turkey\u2019s authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared to throw shade on James\u2019 comments, tweeting first \u201cWow dude!\u201d followed by, \u201cSMH (shaking my head),\u201d and a \u201cnauseated face emoji.\u201d\n\nHe then chronicled his experiences dealing with the ramifications of speaking out against Erdogan\u2019s government.\n\nIn an op-ed published Tuesday for the Boston Globe, Kanter wrote: \u201cI have a prominent platform and I want to use it to promote respect for human rights, democracy, and personal freedom. For me, this is bigger [than] basketball. Being a champion of tens of thousands of voiceless people back in my home country carries a risk that includes death threats and arrest warrants.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe op-ed also recounts Kanter\u2019s recent confrontation at a Boston-area mosque with supporters of Erdogan, but makes no explicit mention of China, Daryl Morey, or LeBron James.", "description": "Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter on Tuesday appeared to take shots at NBA superstar Lebron James after he criticized Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for tweeting in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
