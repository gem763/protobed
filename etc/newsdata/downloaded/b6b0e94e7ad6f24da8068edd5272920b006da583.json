and now the world is waking up to the need to change.\n\nAt the same time, Henry says, we have \u2018long-term slightly hidden trends\u2019 in the world of food that create \u2018tailwinds\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018Those tailwinds include population growth, it includes things like urbanisation - as people move to the cities their diets change because they\u2019ve got more access to supermarkets and things like that, and it includes just the rising standards of living across the world and the changes in our habits and in our health trends and concerns.\u2019\n\nThese are all things that make you stop and think a lot more about how the things we eat or drink get to our mouths \u2013 and whether they offer the opportunity to act to improve the world we live, the possibility of investing to make a profit, or the chance to do both at the same time.", "description": "When you think about it the world of food has changed swiftly and dramatically since the Second World War -
