What is it like to grow up in a home enchanting not only to us, but to everybody else?\n\nMaeve and Danny Conroy grow up in the storied Dutch House, a 1922 mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs that was commissioned by the VanHoebeek family who made a fortune in cigarettes and filled their American home with European treasures, ornate mirrors, wood paneling, fanciful windows, and blue Delft mantels \u201csaid to have been pried out of a castle in Utrecht and sold to the VanHoebeeks to pay a prince\u2019s gambling debts.\u201d The Dutch House is the stuff of fairy tales, and Patchett\u2019s plot sounds like a fairy tale as well. A mother who runs away from home, an orphaned sister and brother displaced by a grasping stepmother \u2014 bare summary sounds like melodrama, and this plot would devolve into cliche in the hands of a softer more sentimental novelist. Fortunately, Patchett is made of sterner stuff.\n\nAnn Patchett: Mothers and daughters: It\u2019s a complicated sisterhood\n\nEight years younger than his sister Maeve, Danny Conroy tells the story of his family in and outside the Dutch House. We see the mansion and its inhabitants through Danny\u2019s young eyes, and then we revisit place and people as Danny grows. Like a gradually opening aperture, Danny\u2019s narrow view of rooms and servants broadens to comprehend abandonment by Elna Conroy, and the arrival of a brisk stepmother, Andrea, and her little girls Norma and Bright.\n\nWe watch Danny realize that his life is strange, his house extraordinary, that the rooms and people of his childhood are more complex than he imagined. His family\u2019s faithful servants Sandy and Jocelyn are sisters. To his shame, he had \u201cnever wondered who they were related to or who they went home to.\u201d Most important, we see Maeve through Danny\u2019s eyes, as he grows from dependence to mature appreciation of his brilliant older sister. Danny narrates this story, but Maeve is its heroine \u2014 Danny\u2019s protector, teacher, confidante and closest friend. We watch in horror and fascination as Andrea supplants the absent Elna, and Norma moves into Maeve\u2019s room with its curtained window seat \u2014 a perfect detail straight from another orphan tale, \u201cJane Eyre.\u201d We feel for brother and sister as they return, like Hansel and Gretel, after their father\u2019s death to gaze at the Dutch House and try to make sense of their past.\n\nAbove all, we come to understand the bond between brother and sister. This is the central relationship of the novel \u2014 more durable for these two than any other friendship or romantic attachment. Patchett dramatizes this sibling bond as beautiful, necessary and dangerous.\n\nWith the loss of mother, father and childhood home, Maeve and Danny become a family of two. Maeve serves in loco parentis, but she also becomes a kind of historian for Danny, because she remembers so much more. Pragmatic, clear-eyed, and unsentimental, Maeve is nevertheless possessed by the Dutch House. She drives Danny there whenever he is home from school, and they sit together in her parked car to view the mansion and to talk about what they have lost. The ritual is painful and at the same time thrilling because it is theirs alone. Danny does grow up and marry, but this is the true romance of his life, this love triangle \u2014 brother, sister, gorgeous house. This is the novel\u2019s beating heart \u2014 a strange enchantment in which Maeve waits for her brother to come home and watch the house with her.\n\nThe 10 books to read in September\n\nHere again, the situation sounds both bleak and fanciful, but Patchett writes with restraint, never indulging in overwrought language. In perhaps the most dramatic scene in the book, Maeve and Danny sit in their parked car and watch as their stepmother emerges from the Dutch House to retrieve her newspaper. Danny observes: \u201cShe hadn\u2019t stopped for a scarf. She hadn\u2019t expected the early morning dark to be so clear or the moon so full, and she stood there, taking it in.\u201d Simple language, primarily one-syllable words to convey a moment of almost unbearable suspense, as the orphans watch and speculate on the woman who \u201cthrew us out.\u201d In Danny\u2019s account, an ordinary act \u2014 picking up a newspaper \u2014 becomes ominous. \u201cShe was entirely too close, our stepmother, as close as a person on the other side of the street\u201d and then mundane, \u201cI could see both how she had aged and how she was exactly herself: eyes, nose, chin. There was nothing extraordinary about her,\u201d and finally the occasion for sad revelation. \u201cShe was a woman I had known in my childhood and now did not know at all.\u201d An epic journey in the space of a few sentences.\n\nMasterfully, this scene dramatizes the central conflict in \u201cThe Dutch House\u201d\u2014 not the struggle between orphans and stepmother, innocent children and wicked witch \u2014 but the war between memory and mature reflection, childhood myth and adult analysis. A classic theme, but what makes this novel extraordinary is Patchett\u2019s fair-minded presentation. She inhabits both the child and adult point of view. Both have their powers, their insights and deceptions, their vanities, cruelties, and passions. The outcome is uncertain, lives hang in the balance, and we cannot stop reading. Subtle mystery, psychological page-turner, Patchett\u2019s latest is a thriller.\n\nAllegra Goodman\u2019s novels include \u201cIntuition,\u201d \u201cThe Cookbook Collector,\u201d \u201c Paradise Park\u201d and \u201cKaaterskill Falls.\u201d\n\nTHE DUTCH HOUSE\n\nA Novel\n\nBy Ann Patchett\n\nHarper. 337 pp. $27.99", "description": "The beloved author\u2019s latest novel is a rich tale of love, loss and memory.", "authors": ["Allegra Goodman"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YT4DQAWIDAI6TJHTYCA2CJW6OA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
