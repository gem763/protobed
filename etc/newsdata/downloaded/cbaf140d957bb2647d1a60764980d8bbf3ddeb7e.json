Trump.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) plan to break up large tech companies, which she discussed in a speech last Friday in Queens, positioned her as one of the most aggressive anti-monopolists running in a crowded Democratic field.\n\nBut while the proposal was meant to serve as a benchmark for others seeking the nomination, it managed to spark a tangible amount of interest in conservative quarters, where the perception exists that the social media giants are too powerful and liberal-oriented. On Tuesday, several of those conservatives found themselves doing the previously unthinkable: claiming common ground with a senator whom President Trump routinely mocks as a fraud.\n\n\u201cDue to their rampant censorship, these companies risk radicalizing conservatives to support policies like what Elizabeth Warren is proposing and that will continue unless they start grappling with their inherent biases and the issue of censorship,\u201d said Andrew Surabian, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s political adviser, who argued that conservatives could back Warren\u2019s proposal because of their own grievances with Silicon Valley.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), an ardent Trump ally, said he hadn\u2019t followed the specifics of Warren\u2019s proposal but said a similarly aggressive antitrust push from Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), the chair of a House antitrust subcommittee, could win bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cCicilline in the House is going to go gangbusters on big tech and I'm excited to see what he puts together in legislation,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cIt may get lots of bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nEven Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) got in on the act, tweeting that Warren was \u201cright\u201d that tech giants have too much power while noting that Warren herself had ads on the matter removed from Facebook because of the use of the company\u2019s corporate logo.\n\nBeyond the overtures from GOP lawmakers and top Trump advisers, elements of the online right also cheered on Warren\u2019s call to break up the tech giants. On \u201cThe Donald,\u201d the leading pro-Trump forum on Reddit, posters praised the senator\u2019s proposal\u2014in part because they expected that it would alienate Democrats from wealthy Silicon Valley donors.\n\n\u201cWatch Google and Amazons political ideologies change overnight,\u201d predicted one post that received more than 1,000 votes in support.\n\nWarren\u2019s goal is hardly to alienate Big Tech from the Democratic Party, though she most likely will not win plaudits in Silicon Valley for the argument that Facebook, Amazon and Google had \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat had two specific prescriptions for ending what she viewed as the monopoly these companies enjoyed. The first was to pass legislation that would designate a new category for large companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more that \u201coffer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties.\u201d Warren proposes that those companies be classified as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d and be prohibited from both owning the platform and any of its participants. Additionally, under her plan, the utilities would have to \u201cmeet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users,\u201d and they would not be allowed to share or transfer data to third parties. Warren suggested that the Amazon Marketplace, Google\u2019s ad exchange, and Google Search would turn into platform utilities.\n\nThe second aspect Warren suggested was appointing regulators to undo recent mergers like Amazon\u2019s ownership of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook\u2019s ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google\u2019s ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.\n\n\u201cWe have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth,\u201d Warren declared at a boisterous rally in Queens on Friday night, where Amazon had intended building half of its second headquarters before folding in the face of local and national resistance. \u201cThey think they can come to towns, cities, states and bully everyone into doing what they want.\u201d\n\nThough Warren\u2019s regulatory agenda has long been an object of ridicule for conservatives, many flocked to her call to break up the tech giants, which they view with increasing suspicion. In particular, conservatives have grown increasingly convinced that social media companies are engaged in a pattern of shadow and even overt censorship of their viewpoints\u2014through algorithmic changes to user feeds and even outright bans from the platforms.\n\nHot points have included the banning of right-wing provocateurs and a short-lived Twitter prohibition on a campaign ad from then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). Last year, pro-Trump commentators \u201cDiamond & Silk\u201d appeared at a congressional hearing to allege that Facebook was \u201cshadow-banning\u201d conservatives on social media to reduce their visibility.\n\nThose tensions have prompted more calls from the right for the tech giants to be broken up. In 2017, conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter called for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to assign Justice Department attorneys to \u201cbreaking up these enormous, bloated, anti-competitive conglomerates.\u201d And in language reminiscent of Warren\u2019s own progressive rhetoric, National Review writer Victor Davis Hanson has called the tech founders the \u201cnew robber barons.\u201d\n\nSarah Miller, deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, which advocates against corporate concentration and monopoly power, said that it was not surprising to find Republicans and Democrats agreeing about the pernicious effects of tech companies becoming more and more monopolistic.\n\n\u201cThese corporations becoming more and more like private governments is just becoming more apparent to people on both sides of the aisle who are in democratically elected government,\u201d Miller told The Daily Beast, adding that part of their advocacy is centered on pushing the Federal Trade Commission to take more action.\n\nWith a growing conservative appetite for a proposal now being championed by a leading Democratic presidential candidate, President Trump could find himself in an odd position: forced to tiptoe around a signature policy of a lawmaker at which he\u2019s directed racist attacks. On Monday, that tiptoeing began. In an interview with Breitbart, the president called Warren\u2019s proposal \u201cfunny\u201d because of tech leaders\u2019 traditional support for Democrats.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny? Elizabeth Warren called for their total breakup,\u201d he said. \u201cI do smile, though, they\u2019re so protective of her.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sam Stein and Lachlan Markay contributed reporting", "description": "The senator is targeting Facebook, Google, and Amazon.
