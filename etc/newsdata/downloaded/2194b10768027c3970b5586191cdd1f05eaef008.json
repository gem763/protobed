A weaker-than-expected survey of U.S. manufacturing was the latest blow to those long crude Monday, echoing similarly bleak surveys from around the world.\n\n{8849|U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude}} was down 66 cents, or 1.2%, at $53.41 per barrel by 1:50 PM ET (17:50 GMT).\n\nslid 48 cents, or 0.8%, to $58.77.\n\n\u201c is not only back to the range of August, but it is also back near the lows of the range,\u201d said Olivier Jakob of Zug, Switzerland-based oil risk consultancy PetroMatrix.\n\nThe market has fallen without pause since the last settlement higher on Sept. 23, losing 9% in that stretch.\n\nPrices slumped for a sixth day in a row after The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s posted its lowest reading in 10 years, falling to 47.8 in September and disappointing consensus forecasts of a rebound above 50.\n\nEarlier in the day, similar surveys from Japan to the euro zone and U.K. had also painted a picture of a global manufacturing sector still suffering from the fallout of the U.S.-China trade conflict, Brexit and other concerns.\n\nEven data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration has been working against oil bulls lately.\n\nThe EIA released its July tally for oil products on Monday, showing demand picked up by a modest 0.3%, or 60,000 barrels per day, versus a year ago.\n\nBut within that, gasoline sales were down 1.6% year on year (or 156,000 bpd) and distillates fell -1.4% (56,000 bpd). While jet fuel demand was stronger, and the rest of demand growth came from less visible products such as LPG (up 2.1%), fuel oil, asphalt or petroleum coke. Demand for gasoline was at the lowest level for the month of July since 2015.\n\nJakob of PetroMatrix particularly noted that crude production at 11.806 million bpd was 900,000 more than a year ago.\n\nProduction in North Dakota, one of the states forming the mammoth Bakken shale oil play, itself reached record highs in July.\n\nTotal U.S. petroleum stocks in July were 100 million barrels above last year, although overall U.S. output was 276,000 bpd less than in June.\n\n\u201cBehind the headline number, it is important to note that most of the drop was due to weather impact on offshore Gulf of Mexico,\u201d Jakob added.\n\nThe EIA will release next its weekly dataset on , and slotted at 10:30 AM ET on Wednesday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com are projecting a 1.1 million bpd build for crude for the week ended Sept. 27, that will add to the previous tally of nearly 3.5 million barrels over the past two weeks.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, will issue its own snapshot at 4:30 PM ET today on what the EIA numbers are likely to be.", "description": "Oil Down for 6th Day; Weekly Crude Build Awaited", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAB10O6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
