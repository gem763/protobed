He\u2019s very serious in all the things he does, but very funny in the dressing room.\n\n\u201cIn a game like this with MK Dons, for example, you go there and play with five kids and six first-teamers. The others didn\u2019t even travel.\n\n\u201cThere could be kind of a feeling that \u2018oh, we play MK Dons, thank you very much boss!\u2019 But there was no chance of that with James, or with Adam Lallana, or Hendo if he would have been there. From the first moment; if we are here, we give our everything.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a role model for the young boys. Not only the young boys actually. He\u2019s had an exceptional career so far and he looks like he has a few more years in the locker.\n\n\u201cContract situations, we don\u2019t talk about here. But we are really happy to have him.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMilner will also feel that he does have \u201ca few more years\u201d left in him, with there no indication that he is about to start slowing down as he closes in on the 200-appearance mark for Liverpool.", "description": "The versatile 33-year-old remains an important part of the first-team plans at Anfield and may be offered the chance to extend his spell on Merseyside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GT74oA27jPP_bVTpyUVPpQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/55sGNvH8ZpyaUTqJLzgobg--~B/aD0xMzExO3c9MjMyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/a665eedc7060a7a4216c9346fb324ae2", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
