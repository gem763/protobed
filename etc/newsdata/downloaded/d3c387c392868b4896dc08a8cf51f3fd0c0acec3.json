Cain Dingle's mystery ex-lover REVEALED", "language": "en", "text": "Emmerdale viewers were left stunned this week when farmhand Nate Robinson revealed that he was Cain Dingle's secret son.\n\nHowever, Thursday\u2019s double bill revealed the identity of Nate\u2019s mother as Cara Robinson, who had been a former fling of Cain\u2019s 20 years ago.\n\nBut, as Faith Dingle revealed a huge secret to her son surrounding the paternity bombshell, viewers at home spotted a major bombshell.\n\nBombshell: Thursday\u2019s double bill of Emmerdale revealed the identity of Nate\u2019s mother as Cara Robinson, who had been a former fling of Cain\u2019s 20 years ago\n\nThe episode saw Cain visit Nate in hospital following the boat explosion, determined to get answers following Nate\u2019s revelation.\n\nThere, Nate revealed that his mum was Cain\u2019s ex-girlfriend Cara Robinson, whom the mechanic had been seeing 20 years earlier, before he had appeared in the Dales.\n\nHowever, Cain was left perplexed about the situation, insisting that Cara suddenly disappeared and he hadn\u2019t seen her since.\n\nBut Nate argued back that Cara had sent Cain several letters telling him about his son, and even turned up at Dingle home to show him pictures of his son, but was sent away.\n\nNot adding up: But, as Faith Dingle revealed a huge secret to her son surrounding the paternity bombshell, viewers at home spotted a major bombshell\n\nAs Cain continued to insist he knew nothing of having a son, his mum Faith turned up and revealed the truth.\n\nShe told the boys that she had intercepted Cara\u2019s letters and sent her away when she visited as her then husband Shadrach Dingle was racist and would\u2019ve harmed Cara and the baby.\n\nShe said: \u2018Her plan was to stay with you and raise the baby, but I made her see it was never going to be an option. It would never have worked out, with a mixed-race kid, Shadrach... it would have killed you both, you must see that.\u2019\n\nHowever, Emmerdale viewers spotted a major plot hole as Faith had walked out on Cain and Chasity when they were both kids, having no contact since.\n\nA flashback episode in 2017 confirmed that Faith left when they were young, so couldn\u2019t have been around when Cain, who is around 45 years old, got Cara pregnant 20 years ago.\n\nError: Emmerdale viewers spotted a major plot hole as Faith had walked out on Cain and Chasity when they were both kids, having no contact since\n\nTaking to Twitter, fans were quick to call out the error as they speculated that Faith can\u2019t have been around when Nate was born.\n\nOne viewer tweeted: \u2018Faith walked out on Chas & Cain as kids right? So how did she even know about Cara? #Emmerdale.\u2019\n\nWhile another remarked: \u2018And Faith allegedly left Cain and Chas when they were kids according to the flashback episode we watched a few years ago, so how did she chase Cara and destroy her letters to Cain when Nate was born? Unless Cain was a kid when it happened. #Emmerdale.\u2019\n\nPaternity shock: Previous to the reveal of Cara, fans of the ITV soap had been desperately trying to work out the identity of Nate's mum, with several theories circulating on Twitter\n\n\u2018Can someone help explain the Faith and Nate stuff? Didn\u2019t she walk out on the family when Chas and Cain were kids? How did she know all about Cara? #answersonapostcard #Emmerdale\u2019 asked a third.\n\nA fourth watcher questioned: \u2018I thought Cain & Chas had no contact with Faith as they were growing up, so how could Faith be involved with Cara & Cain? Plot hole. #emmerdale.\u2019\n\nWith another adding: \u2018As a hardcore #emmerdale fan. Must say I don\u2019t understand - didn\u2019t Faith abandon Cain & Chas when they were kids? Not when they were 20...and how much older is Nate than Debbie. My head hurts.\u2019\n\nPrevious to the reveal of Cara, fans of the ITV soap had been desperately trying to work out the identity of Nate's mum, with several theories circulating on Twitter.\n\nOne wild theory was that Faith could actually be Nate's mother, with Cain not being his father after all.\n\nAfter Faith broke into Nate's caravan and discovered an old picture, she fell to the floor in shock, leading viewers to speculate whether she had a close connection with Nate.\n\nMum's the word? One wild theory was that Faith could actually be Nate's mother, with Cain not being his father after all\n\nOne person shared: 'Why was Faith acting so sketchy is she Nate\u2019s mum or something #Emmerdale.'\n\nWhile another shared: 'PLOT TWIST!!! Is Faith actually Nate\u2019s mum? Why else would she really leave? Everyone predicted Cain being Nate\u2019s dad months ago, maybe this is the shocking twist?!'\n\nWith a third speculating: 'I have this strong feeling that Faith is Nate's mum.. by the look on her face. #Emmerdale.'\n\nHowever, others suspected that she was shocked as she knew who Nate's mum was and knew the connection but kept the truth secret from Cain - a theory that later turned out to be true.\n\nOne viewer declared: 'Calling it now. Faith knew Nate's mum was expecting him but Cain didn't. Faith was involved in hiding this. #emmerdale #mumthinkssheknowsbest\n\nSecrets and lies: However, others suspect that she was shocked as she knew who Nate's mum was and knew the connection but kept the truth secret from Cain - which turned out to be true\n\nWhile an second mused: 'Theory: I think Faith knew whoever Nate\u2019s mum is, was pregnant with his baby and forced her to keep it from him or give it up for adoption. So when Cain finds out he goes mad at Faith thus setting up for Faith exit......#emmerdale.'\n\nAnother name that had been doing the rounds was former Emmerdale character Latisha Daggert, who Cain had a fling with in the early 90's.\n\nWhile some had suspected Angie Reynolds, whom Cain also had a fleeting romance with around the same time as Latisha.\n\nBaby mother? Latisha Daggert was suspected to be Nate's mum\n\nFormer lover: Angie Reynolds was also thrown into the mix\n\nSpeculation: Another name that had been doing the rounds was former Emmerdale character Latisha Daggert, who Cain had a fling with in the early 90's, while some said Angie Reynolds\n\n'Is Nate really Kirk, Latisha's son or was Latisha pregnant with Cain's baby when she left #Emmerdale,' questioned one watcher.\n\nWith another asking: 'Hang on, could Nate's mum be Latisha Daggert??'\n\nAnd another fan speculating: 'Dates fit, as Angie left under mysterious circumstances in 1999, fast forward 20 years, when Nate is 20, and its 2019.'\n\nBut with the truth now out, what is next for Cain and Nate? And will Cara make her grand entrance to rock Cain's life once again?\n\nEmmerdale continues weekdays at 7pm on ITV.", "description": "Emmerdale: Who is Nate Robinson's mum?
