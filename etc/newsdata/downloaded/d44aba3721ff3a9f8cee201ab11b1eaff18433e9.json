Some 60 laws relating to secrecy have been passed in the past two decades.\n\nABC Managing Director David Anderson warned that \u201cAustralia is at risk of becoming the world\u2019s most secretive democracy.\u201d The Australian media argue the government is trying to penalize whistleblowing, criminalize journalism, and infringe upon the public\u2019s right to know.\n\nThe protest comes after a series of high-profile raids on the offices of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the home of a News Corp Australia journalist following the publication of articles detailing alleged war crimes and domestic spying carried out by the government.\n\nAlso on rt.com Australian feds raid broadcaster\u2019s office over Afghan war crime stories\n\nThree journalists may face prosecution following the raids for their part in the whistleblower articles\u2019 publication.\n\nDuring these press investigations, it was revealed that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service had bugged the offices of Timor-Leste officials during a multimillion-dollar resource negotiation in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian Tax Office whistleblower Richard Boyle is facing up to 161 years in prison for revealing abuse of powers by the Australian tax authority apparatus.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said that while press freedom was important, it is still subject to the rule of law, adding that \u201cno one was above the law.\u201d\n\nThat includes me, or any journalist, or anyone else.\n\nA press freedom inquiry is under way, the findings of which will be revealed in parliament next year. The media are fighting for the right to challenge government applications for warrants against journalists, while calling for freedom of information and defamation law reform, and the introduction of special protections for journalists and public sector whistleblowers.\n\nA free media & protection for whistleblowers to speak truth to power are essential for a robust & healthy democracy.\n\nA Government obsessed with secrecy is a Govt that doesn\u2019t deserve the trust of the people. An attack on media freedom is an attack on all Australians #righttoknowpic.twitter.com/eKauOG8ts8 \u2014 Sarah Hanson-Young\ud83d\udc9a (@sarahinthesen8) October 21, 2019\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
