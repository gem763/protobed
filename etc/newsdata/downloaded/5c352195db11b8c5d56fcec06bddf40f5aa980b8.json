He was sacked three times by the Cowboys, who entered the game with just two sacks in their first two games.\n\nThe Cowboys (3-0) got on the scoreboard on their first possession on a 28-yard field goal by Brett Maher. Dallas added to its lead via a 5-yard touchdown pass from Prescott to Cooper with 5:57 to play in the first quarter.\n\nBut the rest of the half belonged to the Dolphins, who had been outscored in their first two games by a combined score of 102-10.\n\nMiami clawed back to within 10-6 at halftime, first driving 72 yards in 10 plays to a field goal by Jason Sanders with 58 seconds remaining in the first quarter.
