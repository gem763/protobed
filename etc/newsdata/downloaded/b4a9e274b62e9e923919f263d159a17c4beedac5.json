He wisely marshaled his sound \u2014 which is on the light side of the \u201cOtello\u201d spectrum \u2014 especially in convincingly showing the character\u2019s crescendo into jealousy, his voice shining with the bright ping of fury, and in caressing the quieter moments with dignity. He did himself proud.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t an evening for the ages, that was partly a result of the incomplete mingling of the several elements that comprise an opera. Daniele Callegari was a strong conductor, understanding some of the forward propulsion, verbal sensitivity and passion that circulate like life\u2019s blood through Verdi\u2019s music and keep it, after more than a century, vivid and alive. The singers were reasonably cast, and able to follow him while offering more or less convincing portrayals. David Alden\u2019s production, though, lay on the side of the plate like a piece of gristly meat, tough and gray, casting something of a pall over things.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI am a huge fan and defender of interpretive stage direction when it works, but there is a kind of default area. Alden\u2019s staging, taken over from the English National Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera and the Teatro Real in Madrid, falls into the muddy isn\u2019t-it-all-bleak school of direction with costumes dark and stage bare. The set was shabby and starkly lit so that the characters\u2019 menacing shadows on the wall acted like alter egos. The whole thing took place somewhat arbitrarily in the late 19th or early 20th century, with the soldiers in olive-drab uniforms; Desdemona\u2019s maid Emilia (the ever-reliable Deborah Nansteel) attired like a kind of Mary Poppins; Lodovico (Wei Wu), dwarfed and somewhat muted by an improbable stovepipe hat; and Rodrigo (Alexander McKissick, who, like the two others mentioned, is an alumnus of WNO\u2019s Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program) as an early incarnation of Leisure Suit Larry, topped with a white fedora.\n\nSometimes a historical updating issues an invitation or challenge to think about how the change in time and place affects the plot. But this production, from the first scene when the chorus lurched across the stage like shifting waves \u2014 because of course that\u2019s how you stand on the shore and watch a storm \u2014 wasn\u2019t interesting enough to make me want to work out the riddle. The music and story were so much stronger than this telling of it that they were what drew my attention, even dimmed as they were by the dull gauze of this setting. (The chorus extolling Desdemona\u2019s beauty happening offstage? All the romantic moments staged as drably as possible? Whatever.)\n\nThe cast all did perfectly well, however, even under these circumstances. Leah Crocetto has a sweet, large voice without a lot of lower heft, making her perfect for Desdemona, one of the lighter Verdi roles, especially when she uncorked some muscle at one climax of her lengthy final-act \u201cWillow Song,\u201d throwing herself into Emilia\u2019s arms in what turned out to be the most moving interaction of the night.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere were also two respectable debuts. George Gagnidze was a solid baritone who powered out the role of Iago, arguably opera\u2019s greatest villain, with a lot of foggy sound that took a while to warm up and focus on individual notes, but that was perfectly operatic and effective. And Zach Borichevsky was appropriately handsome and lighthearted as Cassio, the captain who unwittingly becomes the target of Otello\u2019s jealousy, with an agreeable tenor sound that brought some light into the dark evening.\n\nWhen Alden\u2019s production opened at WNO in 2014, Otello was white, since darkening a singer\u2019s face with makeup is well known as blackface, a tradition people no longer want to perpetuate. Perhaps for this reason, the production made a point of underlining the character\u2019s isolation in ways that became a little over-obvious when the singer is African American \u2014 having the crowd shy away from him, even in the opening scene at what should be the moment of his greatest triumph. But this sense of isolation does explain the character\u2019s reliance on Iago, the only person who tries so hard to get close to him; in this production, they become blood brothers, sealing their bond with an inevitable (in this kind of production) slash of red blood wiped across each other\u2019s faces.\n\nThe main interest of the evening was Thomas\u2019s performance, since hearing a new credible Otello is always an event \u2014 almost a sporting event, as one waits to hear how he fares at each hurdle the score places for him. Thomas met each hurdle with aplomb, through to the final anguished \u201cNiun mi tema.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t the most heart-rending Otello I\u2019ve heard, it was certainly an admirable one \u2014 which in this role is saying quite a lot.\n\nOtello continues through Nov. 16 at the Washington National Opera.\n\nAD", "description": "A gray David Alden production can\u2019t entirely dim the luster of the music.", "authors": ["Anne Midgette", "Classical Music Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_w7UYur-RobyqxRetgJDd1i8Bic=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTBWRQXXNQI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
