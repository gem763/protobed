The company recreated the incident at another facility and used the data to create a new system for Crew Dragon's thrusters, which SpaceX has been testing alongside NASA.\n\nThe two space leaders met on Thursday after Bridenstine toured SpaceX's facility, focusing on the Crew Dragon capsule that the company is building to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Bridenstine has recently added pressure on Musk and his team to safely yet quickly deliver on the government's investment in SpaceX, as the company won a $2.6 billion contract in 2014 for NASA's Commercial Crew program.\n\nCommercial Crew is NASA's solution to once again launch U.S. astronauts from U.S. soil. Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, astronauts have flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft \u2014 at a cost to NASA of more than $70 million per seat.\n\nThe first launches for the program have been pushed back from 2017 as delays mounted for SpaceX and Boeing, which also won $4.2 billion to build its own capsule for Commercial Crew. The most recent schedule update for the program was five months ago, in part because Bridenstine removed NASA's former leader of human spaceflight Bill Gerstenmaier from his role in July. The administrator said NASA needed more urgency in address inflating costs and delayed schedules for its key exploration programs.\n\nIn the meantime, Bridenstine has publicly pressured SpaceX to deliver on its side of the contract. In a statement the day before Musk gave a highly-anticipated update on the company's next-generation rocket called Starship, Bridenstine said \"NASA expects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer.\" While Bridenstine said he was \"looking forward to the SpaceX announcement,\" he emphasized that \"Commercial Crew is years behind schedule,\" adding that \"it's time to deliver.\"\n\nAlthough Bridenstine's statement spoke about Commercial Crew, he did not mention Boeing at the time, which is also behind schedule. Asked by The Atlantic whether he was singling out SpaceX, Bridenstine noted that he has \"been critical of all contractors that overpromise and underdeliver.\"\n\nDuring the Starship presentation, Musk responded to Bridenstine.\n\n\"From a SpaceX resource standpoint, our resources are overwhelmingly on Falcon and Dragon. Let's be clear, it was really quite a small percentage of SpaceX that did Starship,\" Musk said, noting that he believes less than 5% of the company's total workforce had been working on the new rocket.\n\nWhile Musk has said SpaceX will be ready for its next milestone, known as an inflight abort test, in about 10 weeks, Bridenstine has remained skeptical. Testing the updates to Crew Dragon following the explosion, as well as capsule's parachute systems, will take at least three more months, Bridenstine estimated.", "description": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine spoke during a media briefing at SpaceX headquarters.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105781212-155199281290447205297202_e808222c86_k.jpg?v=1551993089", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
