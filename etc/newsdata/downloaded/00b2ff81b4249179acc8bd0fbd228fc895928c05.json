A rugby drug if ever there was one.\"\n\nThe Stuff.co.nz website published a photo highlighting the All Blacks' guard of honour for retiring Ireland legend Rory Best while rugby correspondent Richard Knowler said the win was \"superb\".\n\n\"They made Ireland's defensive line, which is organised by Andy Farrell, look like it had been organised over a few pints and a game of darts,\" Knowler said.\n\n\"Cross-kicks, pop passes in the tackle, transfers quickly off the grass and runners tearing in on angles. It was designed to get in behind the rush defence, to put Ireland into the outhouse.\n\n\"It will also have England coach Eddie Jones demanding his analysts issue footage on every try and line break ahead of the semi-final. Here's the tip: those guys are in a for a big shift because the All Blacks gave them plenty to get their teeth into.\"\n\nHerald correspondent Liam Napier said the All Blacks at their peak possessed better and faster basic skills than any other side and \"their catch, pass, cleanout, ball protection, carry, tackle tonight were all supreme\".\n\nPatrick Mckendry, in the Herald, described the All Blacks victory as \"a remarkable performance\" and added that England coach Jones \"is likely to have been as impressed as everyone else\".\n\nOn Radio New Zealand, Matt Chatterton rated the All Blacks \"fast, offloads, excellent under the high ball, ruthless\" while Ireland were \"kicking off the mark, always on the back foot, monstered by NZ's forward pack\".", "description": "The All Blacks were hailed as playing rugby the way \"the gods want\" as New Zealand celebrated an overwhelming victory against Ireland in the World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2566/a7255c2dfc7c41c19fce34703c464f99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
