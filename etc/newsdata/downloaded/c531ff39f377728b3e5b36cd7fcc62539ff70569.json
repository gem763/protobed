Next month, she\u2019ll tee off in the first stage of the Ladies\u2019 European Tour\u2019s Qualifying School.\n\nSuddenly, South African women\u2019s golf has two bright young professionals not only eager to make their mark, but with the confidence of expecting to do so, following in the steps of Nobuhle Dlamini, Lee-Anne Pace, Ashleigh Buhai, Stacy Bregman and others in the pro ranks.\n\n\u201cI think women\u2019s golf talent in South Africa has come through in stages. Recently, we had Ashleigh Buhai and Lee-Anne Pace, and that group of players. We\u2019ve had a bit of a lull and age gap now. But hopefully we can start a new era of good players representing South Africa on tour,\u201d said Gorlei.\n\nShe recently made an attempt at an LPGA Tour card. She made it through the first cut in the first stage of the qualifying school, but then shot 79 in the final round to miss progressing to the second stage.\n\n\u201cI was the only South African to make the first cut. My game is in good shape and I know that, if I try again, I\u2019ll make it. In my time in the US, I learnt a lot about playing other tours. I learnt to trust the belief other people have in me. Once I was over there and started doing well, I kind of surprised myself. It boosted my confidence a lot. I learnt that if I just put in the hard work, I would definitely make it.\n\n\u201cMy University of Arkansas coach, Shauna Taylor, played a lot on tour and she has been telling me to just believe in myself and I will win out there. On the college golf scene, you play against the top amateurs in the world on some of the top courses in the world. You have the best coaches and facilities and you just learn so much. I feel if I didn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t be so confident to go on to the tour right now.\u201d\n\nHall has similar aspirations. \u201cI\u2019ve been working towards going to the Ladies European Tour Qualifying School with the confidence to know that, when I go there, I can very well secure a card.\n\n\u201cThe biggest change in my game has been mental. I\u2019ve basically got the mind-set that anything the golf course throws at me I can handle.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that this next generation of professionals is entering the arena with their own very high expectations of performing at the highest level.", "description": "It took a four-year golf scholarship at the University of Arkansas in the US to convince Cara Gorlei that she not only had it in her to become a top player, but was also part of a new generation of South African woman golfers ready to fly the country", "authors": ["Michael Vlismas"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/5a3bb96cff1a4298956c846b3511baf4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
