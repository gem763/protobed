It surfaced for the first time in Asia more than a year ago in China, and has now spread to over 50 countries, according to the World Organization of Animal Health - including those that account for 75 per cent of global pork production.\n\n\"Here's a major packer that says ASF is important enough that we're going to get in a position to serve that market,\" said Steve Meyer, economist for US commodity firm Kerns and Associates.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nJBS USA, owned by Brazil's JBS, said it removed ractopamine from internally owned production systems in August 2018. Now the company will also prohibit the drug from diets of hogs owned by farmers who sell livestock to JBS USA.\n\nThe Colorado-based JBS unit sells pork under brands including Swift and Swift Premium.\n\n\"Early on, basically JBS said, 'You guys chase that export stuff. We're going to serve the domestic market',\" Mr Meyer said. \"It's pretty much an about face on that.\"\n\nRival US pork producer Smithfield Foods, which is owned by China's WH Group, already raises all of the hogs on its company-owned and contract farms without the drug.\n\nTyson Foods previously told Reuters it was looking at diversifying its pork supply to include ractopamine-free hogs as demand expands.\n\n\"We are confident this decision will provide long-term benefits to our producer partners and our industry by ensuring US pork products are able to compete fairly in the international marketplace,\" JBS USA said in an emailed statement.\n\nRactopamine is used in some countries to raise leaner pigs, but China does not allow its use or tolerate residues in imported meat. The European Union also bans ractopamine.\n\nElanco Animal Health, the manufacturer of Paylean, its brand name for a ractopamine feed ingredient, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing blocked pork imports from a Canadian company this summer because China's customs agency said a shipment contained ractopamine.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [CHICAGO] JBS USA will remove a growth drug banned by Beijing from its US hog supply, the company said on Friday, accelerating the competition for pork exports as China grapples with a devastating pig disease. .
