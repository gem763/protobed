(Google Street View)\n\nGarza has nicknamed the bear Cheeseburger \"just because of all the good food he's been trying to get.\"\n\n\"He loves this grease trap back there,\" Garza said, referring to the restaurant's dumpster. \"He loves just rubbing up against that.\"\n\nAnd it's a snack the bear was after at the Bud Depot too. Garza confirmed it wasn't trying to score the shop's weed supply.\n\n\"I imagine he could probably smell something from the shop, but as far as the dumpster goes, we don't have any cannabis products in there.\"\n\nThe animal ran off, but Garza says he's spotted another bear, or possibly the same one, once more since the dumpster incident.\n\nLocal wildlife officials say they are keeping an eye out for more.\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
