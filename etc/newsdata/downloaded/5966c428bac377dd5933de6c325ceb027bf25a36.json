The Netherlands move to six points from three games and next face bottom side Estonia.\n\nIt was a winning return to Hamburg for Dutch coach Ronald Koeman, who won in the port city against the Germans as a player during Euro\u2019 88, and a clear mark of his team\u2019s improvement after they failed to reach the last two major tournaments.\n\n\u201cI told my players (at halftime) to stay in the game, not to give them so much space, control the ball better,\u201d Koeman told reporters. \u201cThat we should just keep going and we would get our chances. In the second half the Germans looked more tired and we benefited from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall we worked harder than Germany for this victory,\u201d he said.\n\nJoachim Loew\u2019s Germany side, undergoing their own overhaul after a disappointing 2018 World Cup first round exit and Nations League relegation, got off to a good start with Gnabry scoring on the rebound in the ninth minute.\n\nThere was little to be seen in terms of attacks from the Netherlands but that changed after the break.\n\nDUTCH FIGHTBACK\n\nThey turned the game around within seven minutes, first scoring through De Jong in the 59th and then taking the lead courtesy of Tah\u2019s unfortunate own goal.\n\nThe Germans, missing several injured players, including Leroy Sane and Leon Goretzka, were struggling with the Dutch pace down the wings and were lucky to level with a 73rd minute Kroos penalty after Matthijs de Ligt accidentally handled.\n\nThere is no video replay for referees in the qualifiers.\n\nThe visitors got revenge for their 3-2 loss in Amsterdam in March, striking through debutant Malen in the 79th after a quick combination left the German defence frozen.\n\nWijnaldum completed the victory in stoppage time and ended Germany\u2019s 14-match winning run in World Cup and Euro qualifiers.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\n\u201cWe played below our skill level and abilities,\u201d Loew told reporters. \u201cThe Dutch were the better team and we deserved to lose. We went ahead but I never had the feeling that we were in control of the game.\n\n\u201cThe Dutch kept pressing and then we ended up playing high balls. That is not how we had planned to play. We will now need to analyse this game and draw our conclusions,\u201d\n\nBelarus earned a stoppage time 2-1 win at Estonia to claim their first points in the other game in the group on Friday.", "description": "Netherlands scored four times in 32 second-half minutes to secure a remarkable 4-2 comeback victory against hosts Germany in their Euro 2020 Group C qualifier on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427056454&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851ZZ", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
