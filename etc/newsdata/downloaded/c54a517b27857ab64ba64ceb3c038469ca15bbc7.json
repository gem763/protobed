Instead, let\u2019s give the life they contain the respect it deserves.\u201d\n\nOne of the most obvious risks is the opening up of the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and northwest Pacific. There is a massive amount of interest in using this as a commercial route for shipping from a number of countries that border the Atlantic and Pacific.\n\nIn 2018, M\u00e6rsk \u2013 which is the largest shipping container in the world \u2013 sent a container ship through Russia\u2019s Northern Sea Route for the first time, reducing the time it took to get between Vladivostok and St Petersburg by 40 per cent.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They found more than half were at risk from ships crashing into their territory.\n\nNarwhals, for example, are pretty inflexible in where they spend their summer and at the moment they are smack bang in the middle of trade shipping routes. They also rely on sound and are notoriously skittish to any kind of disturbance.\n\nAs trade routes and resource extraction swells, oil spills pose another huge threat to polar regions.\n\nAn example is the Exxon Valdez oil tanker which struck reef off the coast of Alaska, spilling around 750,000 barrels of oil in 1989.\n\nMore than 1,200 miles of coastline was spoiled \u2013 immediately killing 2,000 sea otters, 300 harbour seals and 250,000 seabirds.\n\nIt was one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters in the world. Oil takes a long time to clear up in cold water and the extreme conditions meant mounting a formal clean-up response was extremely difficult.\n\nAlthough Antarctica is not at risk from new trade routes, it could still be carved up like nations on every other landmass.\n\nFor six decades the Antarctic Treaty has suspended territorial claims and strengthened environmental protections of the continent. However, the treaty comes up for review in 2048.\n\nGlobal powers must make sure this is not another desperate story of resource extraction and environmental destruction.\n\nOur polar regions must not be for sale.", "description": "Ice in the Earth\u2019s polar regions is rapidly melting and pristine ecosystems are being pulled apart at the seam.\u00a0 Not only is this a sad story of vast environmental loss, ice melt is also opening up parts of the world that were previously inaccessible.\u00a0 Owners of cruise liners, trawlers and mining companies are licking their lips at the thought of exploiting its riches for", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/18/istock-902006618.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
