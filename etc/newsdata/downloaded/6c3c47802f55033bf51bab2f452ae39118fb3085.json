It showed off an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach anywhere in the U.S.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.\n\nMr. Trump frequently boasts about his tough stance on China, pointing to escalating tariffs amid a trade war and his demands for systemic changes in how the country does business.\n\nYet he\u2019s also cultivating a personal relationship with Mr. Xi. The president often goes out of his way to compliment Mr. Xi as a strong leader who drives a hard bargain, even as he slams China\u2019s economic practices in the same breath.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s offer of congratulations contrasted with his main 2020 message \u2014 he frequently slams his Democratic rivals as \u201csocialists\u201d \u2014 and statements from members of his own party, who noted that Hong Kong police used a live round on a pro-democracy protester for the first time.\n\n\u201cToday Chinese tyrants celebrated 70 years of communist oppression with their typically brutal symbolism: by sending a police officer to shoot a pro-democracy protester at point-blank range,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, said. \u201cThe freedom-seekers in Hong Kong mourn this anniversary, and the American people stand with them against those who deny their God-given dignity.\u201d\n\nHouse GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney said the anniversary is \u201cnot a day for celebration,\u201d pointing to the crackdown at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago and the Uighur Muslims who\u2019ve been placed in concentration camps in western China.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, also slammed China\u2019s celebrations.\n\n\u201cTo see the price of the PRC\u2019s anniversary celebration, look no further than what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong: a ceaseless war against those who wish to live in freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution to the camps in Xinjiang today, it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
