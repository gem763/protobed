He\u2019s fit and some of the other horses are not that fit yet,\u201d Ho said.", "description": "John Size is looking to snare his third consecutive Group Two Premier Bowl (1,200m) at Sha Tin on Sunday and heads into the race with three of the eight runners....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/19/f80460d8-f16f-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_160335.JPG?itok=xo-MFsYG&v=1571472222", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
