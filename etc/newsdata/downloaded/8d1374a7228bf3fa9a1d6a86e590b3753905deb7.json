Their list \u2014 which they are lobbying Democratic candidates to adopt \u2014 is wholly consumed by far-left activism and identity politics. They see the courts as their ticket to implementing their radical policy agenda, which includes gutting the First and Second Amendments, establishing a right to illegal immigration and abortion on demand straight through birth, and destroying our economy by imposing burdensome regulations on everyone from Main Street to Wall Street. And the newly published list neatly lines up with their radical policy agenda. For every specific policy goal that the extreme left wants to implement, Demand Justice has provided a name \u2014 or two or three \u2014 of an ultra-liberal lawyer who has made that cause a focus of his or her activism.\n\nDemand Justice has a different perspective on its list:\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump released a shortlist of possible Supreme Court picks, and it succeeded in rallying conservative voters to his side. In 2020, the Democratic candidates running for president should also state what kind of justices they would appoint. Doing so would show their commitment to the Supreme Court as an issue and draw a clear line in the sand about what is at stake in the coming election. To prod the candidates, Demand Justice is releasing its own Supreme Court shortlist of possible nominees in the next Democratic administration. Our list is made up of brilliant lawyers who have spent their careers fighting for progressive values and represent the diversity of our nation. In releasing this list, we also hope to make clear that the next Democratic president ought to approach the task of nominating judges with a new playbook\u2013\u2013one that prioritizes unabashedly progressive lawyers and legal thinkers, who have all too often been pushed aside. None of the lawyers on our list are corporate lawyers, in keeping with our call for the next president to avoid nominating any more lawyers who have been partners at corporate law firms or in-house counsel at large corporations. Instead, our list boasts wide range of former public defenders, public interest lawyers, academics, and plaintiff\u2019s lawyers.\n\nHere are more details about some of the figures on the SCOTUS short list:\n\n\u2022 Pro-abortion activist Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Her bio on the ACLU\u2019s website states: \u201cShe is currently litigating numerous cases, including leading the Jane Doe case, challenging the Trump administration\u2019s ban on abortion for unaccompanied immigrant minors. She also represents the last abortion clinic in Kentucky, including in a challenge to the 6-week abortion ban.\n\n\u2022 Xavier Becerra, attorney general of California. \u201cWhen he was a member of the House of Representatives, Becerra in 2003 voted no on the bill banning partial-birth abortions that ultimately was signed into law,\u201d Severino wrote.\n\n\u2022 NYU Law professor Melissa Murray is a self-proclaimed expert on \u201creproductive justice\u201d issues who testified against Brett Kavanaugh at his Senate confirmation hearing. Her bio states: Murray\u2019s award-winning research focuses on the legal regulation of intimate life and encompasses such topics as the regulation of sex and sexuality, marriage and its alternatives, the marriage equality debate, the legal recognition of caregiving, and reproductive rights and justice.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe Demand Justice list includes several individuals, such as Nina Perales and Thomas Saenz of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who have fought against legislation aimed at discouraging illegal immigration and sanctuary cities,\u201d Severino wrote.\n\n\u2022 Vanita Gupta is president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and has been involved in anti-Trump protests since his inauguration at prsident. She \u201cadvocated vigorously against the Trump administration\u2019s executive order that would have required a question about citizenship on the 2020 census. Gupta argued that inclusion of a citizenship question would \u201cweaponize\u201d the census,\u201d Severino wrote.\n\n\u2022 \u201cAlso on the list is Deepak Gupta, a former senior attorney for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has significantly increased the regulatory burden on everyday consumers since its inception nearly a decade ago,\u201d Severino wrote.\n\n\u2022 Goodwin Liu, former law professor, \u201cdisavows Originalism and textualism. Liu once said in an American Constitution Society podcast: \u201cthe Constitution should be interpreted in ways that adapt its principles and its text to the challenges and conditions of our society in every succeeding generation,\u201d Severino wrote.\n\n\u2022 \u201cMichelle Alexander, is more forthright in articulating the left\u2019s belief that its hope lies outside the democratic process: \u201cI no longer believe we can \u2018win\u2019 justice simply by filing lawsuits, flexing our political muscles or boosting voter turnout.\u201d\n\nSeverino said her post in National Review \u201conly scratches the surface\u201d on this effort from the left.\n\n\u201cBut make no mistake, these are the kinds of judges that Demand Justice and others on the extreme left want, not just on the Supreme Court, but also on the lower federal courts,\u201d Severino wrote. \u201cThese individuals are far-left ideologues who are out of touch with the mainstream.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "The far leftwing Demand Justice released its short list of activists they would like to see nominated to the United States Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/wi/ap/28/f8f804_supreme-court-abortion-38679-in-oct-10-2017-file-photo-supreme-court-in-washington-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
