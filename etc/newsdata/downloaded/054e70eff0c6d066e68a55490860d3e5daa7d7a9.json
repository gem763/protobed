The monument was proposed by an officer who had been on leave during the massacre, and was carved in a section of natural cliff in the 1820s.\n\nConquer Mount Pilatus\n\nMake your way up Lucerne\u2019s local mountain, Pilatus, to shout from its 2,128m high snow-covered top.

The name is derived from a former inmate whose wall painting can still be seen in one of the rooms. Choose from multi-bed rooms, singles, doubles and family rooms and get locked up in one of the 60 converted cells. Doubles from CHF82.50 (\u00a366), room only.\n\nLocated on Lake Lucerne with unobstructed views of the water and Mt Pilatus in the distance, Hotel Beau Sejour charms with an eclectic mix of old chandeliers and modern artworks on the walls.

The design oozes cool, featuring bare brick walls and off-beat lighting.\n\nWhere to drink in Lucerne\n\nSwitzerland might not be known for its beer but the Rathausbrauerei impresses with its self-brewed tipple which uses Pilatus spring water stemming from the oldest complex of springs in Lucerne. The zesty compositions are accompanied by sausage specialities made to local recipes by Lucerne butchers.\n\nClose to the Chapel Bridge, Blend Teehaus has rebranded as Pura, offering plant-based dishes, regional beer and wine and great coffee roasted in Lucerne by Cafe Tacuba.\n\nAfter the sun goes down, night owls and party lovers flock to Max Restaurant and Bar in the newer part of town for cocktails and entertainment. Try the house mix Gema, made from nine different spirits, and dance the night away to live music on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nWhere to shop in Lucerne\n\nNo trip to Switzerland is complete without trying its famous chocolate.
