The president stands credibly accused of felonies that have been pushed out of the public consciousness by the stories of his more recent misdeeds. Thankfully, crimes don\u2019t disappear when they stop being the lead story on cable news. Several criminal allegations against Trump remain unresolved \u2014 and their resolution should be central to impeachment proceedings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRemember Stormy Daniels? She hasn\u2019t been in the news recently, but that doesn\u2019t change a stunning fact: Trump knowingly participated in a felony criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws while in the Oval Office. The Justice Department says that \"Individual 1, Trump, directed the conspiracy. We have seen physical evidence in the form of checks signed by Trump himself. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is serving a prison term for carrying out the conspiracy at Trump\u2019s direction.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Mueller report. Remember that? The report deferred to the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s determination (however flawed) that a sitting president cannot be indicted. But it also pointed out that \u201ca criminal investigation during the President\u2019s term is permissible,\u201d implying that the only remedy for holding a president accountable for criminal behavior is impeachment.\n\nVolume II of the report identified 10 \u2014 count \u2018em, 10 \u2014 separate alleged instances of obstruction of justice. These range from the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey because of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump and Russia,\u201d to Trump\u2019s efforts to dismiss special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, to his efforts to prevent disclosures related to the infamous Trump Tower meeting. Each one of the alleged acts would count as a felony.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the report was published, a bipartisan group of more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors signed a letter stating that Trump would have been indicted on a charge of obstruction of justice if he were anyone but the president. The signatories include Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s former deputy when they served in the Reagan administration; a former senior counsel under Kenneth Starr who is a member of the staunchly conservative Federalist Society; and a former deputy attorney general who served under George W. Bush. Not exactly Birkenstock-clad Bernie bros.\n\n(Keep in mind that Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, former national security adviser, former personal lawyer and former foreign policy adviser are all convicted felons. And now there\u2019s reportedly an ongoing criminal investigation into his current personal lawyer, Giuliani, as well.)\n\nNext, there are Trump\u2019s ongoing violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which was intended to stop presidents from being swayed by foreign payments. Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his business interests has given foreign regimes significant sway over U.S. foreign policy. At least 22 foreign governments have funneled cash to Trump\u2019s businesses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWas Trump\u2019s calamitous decision to betray America\u2019s Kurdish allies by greenlighting Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria affected by what he called \u201ca little conflict of interest\u201d in the form of two Trump Towers in Istanbul? We will never know. But it\u2019s reckless to allow a president to govern when what is best for his wallet regularly clashes with what is best for the United States. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit breathed new life into an emoluments case, with a hearing scheduled for December.\n\nThere is no clause in the Constitution that allows presidents to commit crimes. If some of his abuses are not included in the eventual articles of impeachment, it sets the precedent that a future president can get away with similar conduct.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the right thing to do for principle or precedent; it\u2019s also smart politics. If the House of Representatives creates a laser-focused impeachment inquiry, Senate Republicans can try to dodge the beam. With any individual scandal, their dodges might work. But can they dodge all of them? Furthermore, a broader set of charges would allow moderate Republicans to vote to acquit on several charges, allowing them to save face by drawing distance between themselves and Democrats, while still voting to convict on at least one impeachment article.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd if Senate Republicans want to endorse all of Trump\u2019s allegedly criminal behavior with a full acquittal, at least it will forever stain their legacies in history.\n\nThe impeachment process should remind Americans \u2014 and Republicans in Congress \u2014 of all of Trump\u2019s crimes. Restricting the congressional indictment to only the most recent scandals would be a serious blunder.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Democrats are focused on the Ukraine inquiry.
