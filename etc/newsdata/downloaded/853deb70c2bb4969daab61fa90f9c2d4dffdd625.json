Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nHe had been briefly detained in Hong Kong by authorities immediately before his departure to Germany, apparently following a mistake related to his bail conditions.\n\nThe former student leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014 was one of several activists arrested in late August. The case was adjourned until November and he was released on HK$10,000 (\u00a31,045) bail.\n\nWong told the Berlin gathering he had been arrested eight times and held in detention for 100 days.\n\nIn a statement a spokeswoman for China\u2019s foreign ministry accused Berlin of interfering in the country\u2019s affairs.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely wrong for German media and politicians to attempt to tap into the anti-China separatist wave,\u201d Hua Chunying said at a press briefing on Tuesday, adding that the government \u201cstrongly disapproved\u201d of the meeting. \u201cIt is disrespectful towards China\u2019s sovereignty and an interference in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s foreign ministry rejected the criticism. A spokesman said it was normal for the foreign minister to \u201chold meetings with members of civil society and for the government to stand up for freedom of speech\u201d.\n\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who visited Beijing last week with an entourage of business leaders, said she had discussed the protests during her meetings with officials. She reportedly stressed to China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, on Friday that the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong \u201cmust be guaranteed\u201d.\n\nWong, who is due to address students and the public on Wednesday evening at the Humboldt University in Berlin before travelling to the US, said he planned to hold further talks with political leaders in Germany. There was no meeting scheduled with Merkel, according to her spokesman, Steffen Seibert.\n\nLast week, Wong made headlines in Germany after calling for two panda cubs, born last month to pandas at Berlin zoo who have been rented from the Chinese government, to be named \u201cDemocracy\u201d and \u201cFreedom\u201d, in order to \u201csend a very clear signal to China\u201d. A national campaign has called for the cubs to be called \u201cHong\u201d and \u201cKong\u201d.", "description": "Beijing criticises German foreign minister over meeting with Joshua Wong", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b49473a9004a6fb81d9aae59792da7fa56e08ae/0_78_5337_3203/master/5337.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1fb877a3dc65058a2b0db3e2717a397a", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
