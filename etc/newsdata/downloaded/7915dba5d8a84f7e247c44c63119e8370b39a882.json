The company resurrected its legendary dual-screen Courier concept as the Surface Neo, then it surprised the world by announcing a dual-screen Android phone. The company finally embraced the USB-C port on its new Surface Pro X, Surface Pro 7, and Surface Laptop 3, and it\u2019s even making them slightly upgradable, too.\n\nBut if you came wondering about the future of Windows, you might have left a bit confused.\n\nMicrosoft did announce a new streamlined version of Windows \u2014 dubbed Windows 10X \u2014 but it\u2019s only for dual-screen devices like the Surface Neo and with Intel processors inside. You won\u2019t be able to upgrade your PC to Windows 10X, and most of Microsoft\u2019s just-announced devices won\u2019t support it either.\n\nX doesn\u2019t necessarily mark the spot\n\nHeck, the new Surface Pro X tablet doesn\u2019t run Windows 10X, even though they\u2019ve both got that \u201cX\u201d in the name, and you might theoretically prefer a stripped-down Windows to go with its ARM-based chip. The upcoming Surface Duo phone also doesn\u2019t run Windows 10X, even though its dual-screen hardware looks almost exactly like a miniature Surface Neo. (See below.) It\u2019s using Android instead.\n\nWhile each of these decisions might seem confusing on their face, there may be good reasons behind each one \u2014 particularly, if it\u2019s true that Windows 10X isn\u2019t actually a new operating system at all.\n\nOfficially, Microsoft hasn\u2019t said anything of the sort \u2014 frankly, the company isn\u2019t talking about Windows 10X much at all \u2014 but here\u2019s everything we know for sure:\n\nHow an early build of Windows 10X works on the Surface Neo, with its intriguing WonderBar that can act as a tiny secondary monitor on demand.\n\nThat it\u2019ll ship in late 2020 on similar Intel-powered devices from Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\n\nThat it\u2019ll run \u201clegacy\u201d Win32 desktop apps, not just web apps and Windows Store ones, in a mysterious container tech that preserves battery life.\n\nThat the Start Menu is a smartphone-esque launcher now, and Live Tiles appear to be gone.\n\nIf we consult years of insider whispers about Microsoft\u2019s alleged internal strategy for Windows, many from The Verge\u2019s own Tom Warren, there\u2019s a simple reason why you shouldn\u2019t care whether Windows 10X ships on just a few devices or thousands. That\u2019s because Windows 10X is likely just a modular shell that gives the core Windows operating system a new user interface to do the tricks you see in these videos.\n\nAnd it all comes back to the philosophical question of what \u201cWindows\u201d really is now.\n\nMicrosoft may not think Windows is important anymore, but historically, the company has enjoyed saying it runs on all the things. Back in 2013, it told us that the Xbox One ran Windows. The doomed Surface RT ran Windows in 2012, the original HoloLens ran Windows in 2016, and there were quite a few Windows-based phones stretching back years.\n\nEach time, some Windows users called bullshit because those platforms didn\u2019t run traditional Windows desktop apps \u2014 or, in the case of Xbox, any apps at all for years. With the ill-fated Windows RT and Windows 8, they also demanded a Start Menu instead of the touch-centric Start Screen that replaced it.\n\nEach time, the UI or the app compatibility didn\u2019t match up to expectations. In the case of phones, you might have felt betrayed when Microsoft broke promises to upgrade Windows Phone devices to the next version of the OS twice in a row.\n\nEach time, it was true that these devices were running Windows (and not just because Windows is a brand Microsoft owns, and it could technically say a jelly donut contains Windows if it wants). If you asked Microsoft engineers about it at the time \u2014 and we did \u2014 they would always explain that each device shared more than a little of the same Windows backbone.\n\nBut it may soon become even truer that these devices are running the same Windows OS now that Windows is becoming a modular operating system.\n\nWe\u2019ll likely learn more about Windows Core in 2020\n\nAs Tom and fellow reporters have discovered, Microsoft has been building a new Windows Core OS (WCOS) that will serve as the new modular backbone of Windows. It can be paired with a different user interface for different types of displays by adapting what Microsoft\u2019s calling a Composable Shell, or CShell (say it out loud), to each new interface.\n\nGot a dual-screen device? It might run \u201cSantorini,\u201d the codename for Windows 10X so that it can flip and fold and slide into an array of configurations while intelligently repositioning your apps.\n\nSimilarly, the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset is said to be shipping with \u201cOasis\u201d to let you pin apps and objects in 3D space on top of Windows Core OS while the gigantic whiteboard-sized Surface Hub 2 may get \u201cAruba\u201d on top of WCOS in 2020 when its modular \u201c2X\u201d upgrade cartridge ships.\n\nThere\u2019s a thought that Windows Core OS could come to regular desktops and laptops with a \u201cPolaris\u201d shell, too, as well as a \u201cGameCore\u201d for Xbox Scarlett, though some believe Microsoft may have abandoned Polaris in favor of sticking with standard Windows 10 for traditional PCs.\n\nWindows 10X is more exciting than any of these, of course, because it\u2019s flashy and new. We already had a HoloLens, an Xbox, a giant Surface Hub, and ways to control each of them. For those, it sounds like Microsoft is largely just porting over the same UI concepts to the new Windows Core OS backbone, whereas Windows 10X gives us neat new tricks like the WonderBar, too.\n\nIn 2015, Microsoft called Windows 10 the last version of Windows because Windows is becoming a more nebulous concept than versions like \u201cWindows 8\u201d and \u201cWindows 10\u201d really let on. When the company says something like \u201cThe Xbox runs Windows,\u201d it probably wants that to be true in as many ways as possible.\n\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s already been taking small strides toward making that happen \u2014 the current Xbox One actually does run Windows 10 now, and there\u2019s an existing OneCore effort to make Windows more modular \u2014 Windows needs to be more flexible and responsive to new device trends than that strategy offered.\n\nMicrosoft recently hinted that a new \u201cmodern OS\u201d may have one specific benefit for us regular users, too: seamless updates in the background so a Windows Update will hopefully never interrupt your critical work again.\n\nAs ever, Microsoft needs the apps\n\nThe big challenge may be for Microsoft, which has struggled to get developers to build anything beyond plain, vanilla Windows desktop apps, to convince them to build ones that adapt to all these different screens, forms, and orientations. Surface boss Panos Panay straight-up admitted to us that\u2019s why the Surface Duo will run Android: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. Like, literally, you need the apps.\u201d\n\nBut that may also be why Microsoft is revealing the Surface Neo and Windows 10X a full year ahead of their planned debut. The company needs to stir up enough interest in the product to prove there\u2019s a market, and Panay tells us it may even put the device in developers\u2019 hands in a few short months. Windows Core OS wasn\u2019t a topic of discussion at the company\u2019s Build 2019 developer conference in May, but the company\u2019s promising more info at Build in 2020.\n\nGetting devs on board may not be as uphill a battle as it would have been a decade ago, back when Microsoft killed off the Courier concept. Then, tablets had barely entered the public consciousness, our modern mobile operating systems were still pretty new, and their chips weren\u2019t anywhere near fast enough to run traditional Windows apps.\n\nBut now that the smartphone and tablet have plateaued, new form factors are the talk of tech. Every major company is working on a foldable or dual-screen device or a pair of AR glasses, and that means those new screens are on the tops of many developers\u2019 minds, too.\n\nThey\u2019ll just need to decide if Microsoft\u2019s vision for those screens is attractive enough to give Microsoft its due.", "description": "Microsoft has announced Windows 10X, a version of Windows that\u2019s meant explicitly for dual-screen devices. We got precious few details about the operating system otherwise, and that may be because it\u2019s not a full OS. Instead, it\u2019s likely a shell on top of a special modular version of Windows 10, like similar versions for the HoloLens 2 headset and upcoming Surface Hub 2X.", "authors": ["Sean Hollister", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GPs9ECOdM7qbKPyvUfAmpuUKW64=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19247635/akrales_190930_3649_0115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
