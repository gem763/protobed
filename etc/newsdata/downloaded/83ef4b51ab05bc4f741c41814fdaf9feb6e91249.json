And that major new development, a second whistle-blower has come forward. This person is claiming firsthand knowledge of the president's dealings with Ukraine. Something the other whistle-blower did not. Our senior congressional correspondent Mary Bruce is tracking the very latest there on capitol hill. Good morning, Mary. Reporter: Good morning, robin. Well, this new whistle-blower could provide new leads in this investigation and this person as you mentioned claims to have firsthand knowledge of the president's behavior which undercuts one of trump's main arguments which is that the first whistle-blower was not a direct witness and now this morning you can be sure members of congress are likely going to want to this new whistle-blower soon. This morning Democrats are applauding the news of a second whistle-blower who claims to have direct knowledge of the president's interactions with Ukraine. We are tremendously dependent on people of courage stepping forward. This morning, more breaking news. Reporter: ABC news was first to report that an attorney who represents the first whistle-blower is now representing a second whistle-blower. A member of the intelligence community who claims to have firsthand information about the president's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. The president had disparaged the first whistle-blower for not having witnessed the call firsthand. The whistle-blower never saw the conversation. He got his information, I guess, second or thirdhand. Reporter: But the white house still insists there is nothing to see here saying in a statement it doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistle-blowers about the same telephone call, a call the president already made public. Adding, it doesn't change the fact that he has done nothing wrong but the president's allies are struggling to defend trump's public appeal for China to also investigate Biden. We know they're not. Come on. Why can't you answer yes or no, do you think it's appropriate? Because I don't think that's what he did. I don't think that's what he did. But it was right there on camera. Reporter: Republican Jim Jordan dodging George's question more than a dozen times while most Republicans have refused to condemn the president's behavior. A small growing number are taking him on. Vulnerable Republican senator Susan Collins says trump's request for China to get involved was completely inappropriate. But she isn't weighing in on trump's communications with Ukraine. I don't want to prejudge the evidence. Plus, not all the evidence is in yet. Reporter: Senator Mitt Romney has been the most outspoken Republican calling the president's comments wrong and appalling. And this weekend trump fired back calling Romney a pomp mouse expletive who can so bad for Republicans. Some members in tough re-election fights are getting an earful. Support of an impeachment inquiry and I wanted you to know from me -- I wanted you to know from me -- Reporter: Alyssa Slotkin getting mixed messages at home in Michigan. Democrats subpoenaed the white house but senior white house officials tell us they will not cooperate unless the speaker first holds a full house vote authorizing this impeachment inquiry. The white house insists without that they are denied of certain rights like having a counsel present for some of these depositions but the speaker is adamant saying she is not required up the constitution to have a vote before proceeding with this investigation even though every other impeachment process has had this vote. Every presidential impeachment process has had one of these votes and the speaker is under more pressure. Reporter: She is not ruling it out. Notably says she could consider having this vote. It is possible but she is adamant and insists the constitution does not require her to do this.
