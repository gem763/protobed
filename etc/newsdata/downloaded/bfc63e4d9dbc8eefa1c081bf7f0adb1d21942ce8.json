We also took back the House with a mandate to fight for sexual and reproductive health care. In 2020, we have the opportunity to flip the Senate and strengthen our House majority, ensuring we have a Congress that will protect people\u2019s health and rights,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, Acting President and CEO, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cProviding health care is meaningless if people cannot access it. The Trump administration and Republican leadership\u2019s attacks against our health and rights have been relentless. People won\u2019t take these attacks anymore \u2014 and they\u2019re looking to make their voices heard at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe endorsees include Senate hopeful Mark Kelly, a Democrat running to unseat Sen.

Planned Parenthood is also backing a mix of Democratic House incumbents and challengers in 25 different states.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Planned Parenthood\u2019s super PAC announced Wednesday it would spend $45 million in an effort to beat President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE and flip the Senate in its \u201clargest ever\u201d electoral program, a significant boost from the $30 million the group committed to spending in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI think this is a really unique moment for us as an organization,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThe stakes are higher than ever, and we\u2019re coming out more powerful than ever with our largest investment ever made.\u201d\n\nThe moves come as advocates worry that internal strife could hobble Planned Parenthood\u2019s political power heading into the 2020 cycle. The group\u2019s board of directors this year fired its president and was mired in a public dispute over the circumstances of her departure; its health centers lost millions of dollars in federal family planning funding under a new Trump administration rule; and it is waging a court battle to keep open the last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri \u2014 a Planned Parenthood affiliate.\n\nMeanwhile, the group is fighting back against a wave of state legislatures seeking to curtail access to abortion. Twelve states in the first half of the year enacted some kind of ban on the procedure, with advocates of the campaign saying they hope to spark a Supreme Court battle that could lead to the nation's top court reviewing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that was the first to legalize abortion on a federal level.", "description": "Planned Parenthood on Thursday announced its first round of endorsements for dozens of House and Senate candidates who are \u201ccommitted to protecting sexual and reproductive health and rights across the country.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/plannedparenthood_protesters_053119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
