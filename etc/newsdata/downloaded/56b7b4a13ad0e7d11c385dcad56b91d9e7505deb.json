Commander Steve McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) and Danny Williams (Scott Caan). Last week, a first \u201chello\u201d for the new character, Quinn Liu (Katrina Law) came with staring down the barrel of a gun, and not just for the boss, McGarrett.\n\nHer role will develop further as the season moves along, but just a sneak peek from tonight's Episode 2 of Season 10, \"Kuipeia e ka makani apaa\" (Knocked Flat by the Wind; Sudden Disaster), rips \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d open, from the ground up, with terror and truly ground-shaking impact.\n\nSpoiler TV teased viewer appetites with October 4 previews of their law enforcement heroes, who have more than one bomb site to manage.\n\nIn this booming installment, the younger members of \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d are drawn into danger like never before and the situation is reminiscent of other tender moments in \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d lore created by combustion.\n\nEddie is ever on duty\n\nSteve McGarrett and the entire team of \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d have been spared by the keen nose in and constant faithfulness of Eddie, who became part of the McGarrett home and \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d per the suggestion of Alex O'Loughlin in Season 8.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

TV Shows\n\nThe precious retriever has done nothing but to endear himself to cast, crew, and viewers since, and he has been known to even take a swim with his master.\n\nEddie never lets go of a scent, and in one advance look, the leader of \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d summons the bomb squad to his own home when Eddie smells something suspicious from the garage.\n\nAs if that's not enough to distract from his morning \u201cbulletproof\u201d coffee, another clip depicts Tani (Meaghan Rath) giving the boss a call to let him know that she and Junior (Beulah Koale) are headed into a collapsed tunnel to help retrieve victims.\n\nAlthough he advises waiting for the all-clear for safety, she counters with \u201cyou\u2019d do the same, and you know it\u201d so McGarrett isn't exactly on good ground to argue.\n\nFurther scenes show Tani and Junior deep below, rendering aid when gunmen approach seeming to be victims but shooting those in charge. These younger badge-holders of \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d are known for keeping emotions at bay, but Junior conveys absolute terror as he yells \u201cBomb!\u201d while aiming his weapon. Aani\u2019s scream of \u201cJunior!\u201d is just as bloodcurdling.\n\nA blast can be bonding\n\n\u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d faithful will have to be patient to see how the team survives tonight, but once Steve McGarrett is on the scene with Captain Grover (Chi McBride), no effort will be spared to save the two trapped below.\n\nLongtime followers of the police drama will forever recall a pivotal Episode 19 from Season 4 of \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cKu I Ka Pili Koko\u201d (Blood Brothers). When an informant\u2019s tip turns out to be a setup, Danny and Steve are trapped by a building explosion, Steve must devise a way to safely blast their own way out, along with saving Danny's leg.\n\nDistracting his partner by listening endlessly to baseball statistics, Steve removes rebar from Danny's leg, disinfecting the wound with bleach. The episode is full of probing and funny reflections on life, love, and fate, and ends with a heartfelt hug between the two, not to mention Michelle Borth being overjoyed as Catherine to welcome Steve to live above ground again.\n\nIt was after loading a monster bomb onto a red truck and navigating a very treacherous bridge that Danny and Steve first discussed their venture into the restaurant business, which led to bickering and bonding all its own. The pair narrowly escape the blast once again.\n\nAfter the soulful and bittersweet departure (but not formal goodbye) for Jerry last week, the bonds between \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d are bound to be stronger than ever, no matter how much TNT is involved. The outcome for Tani and Junior should only further their budding romance.", "description": "Season 10 of police drama keeps turning up the action and the energy early in the new milestone year.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Cheryl Preston", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "Dylan Dreyer Sparks A Jade Roller Frenzy On", "Today", "When Calls The Heart S", "Erin Krakow Enjoys Elevator Fun With Leading Men Cut-Outs", "'The Good Doctor ' Season Episode", "'Debts'"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/4/os/b_1200x630/steve-alex-oloughlin-isnt-the-only-target-of-a-bomb-in-episode-2-of-hawaii-five-o-this-week-image-source-spoilertv-youtube_2334277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
