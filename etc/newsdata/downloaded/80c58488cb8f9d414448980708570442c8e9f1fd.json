BHP reassured the climate lobby that the Minerals Council-aligned Coal21 and the positions it had taken since January 2018 would be tested against BHP\u2019s policy setting.\n\nCoal21 has been something of a problem child for both the anti-coal lobby and BHP.\n\nCoal21 was set up as a coal industry-funded technology play that was supposed to work out whether or not carbon capture and storage was a viable way of solving coal\u2019s emissions dilemma. But, over recent years, it has drifted into the coal lobby space.\n\nThis week, we chatted to one of the proxy agencies to have apparently irritated the Church of England by recommending rejection of the ACCR resolution. That firm leans towards routine rejection of resolutions that \u2013 like the ones delivered in BHP by ACCR \u2013 are predicated on constitutional change.\n\n\u201cBut Coal21 needs to be bought to heel,\u201d the proxy adviser said. \u201cIt should not be an advocate of anything but CCS. It should not be involved in social media election campaigns.\u201d\n\nThis, I suspect, is also BHP\u2019s position. And that, presumably, is why Coal21 was the only agency of industry that was called out in BHP\u2019s public riposte to ACCR.\n\nBHP finds itself on the horns of a carbon dilemma with Coal21. It has proved irritatingly resistant to invitations to recover a singular focus on its core purpose of proving CCS technologies. But that purpose is mission-critical to BHP, which continues to promote the view that the world cannot hit its Paris target without getting serious about carbon capture.\n\nJust generally though, BHP\u2019s firm position is that the Minerals Council\u2019s role is far more than political advocacy and I suspect, this time around, it is ready to defend that thesis very actively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBHP\u2019s most recent affirmation of its Minerals Council membership noted that its benefits were rated as \u201chigh\u201d on the back of the strength of its contribution to issues such as health and safety, the environment, workforce and industry economics.\n\nIf anything, that rating will have increased this year with confirmation that the council is now the lead for the Australian industry\u2019s technical response to the tailing dam management crisis triggered by the BHP-Vale owned Samarco tragedy and then so tragically amplified by the Vale-owned Brumadinho collapse.\n\nConversely, there is every indication that BHP is proving a force for climate policy progress at the Minerals Council. As The Australian Financial Review revealed on Thursday, the Council is \u201cquietly\u201d working to update the climate strategy that was reworked in the face of BHP\u2019s 2017 review and released in March 2018.\n\nHow BHP will spend its climate fund\n\nNow, while we are on the subject of BHP and climate, we have been belatedly delivered with the transcript of the Global Australian\u2019s first full-scale ESG (environment, social, governance) briefing that was held in London on Tuesday.\n\nAs we reported on Wednesday, the core theme of that investor briefing, which was led by external affairs boss Geoff Healy, was that the investment of human and financial capital in managing social issues is simply good business.\n\nFor example, as Healy cogently explained, BHP\u2019s decision to account for the greenhouse emissions of its customers (scope III) and to pursue opportunities for their mitigation made sense because success would extend the economic life of its core products \u2013 iron ore, coal and petroleum.\n\nBut on Tuesday, investors also heard from Fiona Wild, BHP\u2019s vice-president, climate change and sustainability. And, after reiterating the need for integrated climate and energy policies that put a price on carbon, she offered a few insights into what BHP\u2019s new $US400 million \u201cclimate fund\u201d might find itself supporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIntegrated climate and energy policy is fundamental to delivering a low carbon transition at least cost,\u201d Wild started. \u201cWe recognise our role to work with others, including policymakers, NGOs and peers, to encourage global action.\n\n\u201cA price on carbon is an important component of an effective response and, through our investments in carbon offset programs, we hope to stimulate broader private sector interest in market mechanisms,\u201d she continued before turning to the climate action fund that BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie announced back in July.\n\n\u201cThe program will consider both existing technologies and new, more disruptive options,\u201d Wild told investors.\n\n\u201cFor example, it could include funding for renewable power to our sites, as well as broader electrification of our truck fleet. Scope III could include carbon capture and storage, as well as broader scale carbon utilisation. Carbon offsets are a really important part of the program, addressing a major source of global emissions, from both forest and coastal ecosystems, and stimulating the market for offsets, which will be essential to meet net-zero goals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs well as driving internal innovation, we hope the program will catalyse more partnerships and potentially result in direct equity investments for BHP, as we demonstrated with our $US6 million equity investment in Carbon Engineering earlier this year,\u201d she finished.\n\nCarbon Engineering, which is also backed by Bill Gates, Chevron, a Canadian oil sands billionaire and a variety of government agencies from Canada and the US, has developed technology that sucks carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere so it can be turned into fuel after being mixed with hydrogen and water.", "description": "Church, Mammon and climate lobby push BHP on its association with the Minerals Council of Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5588%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1134%2C$y_798/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d4c5790c5c4c6d159caedb24d63c369cae8bb0bd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
