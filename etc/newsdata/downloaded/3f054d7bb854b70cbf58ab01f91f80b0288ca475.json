Why? Well let\u2019s just say it\u2019s more to do with his chiselled abs than the chiselling he\u2019s paid to do on work sites.\n\nRELATED:\n\nEpisode 46 recap: Mitch and Jesse go head to head\n\nBehind the scenes of The Block\u2019s biggest arguments\n\nEl\u2019ise then took it upon herself to give foreman Keith some stick for his lacklustre following on social media, hinting that it might be because he has remained fully clothed in all his posts.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to be renovating (not stripping),\u201d a stunned Keith pointed out, before dutifully removing his high-vis vest to strut about half naked with Paul.\n\nIt should be noted that even when stripping, Keith is a stickler for safety regulations. He kept his hard-hat on at all times for the construction cavorting.\n\nThen, as if to prove he, too, had something to offer the ladies, Matt removed his shirt.\n\nAs did the A2 milk sponsor guy who turned up to shake some milkshakes (and his rippling physique). I am sure this wasn\u2019t just a bit of gratuitous nudity rather an opportunity to show the kids at home what a diet high in calcium can do for your body.\n\nEl\u2019ise seemed to have a one-track mind this week because she was also enthusing to all who would listen how her powder room (that\u2019s a fancy name for spare toilet) was going to be \u201csuper sexy\u201d.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a description that I would generally associate with the lav.\n\nIn between all the half-naked blokes parading about the Oslo work site and talk of saucy bathroom fixtures, there was the obligatory dose of tears and tantrums from Tess.\n\nThe Cairns couple have fallen behind (again) prompting all and sundry to point out where they are going wrong.\n\nWhen Tess heard that host Scotty Cam would be paying them another visit to lay down the law about their overspending on tradespeople, Tess did a runner.\n\nIf she had stayed to hear Scotty\u2019s latest lecture, she would have heard how she and Luke had spent $25,000 more than the other four teams on tradespeople.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot when you consider Deb and Andy and Mitch and Mark have no building qualifications while Luke is a carpenter by trade.\n\nBut Tess wasn\u2019t having a bar of it.\n\n\u201cI am not a child,\u201d she moaned.\n\n\u201cWe are just defeated, deflated and over it! What\u2019s the point?\n\n\u201cWe are cutting back big time and I feel like we have done a lot to try and get here to where we are now, and we are constantly reminded of the negative.\u201d\n\nAs she attempted to flee the set, she tearfully told a producer the toll that the show is taking on her personal life. She was sleep-deprived, strung-out and on the brink of walking out.\n\n\u201cThis is destroying us\u2026 Luke and I hate each other. We just fight all the time. I don\u2019t like what this is doing to us,\u201d she protested.\n\n\u201cI mentally don\u2019t think I could keep going but he is like a cane toad. They just don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nEven laid-back Luke, aka Mr Toad, admitted the experience on the show was pushing them to breaking point.\n\n\u201cWe are newlyweds and we are having the worst time of our life,\u201d he said, before throwing his arms around a sobbing Tess.\n\n\u201cThis is not the ideal honeymoon situation. The constant fighting. It\u2019s crap. It\u2019s really crap. But it\u2019s unique and we are unique sorts of people.\u201d\n\nTess and Luke revealed that they were beginning to suspect the producers were hoping that they wouldn\u2019t finish their house, thereby securing ratings-grabbing drama from their humiliating failure.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s hard to imagine why they would have allowed Keith and his fellow foreman Dan to bring a team of people in to help the down-and-out Cairns couple get back in the game.\n\nThe free labour came on the back of Keith doing some work for them last week. And Dan has also lent a hand to the equally cash-strapped Matt and El\u2019ise.\n\nThe helping hands that were being offered to the two teams didn\u2019t go unnoticed by eagle-eyed Mark.\n\nHe pointed out that the added assistance being given to the two teams who hadn\u2019t budgeted as well as everyone else seemed hardly fair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that extra resources are being put into house two. I am not sure how that works. Is that fair? Probably not,\u201d Mark pointed out.\n\nDespite Mitch and Mark\u2019s opposition to the added assistance and the ongoing tension between the boys and their neighbours after spa-gate, the pair stepped up to help Tess and Luke in their hour of need (again).\n\nThey were probably buoyed by their triumph in this week\u2019s challenge which saw their party house chosen to grace the cover of a real estate magazine.\n\nSo, when Tess offered to exchange a $2000 Freedom Furniture voucher for some free labour from the boys\u2019 plasterers, they were open to the idea.\n\nEven though, at this late stage of the game, Mitch and Mark don\u2019t need a lot more furniture for an already cluttered abode, they agreed grudgingly to the trade.\n\nAnd so, the Cairns cane toad and his missus live to fight (and plaster) another day.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 46: Mitch and Jesse go head to head\n\n\n\nEP 45 recap: Judges slam pathetic balcony\n\n\n\n\n\nEP 43/44 recap : Has Mel had enough of her \u2018worst boyfriend\u2019\n\nEP 42 recap: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
