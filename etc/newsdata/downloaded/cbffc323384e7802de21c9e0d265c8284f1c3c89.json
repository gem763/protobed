The phone call is at the center of a whistleblower complaint that prompted an impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Zelensky said that Ukraine could not make a determination on whether it was involved in election interference without an investigation, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThere is no evidence that suggests Ukraine committed any interference during the 2016 U.S. election.
