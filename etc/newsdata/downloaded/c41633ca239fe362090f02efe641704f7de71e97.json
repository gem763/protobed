Online jail records had no information about an attorney to speak for Meyer, who was no longer in custody Sunday.\n\nMeyer told police he heard a noise outside around 5 a.m. Thursday and saw someone with a pickax trying to break into his storage shed, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. Meyer told police that he grabbed his gun, went out and yelled at the person to stop and not come closer or he\u2019d shoot.\n\nMeyer told investigators the person took several steps toward him, so he fired and the burglar dropped his pickax and ran toward a nearby park.\n\nMeyer said he fired an additional shot \u201cinto the night\u201d in the direction of the park, even though \u201cfrom the suspect\u2019s accounts, the threat of serious bodily injury against him was over when the complainant dropped the pickax and ran off,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nMeyer, who said he didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d shot anyone, went back to bed. He got up around 7 a.m. Thursday and thought he saw \u201ca black bag\u201d in the park. Upon closer inspection, he found the man\u2019s body.\n\nMeyer\u2019s wife called an attorney, seeking advice, before her husband called 911 to report he was the victim of a crime and that medical help was needed, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office on Sunday had no details on the case and referred questions about the unidentified suspect to police. Spokesman Sgt. Warren Mitchell said he did not have access to the arrest affidavit Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The wife of a Dallas man charged in the fatal shooting of someone they thought was a burglar contacted a lawyer before the husband called 911 to report a home invasion, according to police documents.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
