USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Washington Nationals\u2019 postseason history added a fresh chapter Wednesday night.\n\nTitle it \u201cDelirium.\u2019\u2019\n\nHowie Kendrick's grand slam in the top of the 10th inning broke a 3-3 tie and the Nationals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 in the decisive Game 5 of the National League Division Series.\n\nIt is the first time the Nationals \u2013 or Expos before them \u2013 have won a postseason series. Ever.\n\nThey did it just like they had all year. It was their motto after a 19-31 start to the season. The Nationals stayed in the fight .\n\nIn the top of the eighth inning, with three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayon Kershaw pitching in relief for the Dodgers, Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto hit solo homers, tied the game at 3-3 and sent Kershaw heading to the showers.\n\nIn the 10th inning, Dodgers reliever Joe Kelly \u2013 pitching his second inning \u2013 loaded the bases with no outs. On an 0-1 fastball, Kendrick went to long to dead center field, stunning the capacity crowd at Dodger Stadium.\n\n\u201cProbably the best moment of my career,\u201d Kendrick said after the game. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\"\n\nNationals ace Stephen Strasburg gave up two homers and three runs in the first two innings, but kept the Dodgers scoreless for the rest of his six-inning stint while keeping his team in the game.\n\nThe Nationals' bullpen, which had baseball's worst ERA (5.68) in the regular season, combined for four scoreless innings \u2013 capped off by Sean Doolittle retiring the side in order in the 10th to securing the win.\n\nThe Nationals will face the St. Louis Cardinals Friday a in Game 1 of the best-of-seven NLCS \u2013 the first since 2015 that will not involve the Dodgers.\n\nTurning point\n\nWhen Dave Roberts sent Clayton Kershaw out for the top of the eighth inning. (With two outs in the seventh, Kershaw struck out Adam Eaton, the only batter he faced, on three pitches. No such luck in the 8th.)\n\nAnthony Rendon hit Kershaw\u2019s second pitch into the left field bleachers for a solo home run. Juan Soto followed that up by belting the first pitch he saw from Kershaw over the right-center field wall.\n\nJust like that, the game was tied at 3 3 all.\n\nScary moment\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki went down in the batter\u2019s box after a 94-mph fastball from Walker Buehler hit in his the wrist and apparently hit him in the head in the top of the seventh inning. Dodger Stadium turned eerily quiet and Buehler looked concerned as medical personnel tended to Suzuki. But Suzuki left the field under his own power.", "description": "After tying the game in the eighth, the Nationals got a grand slam from Howie Kendrick in the top of the 10th in the 7-3 win.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published A.M.
