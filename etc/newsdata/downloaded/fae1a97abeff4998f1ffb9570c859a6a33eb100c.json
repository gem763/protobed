However, it'll get lesser RAM with 3GB, as opposed to 4GB that is seen on the iPhone 11's.\n\nFor storage, the iPhone SE 2 is expected to get 64GB and 128GB storage variants. The devices will be made available in three colour variants -- Silver, Space Gray and Red.\n\nDon't Miss 129 SHARES 534 SHARES 3.8 K SHARES\n\nPrevious reports have hinted that the device will look similar to the iPhone 8, with a similar 4.7-inch LCD Retina display. However recent reports have revealed that the device will also be losing the 3D Touch on the display (something that was available on the iPhone 8's display earlier).\n\nThis isn't surprising as Apple has decided to slash-down this feature on its iPhone 11's too. Also coming from the iPhone 8 is the beloved Touch ID, (which means the device isn't getting Face ID).\n\nRepresentative Image: Apple\n\nAs per a previous report by Ming-Chi Kuo, an iPhone SE 2 could sell like hotcakes, as currently, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus isn't getting updated to iOS as the hardware on the iPhone 6 isn't at-par to run Apple Arcade. With a cheaper alternative and faster hardware, iPhone SE 2 could attract people who want to try Apple Arcade too.\n\nThis phone could also be a tempting deal for users who want to get an iPhone with a compact form-factor, without really spending a ton of money for it.", "description": "Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo according to his latest research report has revealed that the upcoming iPhone SE 2 is slated for the first quarter of 2020 and will be sold at a price tag starting Rs $399 (which is approximately Rs 28,000).
