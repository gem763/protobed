It is the complete reverse. Faith, religion, is actually first and foremost an expression of our human frailty and vulnerability and an understanding that there are things far bigger than each of us.\"\n\nMr Morrison, who was launching a book on prayer, said he had visited a bushfire-ravaged town in northern NSW on Sunday and \"our prayers must also be with them and all of those affected by all of the natural disasters which in this country we face with great frequency\".\n\nDuring his recent trip to the US, Mr Morrison visited a Pentecostal church to worship, the National Capital Community Church, whose pastor Mark Batterson has given sermons arguing that pre-marital sex and homosexuality are sins.\n\nBut in question time, Mr Morrison was subjected to several questions over reports he tried to get another Pentecostal church leader, Hillsong founder Brian Houston, into the state dinner hosted by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that the White House had rejected Mr Morrison's request Mr Houston be invited. Mr Morrison at the time tried to brush off the claim by saying he did not comment on \"gossip\", but did not deny the story.\n\nMr Houston was criticised in the findings of the 2014 royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse for failing to alert police about allegations his father, Frank, had sexually assaulted children, and had a conflict of interest when he assumed responsibility for dealing with the accusations.\n\nMr Morrison told Parliament invitations for the event were issued by the White House and he did not comment on unsourced reports.\n\n\"If they are suggesting anything serious or casting any aspersions on the\n\nindividual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners,\" he said.", "description": "The prime minister says prayer can bring MPs together and deal with the challenges facing the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2152%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e94460903b694a84254cbe885bc3463e62b9a91b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
