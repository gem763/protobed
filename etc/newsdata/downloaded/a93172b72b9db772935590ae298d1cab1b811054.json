We were really happy with that.\"\n\nThe university's student union won't have to make as many cuts as it feared 4:43\n\nUOSU was expecting a 70 per cent opt-in rate across the board, so any fees that come in over and above that will go into a special fund that groups can apply for.\n\nStill, the thousands of students who did opt out mean a significant drop in funding some organizations, including UOSU, which replaced the former student federation after that group lost its status over fraud allegations.\n\n\"Running [it] more efficiently helps, but obviously there are things we could do better for students if we had that additional 20 per cent,\" Schroeder said.\n\nSam Schroeder is advocacy commissioner with the University of Ottawa Students' Union. (Menaka Raman-Wilms/CBC)\n\nAt Carleton University, where student leaders said they were expecting an opt-in rate of just 50 per cent, 85 per cent of the undergraduate population opted in, according to Carleton University Student Association president Lily Akagbosu.\n\nSo far, 84 per cent of graduate students have opted in.\n\n\"These numbers show clear support for student unions and is a result of our work to inform students of services and campaigns that would otherwise be impacted,\" wrote Namrata Tilokani, vice-president of Carleton's grad student association.\n\nFees for some programs at Carleton remained mandatory, including the walksafe program, health and counselling services, athletics and recreation, and academic support.", "description": "Student unions at Ottawa's two major universities say their members have voted overwhelmingly to continue paying fees for campus\u00a0organizations, clubs and media.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277665.1568131625!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/university-of-ottawa-summer-campus-tabaret-hall.jpg"}
