The other 11 Pacific Rim countries, including big farm producers such as New Zealand and Canada, went ahead without the United States and were enjoying preferential treatment in Japan.\n\nWhile rewarding American farmers, the new U.S.-Japan mini-deal does not resolve differences over trade in autos. Trump has said the two countries continue to work on a more comprehensive agreement.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose import taxes on foreign autos, claiming they pose a threat to U.S. national security. At the UN general assembly, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that Trump had assured him that a previous agreement to spare Japan from new auto tariffs still stood.\n\nBut Japanese automakers were disappointed that the United States kept existing auto tariffs at 2.5%.\n\nThe limited trade pact also includes market-opening commitments on $40 billion worth of digital trade between the two countries.\n\nTrump has long complained by America\u2019s large trade deficit with Japan, which came to $58 billion last year. Japan is the world\u2019s third-biggest economy behind the United States and China.\n\nThe president was set to sign the deal at the White House Monday afternoon.\n\nThe news might sound familiar. The deal was first announced at the August Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, France. At the UN gathering last month, the two countries signed an agreement-in-principle. On Monday, Trump was scheduled to sign the final text.\n\n___\n\nAP Writer Darlene Superville contributed to this story.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign a limited trade agreement Monday with Japan, a deal that would win back benefits American", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/ea348f_nabe-economic-outlook-29277-donald-trump-in-oct-2019-file-photo-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
