His rent was always paid, along with other utilities, and he would see me weekly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Hoskins added: \u2018The really sad thing is that it cost me almost the same amount of money to pay for his death that it would have to have private dental treatment.\u2019\n\nAfter not hearing from her son for a few days, Ms Hoskins called the police, who had to force entry into his top floor flat.\n\nA statement from Dr Gabriella Day, of Burgess Road Surgery, said Mr Hoskins had last visited the practice in August 2018 with a tooth ache complaint.\n\nPathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes carried out a post mortem and provided a cause of death as hanging.\n\nNeed support?
