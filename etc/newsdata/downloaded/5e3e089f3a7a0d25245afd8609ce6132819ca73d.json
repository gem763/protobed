Here's the best way to profit from that shift.", "language": "en", "text": "The outperformance of US stocks over their international counterparts that's been in place since the financial crisis is at an \"inflection point,\" according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n\nThe firm demonstrated that a rotation was already underway in Europe and laid out more reasons why international stocks could deliver a huge payout to US investors for several years to come.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nIn the 10 years since the financial crisis, non-US stocks have beaten their US counterparts only twice: in 2012 and 2017.\n\nBut the next 10 years are poised to look a lot different, according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n\nThe firm's call is that US investors will enjoy benefits from international stocks that go beyond the standard advantages of having a diversified portfolio: A meaningful rotation is underway and could lift the returns from non-US stocks above the US's for the next decade.\n\nTo compare how both trends have fared since the crisis, Morgan Stanley pit the S&P 500 against the MSCI All Country World Index ex USA. The former has delivered an excess of 500 basis points over the latter, on average, over the past 10 years.\n\nBut this is about to reverse, resembling the period between 1999 and 2009, when international stocks outperformed the US in all but two years.\n\n\"We see the relative outperformance of the S&P 500 versus the MSCI ACW ex US as reaching an inflection point,\" Lisa Shalett, the chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a recent note to clients.\n\nThe inflection is already in its early stages relative to European stocks. Shalett reached this conclusion by comparing the euro-denominated MSCI Europe Total Return Index with the dollar-based S&P 500 Total Return Index.\n\nThe chart below shows the European index has topped the S&P 500 for the better part of the past 12 months.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nThis outperformance has taken place even as large investors have trimmed their exposure to Europe.\n\nHedge funds' net exposure to the region is close to an all-time low, and European equity funds have seen their longest period of outflows in history, Shalett said, citing data from Morgan Stanley Prime Brokerage.\n\nHowever, she views this light positioning among hedge funds as a bullish signal for when the funds come pouring in again.\n\nShe further provided her rationale for why investors would consider rotating back into Europe.\n\nGlobal stocks have long discounted a recession\n\nHer broad assessment is that global stocks were discounting a recession long before fears of a US slowdown reached fever pitch this year because of the trade war and yield-curve inversion.\n\nInvestors started getting jittery about global growth in early 2018, when all the major economies stopped growing in a synchronized fashion. The US soldiered on thanks to corporate tax cuts. But many other countries did not, as the first wave of US tariffs on China slammed those that relied on trade with the second-largest economy.\n\nAnother highlight of 2018 was the Federal Reserve's four rate hikes, which strengthened the dollar and hurt non-US stocks throughout the year. It wasn't until the fourth quarter of 2018 that US stocks buckled under the strain of Fed tightening.\n\nFast forward to late 2019, and non-US stocks have discounted much of the recession risks that US stocks are just now grappling with, according to Shalett.\n\nThe implication is that if global growth rebounds from here \u2014 spurred by more dovish central banks \u2014 investors stand to benefit from the rebound in non-US stocks that had sold off on recession fears.\n\n\"The pay-off from this type of positioning could be large as non-US markets are inherently more cyclical in their composition and thus more operationally leveraged to improvements in global growth,\" Shalett said.\n\nIn order to profit from such a rotation, Shalett recommends looking for active international fund managers who invest in value stocks and do not hedge the dollar. The currency component is important because any weakening in the dollar from here would increase the returns for US investors.\n\nShe also advises that investors watch the policy news flow for progress on the trade front and Brexit. After all, these are among the big issues that have hurt non-US markets lately \u2014 and their resolutions could also lead to huge payouts.", "description": "This \"inflection point\" means that a huge payout awaits US investors who venture beyond their shores, Morgan Stanley said.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/52efb03c6bb3f74f382b25d6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
