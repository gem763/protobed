It is part of an effort to shift what former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the association\u2019s current president, has called the profession\u2019s \u201creputation for hostility toward women and minorities.\u201d\n\nThe conference, held each January in a different city, is equal parts academic conference and massive job fair. Researchers present their work and host panel discussions, while universities, government agencies and other employers interview prospective hires.\n\n\u201cIt was not unusual when I was a job-market candidate to walk into a hotel room and see a roomful of men, and be invited to sit on the bed for a job interview,\u201d said Jessica Holmes, an economics professor at Middlebury College in Vermont. \u201cMany people always recognized it was strange, but it\u2019s finally changing.\u201d\n\nThe change is one of several ways the organization is trying to make the economics profession more welcoming in the hope of bringing more diversity to a field that\u2019s far more white and male than most university campuses.\n\nOnly about 30% of economics majors at the undergraduate level are women, compared with 58% of all undergraduates, and 12% belong to minority groups, compared with 21% for all students, according to a 2017 Fed study.\n\nAn AEA survey earlier this year found that two-thirds of female economists said their work hadn\u2019t been taken as seriously as that of male counterparts or that they had been excluded or disrespected by their colleagues.\n\nFor job applicants\u2014typically graduate students wrapping up their Ph.D.s\u2014the conference kicks off the monthslong process of applying for jobs. It\u2019s not uncommon for applicants to run from one hotel to another cramming in as many as two dozen or more job interviews over three or four days.\n\nRoughly 13,000 people attend every year and space in the conference center is tight. With meeting rooms reserved for panels and presentations, recruiters have frequently resorted to inviting job candidates back to their hotel rooms for interviews.\n\nIt is an awkward arrangement that generations of young economists have had to endure.\n\n\u201cI myself in 1979 when I was on the market, I sat in many hotel rooms speaking to one or two faculty members from different schools,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said.\n\nMany job applicants said the practice made them uncomfortable, he said. So starting with next year\u2019s conference, set for Jan. 3-5 in San Diego, attendees who book hotel rooms through the economics organization will have to pledge not to use their rooms for job interviews. They can instead book a suite and hold interviews in the living-room area. The organization is also making interview space available for recruiters for a fee.\n\n\u201cClearly, it\u2019s something people were concerned about, and we thought it was better to get ahead of it to the extent we can,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said, adding that he was unaware of any bad behavior taking place during an interview.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nKathryn Holston, a Ph.D. student in economics at Harvard University, said she was pleased future generations of economists wouldn\u2019t have to visit hotel rooms in the course of applying for a job.\n\n\u201cEven if nothing that\u2019s incredibly negative happens during the interview, just having it in that setup can set the stage, particularly for female candidates, to be in a position where they might be uncomfortable\u2014particularly if they might be sexual-assault survivors,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Holston and another Harvard graduate student, Anna Stansbury, wrote a memo last year calling on the economics association to end the practice.\n\nElisabeth Perlman, an economist at the Census, recalled sprinting from interview to interview when applying for jobs at the 2016 conference in San Francisco. At least one was in a bedroom.\n\n\u201cThey were very careful to give me the desk chair that came with the bedroom and to have people arranged such that it wasn\u2019t too bad, and there were also women in that interview group, which was helpful, too,\u201d she said.\n\nMoving away from that arrangement, she said, \u201cis a good choice.\u201d\n\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com", "description": "The American Economic Association is implementing new rules forbidding universities and other employers from interviewing thousands of candidates in hotel rooms during the group\u2019s annual conference.", "authors": ["David Harrison", "David.Harrison Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103323/social"}
