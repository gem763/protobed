Disappointed. Hurt. We had that game. I'm going to say the same s--t. We should have won it. It is what it is, though. Got to bounce back.\"\n\nHe added: \"There were some awful, awful calls. But we got to play through them and overcome those.\"\n\nWalker took particular exception to being flagged for unnecessary roughness on the first play of the second half, which saw both Walker and Packers wideout Geronimo Allison attempt to make a play on the ball.\n\n\"Awful. It was an awful call,\" Walker said. \"I felt like I went for the ball, and [it] just so happened we collided, but I was looking for the ball. It was an awful call by them. It is what it is, though.\"\n\nAllison left the game with a chest injury and was also evaluated for a concussion following helmet-to-helmet contact.\n\nWalker's unnecessary roughness penalty was hardly the only call that came into question after Green Bay rallied late for the walk-off victory.\n\nIn the fourth quarter alone, Detroit defensive end Trey Flowers was flagged twice for illegal use of the hands. Both penalties came on third downs, with the second infraction allowing the Packers to run out the clock before kicking a game-winning 23-yard field goal.\n\n\"Nah, I didn't think hands to the chest was a penalty,\" Flowers said. \"I thought hands to the face. But I had them right here on the chest. Second time I changed it to right here. That's part of a move that I do, and yeah, I don't think it's a penalty.\"\n\nThe calls against Flowers stood out above the rest, leading to former Lions star Barry Sanders publicly calling out the officials:\n\nReferee Clete Blakeman addressed his crew's calls following the game, per Matt Schneidman of The Athletic:\n\nBlakeman's explanations will do little to appease the Lions, as Detroit (2-2-1) dropped three games in the win column behind Green Bay (5-1) in the NFC North.\n\nWalker's criticism of the officials could also prove costly.\n\n\"Whatever,\" he said of a possible fine, according to Rothstein. \"It don't even matter. It is what it is.\"", "description": "Detroit Lions  safety  Tracy Walker  was none too pleased with the officiating following a controversial 23-22 loss to the  Green Bay Packers  at Lambeau Field on Monday night...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/833/100/hi-res-e363469de0619b6f99f7dfd755b8b33f_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
