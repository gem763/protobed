The issue with this fact, is that it would give her no legal standing to sue anyone. Any legal cause would have to go through the trustee of the bankruptcy.\n\nAt the time, she claims her lawyers convinced her to lie about the bankruptcy, so they were able to collect the monumental judgment.\n\nView photos\n\nLydia's legal team claim she was \"duped\" by the group to ignore the bankruptcy and told to proceed against Death Row.\n\nSuge Knight and Harris are in direct communication, have compared notes, and realize they are now on the same side.\n\nGivens says the two are in private settlement conversations, but Harris has not received \"one dime\" from her lawyers who collected part of the huge payout.\n\nView photos", "description": "this is huge", "authors": ["Mike Walters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AofGhLMuvHj3tnnJUxvbiA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/be0fa8f92fbc646b729bce8a3fe6e3d4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
