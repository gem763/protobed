At the same time, and now that Blatt\u2019s public court filings have served his media objective, Blatt says that the complaint that he himself chose to file in court should actually be sent to private arbitration.\u201d\n\nIn response, Blatt\u2019s attorney Vineet Bhatia sent the following statement:\n\nWe fully expected this run-of-the-mill, procedural smoke screen to be made by Rad and Pambakian. These arguments are legally wrong and we expect to prevail in Court. The bottom line is, Rad and Pambakian conspired to defame Mr. Blatt and should be held responsible.\n\nBoth Blatt\u2019s suit and the new filing seek to connect the case to the broader #metoo movement (which, as Snyder alluded to, has seen number of high-profile figures accused of sexual assault, and who then fought back through defamation lawsuits).\n\nBlatt\u2019s lawyers argued that \u201cRad and Pambakian have attempted to weaponize an important social movement, undermining the plight of true victims of sexual abuse by making false accusations in cynical pursuit of a $2 billion windfall.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Rad and Pambakian\u2019s attorneys said the \u201censuing crescendo of retaliation \u2014 reminiscent of many Hollywood #MeToo cases \u2014 included [Tinder\u2019s parent company] Match circling the wagons around Blatt, publicly belittling Pambakian by chalking up the assault to \u2018consensual cuddling,\u2019 and firing her months later after she refused to sign an NDA.\u201d\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in the summer of 2018, Rad (Tinder\u2019s co-founder and former CEO), Pambakian (who was then the company\u2019s vice president of marketing and communications), Rad\u2019s fellow co-founders Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen and others sued Match and its controlling shareholder IAC, accusing them of manipulating financial data and removing Rad as CEO in order to create a \u201cfake lowball valuation\u201d and strip the founders and executives of their stock options.\n\nThe suit also accused Blatt \u2014 who served as an executive at IAC and as CEO of Match before replacing Rad as CEO of Tinder \u2014 of sexually harassing Pambakian at a company holiday party in 2016.\n\nIAC and Match have called this suit meritless. And in Blatt\u2019s defamation lawsuit, his attorneys said the encounter between Blatt and Pambakian at the holiday party was consensual and that Rad and Pambakian subsequently \u201cconspired to make false allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault against Blatt with the specific intent to damage Blatt\u2019s good name, personal and professional reputation, and credibility.\u201d\n\nIn a footnote, Rad and Pambakian\u2019s attorneys say that because they\u2019re making a free speech argument, their motion to dismiss Blatt\u2019s suit does not require the court to \u201cdelve into the facts.\u201d However, they add:\n\nBlatt\u2019s false narrative \u2014 that this was consensual, and that Pambakian and Rad concocted the assault allegations to aid their valuation lawsuit \u2014 is patently false and offensive. The evidence shows that Blatt admitted being drunk at the holiday party, making inappropriate comments to Pambakian, and \u201csnuggling and nuzzling\u201d her in a hotel bed. It further shows that Blatt apologized to Pambakian the following week, and later offered to resign over his misconduct. These are not the actions of an innocent man, nor is it the first time Blatt has been accused of mistreating women in the workplace.\n\nTo back that up that up, the motion points to a Gawker article describing supposed harassment and verbal abuse by an unnamed \u201cCEO of a major dating site\u201d owned by a corporation \u201cin a glass building on the far side of town\u201d (subsequent coverage has suggested that the piece was about Blatt).\n\nPambakian withdrew from the initial suit due to an arbitration agreement, but is now suing Blatt and Match for wrongful termination and sexual assault.\n\nYou can read the full motion below.", "description": "Last week, former Tinder CEO Greg Blatt filed a defamation lawsuit against Sean Rad and Rosette Pambakian, who are part of a group of Tinder founders and former executives who accused Blatt (pictured above) of sexual harassment and assault as part of a broader suit.
