Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in a speech that drew thousands of supporters to a historic site in Lower Manhattan, on Monday made one of her most explicit appeals to female voters since announcing her bid for the White House.\n\nIn Washington Square Park, an area etched with the history of women-led political action against corruption and big business, she sought to cast her own campaign as the next iteration of that movement.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all,\u201d she proclaimed to loud cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of some hard-working women.\u201d\n\nWarren stood before one of her biggest campaign crowds yet, a block from the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where a 1911 fire caused by hazardous conditions in the sweatshop killed 146 people, most of them female immigrants. The episode became a national symbol of corporate mistreatment of garment workers and led to sweeping labor reforms.\n\nWarren, who has been gaining momentum as the Democratic field begins to narrow, tried to tie her own candidacy to the female-led labor movement that the Triangle fire roused. She singled out Frances Perkins, who had witnessed the tragedy and subsequently helped organize and implement reforms, later becoming President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s labor secretary and the first female Cabinet member. Perkins later said the fire was \u201cthe day the New Deal was born,\u201d Warren noted.\n\n\u201cSo, what did one woman \u2014 one very persistent woman, backed up by millions of people across this country \u2014 get done?\u201d Warren said. \u201cSocial Security. Unemployment insurance. Abolition of child labor. Minimum wage. The right to join a union. Even the very existence of the weekend.\u201d\n\nChanneling her own campaign slogans, she added: \u201cBig, structural change. One woman, and millions of people to back her up.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s speech was the latest instance of the campaign\u2019s subtle and explicit calls for female political leadership in a country that has never elected a woman to be president.\n\nOn the trail, when discussing executive actions she would take, she often begins with: \u201cI love saying this: \u2018What a president can do all by herself.\u2019\u201d In her \u201cselfie lines\u201d after town halls, she usually kneels down and gives small girls a pinky swear and tells them, \u201cI'm running for president because that\u2019s what girls do.\u201d She almost always works in \u201cpersist,\u201d a reference to the label that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unwittingly made into a feminist rallying cry when he shut down a speech by Warren on the Senate floor in 2017.\n\nAnd before Monday night\u2019s speech, the Warren campaign\u2019s playlist included Lizzo\u2019s \u201cLike a Girl,\u201d which begins: \u201cWoke up feelin\u2019 like I just might run for president, even if there ain\u2019t no precedent, switchin\u2019 up the messagin\u2019, I\u2019m about to add a little estrogen.\u201d\n\nBesides Warren\u2019s rhetoric, 64 percent of the people on the campaign\u2019s payroll are women, according to a spokesperson, including the directors for the four early-voting state contests.\n\nDespite the political hurdles facing any female candidate, the big and small moves have the potential to tap into the same political energy that drove the Women\u2019s March and the election of a record number of women in the 2018 congressional midterms. With women likely to be about 60 percent of voters in the 2020 Democratic primary, a female candidate\u2019s ability to mobilize women voters on her behalf could be determinative in the nomination fight.\n\nWarren is not alone in pursuing such a strategy. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) made explicit appeals to female voters the thrust of her political strategy, which ultimately fell flat, leading to an early exit from the presidential race. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has also had viral moments encouraging young girls and has made inroads with black female voters.\n\nBut the Massachusetts senator currently has a consistent but slight edge with female voters that other leading candidates do not, and it is similar to the small lead that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has with male voters, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of polls over the month of August. Warren still struggles with women of color.\n\nOn the trail, there are some signs the strategy is working. In her town halls across the country, the crowds tend to skew slightly female, many sporting \u201cpersist\u201d-themed swag and tattoos. Many women and some men in attendance are frank about wanting to vote for a woman in 2020. Outside her town halls, independent vendors often sell merchandise referencing Warren\u2019s potential to be the first woman president \u2014 \u201cMadame President\u201d T-shirts and Rosie the Riveter buttons with Warren\u2019s face superimposed.\n\nWarren\u2019s approach, however, expands beyond gender in ways that Gillibrand\u2019s did not. Monday evening\u2019s location signaled that the campaign isn\u2019t just about women\u2019s political power, but is also about people contending with unsafe working conditions and low wages.\n\n\u201cIt took 18 minutes for 146 people to die. Mostly women. Mostly immigrants \u2014 Jewish and Italian,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly people who made as little as $5 a week to get their shot at the American dream.\u201d\n\nWarren recounted the story of the atrocity in vivid detail before connecting it to her plan, announced Monday morning , to tackle corporate power that she believes again has a stranglehold on the political process 108 years later.\n\nShe described a cycle of factory owners doling out campaign donations, cozying up to legislators and blocking reform.\n\n\u201cDoes any of that sound familiar?\u201d she asked. \u201cTake any big problem we have in America today and you don\u2019t have to dig very deep to see the same system at work.\u201d\n\nShe then rolled out what she called \u201cthe biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate,\u201d which includes drastically curtailing the lobbying industry, in part by banning senators, Congress members and cabinet secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists.\n\nShe would require meetings between lobbyists and elected officials to be made public and would abolish political donations from lobbyists in contact with the same government officials, calling the practice \u201cthe very definition of bribery.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s Senate office told POLITICO that she would reintroduce a previous bill she sponsored, called the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d Her ban on lobbyists engaging in fundraising activities is likely to face legal challenges.\n\nBut such nuances did not seem to phase the crowd, which cheered on Monday when Warren said, \u201cI know what\u2019s broken, I\u2019ve got a plan to fix it, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president of the United States.\u201d\n\nFollowing her remarks, supporters filed over to take selfies with her. One woman, 45-year-old Heather Quick, said she was deciding whether to support Warren or Sanders in the primary.\n\nShe said she was moved by Warren\u2019s mention of criminal justice reform Monday night and had heard most of the rest of her stump speech.\n\n\u201cI like that the spine of her talk was the Triangle Shirtwaist fire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a brilliant move to work that into her speech, which obviously leads you into the women\u2019s role in political change and unionizing.\u201d\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Sept. 16, 2019.", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re here because of some hard-working women,\u201d Warren said.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg", "Alex Thompson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f5/5e/dded79c84ceab05d42fdeea8f490/0916warren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
