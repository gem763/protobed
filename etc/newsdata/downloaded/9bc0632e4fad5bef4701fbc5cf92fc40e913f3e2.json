'The light went green and we were hit hard! We wondered what we had done wrong, if we had neglected something. Surely we had neglected something!\n\n'In between the matches, people at my daughter's school and all around the city were saying: 'OK, now things are different, we feel it'.\n\n'Everyone thought that we were going to qualify and go further, but we didn't do it. And I had the impression that, afterwards, everyone said: 'Ah\u2026 it's not changed, it's like in previous years'.\n\n'And we thought: 'No, no, no, it's not the same'. But we were totally helpless. It was like sand flowing through our hands without being able to hold it back.'\n\nTuchel explained what an impact the defeat had both on him and the squad.\n\n'In the days that followed, we felt how disappointed we were,' he said. 'I spent three days in total darkness. It was like something I had never known before.'\n\nPSG have made a promising start to their latest European campaign, recording a 3-0 home win over Real Madrid before beating Galatasaray 1-0 in their second group game.", "description": "Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel has revealed he was left feeling 'helpless' after being sucker-punched by Manchester United in last season's Champions League.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483836-0-image-a-5_1570613872942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
