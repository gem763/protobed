So it felt like old times Monday night when the Late Show host spent a few minutes mocking the Utah senator\u2019s newly revealed secret Twitter account.\n\nThe revelation came from a profile in The Atlantic titled \u201cThe Liberation of Mitt Romney,\u201d \u201cwhich I know sounds like a mid-\u201970s erotic novella,\u201d Colbert joked, \u201cbut it\u2019s actually about Romney\u2019s role as a critic of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nRomney wouldn\u2019t tell reporter McKay Coppins the name of the account, but did give some hints, like the number of people he follows, including a few late-night comedians. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name, the big redhead from Boston?\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cHe has a name, sir! It\u2019s Ginger O\u2019Pale-Body,\u201d Colbert replied as Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s photo appeared on screen. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a friend!\u201d\n\nUltimately, Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg deduced that the account in question goes by the name \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d and Romney confirmed the hunch by saying, \u201cC\u2019est moi.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Pierre Delecto!\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt sounds like something from French-Canadian soft-core porn.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is the most embarrassing reveal since we found out Lindsey Graham\u2019s secret Twitter handle is \u2018Wolfgang Scrumptious.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have a bone to pick with Pierre, because turns out, Conan\u2019s not the only late-night host he follows,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cHe also likes Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.\u201d With that, he said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to launch our new ad campaign: \u2018Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon: The Choice of Mitt Romney. Watch The Late Show, only on CBS.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Conan O\u2019Brien also picked up on his role in the Romney story on his show earlier in the evening on TBS. \u201cMitt\u2019s like, \u2018Conan, what a weird first name,\u2019\u201d the host joked. \u201cOK, Mitt.\u201d (Romney\u2019s real first name is Willard, for what it\u2019s worth.)", "description": "The \u201cLate Show\u201d host had a \u201cbone to pick\u201d with Romney, who is secretly following every major late-night host but him.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1433,w_2547,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571719596/SC_45_pjlg9r", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
