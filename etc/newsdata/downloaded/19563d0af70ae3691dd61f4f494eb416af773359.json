(AP) - New Mexico coach Bob Davie, who will miss the Lobos\u2019 trip to South Bend to face No. 7 Notre Dame because of an undisclosed health issue, said Tuesday he will eventually be back on the sidelines for the team, though it\u2019s not clear when.\n\nDavie has turned the reins of the team over to offensive line coach Saga Tuitele and he said he will leave the game planning for Saturday\u2019s matchup in the hands of his coaching staff. He said he\u2019ll be back when he\u2019s ready.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m smart enough to know when I\u2019m right and when I\u2019m not,\u201d Davie said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to go charging back down that hill right away until I\u2019m 100%. I\u2019m going to take this slow and I\u2019m going to do this right.\u201d\n\nDavie was taken to the hospital after having what he described as a \u201cserious medical situation\u201d that came on unexpectedly during New Mexico\u2019s season-opening win over Sam Houston State on Aug. 31. \u201cI\u2019m not being too dramatic by saying they saved my life and my family will forever be appreciative,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he wouldn\u2019t elaborate on the health issue, Davie said he expects to make a full recovery. \u201cThere was no permanent damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe immediate situation was very serious but, hopefully, as I said, there\u2019s no permanent damage and I will be able to go on to live a nice, healthy life.\u201d\n\nDavie said he was disappointed to be missing the trip to Notre Dame, where he was the head coach from 1997 to 2001. Still, he is glad the players are getting a chance to face the Irish.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, whenever we kind of entertained the idea with this game with Notre Dame, obviously, this isn\u2019t the script we envisioned,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me, this is about the players and the coaches. To have the chance to watch the game on television, to watch our guys play, I\u2019m excited to see it.\u201d\n\nDavie is in his eighth season leading New Mexico, where he is 34-54. He compiled a 35-25 record during his time at Notre Dame.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New Mexico coach Bob Davie, who will miss the Lobos' trip to South Bend to face No. 7 Notre Dame because of an undisclosed health issue, said Tuesday he will eventually be back on the sidelines for the team, though it's not clear when.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Glen Rosales"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/new_mexico-davie_football_90957_c0-140-2000-1306_s1770x1032.jpg?0fa61d4a98becc28880d15c803b34fbdc6c4aae5", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
