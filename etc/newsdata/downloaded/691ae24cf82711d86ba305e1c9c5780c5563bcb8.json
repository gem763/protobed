We have to take you back [to Riyadh],\" Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a senior Saudi intelligence officer and the bodyguard of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said.\n\n\"There is an order from Interpol. Interpol demanded you be returned. We are here to take you,\" Mutreb is quoted as saying.\n\nKhashoggi responded: \"There are no lawsuits against me. My fiancee is waiting outside for me.\"\n\nIn the last 10 minutes before he was killed, Mutreb asked Khashoggi to \"leave a message for your son\", saying not to worry if he could not reach the journalist.\n\nWhen Khashoggi refused, Mutreb said: \"Write it, mister Jamal. Hurry up. Help us so we can help you, because in the end we will take you back to Saudi Arabia and if you don't help us you know what will happen eventually.\"\n\nThe operatives then drugged the Saudi journalist. His last words before losing consciousness were: \"I have asthma. Do not do it, you will suffocate me.\"\n\nSound of an autopsy saw dismembering the 59-year-old's body can be heard at 1.39pm local time. The procedure lasted 30 minutes.\n\nHis body is yet to be recovered.\n\nTurkey has called Khashoggi's killing \"premeditated murder\" orchestrated by the Saudi government.\n\nSaudi officials have countered that claim, insisting Khashoggi was killed in a \"rogue operation\", after initially claiming he had left the building before vanishing.\n\n'I listen to music when I cut'\n\nSaudi authorities have charged 11 unnamed suspects over Khashoggi's murder, including five who could face the death penalty on charges of \"ordering and committing the crime\".\n\nThe CIA has reportedly concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, which officials in Riyadh deny.\n\nDuring trials in Riyadh on Sunday, Daily Sabah revealed some of the statements of the hitmen who killed Khashoggi.\n\nIn the audio recorded minutes before Khashoggi entered the consulate building, Mutreb asked whether it will \"be possible to put the trunk in a bag\".\n\nIn response, Salah Mohammed Abdah Tubaigy, a well-known Saudi forensics doctor, replied: \"No. Too heavy, very tall too.\"\n\nHe added: \"Actually, I've always worked on cadavers. I know how to cut very well. I have never worked on a warm body though, but I'll also manage that easily.\n\n\"I normally put on my earphones and listen to music when I cut cadavers. In the meantime, I sip on my coffee and smoke. After I dismember it, you will wrap the parts into plastic bags, put them in suitcases and take them out [of the building].\"\n\nKhashoggi's killing provoked widespread revulsion and marred the image of the crown prince.\n\nA report in the Washington Post in April said Saudi Arabia gave Khashoggi's four children \"million-dollar houses\" and \"monthly five-figure payments\" as compensation for the killing of their father.", "description": "Turkish newspaper publishes detailed transcript of Saudi hit squad in the final moments of journalist's assassination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7973/a95d0e631bf647899df5aa67a9cded0e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
