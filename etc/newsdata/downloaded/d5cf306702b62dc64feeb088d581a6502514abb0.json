The Second Intifada began in September 2000 with calls for violence following then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\u2019s visit to the Temple Mount, a holy site for Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem. More than 4,000 people were killed in the following weeks after Palestinian leaders unleashed a deadly wave of suicide bombings.\n\nLast year, the European Parliament passed legislation geared to prevent hateful content in Palestinian educational materials, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nISRAELI DRONES STRIKE PALESTINIAN BASE OPERATED BY HEZBOLLAH ALLY\n\nIMPACT-se and other organizations also presented examples of anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish content in Palestinian textbooks last month at the 99th session of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in Switzerland.\n\n\"For the first time a United Nations committee called on the Palestinians to halt hate speech following IMPACT-se\u2019s presentation to the committee (CERD) of anti-Semitism and hate in Palestinian textbooks,\u201d said Sheff, referencing a report issued by CERD last week which he said included unprecedented wording.\n\nSheff also noted that legislation introduced in the United States in April of this year has the goal of preventing hate in school curricula.\n\n\u201cLegislation passing through the House Foreign Affairs Committee, H.R.2343, is an opportunity for the U.S. Congress to add its voice to that of the European Parliament and the United Nations in demanding that the hate in the curriculum is removed once and for all,\u201d Sheff said.\n\nThe legislation, known as the Peace and Tolerance in Palestinian Education Act, would \u201crequire the Secretary of State to submit annual reports reviewing the educational material used by the Palestinian Authority or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in the West Bank and Gaza, and for other purposes.\u201d\n\nThe bill says the new Palestinian curricula \u201cfail to meet the international standards of peace and tolerance\u201d and textbooks \u201cdemonize Israel, encourage war, and teach children that Palestinian statehood can be achieved through violence.\u201d\n\nThe legislation is sponsored by Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., and has bipartisan support, including from Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y.\n\nSheff told Fox News despite the protests from Europe, the U.S. and the U.N., nothing has changed.\n\n\u201c[It's] the first week of the new school year and no changes have been made,\u201d Sheff said. \u201cThe Palestinian Authority is ignoring international institutions\u2019 concerns over hate in its curriculum.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cWhat is clear is it is a strategic decision by the Palestinian Authority to radicalize 1.3 million school children. This curriculum was not created by accident.\u201d\n\nSheff said IMPACT-se will continue to present its findings to Congress, the U.N. and legislators around the world, \u201cparticularly those donor countries that fund the Palestinian Ministry of Education.\u201d\n\nHe said the institute will continue to demand that the curriculum is changed and that \"Palestinian children are taught that the way to resolve conflict is through peacemaking and not continual war.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNeither the Palestinian Ministry of Education nor the Palestinian U.N. mission immediately responded to Fox News\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nFox News' Ben Evansky contributed to this report.", "description": "The\u00a0Palestinian Authority's current school curriculum\u00a0\u201cis more radical than the curriculum that came before\u201d and \u201cis suffused with ideas of martyrdom, [and]\u00a0Jihad,\u201d according to an international monitoring organization.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
