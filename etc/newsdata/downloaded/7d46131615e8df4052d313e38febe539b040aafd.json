They appeared calm after the verdict was delivered, and Chan bowed to supporters clapping for them outside the court. The trio had pleaded not guilty to all charges, which each carry a maximum seven years jail.\n\nTai, speaking to Reuters before the verdict, said: \"We will still continue our struggle for democracy,\n\n\"The reason that we committed civil disobedience is because we want justice for Hong Kong people.\"\n\nIn a summary of his judgement, Justice Johnny Chan noted that while the concept of civil disobedience is \"recognised in Hong Kong\", it wasn't a defence to a criminal charge.\n\n\"The offence of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance does not have the undesirable effect of curtailing or suppressing civil disobedience at its formation stage or suppressing human rights as the defendants contended,\" the summary read.\n\nThe six other defendants include pro-democracy legislators Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, two former student leaders Eason Chung and Tommy Cheung, activist Raphael Wong, and veteran democrat Lee Wing-tat, were also found guilty of at least one public nuisance charge.\n\nNo sentences were immediately given by the judge.\n\nThe nine defendants were accused of inciting and mobilising protesters during the pro-democracy demonstrations that blocked major roads in several parts of the global financial hub for 79 days in late 2014, in one of the boldest populist challenges against Beijing in decades.\n\nThe demonstrators were finally cleared away by police, having won no democratic concessions from the government.\n\nSince the city returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, critics say China has reneged on its commitment to maintain Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms under a co-called \"one country, two systems\" arrangement.\n\nIn the more than four years since the Occupy protests, democracy activists, diplomats and business leaders have expressed grave concerns over what they say is Beijing's tightening grip on the city's freedoms.\n\n(Reporting by James Pomfret and Jessie Pang; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "description": "Hong Kong Occupy leaders found guilty for role in mass rallies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/78/75/94/1000x563_cmsv2_acd74e50-91f6-5987-9807-3209a4040f97-3787594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
