The trial is now set to resume on December 5.\n\nJustice delayed is surely justice denied.\n\nFrom April last year to March this year, 52 420 sexual offences were reported, of which 41 853 were rape cases.\n\nThat represents an increase of 4.6% from the previous year.\n\nAs horrific as these statistics are, it is important to point out that only one in nine rape cases are actually reported to the SA Police Service.\n\nThis is due to secondary victimisation and the structural realities of patriarchy in our society which silence survivors.\n\nRead: Can we change the violence conversation to include men?\n\nThe Constitutional Court has acknowledged these structural realities, stating: \u201cThe systemic exploitation of women and children depends on secrecy, fear and shame. Too often, survivors are stifled by fear of their abusers and the possible responses from their communities if they disclose that they had been sexually assaulted ... They [survivors] are threatened into silence.\u201d\n\nThe scourge of gender-based violence has reached epidemic levels and constitutes a national crisis.\n\nLast month, President Cyril Ramaphosa proposed several emergency measures to address the crisis.\n\nThe second pillar of this plan is to strengthen the criminal justice system.\n\nThis involves the establishment of an additional 11 dedicated sexual offences courts.\n\nWhile we welcome these endeavours, we wish to draw the president\u2019s attention to one glaring omission from these emergency measures: the finalisation of the draft regulations into sexual offences courts.\n\nWhile more sexual offences courts are required, we need to first ensure that the existing courts function effectively.\n\nGender-based violence is fuelled by impunity because perpetrators are seldom held accountable.\n\nThis is primarily because of a trust deficit between survivors and the criminal justice system.\n\nSurvivors feel reluctant to come forward because they encounter a dehumanising and callous criminal justice system that renders them more traumatised and left without justice.\n\nThe draft regulations set out minimum standards for sexual offences courts to enable quality service delivery that treats survivors with the respect and dignity they deserve. Important aspects of these regulations include: . Establishing child-friendly facilities;\n\n. Ensuring that there is a social worker at every court; . Enabling a court preparation programme for survivors to be guided through the justice system; . Ensuring that every sexual offences court has personnel who can provide \u201ctrauma containment, trauma debriefing and trauma counselling to complainants and witnesses\u201d; and . Ensuring that judges and magistrates who are appointed to sexual offences courts have sufficient experience to deal with such cases in a sensitive and appropriate manner.\n\nSonke Gender Justice, which has a footprint across the country, currently monitors several gender-based violence cases, many of which experience chronic delays and constant postponements.\n\n\n\nThese delays cause great anguish and suffering for survivors, their families and the community at large.\n\nThese chronic delays are inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s objectives to establish a \u201cnon-sexist\u201d society based on \u201chuman dignity, equality and freedom\u201d.\n\nThey make a mockery of the constitutional right of women and girls to freedom from violence \u2013 from both public and private sources.\n\nOne case in point is the Butterworth Magistrates\u2019 Court which houses a fully equipped sexual offences court with all the specialised facilities.\n\nWhile the court currently serves as a hybrid, incidents of sexual violence in the community are so prevalent that the court could be dedicated to hearing cases of this nature.\n\nSadly, this court sees several unnecessary postponements largely because of the unavailability of magistrates as they travel to various courts in the Eastern Cape based on a rotation roster.\n\nIt should be noted that the Eastern Cape had the third highest number of reported rape cases in the 2018/2019 financial year, behind Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nJustice delayed is surely justice denied. From April last year to March this year, 52 420 sexual offences were reported, of which 41 853 were rape cases.\n\nHaving a dedicated magistrate to oversee sexual offences in Butterworth would expedite court proceedings and bring much-needed healing and justice to survivors and affected community members.\n\n\n\nThe Butterworth court has been identified as being ideal to service many of the surrounding towns.\n\nThe chronic delays and postponements result in secondary trauma for survivors and their families. This also makes survivors reluctant to press charges.\n\nIt is only by creating an effective and responsive criminal justice system that survivors can be encouraged to come forward.\n\nThis will also bring an end to the culture of \u201csecrecy, shame and fear\u201d which the Constitutional Court so aptly described.\n\nWe therefore call on the president, Justice Minister Ronald Lamola and the Office of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to urgently finalise the draft regulations on sexual offences courts.\n\nThis should form part of the emergency measures to address the scourge of gender-based violence in our society.\n\nAmpofo-Anti and Leung work for Sonke Gender Justice", "description": "While Ramaphosa\u2019s proposed emergency measures to address the gender-based violence crisis are welcome, we need to act swiftly, write Ohene Yaw Ampofo-Anti and Kayan Leung.", "authors": ["Ohene Yaw Ampofo-Anti", "Kayan Leung"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9360/3c6e84cf79134490abeb23aca580ac1d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
