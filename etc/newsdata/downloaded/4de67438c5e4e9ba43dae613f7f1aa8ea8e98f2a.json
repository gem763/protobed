President Trump, though, has been deemed notably discordant with the images many artists wish to portray.\n\nThe latest case study involves the Prince estate, which objected to the Trump campaign\u2019s playing the Minneapolis music legend\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d before a rally in the late artist\u2019s hometown on Thursday night. The estate tweeted a statement afterward noting that, \u201cThe Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs.\u201d It added a copy of a letter from a Trump campaign lawyer dated Oct. 15, 2018, that confirmed \u201cthe Campaign will not use Prince\u2019s music in connection with its activities going forward.\u201d Oops.\n\nRead more: Scandalous: Prince\u2019s estate sees red over Trump\u2019s use of \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 at rally\n\nThis comes just a week after Nickelback got Twitter TWTR, +2.07% to remove the band\u2019s doctored \u201cPhotograph\u201d video from a Trump tweet, citing copyright infringement.\n\nWho else has objected to being on Trump\u2019s playlist?\n\nWhen Trump first announced his presidential bid at Trump Tower in June 2015 by playing Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World,\u201d the artist\u2019s label responded that \u201cNeil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America,\u201d and that Trump was \u201cnot authorized\u201d to use the song. A Trump spokesperson told Rolling Stone at the time, however, that the campaign had \u201cpaid for and obtained the legal right\u201d to play the song.\n\nIndeed, intellectual-property lawyer Danwill Schwender wrote in his 2017 article \u201cThe Copyright Conflict Between Musicians and Political Campaigns Spins Around Again\u201d that because most artists give rights to perform their music to performance rights organizations (PROs), from which venues and events can then license the songs, that means the artists don\u2019t need to be consulted about the playing of their music at events. So political campaigns can pay for the rights and use them, even if the artist objects.\n\nMick Jagger learned this the hard way after the Rolling Stones repeatedly asked Trump to \u201ccease all use\u201d of their songs. Jagger conceded artists \u201ccan\u2019t stop\u201d people from playing their songs during a Twitter Q&A a month before the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThey can play what they want,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately the Trump campaign is using loopholes in the various venues\u2019 blanket performance licenses which were not intended for such craven political purposes, without the songwriters\u2019 consent.\n\n\n\nCan u say \u201cshitbags?!\u201d\ud83d\udca9 \u2014 Axl Rose (@axlrose) November 4, 2018\n\nBut a PRO known as Broadcast Music Inc. did take the step of creating a separate license for \u201cpolitical entities and organizations,\u201d which includes a clause that lets musicians pull their music from the license \u201cfor any reason\u201d before or after it\u2019s been used in a way they don\u2019t like, Entertainment Weekly reported. So that\u2019s how Queen was able to stop the Trump camp from using its songs after \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d was played at 2016 Republican National Convention, where Trump formally accepted his party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nAn unauthorised use at the Republican Convention against our wishes - Queen \u2014 Queen (@QueenWillRock) July 19, 2016\n\nOther artists, such as Aerosmith, have cited the Lanham Act, which prohibits \u201cany false designation or misleading description or representation of fact \u2026 likely to cause confusion \u2026 as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person.\u201d In other words, by playing an artist\u2019s song at a rally, a politician could make the audience think that musician supports the campaign.\n\nProblem is, such cases are hard to prosecute \u2014 especially after an artist publicly denounces any affiliation with a candidate, which an attorney can argue would remove any confusion about whether the artist supports a candidate.\n\nR.E.M., Adele, Ozzy Osbourne, Rihanna and Pharrell Williams are among the ranks of artists unhappy about being played at Trump events. But politicians on both sides of the aisle have been called out by performers for using their songs.\n\nR&B tenor Sam Moore, of the duo Sam and Dave, asked Barack Obama to stop playing \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Coming\u2019\u201d during his 2008 presidential campaign. (Audience members were changing the lyrics to, \u201cHold on, Obama\u2019s comin\u2019 \u201d.) Moore at the time wrote, \u201cI have not agreed to endorse you for the highest office in our land. ... My vote is a very private matter between myself and the ballot box.\u201d\n\nMoore later performed at Obama\u2019s inaugural ball with Sting and Elvis Costello.\n\nCyndi Lauper chided the Democratic National Committee for using her 1986 hit \u201cTrue Colors\u201d in a 2012 attack ad against Mitt Romney. She tweeted, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted that song to be used in that way,\u201d adding. \u201cMr. Romney can discredit himself without the use of my work.\u201d\n\nWhoever used my song should have asked, and 2, realized that Mr Romney can discredit himself without the use of my work.
