Ed Rendell said he penned the op-ed not at the behest or with the knowledge of former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign. | Lisa Lake/Getty Images for Pennsylvania Conference for Women 2020 Elections Rendell lights pre-debate stink bomb The former DNC chair and Pennsylvania governor gives voice to what other rival campaigns have said privately about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s fundraising approach.\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee chairman and Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell sparked a firestorm on social media by escalating attacks on Elizabeth Warren ahead of Thursday\u2019s closely watched debate, assailing her as a \u201chypocrite\u201d in an op-ed.\n\nThe article, published Wednesday evening in The Washington Post, came days after Rendell, a top surrogate for Joe Biden, was quoted in The New York Times saying that Warren \"didn\u2019t have any trouble\u201d taking his money until she swore off high-dollar fundraisers for her presidential bid this year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHours before Thursday night\u2019s debate, Rendell yet again stepped up his offensive on Warren by devising a new moniker for her supporters: \"Elizabeth Elites.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Elizabeth Elites have been pounding me on Twitter,\u201d Rendell told POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019ve always been somewhat a target for the Bernie Bots because of 2016, but today I\u2019m in great favor with the Bernie Bots. They really liked the column.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of some Democrats, it\u2019s Rendell who\u2019s the hypocrite.\n\n\"You guys know that Ed Rendell has been awful for a really long time, right?\u201d quipped Pod Save America co-host and Obama White House alumni Tommy Vietor on Twitter.\n\nRendell\u2019s blitz against Warren is the clearest sign yet by Biden\u2019s backers that they see her as a big threat. Warren has risen in the polls in recent months to tie with Bernie Sanders for second place, squarely behind Biden.\n\nRendell's comments have also given voice to what other rival campaigns have said privately about Warren\u2019s fundraising approach.\n\nBrian Fallon, former press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, speculated on Twitter that Rendell\u2019s anti-Warren op-ed was an attempt to \u201cmake it up to Biden\u201d after he told POLITICO that even Biden\u2019s supporters are \u201cnervous as hell\u201d about his primary campaign.\n\n\u201cEd Rendell frequently shoots his mouth off in a way that hurts his friends. He did it frequently to Clinton,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nBoth Rendell and Biden's advisers, however, insist he didn\u2019t tell the campaign beforehand about his Wednesday op-ed that assailed the Massachusetts senator for bashing big-money fundraisers after using them herself in past years.\n\nBiden\u2019s camp isn\u2019t disavowing what Rendell said \u2014 and his aides are staying officially silent as Rendell\u2019s attacks on Warren began trending on social media.\n\nOne Biden adviser said Rendell\u2019s column \u201cwent off like a bomb ... we didn\u2019t know it was coming.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t an unwanted bomb: Another Biden adviser indicated that the campaign \u201cdidn\u2019t pitch him on this\u201d but is nonetheless embracing the fallout of his sortie.\n\n\u201cI mean, he raised some fair points,\u201d the second adviser said about Warren saying she won\u2019t hold high-dollar fundraisers while having transferred $10.4 million from her Senate campaign account that was raised partly from large contributions.\n\n\u201cThis debate is and should be a policy debate, not one based on personal attacks,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate we are looking to have on stage tonight.\u201d\n\nRendell said he penned the op-ed not at the behest or with the knowledge of the Biden campaign, but simply because the Post called him after he was interviewed by the Times. The Post confirmed that it solicited the op-ed.\n\nAsked whether he received feedback from the Biden campaign about his op-ed, he said he did not. However, he said, Biden\u2019s backers loved it.\n\n\u201cI got contacted by Biden supporters all over, saying \u2018great column,\u2019\u201d Rendell said.", "description": "The former DNC chair and Pennsylvania governor gives voice to what other rival campaigns have said privately about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s fundraising approach.", "authors": ["Holly Otterbein", "Marc Caputo"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/34/b0/0eb9cbb8443399ad2e4c93329b28/190912-rendell-getty-773.jpg"}
