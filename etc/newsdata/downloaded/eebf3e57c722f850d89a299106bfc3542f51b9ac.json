Get caught up and ready to get on with the weekend, because it\u2019s hard keeping pace in a digital traffic jam.\n\nHere\u2019s what you missed while you were away.\n\nWhen Arnold met Greta\n\nWhen Arnold Schwarzenegger was introduced to 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg at a European environmental summit earlier this year, he was thoroughly impressed. (Join the club, Arnold.)\n\nAnd then, when he learned she\u2019d be making a North American tour, he offered to set his new friend up with one of the greenest ways to get around: a Tesla Model 3. Thunberg travelled to Montreal to participate in the climate strike along with approximately 500,000 others, and is continuing on to other events elsewhere in North America.\n\n70-year-old B.C. driver given ticket for having cell phone in cup holder\n\nWhere do you keep your cell phone when you\u2019re driving? Obviously, it\u2019s illegal to hold it in your hand and use it \u2013 that\u2019s distracted driving \u2013 but one senior citizen in B.C. was shocked to receive a ticket this week for having her smartphone charging in a cup holder.\n\nRandi Kramer, who\u2019s had a clean driving record for the last 50 years or so, was issued a $368 ticket for distracted driving, despite not being distracted by her phone at all. Kramer plans to fight the ticket and her story has already got the attention of a local lawyer.\n\nThe new C8 convertible arrives with folding hardtop\n\nThe 2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray was unveiled this week, and unlike the initial C8 launch that nearly broke the internet earlier this summer, there\u2019s not so much to report on. The new model will be available with a folding hardtop only, and be powered by the same plant as the coupe: a 6.2-litre 490-horsepower V8.\n\nChevy chose to reveal the convertible at the Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Rocket Garden in Orlando, Florida as a nod to all the astronauts who\u2019ve driven \u2018Vettes over the years. The 2020 Corvette convertible will start at $78,998 when it arrives in Canada next spring.\n\nWatch Tesla owners damage their cars using the new Smart Summon feature\n\nA new software update downloaded into Teslas around the world last weekend, teaching the electric vehicles a highly anticipated new trick. Smart Summon automatically pilots empty cars across parking lots or driveways to their drivers, who summon them with the press of a button on an app.\n\nBut despite the word \u201cSmart\u201d being right there in the name, and Tesla officially reminding driver they \u201care still responsible for [their] car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times,\u201d the new feature has occasionally hit a few snags. Or, more accurately, other vehicles and garage doors.\n\nCheck out some of the Smart Summon fails caught on camera and already making the rounds online.\n\nRussian YouTuber tests how many spokes your car wheel actually needs\n\nHow many spokes is enough spokes? Sure, all of them would be ideal, but when push came to shove, how many could you still drive with? Like, if you literally pushed and shoved (or cut) the spokes off the wheels, like this Russian YouTuber did, how far would you get? Turns out, pretty far!\n\nThe Garage 54 YouTube channel, which is dedicated to these kind of automotive \u201ctorture tests,\u201d fits an old car with a bunch of tires with a varying number of the alloy spokes removed, and basically drives around on them until they break. The language dubbing is bearable, but the video itself is highly entertaining.", "description": "Arnold\u2019s gift to Greta Thunberg, Tesla\u2019s troubled Smart Summon feature, a questionable distracted driving charge and more top headlines from this week", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/tesla-model-3.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
