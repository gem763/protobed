Three hours. One stage. A Texas showdown. This Thursday, Democratic White House 2020 hopefuls meet for round three of the party\u2019s presidential debates as the contest for the party\u2019s nomination enters a new, more urgent stage.\n\nThe Houston hothouse will be the first time the party\u2019s top contenders appear together on a single night.\n\nAs Houston readies to host the next 2020 debates, focus turns to gun control Read more\n\nAmong the most highly anticipated face-to-faces of the evening will be between former vice-president Joe Biden and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who have yet to share a stage in this race.\n\nWarren is jostling with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to be the leading progressive alternative to Biden, who has maintained a comfortable lead over his rivals despite a summer of gaffes and miscues.\n\nBeyond the top three candidates, the California senator Kamala Harris and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg are looking to recreate the momentum that propelled their candidacies earlier in the race. Further down the run, candidates such as the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and the only non-politician, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, need a breakout moment that will jumpstart their lagging campaigns.\n\nBut a strong debate performance must have a second act, said Mo Elleithee, a former spokesman of the Democratic National Committee who is now the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do the next day or the next week after the debate?\u201d Elleithee said. \u201cThese debates don\u2019t tend to have winners. They have moments that a candidate can use as a springboard.\u201d\n\nJudy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa, said voters are still undecided between the many Democrats running for the White House and the debate could help narrow their choice.\n\n\u201cVoters are looking for authenticity,\u201d she said. \u201cA candidate who can shake off their pre-written notes, talking points and stump speech \u2013 a candidate who seems like they\u2019re going off script to address issues with the same sense of urgency and energy that we feel here on the ground in Iowa as Democrats \u2013 I think that would really resonate.\u201d\n\nElectability \u2013 a fraught and elusive measure of the candidate most likely to be successful in a general election \u2013 is front of mind for many voters.\n\nBiden has portrayed himself as the strongest choice against Donald Trump, pointing to polling that shows him ahead of the president in head-to-head match-ups. Polling suggests Democrats agree.\n\nAsked which Democrat has the best chance of beating Trump, 42% of registered Democrats chose Biden compared with 14% who said Sanders and 12% who picked Warren, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. The same poll asked Democrats who they thought would be the \u201cbest president for the country\u201d, the result looked starkly different: 23% said Biden, 19% said Warren and 16% said Sanders.\n\nBiden is preparing again for an all-out assault on his record and his approach. He and Warren have longstanding differences over bankruptcy law and other financial and regulatory issues.\n\nThe Ohio representative Tim Ryan, one of 10 Democratic hopefuls who did not qualify for the Houston debate, told Bloomberg News recently that he thought Biden was \u201cdeclining\u201d. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily.\u201d\n\nWarren emerged from the first two debates in Miami and Detroit largely unscathed. She and Sanders worked together to fend off attacks from lower-polling moderate candidates in Detroit, where Warren delivered one of the most memorable lines of the event: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for.\u201d\n\nBut she may receive a few jabs on Thursday. On the campaign trail, several candidates have noted that \u201cplans\u201d are not enough \u2013 a shot at Warren\u2019s voluminous roster of policy proposals that inspired her campaign mantra: \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d\n\nHarris entered the debates with an explosive performance in June but she has struggled to sustain the momentum she built.\n\nHer searing \u2013 and surprisingly personal attack \u2013 on Biden over his record on race boosted her standing in the polls and led to a rush of donations but the moment proved fleeting.\n\nBakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative who supports Harris, said the former California attorney general had demonstrated that she is \u201cuniquely qualified to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump\u201d. Now he believes she must show voters that she is, as she has described herself, a \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s on stage having fun and she\u2019s smiling and laughing,\u201d Sellers said, \u201cshe\u2019s winning the debate.\u201d\n\nButtigieg had a furious rise from near-obscurity to the front of the Democratic field earlier this year. His prodigious fundraising has helped his campaign build a massive field operation in Iowa, which holds the first in the nation primary contest, but it hasn\u2019t translated yet in polling.\n\nThe Virginia representative Don Beyer, who endorsed Buttigieg, says Democratic voters have a history of gravitating toward \u201cyoung, articulate candidates with bold, fresh ideas\u201d. Beyer has seen it before: he was an early supporter of Barack Obama, endorsing the future president when he was still trailing behind Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cIn the middle is the perfect place to be at this point in September,\u201d Beyer said.\n\nBooker, whose widely praised debate performance in Detroit was not matched by growth in the polls, couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to win the summer of 2019,\u201d Booker told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cI want to win the primaries of 2020.\u201d\n\nAsked how he intends to stand out on such a crowded stage, Booker rubbed his pate: \u201cI believe I\u2019m the only bald person on that stage.\u201d", "description": "Party\u2019s top contenders will appear on a single night as some look for a breakout moment to jumpstart lagging campaigns", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8426edcd687766dafd0ad2e6f218997844a576/0_61_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=699251a3f393eed532256bf0ec951a65", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
