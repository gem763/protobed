It stuns me most days. I can't believe they're anything to do with me. They're just such great people.\"\n\nHe said: \"When the kids' mum died, it was a very difficult period and we went through a lot.\n\n\"It was very hard. She suffered a great deal and my ambition is to make sure that we have come out of it alright, and I hope that's what's happening.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Yorke says he could be difficult in Radiohead's early days\n\nYorke told the show: \"I'm lucky now because I have a new partner who has come and brought a light into all of it, which has taken a great deal of strength.\n\n\"And really if all that's OK... If I'm able to make some music that expresses all that and is still important to people, that's more than I can ask for.\"\n\nYorke also spoke of how he found it difficult to cope with Radiohead's success initially.\n\n\"I got angry,\" he said. \"I'm an extremely angry person.\n\n\"I put my hands on the steering wheel and I white-knuckled, and I didn't care who I hurt or what I said.\n\n\"Years later I sat down with the guys and apologised.\"\n\nDesert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST and is also available on BBC sounds", "description": "The singer also tells Desert Island Discs he is a \"hypocrite\" for flying while a climate campaigner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A969/production/_108896334_056666319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
