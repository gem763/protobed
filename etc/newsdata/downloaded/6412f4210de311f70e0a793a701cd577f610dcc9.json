He will appear at the Old Bailey on 25 November for a plea and trial preparation hearing.\n\nIguyovwe Ogheneruona, prosecuting, cited the \u201cnature and gravity\u201d of the alleged offences and requested for Robinson to be remanded in custody.\n\nThe district judge Timothy Kay said Robinson\u2019s solicitor Julian Hayes had made no application for bail.\n\n\u201cYou have heard the nature of the allegations you face and the majority of these can only be dealt with in the crown court,\u201d he told Robinson. \u201cI therefore allocate all matters to the central criminal court on 25 November and you will be required to enter your pleas on that occasion.\u201d\n\nRobinson, of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, was arrested shortly after the bodies of eight women and 31 men were found in the refrigerated trailer attached to his Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays in the early hours of 23 October.\n\nEssex police are expected to visit Dublin this week to interview and seek the extradition of a lorry driver arrested at the city\u2019s port on Saturday.\n\nIrish police detained the 23-year-old, from County Down, after he drove his truck off a ferry that had sailed from France.\n\nEssex police have identified the driver as a person of interest in the investigation. He is suspected of having brought the refrigerated trailer in which the bodies were found to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before it travelled on a ferry to England.\n\nHe reportedly spent three days in France and disposed of his phone before returning to Ireland. Gardai detained him on a warrant for assault and criminal damage in an unrelated case.\n\nThere is growing focus on a haulier based in County Monaghan who rented the container in which the migrants died. When the Guardian visited his home, residents who described themselves as relatives said he was not at home. They declined to comment on the case.", "description": "Maurice Robinson, 25, appears in court charged with manslaughter of 39 people", "authors": ["Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816632a45bfa59374fe8e493e58a907cf0b052e0/0_258_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72a25f237b461c98f6632cdc95b838bf", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
