General Hospital\n\nCharlotte's world will be turned upside down because instead of gaining a sister, she will lose both Nina and Sasha. Curtis will be even more motivated to find the codicil to the will and if he does, Valentin will be ousted from his Cassadin throne. In the midst of all of this chaos, there are two situations that may work out and bring joy to a few \"General Hospital\" characters.\n\n'GH' may reveal Wiley's identity and pair Jax with Nina\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of \"General Hospital,\" Nina ran outside the church after Sasha confessed to being a fraud.\n\nShe ran into Jax, who was late getting to the ceremony. He took her to a location where she could have some privacy and Nina confessed that Sasha was not her daughter. Ms. Reeves cried as she lamented that she has no child, but she does. Spoiler alerts and rumors have suggested that Willow Tate is the biological child of Silas Clay and Nina Reeves.\n\nThe \"General Hospital\" rumor mill teased that Harmony will admit to Willow that she was adopted.\n\nShe may even produce the other half of the locket that matches the one Madeline left for Nina. Once Nina's true daughter is revealed, perhaps Michael can be reunited with Wiley/Noah. The rumor mill says Nelle may soon be released on parole, so it looks like things are moving in the right direction. It could work out so that Willow ends up with Michael and could be Wiley's stepmom. Jax and Nina might link up, which would devastate Valentin.\n\nThese are projections, but be sure to stay tuned to the action in Port Charles to find out what actually happens.", "description": "Nina's broken heart could lead her to bed with Jax, contention will rise between Charlotte's parents, Obrecht and Valentin will seek revenge.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Susan B.", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Cheryl Preston", "Faith", "Conner", "Charlotte Display Bad Behavior On 'Y R'", "'General Hospital' Rumors", "Lulu'S Revelation Causes Pandemonium In Port Charles", "'Y R' Rumors"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/8/os/b_1200x630/nina-found-out-valentin-liesel-and-sasha-were-deceiving-hrimages-sourcegenreal-hospital_2336223.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
