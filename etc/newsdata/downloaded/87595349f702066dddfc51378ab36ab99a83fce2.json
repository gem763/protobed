That speech, which focused on the perils of artificial intelligence, raised eyebrows with its unusual approach.\n\nAnother adviser said key strategist Dominic Cummings, who accompanied the prime minister to the event in Manchester, and Danny Kruger, a former speechwriter to David Cameron in opposition who was made Johnson's political secretary in August, are among those also working on the address.\n\nHistorically, party conference speeches are seen as a key test for British politicians. Aides are determined not to allow a repeat of May's disastrous performance in 2017, when she lost her voice, was the victim of a mid-speech stunt, and the set fell apart behind her.\n\nJohnson faces the added pressure of a succession of negative stories about him in the press as the Tory conference began on Sunday, including having to apologize to the queen after he lost a Supreme Court hearing about his decision to suspend parliament and two separate allegations about his personal conduct.\n\n\u201cThere is no fuzzy felt, we're projecting using the power of the internet \u2026 there is nothing to fall off,\u201d Party Chairman James Cleverly told POLITICO's London Playbook event on Monday evening.\n\nElection push\n\nAlways a chance to rally the party faithful, this year's conference illustrates a leadership team eyeing what they hope will be an imminent election.\n\nWith parliament deadlocked over Brexit, Johnson has pushed for a snap vote in recent weeks but failed to achieve enough support in the House of Commons to trigger one. Opposition MPs say they will not back an election until they have implemented legislation blocking the prime minster from taking the U.K. out of the European Union without a deal.\n\nThe numerous speeches which dominated proceedings in previous years have been replaced by panel discussions among key senior government figures, with party members able to submit their own questions, something advisers say is designed to make members feel more included.\n\nCleverly said the catalyst for change had been the reaction to this summer's leadership campaign events, where members had turned out in large numbers and asked balanced questions.\n\n\"It was a reminder that our party is populated by a breed of really good people and we can trust them not to be daft,\" Cleverly said.\n\nThe party chairman acknowledged that the party had been ill-prepared for the last vote in 2017. Grassroots activists were infuriated by May's 2017 campaign, which saw the party lose its majority.\n\n\u201cIn 2017 we called a surprise attack \u2026 When you initiate a surprise attack, the people being surprised are meant to be the ones being attacked, rather than doing the attacking. This time, we are absolutely ready to fight a general election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added the party would avoid the mistake of the previous campaign, which began by focusing on Brexit but became about \"everything other than Brexit.\"\n\n\"For a lot of people, Brexit was the reason that they gave us a hearing. And in 2017 when we started that conversation we didn't have something valuable for them, and we didn't have something credible to talk about.\n\n\"This time around, the reason we're saying that both parts of the equation matter, get Brexit done, but also invest in the NHS and police and schools, and infrastructure.\"\n\nEmilio Casalicchio contributed reporting.", "description": "British prime minister eyes a general election as he pens his keynote speech to the Tory Party.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Jack Blanchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1178138492-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
