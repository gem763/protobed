Then he lasted two-thirds of an inning before leaving the game and being diagnosed with a strained MCL.\n\nHill, who has appeared in only 11 games this year, suffered the same injury in spring training. It kept him out until the end of April. In light of that, you have to figure he\u2019s likely going to be out for the rest of the year, postseason included.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Dodgers have had a dandy season even without Hill in the rotation for most of it, but it sure would\u2019ve been nice to have him come October. With Hill gone, Ross Stripling is likely to return to the fourth spot in the rotation the rest of the way, which will put him in the postseason rotation.", "description": "Hill was making his first start since June when he went down last night", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uFgw6zoj6tNMWje3h7996w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9pHJhv6ScPUsaKxHzfOYUw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/0aef1f2c6076ec97815433d6f1480663", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
