Adam B. Schiff of California to resign Friday for reading aloud a \u201cfraudulent\u201d version of the president\u2019s phone conversation with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cHe was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, [and] me sound guilty.\u201d\n\nIn all caps, the president tweeted that Mr. Schiff, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \u201cwas desperate and he got caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cHe has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff acknowledged Thursday that he made up parts of the Ukraine phone call transcript when he delivered his opening statement at a high-profile, televised hearing regarding a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Mr. Trump. The lawmaker said his reading was \u201cpart in parody\u201d \u2014 but made the admission only after Rep. Mike Turner, Ohio Republican, called him out.\n\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Schiff said Mr. Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for fabricated dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. Rather than read excerpts from the actual phone conversation, Mr. Schiff read a summary that amounted to his own fabricated interpretation of the call.\n\nThe unnamed whistleblower, reportedly a CIA agent, said the July 25 phone conversation shows that Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to start an investigation of Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, who held a lucrative post with a Ukrainian energy company. Democrats contend Mr. Trump was threatening to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine; Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing, saying it was an \u201cinnocent\u201d call.\n\nThe president also criticized CNN Friday for a \u201cdishonest\u201d report about his tweets against Mr. Schiff.\n\n\u201cTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cLow ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
