Not only that, but the device is relatively affordable \u2014 and it seems as though it has already been discounted by $30 during the pre-order period.\n\nThe discount in particular is for the 128GB model of the iPad, which has a list price of $429.99 \u2014 but has been reduced to $399.99. The device is available in a 32GB model too, but it hasn't been discounted at all.\n\nIn general, the new iPad has a lot going for it. As mentioned, the device features a 10.2-inch display, which is a little bigger than the 9.7-inch display on the last-generation iPad. Under the hood, you'll get a relatively affordable Apple A10 Fusion chip, and the device supports the 1st-generation Apple Pencil\u2014 so you can use the iPad for art and graphic design.\n\nThe iPad is available in a few different colors too \u2014 you can get it in Space Gray, Silver, and Gold, so there should be something there for most users. Safe to say, this is the perfect iPad for those who want something for social media, web browsing, basic gaming, and so on.", "description": "Apple announced a new version of the iPad this week, and if you pre-order the tablet on Amazon you can save $30 right now.", "authors": ["Christian De Looper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7c027d2e22af26ef6eb148-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
