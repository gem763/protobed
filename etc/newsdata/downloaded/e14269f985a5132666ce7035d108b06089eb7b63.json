In September 2018, Guyger shot Jean to death, claiming she entered the wrong unit and mistook him for an intruder. She later pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn Wednesday, Guyger, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nNow, politicians want to know what happened to Brown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartsick for Joshua Brown\u2019s family and friends,\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted Friday. \u201cHe bravely stepped forward and testified to bring some justice for Botham Jean, and peace for his family. We need answers \u2015 and Joshua Brown and his family need justice.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s message echoed that of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who praised Brown\u2019s \u201cselflessness and courage,\u201d and offered prayers for his family and community.\n\n\u201cWe demand answers,\u201d she said.\n\nJoshua Brown\u2019s selflessness and courage brought some justice for his neighbor Botham Jean. We grieve again learning of Joshua\u2019s murder.\n\n\n\nI pray for his family, his community, and all those impacted by this tragedy.\n\n\n\nWe demand answers. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 6, 2019\n\nNew York Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer have also spoken out, disturbed by the second killing.\n\nIn his remarks, Castro called for \u201ca transparent investigation the people of Dallas can trust.\u201d\n\nHorrific and deeply troubling. Sending love and prayers to Joshua Brown\u2019s family. They deserve the justice he ensured for Botham, and we all deserve answers immediately.https://t.co/O0AWIciR82 \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) October 6, 2019\n\nWhen Botham Jean was killed in his own home, his neighbor, Joshua Brown, spoke out and ensured his murderer was held accountable. His death, like Botham\u2019s, was a tragedy\u2014only possible because we have failed to end this epidemic of gun violence. Sending love to his family. https://t.co/PyrGDyJGe4 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 6, 2019\n\nJoshua Brown bravely stood up to injustice and helped put Amber Guyger behind bars. Three days later, he was murdered by an unknown assailant.\n\n\n\nWe grieve with his family and friends, and demand a transparent investigation the people of Dallas can trust. https://t.co/fnIF0tNCMF \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 6, 2019\n\nJoshua Brown's tragic death, just days after courageously testifying against Amber Guyger in the shooting death of Botham Jean, is horrifying. I stand with his family and activists in Dallas to demand answers on how this happened #blacklivesmatter \u2014 Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) October 6, 2019\n\nDuring Guyger\u2019s trial, she claimed that upon seeing Jean, she said, \u201cLet me see your hands\u201d before she shot him. However, Brown, who lived across the hall, testified that he did not hear her say any such commands, instead describing the sound as \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise,\u201d according to the Morning News.\n\nJean\u2019s death sparked outrage as yet another example of lethal use of force by law enforcement on a person of color.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Saturday, Lee Merrit, the lawyer for Jean\u2019s family, said the slaying of Brown \u201cunderscores the reality of the black experience in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cA former athlete turned entrepreneur \u2015 Brown lived in constant fear that he could be the next victim of gun violence, either state sanctioned or otherwise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have more work to do deal with the constant threats to our community both from within and without. Brown deserves the same justice he sought to ensure the Jean family. The Dallas County criminal justice system must [be] mobilized to identify his killer and see that he is held accountable for this murder.\u201d", "description": "Joshua Brown, a key witness in the trial of ex-Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, was shot dead on Friday.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a549f200000d0024e28f5.jpeg?cache=0cuwhdc8v1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
