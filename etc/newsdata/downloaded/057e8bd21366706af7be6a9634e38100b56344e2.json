REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nTime and again on Tuesday, the U.S. lawmaker from Massachusetts faced skepticism from her Democratic rivals about her leftist agenda, ranging from taxing the rich, to potentially costly universal government-run healthcare, to free college tuition.\n\nModerates suggested Warren may not only be too liberal to seize the White House from the Republican Trump in the November\n\n2020 election but that her push for sweeping change would cause another bitter split in the country after Trump\u2019s already divisive presidency.\n\nWarren\u2019s recent surge in the polls \u2013 she is now considered a favourite for the nomination along with former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 made her the top target at the debate, with moderates such as Biden, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, leading the charge.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters after the debate, Klobuchar, a Minnesota lawmaker who is competing with Biden and Buttigieg to appeal to Midwestern swing voters, said Warren needed to explain how she was going to pay for her sweeping proposals.\n\n\u201cI just think I have a better way, and I think it\u2019s also important that she keeps not telling us how she\u2019s going to pay for them,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd, as I said, someone\u2019s going to get that invoice, and she needs to tell us who it is.\u201d\n\nThe debate highlighted the deep schism in the party that remains between its liberals and moderates, as well as persistent questions about Warren\u2019s electability even as she continues to surge in most national polls.\n\nBiden, who has painted himself as the leading centrist alternative to Warren, came into the debate with worries of his own. He has seen some slippage in polls and more recently been the target of a campaign of unsubstantiated allegations by Trump concerning his son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine and China.\n\nBut that issue was only briefly touched upon \u2013 and by Biden himself, who tried to keep the focus instead on Trump and the impeachment inquiry the president faces as a result of a whistleblower complaint that he pressured Ukraine to investigate him and Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden\u2019s team had worked furiously in advance of the debate to defuse the issue, and his rivals showed little appetite for making it an issue.\n\nFor once, Biden was not at the center of the evening, reflecting the evolving nature of the Democratic race.\n\nNO LEFT TURN?\n\nWarren\u2019s advocacy for a universal government-run healthcare based on the Medicare plan for seniors, which could cost trillions of dollars, as well as for free public universities and a tax on the wealthy, has sparked concerns among some Democrats that her platform is politically unrealistic and could alienate independent and moderate voters if she emerges as the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nHer challengers have accused her of being evasive about whether middle-class taxes would have to be raised to pay for her healthcare plan.\n\nAt the debate, Buttigieg accused Warren of wanting \u201cinfinite partisan combat\u201d that would continue to divide the country.\n\nAfterward, Buttigieg, who raised the third-most amount of money among the candidates in the third quarter of the year, told CNN he felt it was important to take Warren on.\n\n\u201cI think people really need to understand the difference in policy and the difference in vision,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa is less than four months away, adding an urgency to the jabs by Buttigieg and Klobuchar, among others, who have struggled to amass support.\n\n\u201cI think there was a real conversation tonight about approach,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina who advised Hillary Clinton\u2019s two presidential campaigns. \u201cThere was an elevated effort to highlight the pragmatic versus the progressive.\u201d\n\nAmid the attacks, Warren stayed firm and vigorously defended her agenda. She ended up with the most screen time of all the candidates.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d she asked at one point, \u201cdoes everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\nThe evening likely will do little to alter the dynamic between Biden and Warren as the party\u2019s two current standard-bearers, although the announcement after the debate that U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders would be endorsed by high-profile progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could spice up the race.\n\nBiden and Warren are fiercely competing for votes in Iowa. Warren is hoping she can seize control of the race by winning there and then in New Hampshire, while Biden is looking to pair a win in Iowa with a victory in majority-black South Carolina, another early voting state.\n\nHe appeared to be addressing Warren directly late in the debate when he referred to other candidates being \u201cvague.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to get it done, and if you can get it done,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren does an interview in the Spin Room after the fourth Democratic U.S. 2020 presidential election debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk\n\nWarren countered by saying she was not afraid to \u201cdream big.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is about knowing what\u2019s broken, knowing how to fix it, and, yes, I\u2019m willing to get out there and fight for it.\u201d\n\nJudging from Tuesday\u2019s debate, that fight is about to grow much more intense.", "description": "The barrage of questions fired at Elizabeth Warren at Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio underscored her new front-runner status in the Democratic presidential race, but also lingering concern within the party over whether the progressive senator can defeat President Donald Trump next year.", "authors": ["James Oliphant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441398478&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0JO", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
