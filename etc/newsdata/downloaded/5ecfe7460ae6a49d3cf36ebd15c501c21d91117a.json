Concerns about audience response to the possibly incendiary \u201cJoker\u201d and dicey PR appearances yielded a fierce drop in critic support. No one was quite sure what to expect.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nThe estimated weekend gross of $93.5 million doesn\u2019t reach the $100-million mark that some event films reach\u2013but those films are rarely rated R. This box office is the best ever for October, besting Marvel\u2019s PG-13 \u201cVenom\u201d last year by $13 million. And with initial international openings raising the initial \u201cJoker\u201d overseas take to close to $250 million, this $55-million Scorsese-inflected character study is already a success.\n\nHow will it hold? So far, so good.\n\nAlas, this weekend the recurrent issue hurting the box office again took its toll. Because other studios stayed out of the way (unlike last year\u2019s opening of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d), total box office dropped about $30 million (about 15%). In fairness, last year\u2019s numbers were boosted by the Columbus Day holiday, which falls next weekend.\n\nThat keeps the 2019 shortfall to around the half-billion mark where it has hovered around for some time, somewhere around 5.5%. With the calendar speeding toward the end of the year, the chances of making up the difference are falling close to zero.\n\nCuriously, October has long lagged in delivering record openers. But \u201cJoker\u201d is an R-rated film with far more appeal to men (64%) than women. It could have done even better.\n\nThe adjusted \u201cJoker\u201d tally ranks #114 all time among openings (fifth best for this year). Even more impressive are the impediments \u201cJoker\u201d overcame: mostly male appeal, R rating, and mixed reviews: Metascore: 58, below the recent \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d which also earned a B+ Cinemascore. Potential safety concerns likely suppressed the turnout. With a modest $55-million budget, even with high-end worldwide marketing costs, \u201cJoker\u201d will be a global success for Warner Bros., whose DC titles haven\u2019t always enjoyed Marvel\u2019s consistent track record.\n\nHoldovers\n\nOnly \u201cAbominable\u201d (Universal) managed more than $10 million. Last year when \u201cVenom\u201d and \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d soared on their opening weekend, two other holdovers fared better than this year\u2019s batch.\n\nThe DreamWorks Animation original dropped 42% to add another $12 million in its second weekend. It\u2019s headed to a not-great $75 million domestic total, but is delivering worldwide with likely its biggest response in China.\n\nOf the three films that opened wide two weeks ago, \u201cAd Astra\u201d and \u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d plummeted while \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d (Focus) is the clear winner, falling a decent 45%, with a $73 million total. The movie could end up hitting $100 million domestic. That\u2019s fantastic for Focus, which has only topped $100 million once ($114 million adjusted for \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d).\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cHustlers\u201d (STX) is holding steady. Still #4 in its fourth weekend, already up to $91 million and headed to a $115 million total. Women drove the success of these two lower-budget titles, which will return major profits. Theaters are grateful.\n\n\u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d (Warner Bros.) has passed $200 million domestically, with $500 million or more worldwide in sight. It\u2019s another mid-budget range hit for the studio, beating out \u201cAd Astra\u201d (20th Century Fox) this weekend. Not surprisingly, James Gray\u2019s well-reviewed but cerebral space story fell 54%. With Brad Pitt driving audiences, \u201cAd Astra\u201d still might reach $150 million worldwide, but it won\u2019t make back its $100-million cost. \u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d (Lionsgate) dipped 59% and won\u2019t reach $50 million domestic.\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d (Roadside Attractions) tripled its theaters and increased its gross by 50% while staying at #7. So far the awards contender\u2019s results are good. Two Indian films, \u201cWar\u201d (Yash Raj) and \u201cSye Raa Narasimha Reddy\u201d (Indican), impressively round out the Top Ten in around 300 theaters each. Even more notably, \u201cMy Dream, My Love\u201d (China Media) in only 70 theaters placed #12.", "description": "Warner Bros. is laughing all the way to the bank as controversy turns 'Joker' into a must-see.", "authors": ["Tom Brueggemann"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ke_9wIEiJoX4Apv2IodDVA--~B/aD02NDY7dz0xMjkyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/indiewire_268/64aeff21a8208cf3b543f9e10ea791da", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
