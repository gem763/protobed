Local outlets remain silent about the kidnappings and the rise in extortion schemes on local businesses. The sharp spike in kidnappings is more troublesome, since the victims are individuals with no known ties to organized crime.\n\nThe victims include a well-known physician, manufacturing plant supervisors, business owners, and female students who have gone missing during daylight hours in busy areas. To date, the kidnapping cases have not led to any homicides. In some of the cases, the victims were released following several days of captivity, however, relatives who spoke with Breitbart Texas did not wish to reveal ransom terms, if any.\n\nThe rash of kidnappings has led to a panic among locals as they plea on social media for help amid efforts to downplay the matter by officials. This weekend, residents called for a protest outside city hall to raise public awareness.\n\nMost recently, social media posts warned residents about a cartel-imposed curfew for Matamoros. Some officials issued a statement this week claiming the city is safe. Matamoros Mayor Mario \u201cLa Borrega\u201d Lopez has not made any public statements on any of these matters.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by \u201cJ.A.
