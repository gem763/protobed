If you don\u2019t have access to one, feel free to cut these tasty crackers into any shape you like. The smoky eggplant dip is worth the effort, but these crackers are also delicious all on their own.\n\nThese crackers were featured on Biscuit Week of The Great Canadian Baking Show.\n\nIngredients\n\nCracker:\n\n1 cup grated parsnip\n\n\u00bc cup butter, cold and cubed\n\n1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves\n\n2 tsp salt\n\n2 tsp black pepper\n\n\u00bc cup water\n\nDip:\n\n1 large eggplant\n\nSea salt\n\n6 cloves garlic (skin on)\n\n\u00bc cup olive oil, divided\n\n\u00bd cup walnuts\n\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n\n1 tbsp maple syrup\n\n2 tsp harissa paste\n\n1 tsp smoked paprika\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n\u00bc tsp pepper\n\nPreparation\n\nLine 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\n\nCrackers:\n\nPulse the grated parsnip in the bowl of a food processor until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the flour, butter, thyme, salt and pepper. Pulse to combine. Gradually add water, pulsing until the mixture forms into a ball of dough.\n\nTurn the dough onto the counter and let rest for 10 minutes. Heat the oven to 450F degrees.\n\nCut the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll one ball to scant \u00bc-inch thick. Cut into desired shapes about a 1 \u00bd-inches wide.\n\nPlace on prepared baking sheet and bake until firm and beginning to brown, about 12 to 14 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough. Place all baked crackers onto one sheet (it\u2019s OK if they overlap). Turn oven off and place crackers into the oven to dry out and harden, about 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nEggplant dip:\n\nHeat oven to 375F degrees.\n\nSlice the eggplant into \u00bc-inch rounds and sprinkle both sides with sea salt. Place in a colander in the sink to drain any excess liquid, about 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, place the garlic cloves onto a piece of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tsp olive oil and wrap in foil. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, remove the pan from the oven and add walnuts. Bake until walnuts are fragrant and garlic is tender, an additional 7 to 9 minutes. Carefully open the foil to allow garlic to cool.\n\nRinse the eggplant and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Cover with a clean kitchen towel, top with another baking sheet and weight sheet down with a cast iron skillet or stack of plates. Let stand for 5 minutes.\n\nSet oven to high broil and position a rack 6 inches from broiler.\n\nDrizzle the eggplant with 2 tablespoons of with olive oil. Broil until the eggplant is deep golden, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.\n\nRemove the eggplant from the baking sheet, stack and wrap loosely in foil, let stand for 5 minutes. Peel or cut away skin from the eggplant.\n\nAdd the eggplant to the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze garlic from skins into the food processor along with the walnuts and remaining olive oil and ingredients. Pulse until creamy and smooth, adding more oil if needed to make a spreadable consistency.\n\nYield: Makes approximately 50 crackers, about 1 \u00bc cup dip", "description": "This savoury spread from Liam was a hit on Biscuit Week.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285938.1568668851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/crackers-recipe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
