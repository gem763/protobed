(AP) - Tennessee wants to show it has built the type of program that can withstand the loss of three NBA draft picks and remain a Southeastern Conference contender.\n\nThe Volunteers must replace All-America forward Grant Williams, all-conference selections Jordan Bone and Admiral Schofield and 105-game starter Kyle Alexander. That quartet helped Tennessee go 57-15 over the last two seasons, win a share of an SEC regular-season title in 2018 and earn a No. 1 ranking and Sweet 16 appearance last year.\n\nTennessee\u2019s returning players are eager to build on that success.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t something where we say we\u2019re going to get to the top, we\u2019re going to get to No. 1 in the country and then what?\u201d senior guard Lamonte\u2019 Turner said. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to keep working. That\u2019s where we want to be every year.\u201d\n\nTennessee will have to work hard to avoid taking a small step backward as the Vols chase their third straight NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nThe departures of Williams, Alexander and Schofield leave Tennessee with a major frontcourt void. The Boston Celtics selected Williams with the 22nd overall pick in the NBA draft. Schofield and Bone both were taken in the second round.\n\nTennessee needs the senior backcourt duo of Turner and Jordan Bowden to lead a young roster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just letting them know what the standard is, (that) we\u2019re going to work hard, we\u2019re going to fight every day to get better,\u201d Bowden said. \u201cThey\u2019ve bought into it. They know what it takes.\u201d\n\nTennessee coach Rick Barnes believes those two seniors will help make sure the Vols remain competitive.\n\n\u201cThey got the taste of what it\u2019s like to be a really good basketball team and being a program people are excited about, and they want to see if they can obviously take it even further,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s a little bit different because they\u2019ve got so many young guys who\u2019ve never tasted any of that, but (Bowden and Turner) have been great leaders, I will say that. They\u2019ve shown great leadership. Now we just need the experience of playing games.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know heading into Tennessee\u2019s 2019-20 season:\n\nSEEKING SIZE\n\nTennessee has plenty of questions surrounding its frontcourt. The biggest one surrounds 7-foot Arizona State transfer and redshirt freshman Uros Plavsic, who is still waiting to learn whether the NCAA will grant a waiver enabling him to play for Tennessee this season.\n\nThe Vols also could use breakthrough seasons from juniors John Fulkerson and Yves Pons. Fulkerson\u2019s development has been hindered by a series of injuries. Pons has plenty of athleticism but hasn\u2019t emerged as a complete player.\n\nFRESHMAN FOCUS\n\nTennessee\u2019s expecting big things from five-star prospect Josiah-Jordan James, who was rated as the nation\u2019s No. 22 prospect in his class according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports.\n\nJames, a 6-foot-6 guard and the first top-100 recruit to sign with Tennessee in Barnes\u2019 tenure, is one of five true freshmen or redshirt freshmen on the Vols\u2019 roster.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a lot of fun for us younger guys,\u201d James said. \u201cI think there will be a learning curve. I would say we\u2019ll probably be pretty nervous going into the first game, but I feel like as the season gets going, as we play really good teams and as we start to jell, it will be a really good season.\u201d\n\nTennessee\u2019s other freshmen include Plavsic, guard Davonte Gaines and forwards Olivier Nkamhoua and Drew Pember. Teammates rave about Nkamhoua\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cHe kind of reminds me of a younger Grant,\u201d Bowden said. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit for Olivier.\u201d\n\nHOME DOMINANCE\n\nTennessee has 26 straight home victories to match Buffalo for the longest active home winning streak of any Division I team. Tennessee hasn\u2019t lost at home since falling 94-84 to Auburn on Jan. 2, 2018.\n\nSTAFF CHANGES\n\nBarnes lost his top assistant from last season when Georgia State hired Rob Lanier as its head coach. Barnes added assistant coach Kim English, a former Missouri player who previously worked as an assistant at Tulsa and Colorado.\n\nDEMANDING SCHEDULE\n\nTennessee has two games each with No. 2 Kentucky and No. 24 Auburn, visits No. 3 Kansas and hosts No. 6 Florida, No. 14 Memphis and No. 22 LSU. Joining Kansas and Memphis as high-profile nonconference opponents are Cincinnati, Wisconsin, Washington, Florida State, Murray State and either No. 23 Purdue or No. 25 VCU.\n\nThe Vols open the season Nov. 5 by hosting UNC Asheville.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tennessee wants to show it has built the type of program that can withstand the loss of three NBA draft picks and remain a Southeastern Conference contender.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/sec_media_day_basketball_26164_c0-181-4356-2722_s1200x700.jpg?ea0ad4bb4bfe0ed19664c3865c0d7ebdb4b94d88", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
