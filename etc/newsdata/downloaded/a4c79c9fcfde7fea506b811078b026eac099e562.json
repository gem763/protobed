From October, the company is planning to go one step further and accept crypto payments without the need for a point-of-sale device.\n\nAs per the report, a mobile app, CieloPay, would be used to generate the QR code instead. The app, launching on October 14, will enable remote payments through applications such as WhatsApp and online stores.\n\nCielo president Paulo Caffarelli said that the company\u2019s banking partners, Banco do Brasil and Bradesco Bradesco, are backing the new crypto payments offering.\n\nThat could be because the competition to introduce crypto payment services independent of point-of-sale is hotting up in Brazil. Earlier this month, Banco Inter, one of the first banks in Brazil to go digital, announced, on Instagram, that it is launching a new card payment method. The system will dispense with the need for a point-of sale device, and would also allow payment with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn Brazil then, crypto payments are all set to become as easy as pie.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Cielo, which operates 1.4 million point-of-sale devices and is a leading credit card provider in Brazil, is rolling out crypto payments.", "authors": ["Adriana Hamacher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dTYj7vpYsLbLTmswwrpxYQ--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/b66dbd950b1d3fd5b103911ed5b63e23"}
