The Supreme Court of Cassation has two months to make a decision.\n\nHe was convicted after fatally stabbing a local student in 2007, but shas always maintained his innocence, saying he was defending a Roma being attacked by football hooligans.\n\nPalfreeman's Bulgarian lawyer, Kalin Angelov, says it would be a 'huge catastrophe' if he's returned to jail.\n\n'I don't know what will happen,' the lawyer told AAP.\n\n'We're in some very strange legal territory and nothing is following the rules.'\n\nOn Tuesday night Palfreeman was finally released from detention but said police confiscated his passport to stop him leaving the country\n\nAustralian Paul 'Jock' Palfreeman leaves the immigration detention centre in Busmantsi\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne on Thursday said the Australian government was concerned 'if non-legal issues were seen to have an influence on the process'.\n\n'We have called and continued to call for the Bulgarian authorities to allow Mr Palfreeman to travel to Australia given his paroled status,' Senator Payne told parliament.\n\nMr Palfreeman and his wife, Helen, have drawn strength from their son's character as demonstrated by his work setting up the Bulgarian Prisoners' Rehabilitation Association.\n\n'It's amazing that after almost 12 years of imprisonment in such terrible circumstances he's managed to maintain passion, emotion, a sense of humour and an ability to achieve results,' he told AAP.\n\nPalfreeman was charged over the murder of law student Andrei Monov, 20, (left) in a melee on the streets while travelling on an 'extended gap year'\n\nPalfreeman has indicated he could ultimately settle in Bulgaria.\n\nHis father says he would be happy for Jock - who speaks fluent Bulgarian and is currently staying with close friends in Sofia - to live in the country if the prosecutor-general's application is thrown out and it's safe.\n\nBulgarian radio reporter Ekaterina Katratcheva says Jock Palfreeman is a polarising figure in her homeland.\n\nMs Katratcheva told AAP while he was almost forgotten after spending 11 years in prison the granting of parole put Palfreeman firmly back into the public spotlight.\n\n'It was like an explosion, it became a very hot topic and a very divisive topic for our society,' she said.\n\n'Almost everyone in Bulgaria knows his name.'", "description": "The 32-year-old - who spent more than 11 years in a Bulgarian jail after being convicted of murder - was released on parole earlier this week but is banned from travelling.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19842610-0-image-a-10_1571323790059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
