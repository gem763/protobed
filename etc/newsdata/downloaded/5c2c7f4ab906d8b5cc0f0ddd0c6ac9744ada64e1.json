They found that \u201cmoderately selective\u201d schools were the least diverse, whereas \u201copen admission,\u201d \u201cminimally selective\u201d and \u201cvery selective\u201d schools had similar indices.\n\nAmong the top 10 most diverse schools, only two were \u201clarge schools\u201d with more than 5,000 students. The others were all small or midsize schools.\n\nHere are the 10 most diverse private colleges and universities, plus their diversity index scores, according to HeyTutor:\n\n10.
