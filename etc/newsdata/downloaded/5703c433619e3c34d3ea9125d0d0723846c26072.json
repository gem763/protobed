Tourists are able to visit through guided tours all throughout the year\n\nIsolated with a harsh climate, diamonds once made this Namibian ghost town a thriving community and at a time one of the richest towns in Africa.\n\nThe town was founded in 1908 by a Namibian railway worker called Zacherias Lewala, and by 1912 was producing a million diamonds per year, making up nearly 12 per cent of the world's total production of the gem.\n\nHowever today it is a silent and eerie place, abandoned to the sand of the desert after supplies depleted thanks to intensive mining in the area in the 1930s.\n\nBy 1956, Kolmanskop was empty after inhabitants fled, leaving behind all their possessions, when new diamond fields were found in the south.\n\nOnly travellers visit the desolate town now, with guided tours in English, German and Afrikaans offered all year at the location.\n\nBeelitz Sanatorium\n\nBeelitz Sanatorium in Berlin, Germany, was built in the late 19th century to help rehabilitate the growing number of tuberculosis patients in the expanding city of Berlin and was abandoned in 1995\n\nNow an empty shell, this once vital hospital in Berlin, Germany was at the cutting edge for treatment for the then-deadly disease tuberculosis.\n\nThe 60-room treatment complex was built in the late 19th century to help rehabilitate the growing number of tuberculosis patients in the expanding city of Berlin.\n\nThe building was transformed into a military hospital during the First and Second World Wars, and was where a young Adolf Hitler was treated for a thigh injury acquired during the Battle of the Somme.\n\nThe hospital was abandoned following the fall of East Germany, when the Soviet Army who has been occupying the building withdrew in 1995.\n\nThe site has been used as a set for Oscar winner The Pianist and 2008 film Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise.\n\nPower Plant IM\n\nPower Plant IM in Charleroi, Belgium was originally built in 1921 and at its height could cool 480,000 gallons of water every minute - however 2006 protests from Greenpeace led to it's closure and it now deemed too unsafe to repurpose\n\nOnce upon a time, thanks to its hyperboloid shape, the magnificent cooling tower at Power Plant IM - built in Charleroi, Belgium in 1921 - was able to cool 480,000 gallons of water every minute.\n\nFollowing several years of service, it was discovered that the tower was responsible for 10 per cent of the entire carbon dioxide emissions in the country.\n\nProtests in 2006 from Greenpeace led to its closure the following year and now, nearly a century old, the tower is abandoned \u2013 deemed too unsafe to re-purpose.\n\nThe power plant still lies abandoned and is said to be scheduled for demolition and there have been reports of looting by metal scrappers.\n\nHowever until then, the tower remains a popular spot for urban explorers, although not officially open to the public.\n\nRed Star Graveyard\n\nThe Istvantelek train workshop in Budapest, Hungary, homes more than 100 locomotives and train cars, and the abandoned warehouse contains trains said to have transported prisoners to Auschwitz during the Holocaust\n\nPowerful MAV locomotives sit rusting in buildings on the brink of collapse on the abandoned Istvantelek train workshop in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nMore than just a monument to engineering achievements of the past, the trains and carriages here also played a role in some of the most significant moments in Eastern European history.\n\nMore than 100 locomotives and train cars inhabit this deteriorating graveyard - and some are said to have transported prisoners to Auschwitz during the Holocaust.\n\nThe repair shop opened in the early 1900s, and has witnessed 80 years of tumultuous Hungarian history that included the fall of a monarchy, Nazi occupation and transformation into communist state loyal to the Soviet Union.\n\nNow, although not officially open to tourists, the spot remains popular with curious explorers.\n\nPatarei Prison\n\nPatarei Prison on the outskirts of Tallinn's Old Tow in Estonia was turned into one of the most dangerous and brutal institutions in the Communist world after Soviets took over the country in 1940 - a torture device is seen\n\nThis once Soviet naval fortress on the outskirts of Tallinn's Old Tow in Estonia was turned into one of the most dangerous and brutal institutions in the Communist world.\n\nPatarei originally held 500 prisoners, however when Soviets took over the country in 1940, the prison quickly changed, housing 5,000 at its peak.\n\nThe prison's eerie authentic interior reflects the nature of the horrific treatment of hundreds of innocent people imprisoned here for ideological reasons during the country's communist regime.\n\nThe prison's hospital was said to have driven capitalist sympathizers insane during their stay, by pumping them full of hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThe building is protected under heritage conservation and from October 6, 2016 the prison was closed to visitors, but curious tourists can still see it from the outside.\n\nKelenfold Power Station\n\nKelenfold Power Station, Budapest, Hungary, first operated in June 1914 and is one of the oldest power plants in the world, under Hungarian law the structure cannot be demolished and remains open to the public for tours\n\nFirst operating in June 1914, Kelenfold in Budapest, Hungary, is one of the oldest - and most beautiful - power plants in the world.\n\nTwo architects, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Reichl and Virgil Borb\u00edro, designed the old buildings of the power plant, which under the Hungarian law means they cannot be restored or demolished.\n\nDecommissioned after 91 years in operation, and despite years of neglect, the curved walls and dramatic ceilings still somehow capture a design of a technological future.\n\nThe control room, added to the Budapest-based site in 1927, remains the jewel in the station's crown after surviving World War Two unscathed.\n\nAt its height one of the most advanced power centers in all of Europe, the power station is now open to tours on an intermittent schedule with all of the machinery is still completely intact.\n\nThe Forbidden City\n\nThe Forbidden City, Wunsdorf, Germany, built during World War Two housed tens of thousands of Red Army troops and their families during the Cold War, and was dubbed the 'Forbidden City' as Germans were forbidden\n\nThis structure used to be a Nazi base before it was commandeered by the Soviets following World War Two.\n\nThe fortified stronghold in Wunsdorf housed tens of thousands of Red Army troops and their families during the Cold War, and was dubbed the 'Forbidden City' as Germans were forbidden.\n\nThis was the headquarters of some 500,000 Soviet troops stationed across the German Democratic Republic during this period.\n\nThe Forbidden City has been empty since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, when the last remaining Russian soldiers left the military base.\n\nThe structure remains the same with photos and artworks from the Soviet Union still hanging on the walls.\n\nThe Monument House\n\nThe Monument House, Buzludzha, Bulgaria, built between 1971 and 1981 is a mountain-top structure and is funded by public subscription commemorates key events in Bulgarian history - but is not accessible\n\nThis remarkable mountain-top structure, located in Buzludzha, Bulgaria appears in the second season of the show Abandoned Engineering on Yesterday, and was built between 1971 and 1981.\n\nThe project, funded by public subscription commemorates key events in Bulgarian history - most notably, the formation of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party.\n\nFollowing the Communist government's fall from power in 1989 - the monument was closed to the public and all it's artwork destroyed.\n\nIt is one of a number of huge communist structures that many believe, if restored, could attract Western tourists to the region in their droves.\n\nBut the Bulgarian government does not have the resources to carry out the necessary extensive repair work, at an estimated cost of 30million leva (\u00a312million), nor to pull them down.", "description": "A new photographic exhibition featuring eerie images of abandoned buildings from around the world is coming to London and includes a Chernobyl ghost town and ruins of the former Soviet Empire.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/15/19302122-0-image-a-5_1570201084422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
