Harris moved $1.2 million into her presidential fund. Harris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the campaign financially afloat but prefers to spend time in early voting states.\n\n...", "description": "Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris faults Elizabeth Warren\u2019s transfer of funds from her Senate campaign, Republican advisers appear to lose to Democratic advisers in Israel\u2019s election, and more in Washington Wire.", "authors": ["Gabriel T.
