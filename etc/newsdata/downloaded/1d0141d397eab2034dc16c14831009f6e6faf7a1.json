Mehlman and some three dozen other \u201cRepublicans, former Republicans, and political conservatives\u201d of varying degrees of prominence suffers from the same defects as the amicus brief for some former SGs:\n\n1. The brief asserts that \u201cit is clear that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status necessarily constitutes action taken because of the individual\u2019s sex,\u201d (emphasis in original), for it \u201cis impossible to cognize a person\u2019s sexual orientation without first noting whether the person is male or female (or possesses the physical or behavioral characteristics usually associated with being male or female).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the brief fails to recognize that its supposed test for unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex would also doom practices that have long been accepted under Title VII, such as sex-specific restrooms, sex-specific shower facilities, and dress codes.\n\nAssume a situation in which an employer has sex-specific restrooms and showers and a male employee (not someone who identifies as transgender) is disciplined or discharged for using the women\u2019s restroom or showers. It is impossible to apply the employer\u2019s policy \u201cwithout first noting whether the person is male or female.\u201d Under the simplistic logic of the amicus brief, that would mean that the employer\u2019s policy violated Title VII. But Title VII has never been so understood, and the brief doesn\u2019t even acknowledge the problem, much less try to address it.\n\n2. Relatedly, the supposedly textualist brief never examines what \u201cdiscriminate \u2026 because of \u2026 sex\u201d means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Fifth Circuit judge James C. Ho has crisply explained, the traditional understanding of Title VII\u2019s ban on discrimination \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d is that it adopts an anti-favoritism theory (employers can\u2019t favor men over women, or vice versa) rather than the blindness theory (employers must be entirely blind to a person\u2019s sex) that the brief imagines. But, again, the brief doesn\u2019t recognize the issue, much less engage it.\n\n3. From the fact that Title VII prohibits discrimination against individuals, the brief leaps to the mistaken conclusion that the plaintiff employee does not have an obligation to show that the employer disadvantages the plaintiff\u2019s sex as a group. The brief somehow never acknowledges this passage from the Court\u2019s unanimous opinion in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998):\n\n\u201cThe critical issue, Title VII\u2019s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d [Quoting concurring opinion of Justice Ginsburg in Harris v. Forklift Systems (1993).]\n\nAgain, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity does not expose \u201cmembers of one sex \u2026 to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d Oncale\u2019s reading of Title VII thus defeats the brief\u2019s claim.", "description": "The amicus brief filed in the Title VII SOGI cases in the Supreme Court on behalf of Kenneth B.
