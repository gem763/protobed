It's down to Independents \u2014 and the polls show they back it", "language": "en", "text": "As the days pass, it becomes increasingly likely that Donald Trump will be the third president in the history of the United States to face a jury of his peers in an impeachment trial. Still, if the polls are accurate, Republicans have been largely unmoved by the Democrat-run inquiries into the president\u2019s conduct. The majority of Republicans continue to support the president, fueling his ever more erratic behavior, rallies, and Twitterstorms.\n\nThat unwavering support was enough to preserve the sinking ship for a while. But it looks like it isn\u2019t anymore.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fox News released the most recent in a slew of impeachment-related polls. In it, 51 per cent of Americans reported that they wanted President Trump impeached and removed from office, up nine points from a July 2019 poll asking the same question. Unsurprisingly, support for impeachment rose most precipitously among Democratic voters, who now overwhelmingly back the inquiries initiated by the House of Representatives, after years of ambivalence. But Democratic voters were not the only voters for whom perspective evolved. And the evolution of other voters may spell doom for the president.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhether or not Democrats support impeachment inquiries and proceedings is of no real consequence to President Trump, of course. The impeachment needle appears to be moving among Independents, however \u2014 and that development should give the president pause.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by The Washington Post on Tuesday, 57 per cent of Independent voters now support the current impeachment inquiry, indicating a 20-point increase in support since July. Even if the Republicans never come around \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe that they won\u2019t, given their recent messaging in the press \u2014 Donald Trump has plenty to worry about. It wasn\u2019t Republicans, after all, who carried him through the 2016 election; it was Independents, in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio. And those Independents are waning in their commitment to the president.\n\nThe most steadfast Republicans \u2014 like former Representative Trey Gowdy, who once famously excoriated the Obama administration for failing to produce documents requested by Congress \u2014 continue to back the president, apparently seeing no irony or hypocrisy in their own positions. Gowdy himself once stood admirably tall in his moral resolve, saying, \u201cThe notion that you can withhold information and documents from Congress, no matter whether you are the party in power or not in power, is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.\u201d That premise \u2014 that a rule of law is a rule of law regardless of ruling party \u2014 has been abandoned by the current Republican Party. And President Trump has made an unwise bet that his party\u2019s sycophantic loyalty can buy him a second term.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works.

No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.

Getty\n\nDespite his reputation as Teflon Don, to which no scandal will stick, the tides really are changing for Trump this week. Public opinion suggests that Independent voters are shifting their perspective to an unprecedented degree, and those Independent voters will make or break the 2020 election, just as they did in the 2016 election.\n\nWithout swing states in the Midwest and Rust Belt to bolster him, Trump has little chance of becoming a two-term president. If anything is to be his undoing, it will be a break in his base, which is composed not only of party loyalists, but also of white, middle-class voters. Losing that bloc will cost him the election.\n\nSigns are pointing to this significant change. The Fox News poll, specifically, established that there was increased support for impeachment among white evangelicals, white men without a college degree, and white rural voters \u2014 three groups that have historically supported Trump in big numbers. The Republican Party may be towing the line, but not everyone is on board. When Independents begin to jump ship, as they appear to be doing, the problem of the presidency may become insurmountable.\n\nIn April 2017, Trump tweeted that he \"did what no other Republican could\" and \"easily won the Electoral College.\u201d That tweet, of course, was hyperbolic and largely inaccurate, but it did contain one kernel of truth. Without Independent voters, no candidate\u2014Democrat or Republican\u2014has a chance at the presidency, regardless of magnetism, social media following, or bombast. Donald Trump, Teflon or not, is no exception to this rule.", "description": "As the days pass, it becomes increasingly likely that Donald Trump will be the third president in the history of the United States to face a jury of his peers in an impeachment trial.
