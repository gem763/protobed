Samsung feels for these people, so it launched an entire Giphy page filled with comeback GIFs they can send to self-righteous iPhone users.\n\nFor the green bubble unacquainted, many iOS users don\u2019t enjoy texting Android users because Apple treats SMS, MMS, and RCS messages differently than iMessages. All sorts of iMessage features act up when someone texts an Android user \u2014 signified by a green bubble \u2014 so many times, iOS users will leave Android users out of group chats or stop talking to them altogether. It\u2019s unfortunate.\n\nAlong with the GIFs, Samsung also seems to be reaching out to Instagram meme pages and asking them to share the GIFs along with the hashtag #GreenDontCare. At least four partners tried to make memes with the GIFs on Instagram. They all fail. The two I included below also both suggest that green bubble people have money? And therefore are worth texting? I don\u2019t get it!\n\nThe whole situation makes me sad, but let\u2019s take a look at the GIFs because many of them are confusing. The overall message seems to be that green bubbles can conquer blue bubbles? And that green bubbles are superior?\n\nThere\u2019s a light violent undertone to these GIFs, too, which I don\u2019t enjoy. Blue bubble people don\u2019t want to hurt green bubble people; they just don\u2019t want to deal with a compromised messaging product. I guess leaving them out of group chats is hurtful.\n\nIt probably should go without saying, but texting an iPhone person with one of these GIFs probably won\u2019t help the situation. The only fix, really, is to get an iPhone, and Samsung doesn\u2019t want that to happen, so we ended up with these GIFs.", "description": "Samsung has launched a Giphy page and paid Instagram meme makers to weigh in on the blue vs. green bubble debate.
