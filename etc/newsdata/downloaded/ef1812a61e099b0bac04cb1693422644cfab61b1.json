It is likely to be the last chance voters have to choose between parties offering to cancel Brexit or force through a hard split at any cost.\n\nMembers of Parliament will vote later on Tuesday to endorse the election plan.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson needs only simple majority in House of Commons after proposing a bill to set date of next election as Dec. 12Labour said it will back an early election in December, with date subject to any amendments to government legislationCabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says government wants election bill to pass all House of Commons stages on Tuesday; debate to continue \u201cuntil any hour\u201dRead more: Boris Johnson\u2019s Double Gamble on an Unpredictable U.K. ElectionPound erases earlier loss\n\nMPs Voting to Allow Election Bill Amendments (2:10 p.m.)\n\nMPs are voting on an amendment to the government\u2019s schedule for proceeding with the general election bill in the House of Commons.\n\nIn essence, the amendment, proposed by Labour backbencher Stella Creasy, would allow MPs to amend the legislation calling for an early general election. The government is trying to bypass normal Parliamentary rules to speed its passage through parliament.\n\nCreasy said her amendment aims merely to put the concept of \u201cfair play\u201d back in the Commons. \u201cWhat the government was trying to do, in simple terms, was rig today\u2019s debate,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cLetting this program motion go through without the full list of rules, is like letting Lance Armstrong keep all his medals.\u201d\n\nElection Bill Presented to Parliament (1:45 p.m.)\n\nThe bill calling for an early general election has been presented in Parliament \u2013 what\u2019s called its first reading. That\u2019s just a formality. MPs have 6 hours to get it through all of its stages in the House of Commons.\n\nThat includes a vote on second reading \u2013 expected by about 6 p.m. and then debate on possible amendments at what\u2019s called the committee stage of the bill. If it stays to schedule, the final vote should be no later than 7:45 p.m.\n\nOBR Forecasts Still Due on Nov. 7 (12:45 p.m.)\n\nThe government\u2019s fiscal watchdog said it will still publish its economic forecasts on Nov. 7, even though Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid\u2019s Budget the day before has been canceled.\n\nThe forecasts, which were due to be presented in response to the Budget, will include updated assessments of the impact of the Brexit deal Boris Johnson agreed with the EU on Oct. 17. Javid has ruled out publishing any government impact assessments of the deal.\n\nIn a letter to the Treasury, Robert Chote, Chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said it is required by law to publish at least two forecasts per year and will go ahead with its plans.\n\nChote said in his letter that the new deal is unlikely to have made a \"significant quantitative difference\u201d compared to the last forecast in March, which was based on Theresa May\u2019s deal and assumed a transition period to Dec. 2020.\n\nJohnson Will Consider Other Election Dates (12:30 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson is open to considering other dates for a general election, but doesn\u2019t consider a poll on Dec. 9 as logistically possible, his spokesman James Slack told reporters in Westminster.\n\nThat means Dec. 10 or 11 could emerge as the date for a pre-Christmas election, rather than the Dec. 12 vote proposed by the prime minister.\n\nSlack also said that Johnson wouldn\u2019t countenance the lowering of the voting age to 16, or the inclusion of EU nationals in the vote, both of which have been proposed by opposition parties. Even if he supported the changes, there would be practical issues with either happening in time for an election next month, Slack said.\n\nMixed Reaction to Election From Labour MPs (11:50 a.m.)\n\nNot all Labour MPs seem happy about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to back a general election.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The U.K. is set for its third general election since 2015 as political leaders attempt to resolve the Brexit crisis paralyzing the country.Prime Minister Boris Johnson won the backing of opposition Labour Party", "authors": ["Kitty Donaldson", "Tim Ross", "Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t2.HKs1ccpXgIqqVLK6rlQ--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/5e4d2bad03059b412d1a880db51a8924", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
