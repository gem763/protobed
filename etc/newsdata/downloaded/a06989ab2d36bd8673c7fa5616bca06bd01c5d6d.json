So that was really hard.'\n\nPip, from West Yorkshire, said she was determined to do her parents Dave and Linda Palmer proud with the renovation of her childhood home (pictured, her parents in the house)\n\nBefore the renovation the house hadn't been updated since the couple had decorated in the '60s, and was dated and dinghy\n\nOne of the main transformations is a huge open-plan kitchen diner at the back of the house in place of several smaller dinghy rooms\n\nPip's parents bought the house in 1965, and she told George: 'I've got fabulous memories growing up here.'\n\nThe Georgian property was converted into two houses in the '70s, after Pip's grandparents moved into the family home.\n\nAfter her parents recently died, Pip became determined to renovate the house for her and her husband Neil to move in.\n\nNeil explained: 'You see it in the state it is now, and we think we could turn it into one fantastic family home.''\n\nThe upstairs featured several dinghy and awkward bedrooms, with one painted in a bold red colour, with a matching carpet and painted ceiling\n\nThe master bedroom is stylishly updated with a colourful modern-take on Georgian wallpaper and a huge four poster bed\n\nBut with every room meaning so much to her, it was a challenge to know where to start.\n\n'It's a challenge, it's emotional - but it's exciting as well,' Pip said. 'My dad was a joiner by trade, so the kitchen has been here 50 years. My mother and father would want it to be updated. It's time now.'\n\nGeorge replied: 'It reminds me of my mum and dads house, with the curved arches and the wallpaper.\n\n'If you had the chance to renovate your childhood home, it makes perfect sense that you'd want to do it some justice.'\n\nThe ground floor had been divided into two, splitting off a smaller kitchen and living room, while upstairs the house divide had left a series of dark and dingy bedrooms.\n\nBefore the renovation, the home was covered in ancient carpets and dark old-fashioned wallpapers\n\nPip is emotional throughout the build, and admits to husband Neil and George Clarke that she is feeling the pressure of her renovating her parent's home\n\nBefore the renovation the house featured several pokey small bedrooms which hadn't been decorated since the '60s\n\nPip and her husband Neil rip out the dated features and stripped back the walls and ancient carpet during the renovation\n\nThe couple started off with a budget of \u00a3100,000 for the project, but there was a lot to do to modernise and unite the two halves of the house.\n\nPip has to paint over her childhood wallpaper, rip up the swirly carpets, and replace the kitchen that her father hand built.\n\nGeorge suggested moving 'sociable family spaces' to the back of the house, creating one large open-plan space.\n\nHe added: 'It's massive. In some ways you've got too much space.'\n\nInstead of the warren of rooms upstairs, the couple created four bedrooms instead, with a huge master with a walk-in wardrobe and ensuite.\n\nThey planned to create a functional modern interior while still maintaining the charm of her original family home.\n\nPip transforms her terraced childhood home into a modern mansion, changing the property from two houses into one\n\nPip and Neil used a few tricks to get more light into the centre of the house, including putting a skylight in the roof of the stairwell.\n\nBut the renovation was anything but straightforward, since every room was packed with echoes of the past.\n\nPip was surprised to uncover wallpaper that was put up by her parents around the time of her first birthday.\n\nWith so much emotional pressure on her, Pip struggled to make decisions because of the 'absolute minefield' of memories.\n\nShe revealed: 'I go to work and ask everybody at work, I ring all my friends and ask them, I ask all my family, and then I come home and Neil says the opposite.\n\nPip is determined to make her late parents proud with her modern updates to the property, with the former kitchen being updated with a stylish modern island\n\nShe went on: 'I cannot make a decision for the life of me.'\n\nAs a result, it took her three months to decide on a replacement for her father's kitchen.\n\nBut she explained: 'This house means so much to me. I don't want to spoil it.\n\n'And my mum always knew what she wanted and made the right decisions in the end. I want to do the same.'\n\nThe couple's huge home also features several living spaces, where they tried to balance the traditional style with modern updates\n\nAfter five months, the couple spent a few days away from the property so that George and his team were able to add some final homely touches.\n\nAnd Pip couldn't contain her emotion as she looked around the transformed home.\n\nThe back of the property was transformed to create a large open-plan space with an enormous kitchen and sitting room flooded with light, thanks to a full wall of windows.\n\nShe said: 'My mum would be absolutely over the moon, I love it.'\n\nPip is determined to keep the old charm of the building but weave in modern touches and stylish updates, such as the wooden floor in place of old carpet\n\nAlthough the couple had hoped to spend \u00a3100,000 on the property, Pip says she would 'rather not' disclose their total spend to husband Neil\n\nMeanwhile the master bedroom was decorated with bright, modern wallpaper, with Pip admitting she loved it because it reminded her of her mother.\n\nShe could barely contain her emotion as George gave her a photo frame engraved with the pattern from her childhood wallpaper.\n\nPip said: 'This was my mum and dad's bedroom and she likes bright colours. My mother is here in this paper. I'm crying again.'\n\nBut when George asked Pip how much money she'd spent on the project, she admitted she would 'rather not' say.\n\nPip and Neil also transform the back of the property by adding large glass windows which flooded the room with light\n\nPip explained: 'I spent more than \u00a3100,000, but I'd prefer not tot say in front of Neil. He doesn't know. We don't need to say.'\n\nGeorge acknowledged how difficult the project must have been for Pip, saying: 'I think this is the first time in a long time that I've done a house for someone in the house that they grew up in.'\n\nAnd Pip revealed: 'It was especially hard not having my mum and dad here to give their blessings overt things and say it's okay to say goodbye to that piece of it..so that was really hard.\n\nShe adds: 'But I know they've given their blessing.'\n\nGeorge Clarke's Old House, New Home airs on Channel 4 at 8pm", "description": "Pip, from West Yorkshire, appears on George Clarke's Old House, New Home tonight, renovating the property that her late parents Dave and Linda Palmer last decorated in the '60s.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20384116-0-image-a-126_1572450908072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
