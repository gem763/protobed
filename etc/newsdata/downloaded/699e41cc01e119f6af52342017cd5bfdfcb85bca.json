The card airs on ESPN2.\n\n(Click here to open a PDF of the staff picks grid in a separate window.)\n\nIn the main event, former middleweight champion Chris Weidman (14-4 MMA, 10-4 UFC) makes the move to light heavyweight for the first time to take on the unbeaten Dominick Reyes (11-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC). The oddsmakers have made Reyes a favorite of around -160, and our 13 MMA Junkie editors, writers, radio hosts and videographers are siding with him, as well, at a 9-4 clip.\n\nIn the co-main event, Yair Rodriguez (12-2 MMA, 7-1 UFC) and Jeremy Stephens (28-16 MMA, 15-15 UFC) will run back their featherweight fight from Mexico City in September. That fight ended in a no contest after only 15 seconds when Stephens suffered an accidental eye poke. There\u2019s plenty of bad blood between the two, and the fight is a pick\u2019em from the oddsmakers. But our staff members like Stephens, who has an 8-5 lead in the picks.\n\nAlso on the main card, Greg Hardy (5-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) returns at heavyweight against Ben Sosoli (7-2 MMA, 0-0 UFC). Hardy is the biggest favorite on the main card and second biggest favorite at the event, and only one of our pickers is going against him.\n\nBoston-area native Joe Lauzon (27-15 MMA, 14-12 UFC) has a home fight against Jonathan Pearce (9-3 MMA, 0-0 UFC) in a lightweight fight that started as a virtual pick\u2019em at the sports books, but has seen money come in on Pearce to make him the favorite around -150. But our staff members are taking Lauzon at a rate of 8-5.\n\nMaycee Barber (7-0 MMA, 2-0 UFC) is just a slight favorite in her women\u2019s flyweight fight against Gillian Robertson (7-3 MMA, 4-1 UFC), and it\u2019s the closest fight on the main card as far as our pickers are concerned. Barber has just a slim 7-6 lead in the picks.\n\nAnd to open the main card, the middleweight bout between Darren Stewart (10-4 MMA, 3-4 UFC) and Deron Winn (6-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC) has Winn as the mild favorite. It\u2019s also Winn with an 8-5 edge in the picks.\n\nIn the MMA Junkie reader consensus picks, Reyes (63%), Stephens (63 percent), Hardy (76 percent), Lauzon (59 percent), Barber (76 percent) and Winn (75 percent) are the choices.\n\nCheck out all the picks above.\n\nGallery Photos: UFC on ESPN 6 official weigh-ins view 26 images", "description": "Check out our staff members' picks for the UFC on ESPN 6 main card in Boston, featuring Dominick Reyes vs. Chris Weidman.", "authors": ["Matt Erickson", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ufc-on-espn-6-staff-picks.jpg?w=640&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
