We were in Muncie, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, and the small northern-Indiana town of Angola. You can read some of our series of reports here from Fort Wayne, here from Muncie, and here from Angola, with links to others.\n\nWhile we were there, a video team from New America made a series of three short films. They\u2019re about the up-close realities of issues that usually appear as slogans or abstractions in so many speeches, policy papers, and panel discussions.\n\nThese are issues such as \u201crestoring opportunity,\u201d \u201cre-creating middle-class jobs,\u201d and \u201cbringing hope to the heartland.\u201d Or about working with \u201creturning citizens,\u201d those who have been incarcerated, to increase their chances of a successful return to economic and family life.\n\nTo put it another way: Everyone talks about creating opportunity. Here\u2019s what it looks like when people do something about it.\n\nThe first film, shot in Fort Wayne and around Indianapolis, describes the work of an innovative program called Build Your Future (BY, for short). It\u2019s five minutes long, and you can see it below.\n\nThanks to the videographer and editor Michael Jensen, the executive producer Fuzz Hogan, plus our other friends at New America. Two more films shot in Indiana are ahead in the series. The next one is about an art-collaborative project in Indianapolis called Big Car.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Fallows"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2019/10/Brannon/facebook.png?1569954224", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
