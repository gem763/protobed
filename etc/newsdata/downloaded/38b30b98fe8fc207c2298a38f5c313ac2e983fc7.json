We used a small number of people on the ground, advising this force, the SDF, with our airpower, and they were able to roll back the caliphate. So, we cannot tolerate a NATO ally now coming in and mowing them down. That is just not the right message, and it\u2019s not good for the safety of America. So, I really hope it\u2019s reconsidered.\u201d\n\nMcSally added that Congress needs to do whatever it takes to deter Turkey from destabilizing the region.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's \"The Story,\" Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) stated that she hopes President Trump reconsiders his decision | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/McSally722-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
