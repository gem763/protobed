The Niners have, entering Monday night\u2019s game versus the Cleveland Browns at 3-0, with the Detroit Lions replacing the struggling Atlanta Falcons on the contender list.\n\nWhich NFC teams are the best through five weeks of the season? We ranked the conference\u2019s 11 winning teams, based on which are strongest at this point in the year.\n\nAD\n\n1. New Orleans Saints: After quarterback Drew Brees injured his right thumb in the second game of the season, a reasonable hope was that the Saints could go 3-3 with backup Teddy Bridgewater and still find a way to make the playoffs after Brees returned.\n\nAD\n\nBridgewater is now 3-0 as a starter, and getting better each week. Brees is starting to throw the football and is nearing a return. Without question, the Saints are the best team in the NFC after five weeks. In the two weeks following Brees\u2019 thumb injury, the Saints beat the Seattle Seahawks on the road and won a Sunday night game against the Dallas Cowboys, before Sunday\u2019s win over Tampa Bay.\n\nAlvin Kamara is unstoppable at running back. Michael Thomas remains one of the best wide receivers in the league. The offensive line ranks in the top three. The Saints\u2019 defense may rank in the bottom quarter of the league for yards allowed, but it makes key stops to win games. With games coming up against Jacksonville, Chicago and Arizona, Brees will take over a team that could be 6-2 or better by midseason with the hope of getting a No. 1 seed at 12 wins.\n\nAD\n\n2. San Francisco 49ers: If they put in a poor performance against the Browns, they\u2019ll need to be dropped a few spots, given that they built their 3-0 record on wins against Tampa Bay, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. But we\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is playing really well, despite the offense dealing with injuries at left tackle, running back and wide receiver, and the defensive line is the most improved in football with the additions of edge rushers Dee Ford and Nick Bosa.\n\nAD\n\n3. Seattle Seahawks: Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes are in a two-man battle for the league\u2019s MVP award after five weeks. Wilson has never played this well. He\u2019s completing 73.1 percent of his passes and has 12 touchdown passes and no interceptions. With his running ability, Wilson has helped to make the Seahawks one of the best red-zone teams in football.\n\nBrewer: Russell Wilson is the best franchise quarterback in the NFL\n\nOn defense, their biggest expected weakness has been a strength, with Jadeveon Clowney one of the best edge rushers in the league and Ziggy Ansah also contributing. Defensive tackle Jarran Reed, who had 10 and a half sacks last year, will soon return from his 10-game suspension.\n\n4. Green Bay Packers: The Packers went to great lengths to improve their pass rush this offseason, and it worked. Free agent pickups Preston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith have combined for 9 \u00bd sacks and first-round pick Rashan Gary has flashed despite not playing that much.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAaron Rodgers might not be completely on the same page as head coach Matt LaFleur on what they are doing on the offense, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s Aaron Rodgers, and he showed how great he remains in Sunday\u2019s win over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n5. Los Angeles Rams: The Rams are on a two-game losing streak, and it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re having issues on offense. Coach Sean McVay is having to adapt to teams using six-man fronts against them, which first took place last December against the Detroit Lions and was adopted by the Patriots in their Super Bowl victory.\n\nRunning back Todd Gurley also clearly isn\u2019t the same because of his arthritic knee, forcing Jared Goff to throw more and not be able to take as much advantage of L.A.\u2019s effective play-action game. All of that said, the Rams can put up points on offense and make big plays on defense, so nobody should count them out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n6. Dallas Cowboys: They rode an easy schedule to a 3-0 start, but things have unraveled with consecutive losses to the Saints and Packers. Those teams were able to slow Ezekiel Elliott, which threw off Dak Prescott and the passing game, but the Cowboys remain one of the most talented teams in the conference on both sides of the ball, which will keep them in the mix.\n\n7. Philadelphia Eagles: Injuries have been a problem on both sides of the ball, but thanks to Coach Doug Pederson\u2019s play-calling and Carson Wentz\u2019s efficient play, they are averaging 28 points per game \u2014 and the defense should get better as the season progresses.\n\n8. Carolina Panthers: Coach Ron Rivera was on the hot seat after an 0-2 start, but backup quarterback Kyle Allen has led a three-game winning streak in relief of the injured Cam Newton (foot). Christian McCaffrey is arguably the best running back in football this year, and the defense has been good despite losing defensive tackle Kawann Short.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n9. Minnesota Vikings: Kirk Cousins finally threw the ball downfield in Sunday\u2019s 28-10 victory over the New York Giants. That was a must-win game after wide receivers Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen voiced their frustration with the team\u2019s run-heavy direction on offense.\n\n10. Chicago Bears: The shoulder injury to Mitchell Trubisky took its toll in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Oakland Raiders in London, as the Bears fell behind 17-0 and generated just 236 yards of offense behind quarterback Chase Daniel. The bigger surprise was the defense, which allowed 169 rushing yards.\n\n11. Detroit Lions: They\u2019re on a bye this week, but still a factor at 2-1-1. The big story is how much better quarterback Matthew Stafford looks with Darrell Bevell as his offensive coordinator. He is one of the most aggressive passers in the league this year, according to Next Gen Stats, and the Lions are a factor in the stacked NFC North.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAround the NFL\n\n\u2014 The Miami Dolphins are terrible this year, having been outscored 133-16 in four games. But they have some teams that could challenge them for the league\u2019s worst record. The Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Redskins have both started 0-5, while the 0-4 New York Jets might be even worse than those two. The Luke Falk-led offense scored a touchdown in Sunday\u2019s 31-7 loss to the Eagles, ending a string of 39 possessions without one.\n\n\u2014 The Arizona Cardinals were able to get a win for their late owner Bill Bidwill, who passed away Friday. It was the first win for Coach Kliff Kingsbury, who is adjusting his offense a bit. In the first three weeks, the Cardinals ran 130 of their 209 offensive plays in five-receiver sets. In the past two weeks, they\u2019ve been using three- and four-receiver sets. It worked in scoring 26 points Sunday versus the Bengals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 The most satisfied coach in the NFL Sunday was the Oakland Raiders\u2019 Jon Gruden. After being criticized for more than a year for trading Khalil Mack, Gruden beat the Bears, 24-21, and Mack didn\u2019t record a sack.\n\nMore than anything, Gruden is finding out what works for the offense. Gruden wants a physical running attack and he doesn\u2019t want quarterback Derek Carr to make risky throws downfield. According to Next Gen Stats, Carr only had two throws longer than 10 yards. For the season, he only has 19, the lowest number in football. The Raiders are 3-2.\n\n\u2014 Deshaun Watson could join Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson in the MVP race. He had a five-touchdown game in a 53-32 win over the Atlanta Falcons, with 426 yards and a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 The Steelers are in trouble. They are 1-4 and have lost quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for the season, while Mason Rudolph\u2019s status is uncertain after suffering a scary concussion in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Ravens. They are down to undrafted rookie Delvin Hodges as the only remaining quarterback.\n\nThe NFL Players Association wasn\u2019t happy seeing Rudolph have to be helped to the locker room after his concussion, on which he appeared to be knocked out cold by a hit from Ravens safety Earl Thomas. A cart came out to get him, but the cart\u2019s operator couldn\u2019t get it moving.", "description": "Eleven of the NFC's 16 teams have winning records.", "authors": ["John Clayton"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8oJbSaNE8CCx7IA9d0m5NmXBTaw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IWFZMTHIPAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
