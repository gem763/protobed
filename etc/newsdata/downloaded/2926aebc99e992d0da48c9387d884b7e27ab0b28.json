Nearly a month after Afghans went to the polls in seemingly low numbers no results have been released.\n\nPreliminary results are now expected on November 14.", "description": "During their meeting on  Monday, Pakistan PM called on all sides in Afghanistan's protracted war to reduce the violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/f96520c538854dfb9d305e1b12bb5a8e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
