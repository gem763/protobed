(Eric Thayer/Reuters)\n\nWhenever government regulations lead to higher prices, the champions of regulation blame the free market for failing to fix the problem.\n\nIt has \u201cinvariably been the fate of conservatism to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing,\u201d the philosopher and economist Friedrich Hayek famously wrote. Hayek\u2019s larger point was that while conservatism plays an important role in pumping the brakes on radical ideas that go too far, too fast, it lacks a positive alternative agenda itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fairness to American conservatism, Hayek was talking primarily about the European variant that defended a status quo of aristocracy, theocracy, and a fairly closed economy. But his basic point about the conservative temperament has always resonated with me, because it rings true. Conservatives often start from the position of saying \u201cNo\u201d to any new proposal or reform and end up, because of the nature of politics, agreeing to some compromise between no and a total yes.\n\nSometimes this is fine. Sometimes it\u2019s worse than doing nothing. For example, imagine that liberals want to build a bridge that conservatives think is unnecessary pork. Compromising on half a bridge is dumber than no bridge or a whole bridge. Cheering the \u201cbipartisan\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d nature of the half-bridge deal doesn\u2019t change the foolishness of it. Worse, liberals understand that they can pocket the concessions and benefits (union jobs, expanding the baseline budget, etc.) and come back the next year to demand more money to finish the project. As Milton Friedman said, \u201cNothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.\u201d\n\nThis dynamic doesn\u2019t apply just to public works but to a whole raft of market-distorting policies, from subsidies for higher education and health care to entitlements. The political priority for liberals is to establish the principle that there is a role for government in X and then keep insisting that the supposedly worthy initiative is underfunded. Look at where Democrats are today on health care. A couple years ago the Affordable Care Act was a bold progressive reform. Now it\u2019s too conservative for Democrats eager to do away with private health insurance and establish Medicare for All.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes this dialectic so frustrating for conservatives is that whenever government regulations lead to higher prices \u2014 in college tuition, energy prices, rent, etc. \u2014 the champions of further regulation blame the free market for failing to fix the problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seems worth bearing in mind as President Trump and Democratic leaders hammer out an agreement to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure before agreeing on where the money will come from or how to spend it. The president would like to put it on the nation\u2019s credit card. The Democrats have no insurmountable objection to that, but they\u2019d like to goad Trump into agreeing (before the 2020 election) to tax hikes to pay for it.\n\nHowever it\u2019s spent, or paid for, you can be sure that before the last dollar goes out the door, Democrats will be insisting again that infrastructure is underfunded and that the private sector is inadequate to the task.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t really have a solution, in part because I\u2019m not sure there is one. And as the saying goes, a problem without a solution isn\u2019t a problem, it\u2019s simply a fact. This is the nature of politics generally, and not just for conservatives. After all, there are many issues where liberals start from a position of \u201cNo\u201d and end up being forced to accept a compromise they don\u2019t like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as a conservative of the Hayekian variety, I see a particular threat in how some on the right are responding to this inconvenient truth: They want to get in on the action.\n\nHistorically, the primary conservative argument against top-down planning wasn\u2019t so much that politicians and bureaucrats aren\u2019t smart enough to run the economy from some Washington-based control room, but that it simply can\u2019t be done. Policymakers suffer from what Hayek called \u201cthe knowledge problem.\u201d The market is too complex, with too many variables on the ground, for anyone to manage things from above.\n\nOn some parts of the right, the argument is changing. The new proponents of \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d no longer think elites can\u2019t run the economy \u2014 just that liberal elites, or \u201cglobalists,\u201d can\u2019t run it. Part of this stems from the often-paranoid conviction that liberal elites have brilliantly rigged the system in their favor. So, the thinking goes, if they can pull that off, so can we.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work that way. Such thinking is wrong regardless of the partisan agenda behind it, which is why Hayek dedicated his book The Road to Serfdom to \u201cthe Socialists of All Parties.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY LLC", "description": "Policymakers suffer from what Hayek called \u201cthe knowledge problem.\u201d The market is too complex, with too many variables on the ground, for anyone to manage things from above.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
