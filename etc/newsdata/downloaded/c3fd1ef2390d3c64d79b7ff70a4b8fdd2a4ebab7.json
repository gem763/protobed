When I was told I was going to be vice-captain it was an honour for me. As soon as Mesut came off I knew I was getting the armband so it was just a great moment.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt [the vote] was just writing names down and then giving them to the manager. He will go through them obviously with his input and we will see what happens. If I get it, then I will be more than happy and honoured to do it.\n\n\u201cI would love to be a captain and being captain of Arsenal is unbelievable. It would be a great feeling. We will see what happens in the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nEmery said this summer that he wants an English player to be part of the captaincy group Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nArsenal are routinely criticised for a lack of leadership on the pitch but Holding insisted there are plenty of strong characters within the dressing room, citing the influence of David Luiz behind the scenes since the Brazilian\u2019s move from Chelsea.\n\n\u201cYou can see it in training,\u201d Holding said. \u201cThe way David Luiz has come in and when he is talking in front of the group he speaks really well.\n\n\u201cI love Granit in the changing room. I think he is great. He is really switched on to people being late, people using the phones. He is quick to dishing out the fines. I think he is a great leader and just another positive person to have in the changing room.\n\n\u201cHe is very sort of demanding and makes demand of us. He puts accountability on ourselves, which is important as a leader.\n\n\u201cNow that we've got these five captains that the manager has brought in it's spreading the leadership group rather than having one person to dictate it. You're getting more input, it's generating a good environment.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal\u2019s players held a blind vote to help Unai Emery to decide who will be the club\u2019s captains as the Spaniard looks to rebuild his five-man leadership group after a summer of upheaval.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mmhvXNTcKG3W_5ZqoHBb5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B0Z4O0ZRV2WsUGWG4lAwqA--~B/aD0xMjI1O3c9MTk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/a0ce91971082fb404ba806639fc768e1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
