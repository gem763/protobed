But the goal of pushing Maduro from office has been slow to materialize, and the United States has blamed Cuba and Russia for continuing to support him.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, the statement said, \u201cthe human rights situation in Cuba remains abysmal, with state authorities harassing and arbitrarily jailing activists, dissidents, artists, and others questioning regime authority with impunity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDirect commercial flights and other expanded travel opportunities from the United States to Cuba came as part of the Obama administration\u2019s opening to Cuba, which reopened diplomatic relations with Havana in 2015. Tourism remained prohibited, under the terms of economic sanctions in effect since 1962, but a number of categories of permitted travel were expanded. Many restrictions have now been reimposed by President Trump.\n\nIn June, Travel Weekly reported that \u201cairlines have had relatively consistent U.S.-Cuba bookings of between 130,000 and 170,000 one-way passengers per month since September 2017, following higher numbers during the first year after commercial flights were authorized\u201d in 2016.\n\nCharter flights, most utilized by Cuban Americans, will still be permitted under the new restrictions.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Commerce Department also said it would revoke licenses for aircraft leases to Cuban state-owned airlines, forcing national carrier Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n to suspend flights to several Latin American destinations.\n\nAD", "description": "American, Delta and JetBlue airlines, which now offer flights to nine destinations other than the Cuban capital, have 45 days to stop them.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7gmAYN4jCmjwbGWaQMVYuUma4Xw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LBRV3QHXQQI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
