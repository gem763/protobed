I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve seen it yet.\u201d\n\nAs for the evidence that has already been presented in the whistleblower complaint, the now-infamous July 25 Ukraine call and the actual comments made by Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Kennedy claimed that this was just part of the job of being president.\n\n\u201cThe problem is if responsible journalists go back and look at some of the same types of conversations and dealings and quid pro quo that's happened with past administrations,\u201d the Fox host declared. \u201cYou might build a case that you've seen the exact same thing with President Clinton, and President Bush, and President Obama over and over and over again, particularly with allies \u2014 \u2018allies\u2019 \u2014 like Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\u201d\n\nFollowing this bit of whataboutism, Kennedy pivoted to lowering the bar and moving the goalposts, shifting away from conservatives' previous talking points.\n\n\u201cYou know, quid pro quo means this for that,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThat is not necessarily illegal, and I think every administration and every president can say, well, that's how you get things done. We've got something they want, so if we're going to exchange in order to get what is most beneficial for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is, and I don't think Democrats have done this yet, they have not drawn the line when it sort of falls over the cliff of illegality,\u201d Kennedy continued. \u201cAnd that's very, very important, and that has to be completely stark.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, earlier this week, Fox & Friends co-host Steve Doocy claimed it would be \u201coff-the-rails wrong\u201d if the president sought a quid pro quo from Ukraine. That statement, of course, came prior to the release of the whistleblower complaint.", "description": "\u201cThat is not necessarily illegal, and I think every administration and every president can say, well, that's how you get things done,\u201d Lisa Kennedy declared on Thursday.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569535674/outnumbered_28_n0fc47", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
