I was diagnosed very unexpectedly during my annual physical and my cardiologist said, \u201cwhat are you doing this afternoon?\u201d And I said well actually I\u2019m going to Panama Pictures for lunch, and he said, \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t\u201d.\n\n\u2018And in five minutes I was on a gurney giving details of next of kin so it was rather dramatic. So I didn\u2019t have time to brood on it, but all I knew was I was in the best possible hands there could have been and I was going to be taken care of. But yes it was a wake-up call.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can catch This Morning weekdays on ITV at 10.30am.\n\nNeed support?
