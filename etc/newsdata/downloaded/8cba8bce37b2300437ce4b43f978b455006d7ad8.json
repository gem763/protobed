This is not like, you know, 'Andy figures out what the CIA was up to.' We had this guy in, testifying. And he also, you know, whatever. What he didn't say in his testimony, he said on MSNBC. So, you know, I would think that they're very relevant witnesses.\"\n\nFox News reported Tuesday that Durham's probe had expanded significantly based on new evidence uncovered during a recent trip to Rome with Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nSteyn asked McCarthy if it's likely the CIA is \"on the hook\" for the alleged misconduct.\n\n\"I think that when you look at this as the full continuum of the investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department are almost late to the party. This actually, I think, started as strands of foreign intelligence that came into the government through the CIA and that ended up with the bureau because the CIA acted as kind of a clearinghouse for it,\" McCarthy said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We coordinate with the foreign intelligence and the foreign government in those places. So there was a lot of foreign activity here,\" McCarthy added. \"That's where I think the real collusion was.\"\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman, Gregg Re and Ed Henry contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Andy McCarthy reacted Friday to the latest news that U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing probe has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/ANDY-CROP-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
