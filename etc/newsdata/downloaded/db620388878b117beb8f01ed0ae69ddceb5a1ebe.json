All images are metaphorical in nature only', it said\n\n'We are on the right side of history,' Brown said. 'The billboard is an expression of our First Amendment right. Its art is a symbol. We would never condone violence. This is about taking our country back.'\n\nOther ads in the campaign show models taping over Trump's mouth.\n\n'He unilaterally has created a gag rule that you cannot refer patients with reproductive information about abortion, sex ed, and contraception,' Brown said.\n\n'He's gagging doctors and nurses, and telling them what they can and cannot tell patients.'\n\nDue to the ad's violent nature, there was some back and forth between Dhvani and Lamar Advertising, the agency that operates the billboard\n\nThe company bought the ad space in Times Square and it includes 'middle school teacher and Marine Corps veteran Michal Mesa' over Trump\n\nAccording to Dhvani, the model in the billboard, Michal Mesa, is a Marine Corps veteran and middle school teacher.\n\nDue to the ad's violent nature, there was some creative division between Dhvani and Lamar Advertising, the agency that operates the billboard.\n\n'The client wanted to use a photo of the President but we said no,' said Lamar Advertising's digital marketing coordinator, GraceAnn Woolf. The company insisted on a look-alike instead.\n\nBrown said there's been an increase of traffic to the company's website, along with a jump in sales, since the billboard went up. He did not elaborate on the sales figures.\n\nThe billboard went up just days after a spoof video of Trump attacking his detractors, including journalists and politicians, was shown at his Florida golf resort\n\nTrump's son, Donald Trump Jr, tweaked the media Friday for not writing about the billboard sooner in a Tweet and referred to a parody video showing his father attacking detractors\n\n'This is about giving a voice to women,' said Brown, 46, who founded the company last year.\n\n'Our intent is for our brand to stand for progressive change in the face of what we perceive to be steps backwards in the evolution of our country.'\n\nIn other images issued as part of the ad campaign, one model is seen putting her fingers on Donald Trump's lips as he kneels down beside her.\n\nAnother image shows five models in athletic wear surrounding Trump as he is gagged with black tape and appears disheveled as he sits on a chair.\n\nBrown told The Washington Post: 'We\u2019ve never taken a political stand before but frankly, we were fed up.\n\n'This is just saying: Let\u2019s put a gag order on him. Enough is enough. We support impeachment.'", "description": "Donald Trump is pictured being tied up by a woman standing over him with the The White House in the background in a controversial billboard which has been erected in Times Square.", "authors": ["Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/20/19934460-0-image-a-25_1571513289697.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
