Labor has already opened the door to increasing the $6 billion bank levy.\n\nWhile the big four banks reported a cash profit after tax of $14.5 billion for the first half of 2019, those profits were down 4 per cent after what some termed a horror year.\n\nProfessor Harper also pointed to the recent action by the European Central Bank to step in and protect bank profits because he says \"we don't want people putting their money into a safe or into a hole in the ground\".\n\n\"Other central banks are concerned,\" he said, \"and for good reason.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'You can't pay people to switch'\n\nConsumer activists such as Barefoot Investor Scott Pape have made a career out of successfully arming customers with scripts to call their bank and demand a better rate.\n\nBut Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive Gerard Brody wants the government and regulators to do more than just issue warnings.\n\nConsumer Action Law Centre director Gerard Brody: \"The banks know it is very easy to tell people to shop around but much more difficult to do.\" Supplied\n\n\"The Treasurer is telling people to shop around but if that is the only policy prescription the government have got, we will still be complaining about this in 20 years time,\" he said.\n\nFormer Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris has urged the Treasurer to act on the 34 recommendations in his report last year, including a best interest duty, rather than calling another inquiry.\n\nProfessor Harper favours improved transparency, so that consumers are armed with the right information to make their own decision. But even he admits that if it's left in the hands of consumers, most people can't be bothered acting.\n\n\"For a lot of people it is just too much of a hassle,\" he said. \"We constantly have people turn up at my door with a new energy offer and I say, 'I'm sorry mate, I'm not interested, I've got better things to do'.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the Victorian government has found you can't even pay people to shop around.\n\nIt offered energy customers $50 to go onto their government-backed website to compare providers, but have had to extend the offer after estimates it had given away less than $14 million of its $48 million package.\n\nComparator website finder.com.au warns the problem is even more pronounced for credit cards and home loans than in energy.\n\nWhile 18 per cent of people have switched mobile phone plans, 13 per cent have switched electricity providers and 10 per cent have switched broadband, only 8 per cent have switched credit cards and just 3 per cent home loans over the past six months. That is despite the mortgage topping the list of expenses which cause the most stress.\n\nFurther, 40 per cent of adults are still with their childhood bank, which suggests more than 7 million have never switched banks.\n\nLittle can be done\n\nIn contrast, the Australian Bankers Association proudly sung the findings of a Deloitte Access Economic report on Thursday, claiming 2.8 million customers switched banks for their home loan, credit card or transaction account last year and \"competition is robust\".\n\nProfessor Harper said another important element of the equation was that banking is relational, not simply a transactional purchase based on price alone. \"People often stay partly because of that relationship and history,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompetition law expert Geoff Carter agreed there was little that can be done under the current legal framework.\n\nThe Trade Practices Act did specifically prohibit price discrimination in relation to goods (but not services) before 1995, but several competition reviews concluded the prohibition did not benefit consumers or small business.\n\n\"Price discrimination is in fact an extremely common commercial practice and it would only be very unusual factual circumstances which would give rise to a valid misuse of market power or unconscionable conduct case,\" he said.\n\nA fresh inquiry?\n\nBut Mr Brody argued banking, like energy, was a special case and also supports as a minimum the duty proposed by Mr Harris. \"The banks know it is very easy to tell people to shop around but much more difficult to do,\" he said.\n\n\"It takes a lot of time, it's confusing, the standard rates are not the rates people pay and so people tend to give up.\"\n\nHe said former Treasurer Wayne Swan's bank switching package of 2010 failed largely because it was too limited in scope, focusing only on transactional accounts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe pointed instead to a widespread UK inquiry which has examined so-called loyalty penalties across insurance, banks, energy and telecommunications.\n\n\"For insurers they are considering whether to ban or restrict price increases for consumers who renew year on year, or automatically require them to move consumers to their cheapest deal, that could apply to mortgages here too.\"\n\nMr Brody said the government should also consider a fresh inquiry or support a government-backed comparator website like the abandoned Grocery Choice or Fuel Watch, after the Productivity Commission also recommended public disclosure of actual mortgage rates.\n\nIn energy, the federal government went further and introduced a default offer, but Mr Sims said loyal customers were \"paying ridiculous prices\" and the case for a similar intervention against the banks was not yet made out.\n\n\"For airline fares, people know and can see that if you travel at an inconvenient time it will be cheaper, but for an essential service like a mortgage what is the justification?\" Mr Brody asked.", "description": "Economist Ian Harper said the banks' $3 billion \"loyalty tax\" was neither illegal nor unusual, as experts say customers can blame themselves for being ripped off.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4089%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_595%2C$y_338/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d0d78e8c2c15450eaf80305d3ef9ac9de9647bad", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
