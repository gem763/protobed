Photo: House House\n\nSuddenly and somewhat unexpectedly, the internet has become obsessed with a game about a goose. Untitled Goose Game is simple: You, a goose, wander around a small English village and enact mild, hilarious chaos. You irritate a gardener by stealing some of his belongings. You honk at startling moments. You make some of the villagers do awkward, annoying things to deal with your mischievous shenanigans. You break a few things, but nothing all that important. The worst thing that happens is someone\u2019s thumb gets a little hurt.\n\nUntitled Goose Game is improbably fun, at least in part because of how low-stakes it all is. It\u2019s silly and gentle and smart. Propelling the goose through the pleasant, bucolic environments feels like engaging in some ultimately harmless misbehavior, a playground of sanctioned naughtiness where you\u2019re definitely going to ruin someone\u2019s day, but you\u2019re never going to destroy anyone\u2019s life.\n\nAfter playing through all of Untitled Goose Game in almost one sitting (and forcing myself to stop before starting in on the post-game extra credit), I talked with Jacob Strasser and Michael McMaster, two of the four-person indie game company, House House, which created and developed Untitled Goose Game. I asked them about the uncanny appeal of the goose, how the game developed from its earliest concepts, and the idea of the goose as a leftist icon. (Spoiler: They love this idea.)\n\nThe game started when someone just put a picture of a goose into your Slack and said, \u201cLet\u2019s make this a game,\u201d right?\n\nJacob Strasser: Yeah, that was our colleague, Stuart Gillespie-Cook. There was never really any intention that we should make a game about it, he just saw a stock photo and remembered that geese were funny, like, conceptually. We all agreed that geese were very funny.\n\nWhat was the motivation for turning the funny goose into a game? There\u2019s a big distance between \u201cthis image is funny\u201d to wanting to make a full game out of it.\n\nStrasser: When we were finishing our last game, Push Me Pull You, We had a lot of different ideas floating around for our next game. We knew we wanted to make a game in 3-D. We wanted to make a single-player thing. We were very interested in depictions of community and having this character that you could puppeteer so you could embody this physical thing.\n\nStuart made this joke about the goose and we had a laugh about it, and then we said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go back to more serious ideas.\u201d But when that didn\u2019t quite work, we finally said, \u201cOh, what about that goose thing?\u201d Eventually we turned around and realized that it could be a serious idea, a viable game.\n\nWatch: How Untitled Goose Game Was Made\n\nIt\u2019s interesting you were thinking about depictions of community. The goose seems like it\u2019s mainly a disruption of the community, this asshole goose who keeps showing up to disorder everyone\u2019s lives.\n\nMichael McMaster: The original pitch for this goose version of the game was that there\u2019d be this large-scale simulated English f\u00eate \u2014 a country fair is kind of the American equivalent. We had this image of a huge crowd of people, and you as a goose would come in and disrupt that. But we didn\u2019t really think through how complicated it\u2019d be to design and program this completely systemic f\u00eate. What happened then was this slow process of winnowing down the concept so that rather than this massive crowd of people, it became this collection of a handful of people.\n\nI\u2019d imagine that was mostly a practical issue? With a huge group of people you\u2019d need so many possible interactions between all the people and all the objects in the world. Did you ever play with the idea of there being a fail state in the game?\n\nStrasser: As we were building out the game, actually, the first ingredients we needed were the goose and the person. We very quickly realized that the low-level relationship between a goose and person was really interesting and really rich, and had all this opportunity for depth and nuance and humor. The big crowd scene was too macro to allow those sorts of things to happen, so we realized it was more interesting to have fewer people and allow those relationships to exist more richly.\n\nThe lack of a fail state is because of that relationship, and because of how grounded it was.\n\nMcMaster: The relationship feels quite real, and quite tangible. To turn that into a violent fail state would just feel so egregious in this setting. We wanted to keep it as realistic as possible.\n\nStrasser: We never wanted there to be any threat of violence or open hostility between the players and the game. We were more comfortable with the idea that, yeah, maybe they\u2019d shoo you away as maybe you would a goose in real life, but unless you\u2019re a hunter or an animal-control person, you\u2019re not going to do anything more than that. It was a way to keep it low-stakes in that personal, intimate way that we quite liked.\n\nYou describe the relationship between a person and a goose as one of depth and nuance. I definitely experienced that while playing the game, but would never have said that I\u2019ve experienced that with a goose in real life. Did it take a long time to get from \u201cHere\u2019s a funny picture of a goose\u201d to \u201cThis is a relationship with depth and nuance\u201d?\n\nStrasser: It happened fairly early. One of the earliest prototypes of the game was a very rough version of the garden that\u2019s in the game now, just a big open green space with a man who looked very similar to our current groundskeeper, and the goose. We made a few props, and the man cared about the props, and the goose could pick them up. The basic early blocks were there.\n\nA still from the game in an early development phase. Photo: House House\n\nIt was quite instant. We used this thing called inverse kinematics, which is a way to make game characters look at stuff, basically, and we set it so the goose would look at where the gardener was. No matter where he was in the world, the goose would turn his head to look at him. And the gardener would do the same. And just having those two characters look at each other \u2014 the world was totally bare, it was pretty rough and early \u2014 but having two characters look at each other in silence had all this stuff in it. Just that eye contact creates this relationship that you can put so much meaning into. It happened early on. And it was very, very funny. I remember just feeling like we\u2019d landed on something special.\n\nI love the ending very much. I laughed so hard at the final shot, but I don\u2019t want to spoil it for anyone who hasn\u2019t played it. Where did that idea come from?\n\nStrasser: We did have this big blank space for how the game was going to end. We threw around a lot of ideas. It didn\u2019t have to be that exciting from a gameplay perspective, but we wanted it to feel like it came to some sort of closure.\n\nMcMaster: Probably the core of the idea of the whole finale sequence was that we wanted it to feel like the entire town was now unified against you, and you had to go back through the space that you\u2019ve just wrecked havoc in and account for it in some way. [Laughs.]\n\nStrasser is very proud of the drinking fountain. Photo: House House\n\nDo you have personal favorite details in the game? Small things you\u2019re particularly fond of?\n\nStrasser: I really love the drinking fountain in the garden. I made it really really late in the game, and modeled it and thought, \u201cAh, that\u2019s the perfect drinking fountain.\u201d [McMaster laughs in the background.] No one else will look at it, but it\u2019s in the credits. [Some background muttering.]\n\nI\u2019ve just been tapped on the shoulder by our colleague Stuart to say that in the backyards level, there\u2019s a little statue of a fish that\u2019s got legs. Just for the record, his and probably my favorite thing in the game is this little statue of a fish that internally we refer to as Jeremy Fish.\n\nWhere did Jeremy Fish come from?\n\nStrasser: Stuart, do you want to come tag into an interview for a bit?\n\nStuart Gillespie-Cook: I guess there\u2019s a Beatrix Potter character called Jeremy Fisher, who\u2019s like a funny frog who dances ballet, maybe? We wanted the character of this woman who has all this stuff in her backyard to be a bit wacky. So we spent a while trying to come up with different lawn ornaments she could have, and Jeremy Fish was the best of them.\n\nJeremy Fish. Photo: House House\n\nMcMaster: The other thing I wanted to mention: There\u2019s this sequence where you rush through a house and get kicked out of a door, and it feels like maybe the biggest indulgence we took with the game. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of gameplay opportunity, and you can only interact with it one way. It\u2019s a single gag in an entire game. It took so much work to make you move through the house in that way and get kicked out the door, and if you\u2019re carrying an item it gets thrown out after you in this really graceful way. I\u2019m very glad that we spent probably way too much time to get this one very specific gag into the game.\n\nThere\u2019s been some very small but angry political responses to the game. Have you seen any of it? Do you have any feelings about it? It\u2019s hard to figure out the political angle on this goose without doing a super Marxist reading.\n\nStrasser: We have a joke canonical version of the world of the game, in which \u2014 I don\u2019t think you should publish this, but for the sake of conversation \u2014 it\u2019s set in a world where a goose chased Margaret Thatcher out of office, leading Tony Benn to take over the U.K. and enact social democracy in the U.K. All the people are good Marxists, and they\u2019re all good people, and the goose is just a goose. All the people on Twitter responded to that saying \u201cOh, I feel bad that the goose is harassing these Marxists.\u201d\n\n[Laughs.]\n\nStrasser: I\u2019m not going to go on Twitter and correct people because I have better things to do, but the goose is just a goose. The goose is this chaotic neutral character. They\u2019re just an animal who\u2019s not really aware of what they\u2019re doing.\n\nSo I don\u2019t need to read into the game to try to figure out which of the people voted for Brexit?\n\nStrasser: You can if you like! You\u2019re very welcome to predict whatever you\u2019d like. We\u2019ve got our joke canon.\n\nMcMaster: I\u2019m glad that the goose is a leftist icon; that\u2019s very funny. I\u2019d much rather it be a leftist icon than a right icon.\n\nHave you heard of Gritty?\n\nMcMaster: Oh, if he can be the new Gritty that\u2019d be fantastic! Anything the left can take joy in and pride in and have a bit of fun with, we love. And if it pisses off some alt-right people, then great.\n\nStrasser: That will maybe happen no matter what.\n\nDo you have any thoughts about why the game has resonated with people as much as it has?\n\nStrasser: I think your guess is as good as ours? We made a game that we thought was funny, about a goose.\n\nMcMaster: The way I\u2019ve always thought about it is, it turns out people have strong feelings about geese. Maybe without realizing how strongly they felt about it. So it creates a moment of joy. There probably is something more interesting there, but I\u2019m not sure what it is.\n\nStrasser: Yeah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve figured it out.", "description": "An interview with  Jacob Strasser and Michael McMaster, two of the creators of the hit PC and Nintendo Switch game \u2018Untitled Goose Game,\u2019 on how the game came to be and why they think it\u2019s become such an instant hit.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/untitled-goose-game/27-untitled-goose-game-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
