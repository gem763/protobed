A representative Breitbart headline: \"While Democrats pursue impeachment, President Trump builds impressive record of accomplishments.\"\n\nThe president has been lapping up Breitbart's coverage \u2014 to such an extent that \"Saturday Night Live\" made fun of Trumpworld's Breitbart habit in their cold open last night. In a meeting with Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani pulls out a \"Breitbart Office Poll\" that \"says 121% of people want Biden impeached.\"\n\nThe big picture: The entire Biden-Ukraine narrative began with \"Secret Empires,\" a book by Breitbart's senior contributor Peter Schweizer. Ahead of the last election, Schweizer published \"Clinton Cash,\" which portrayed Bill and Hillary Clinton as corrupt grifters and set the tone of some influential coverage in 2016. (Trump promoted Schweizer's book on Twitter yesterday.)\n\nWhat we're seeing:\n\nTrump has promoted Breitbart multiple times as a source of polling. In one of Trump's favored Breitbart polls \u2014 which bear no relation to public opinion \u2014 97.83% of respondents say they \"stand with President Trump\" against impeachment.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have been using Breitbart as a key platform in their campaign against impeachment.\n\nAnd it's not just ultra-conservative, Freedom Caucus types. Establishment Republicans including members of leadership like Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (who has given Breitbart multiple \"exclusives\") and Minority Whip Steve Scalise have been appearing on Breitbart's radio shows.\n\nSenior White House official Stephen Miller will be appearing on Breitbart's radio show tonight.\n\nFlashback: We're coming up on 2 years since Steve Bannon was forced out of Breitbart and publicly trashed by the president. The ultra-right-wing website spent some time on the outs from the White House as a result of Bannon's exile, but it's now back as one of Trump's go-to outlets.", "description": "With the exception of true believers like Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, Trump has grown disillusioned with Fox News.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/l7x_uue-7Ydr6eHLjuk-9HA3luA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/06/1570398746321.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
