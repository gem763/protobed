The striker's goalbound shot was palmed away acrobatically by Derby keeper Kelle Roos.\n\nConor Gallagher's superb long-range strike capped off an impressive performance\n\nMATCH FACTS Charlton Athletic (3-4-3): Phillips; Lockyer, Pratley, Sarr; Solly, Cullen, Gallagher (Kayal 78'), Forster-Caskey; Leko, Bonne (Hemed 74'), Williams (Field 32') Subs not used: Amos, Pearce, Oshilaja, Oztumer Derby County (4-2-3-1): Roos; Bogle, Davies, Clarke, Malone; Bielik (Holmes 60'), Shinnie; Waghorn (Jozefzoon 60'), Paterson (Bennett 77'), Lawrence; Martin Subs not used: Hamer, Wisdom, Lowe, Dowell Referee: Stephen Martin\n\nSadly for the home side, the blossoming partnership was split up just after the half-hour when Williams limped off following a midfield challenge.\n\nThat failed to curtail Charlton's dominance with Roos then having to rush from his goal to deflect a Josh Cullen shot away for a corner.\n\nIn contrast, Derby were offering almost nothing at the other end apart from a speculative 25-yard shot from Krystian Bielik which plopped harmlessly into the arms of Charlton keeper Dillon Phillips.\n\nAny thoughts that half-time would signal a momentum shift were soon dispelled when the unmarked Naby Sarr headed home Cullen's corner three minutes into the second half.\n\nAgain, Derby's response was lukewarm at best with only Tom Lawrence, booed throughout for his recent drink-driving conviction, offering any creative spark and spirit.\n\nTime and again, the Wales international attempted to take on his man, but with his teammates offering little in the way of support, Charlton quickly realised they could crowd Lawrence out.\n\nVictory was sealed with a majestic 20-yard curling shot from Gallagher which left Roos helpless as it bent into the corner of the net after 67 minutes.\n\nJonathan Leko might have added a fourth 10 minutes from time but scuffed his shot from the edge of the box.", "description": "It was Charlton who looked like promotion contenders with a display of attacking verve which swept the visitors away.", "authors": ["Ivan Speck For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19938396-0-image-a-8_1571522226578.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
