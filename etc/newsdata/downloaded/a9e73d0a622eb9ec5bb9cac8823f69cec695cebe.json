But since appearing on The Bachelor, Abbie said she has grown so much as a person, and wanted to share her story with women across the country to break down the stigma surrounding abortions.\n\n\u201cThe Bachelor is just these perfect women on this perfect show and you fall in love and it\u2019s happy and great and and it\u2019s easy stuff, but it\u2019s not easy and I just want people to know that a lot of women have abortions and whether or not you know they have abortions or not, it\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want people to be shamed for that or feel eternal shame. And maybe someone who\u2019s kind of in the public eye saying they\u2019ve had an abortion and saying that it\u2019s okay will help them.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to Abbie\u2019s full interview on Shameless, right HERE.", "description": "Abbie Chatfield has opened up about her tumultuous time on The Bachelor,\u00a0revealing she had an abortion just months before going on the show.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-10-at-5.38.07-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
