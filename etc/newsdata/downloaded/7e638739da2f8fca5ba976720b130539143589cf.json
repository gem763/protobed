But by DelFattore\u2019s own reckoning, there was a chance that by not having a husband, her life might have been at unnecessary risk.\n\nThe pivotal moment came when she was asked by an oncologist how she\u2019d cope with the harsh side effects of a particularly nasty course of chemotherapy without the dedicated support of a loving partner, children, or parents.\n\nOf course, a nuclear family is no guarantee that a patient will have a network of volunteers to help out when the ravages of chemo make everyday life that much harder to manage. By the same token, being single doesn\u2019t necessarily mean support isn\u2019t available.", "description": "", "authors": ["Science Alert", "Sciencealert.Com There-Could-Be-A-Dangerous-Bias-Against-Single-People-In-Cancer-Treatment"], "top_image": ""}
