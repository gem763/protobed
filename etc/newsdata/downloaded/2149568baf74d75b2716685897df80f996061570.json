But by evening they had largely dispersed in preparation for bigger marches planned for Sunday.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp suspended all services, paralyzing transport in the Asian financial hub, while malls and shops closed early after a night of chaos in which police shot a teenage boy and protesters torched businesses and metro stations.\n\nProtests had erupted on Friday across the former British colony hours after its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to ban the use of face masks demonstrators have been using to hide their identities.\n\nThe night\u2019s \u201cextreme violence\u201d justified the use of the emergency law, Beijing-backed Lam said in a television address on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe radical behavior of rioters took Hong Kong through a very dark night, leaving society today half-paralyzed,\u201d she said in pre-recorded remarks.\n\n\u201cThe extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong\u2019s public safety is widely endangered. That\u2019s the concrete reason that we had to invoke emergency law yesterday to introduce the anti-mask law.\u201d\n\nUndeterred by the ban and transport shutdown, several hundred pro-democracy protesters - many wearing masks - marched through the normally bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay on Saturday, but there was no repeat of Friday\u2019s violence.\n\nOther groups gathered in Sheung Shui close to the border with mainland China and in the busy shopping and tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\n\u201cWe felt we had to get out and show our basic right to wear a mask,\u201d said one protester, Sue, 22, who wore a black mask and dark glasses to the Causeway Bay march.\n\nRelated Coverage U.N. calls for probe into violence related to Hong Kong protests\n\n\u201cThe government needs to learn it can\u2019t squeeze Hong Kong people like this.\u201d\n\nThe increasingly violent demonstrations that have roiled the city for four months began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China for trial. They have since spiraled into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that granted it autonomy and broad freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said on Friday the protests were evolving into a revolution backed by foreign forces and could not continue indefinitely.\n\nThe United Nations human rights chief called on Saturday for an independent probe into the violence seen during the protests.\n\nMichelle Bachelet told a media conference in Kuala Lumpur the U.N. was: \u201calarmed by the injuries to the police and protesters, including journalists and protesters shot by law enforcement officers\u201d.\n\nTRANSPORT SHUTDOWN\n\nMTR Corp shut its network, which carries about 5 million passengers a day, while shopping malls and supermarkets also closed in a blow for a city on the edge of recession.\n\n\u201cAs we are no longer in a position to provide safe and reliable service to passengers in the circumstances, the corporation had no choice but to make the decision to suspend the service of its entire network,\u201d MTR said in a statement.\n\nProtesters had set fires at stations as well as to an empty train, and injured two staff, added MTR.\n\nAnti-government protesters wearing masks attend a protest in central Hong Kong, China October 5, 2019.

Some set fires, hurled petrol bombs at police and burned the Chinese national flag, in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.\n\nBachelet said on Saturday that face masks should not be used to provoke violence, but she warned Hong Kong against using the ban to target particular groups or curtail the right to freedom of assembly.\n\nPolice said an officer in Yuen Long, a district in the outlying New Territories that saw fierce clashes in July, had fired a shot in self-defense on Friday night after a protester threw a petrol bomb at him, setting him on fire.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nMedia said a 14-year-old boy was shot and the city\u2019s Hospital Authority said his condition was now stable but gave no further details.\n\nAlso late on Friday, about 100 demonstrators besieged a branch of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) in the high-end shopping district of Causeway Bay, while across the harbor in the district of Kowloon, protesters smashed the glass store front of a China Life Insurance branch.\n\nPolice fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters in flashpoint districts such as Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Wong Tai Sin, underscoring the challenges they face as protests show no sign of letting up.\n\nHospital authorities said 31 people were hurt in Friday\u2019s protests, two of them seriously.", "description": "Hong Kong fell eerily silent on Saturday, with the subway and most shopping malls closed in an unprecedented shutdown of one of the world's biggest commercial centers after the government invoked emergency measures to curb months of unrest.", "authors": ["Felix Tam", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437314969&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9404U", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
