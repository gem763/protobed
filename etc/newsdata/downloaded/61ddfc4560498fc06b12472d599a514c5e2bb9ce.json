One unnamed source told the paper that \u201cthere\u2019s some very hard modelling going on. We are asking why we have so many people in Europe when we\u2019ve got double-digit returns in parts of Asia.\u201d\n\nHSBC employs 240,000 worldwide and the report did not reveal what regions would be most affected. If HSBC were to cut the 10,000 jobs, this would be on top of the 4,700 redundancies it has already announced, globally.\n\nHSBC did not comment on the report.\n\nREAD MORE: HSBC just got another new banking boss\n\nIn August this year, HSBC CEO John Flint stepped down after 30 years at the bank.The group announced Barry O'Byrne as interim head of its global commercial banking division, after his predecessor Noel Quinn took over from Flint \u2014 also in an interim capacity.\n\nWhile Flint has a 12 month notice period, he will stop his day-to-day responsibilities at the group and help HSBC in the transition to find a replacement, while Quinn takes over as interim chief executive.\n\nAt the same time, the group announced it will cut up to 2% of the 237,685-strong global workforce \u2014 which equates to 4,700 people.\n\nShares in HSBC are slightly down on Monday morning:", "description": "If this happened, it will be on top of the 4,700 redundancies that were announced in August this year.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rYBWvQvcfsoKMGm59_PXiA--~B/aD0xMzEyO3c9MjAyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/02d0e670-e8cf-11e9-bec5-6cb82501e1bb", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
