(Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\n\"We don't want to be golf course managers or owners,\" she said.\n\n\"There has to be another way to make this work that's better for everybody, not just the people who own property backing onto the golf course.\"\n\n'The heart of our community'\n\nJay McLean, president of the Stonebridge Community Association and a member of the working group, said the vote on the levy will be the best way to decide the issue, which has hung over the community for more than a year.\n\n\"This is a very divisive issue in the Stonebridge community,\" he said.\n\nAs the plan currently stands, voting could begin next week if approved by city council and the results could be known next month.\n\nProposed timeline for the Stonebridge levy vote would have a result by Nov. 15 \u2014 after an approx 30 day voting period. <a href=\"https://t.co/1w9BiCnotP\">pic.twitter.com/1w9BiCnotP</a> \u2014@matthewkupfer\n\nHe said even those who don't live next to the golf course are implicated in protecting the area.\n\n\"The greenspace, whether it's a golf course or not, is the heart of our community. We've talked to many specialists who have reiterated the fact that this is an instrumental component of our property value.\"\n\nThe community association posted an online version of its letter of intent with Mattamy during Monday's meeting, outlining in more detail the terms of the agreement.\n\nProposal tweaked\n\nThe plan has residents paying a dedicated levy tied to their property tax assessment until the community raises $7 million.\n\nThat money would cover the $6 million price of the golf course and money for any transition either to a community-run facility or for the city to turn it into a greenspace.\n\nGolf course owner and developer Mattamy Homes would build 158 homes on part of the golf course as it proposed in June 2018, but the developer would commit to no further development on the property and redesign the golf course so it maintains its current standard.\n\nMattamy's original plan last year was to take the highlighted area in the southeast corner of the golf course and build homes on it. (Mattamy Homes)\n\nIt would also pledge to keep operating the course for at least another 10 years.\n\nThe catchment area for the levy was adjusted in early September to exclude about 300 properties that the working group determined were actually in the neighbouring community of Half Moon Bay.", "description": "Some residents of south Ottawa's Stonebridge community are expressing skepticism about the plan to buy a south Ottawa golf course using a community levy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303816.1569899004!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dawn-wilson.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
