Email webnews@mirror.co.uk\n\n(Image: lincolnshirelive.co.uk)\n\nIt means that Chelsea can\u2019t dress herself, wash herself or walk more than 100m as her muscles are just not strong enough.\n\nDespite this, in a recent review of her benefits she was told that her motability car and high rate disability allowance were being taken away.\n\nPartner Michael said: \u201cShe can\u2019t leave the house, she needs help to get dressed, have a wash and get around.\n\n\u201cShe would have carers coming in to help but I can\u2019t work more than 16 hours a week now as those have been taken away and I have to care for her where I can.\n\n\"She can\u2019t go anywhere unless I\u2019m with her despite her condition being worse than it was last time it was reviewed.\n\n\u201cIn 2012 we had to go to court as she had her benefits taken away, but they awarded them all back to her.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we are back to square one and it\u2019s really not fair.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMichael added: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand. She needs a car as her appointments are all in Sheffield as the only doctor who knows anything about her condition is based there.\n\n\u201cIf we have to give the car back, she will be stuck in the house, how is she going to get to hospital?\n\n\u201cHer condition affects her muscles so she can\u2019t even put her arms above her head but now all her support has been taken away.\n\n\u201cIt takes 10 weeks for them to review her case and we don\u2019t want to wait that long again, it\u2019s time that affects Chelsea\u2019s life and it\u2019s just not fair.\u201d\n\nNow Chelsea has appealed the DWP's decision to see if she can get her benefit back again.\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u201cMs Tyler has asked us to look at her claim again, which we are doing.\n\n\u201cWe want anyone with a health condition or disability to get the support they are entitled to, and when decisions are overturned it\u2019s often because people have submitted more oral or written evidence.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea Tyler, from Lincoln, was not expected to live past the age of one and defied doctors - but is now locked in a row with the Department for Work and Pensions", "authors": ["Danielle Hoe", "Image", "Lincolnshirelive.Co.Uk", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530672.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP__4465JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
