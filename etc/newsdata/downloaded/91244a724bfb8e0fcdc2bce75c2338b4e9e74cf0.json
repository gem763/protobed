Lianhe Zaobao\n\nSweet-toothed bubble tea lovers, look away now: the sugary drink has gotten so popular here that a local hospital is calling for consumers to modify their orders to make them healthier.\n\nMount Alvernia Hospital \u2013 a private, not-for-profit tertiary care medical institution \u2013 published an article on its website on Friday (July 5) comparing the sugar and calorie levels of various types of bubble teas and their toppings.\n\nIt later posted an infographic of the article to Facebook due to \u201coverwhelming requests\u201d from visitors.\n\nIn the article, the hospital warned Singaporeans against the sugar content of bubble tea, since the drink had become \u201cubiquitous\u201d and \u201cwildly popular\u201d here in recent years.\n\nIt acknowledged that green and black tea were indeed helpful in reducing the risk of diseases like diabetes, arthritis and cancer, but warned that bubble tea (which contains sugar, milk and non-dairy creamer) could actually increase the risk of chronic diseases.\n\nNon-dairy creamer is a milk substitute that contains trans fat in the form of hydrogenated palm oil. This oil has been strongly correlated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, the hospital said.\n\nIt added that the number of calories in a medium cup of bubble tea were equivalent to a slice of cheesecake, and advised consumers to limit their intake to two cups a week.\n\nThe worst choice? Brown sugar milk tea with pearls\n\nThe hospital compared the sugar level in seven types of bubble tea orders, and found that the unhealthiest option by far was brown sugar milk tea with pearls.\n\nThis drink contained 18.5 teaspoons of sugar.\n\nThe second most unhealthy option was winter melon tea, at 16 teaspoons of sugar.\n\nA adult\u2019s daily recommended sugar intake is 8 to 11 teaspoons, while for children and teenagers, it is 5 teaspoons.\n\nAnd while fruit-based drinks might seem healthy, they were in fact worse choices: passion fruit green tea (8.5 teaspoons) and jasmine green tea with fruit toppings (8.5 teaspoons) outranked milk tea with pearls (8 teaspoons) in sugar content.\n\nTo counter any cravings for sugary drinks, the hospital advised consumers to pick bubble tea shops that allowed them to change the sweetness level of the drinks, and slowly reduce the sugar level to \u201ctrain\u201d their taste buds.\n\nFoam toppings have even more calories than pearls\n\nApart from the drinks themselves, the hospital also compared the calorie content of various toppings.\n\nThe toppings with the highest calories were milk foam (203 calories) and cheese foam (180 calories), beating out the classic option of black tapioca pearls (156 calories).\n\nThe lowest-calorie topping in the list was aloe vera, at 31 calories.\n\nThe hospital warned that toppings like jellies and pearls were kept in a sweet syrup to keep them moist, adding to the drink\u2019s sugar and calorie count.\n\nIt added that new trends like honey pearls or brown sugar syrup increased the drink\u2019s sugar content even further.\n\n5 tips to ordering healthier bubble tea, according to Mount Alvernia:\n\n#1: Choose a smaller cup size\n\n#2: Pick \u201cplain\u201d green tea, oolong tea or black tea\n\n#3: Ask for 30 per cent sugar levels or lower\n\n#4: Ask for fresh, low-fat or skimmed milk instead of non-dairy creamer\n\n#5: No toppings (or pick lower-calorie options like aloe vera and white pearls)\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Here's how to make your bubble tea healthier, according to Mount Alvernia Hospital..
