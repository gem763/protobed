But I have to let you in on an industry secret: They never did.\n\nIn 1972, after news of the Watergate break\u2011in made headlines, then-President Richard Nixon still won reelection by a landslide because the facts at the time were open to interpretation. Just three years later, researchers at Stanford did the first study proving that people cling to their irratio\u00adnal opinions, even in the face of irrefutable evidence that they are wrong.* The hundreds of studies that followed prove that people actu\u00adally dig their heels in when presented with facts that contradict their beliefs. If you want to change minds, facts alone have never been enough.\n\nThe reasons are rooted in behavioral science. At a biological level, our brains aren\u2019t hardwired to look for facts. Instead, we rapidly and automatically process opinions we agree with as if they are facts. In the study \u201cThat\u2019s My Truth: Evidence for Involuntary Opinion Confirma\u00adtion,\u201d** researchers Michael Gilead, Moran Sela and Anat Maril showed not only that our opinions are change-resistant, but that we actually involuntarily reject facts that contradict our existing opinions.\n\nTo compound this, all humans suffer from confirmation bias. We search for information that confirms our opinions. And we cherry-pick the facts that support our point of view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur desire to confirm our existing beliefs also leads us to mini\u00admize or ignore data that doesn\u2019t fit our preferred view of the world. We can quickly dismiss factual information that does not agree with our worldview by labeling the new facts as somehow erroneous or limited. Said another way (shamelessly stealing from a former col\u00adleague): When confronted with facts that don\u2019t fit inside our frame, we throw away the facts and keep the frame (which is easier and less ego- threatening than getting a new frame).\n\nBut people don\u2019t just reject evidence that challenges their beliefs, they go even further. Studies of the often-quoted backfire effect demonstrate that when people reject evidence they don\u2019t like, their support for their original position gets stronger. In \u201cWhy Facts Don\u2019t Change Our Minds,\u201d* Elizabeth Kolbert writes that scientists have deduced that the vaunted human capacity for reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with thinking straight: \u201cProvid\u00ading people with accurate information doesn\u2019t seem to help; they sim\u00adply discount it.\u201d\n\nReading all this might make you feel hopeless. Don\u2019t be. All this tells us is that facts alone won\u2019t set us free. They won\u2019t tell our story. And they won\u2019t change hearts and minds. Decision- making is rarely a rational process. If you want to truly connect with others and shift their thinking, their behavior, their buying habits, or their voting practices, you must engage in a process that goes far beyond hitting them with statistics or study results.\n\nThis book is about persuading people to change their minds. It\u2019s not about appealing to your base or preaching to your choir. It\u2019s about engaging with someone who doesn\u2019t yet know you, agree with you, or sometimes even like you. It\u2019s about the very difficult challenge of overcoming your audience\u2019s human instinct to stick to their exist\u00ading position. It is about giving people a reason to listen and then providing them with the right information in the right way so they can alter their existing point of view.\n\nAll success, in life and in business, is based on the skill of persua\u00adsion. Put simply, you can have the best product, the best plan, the best policy, but if you\u2019re not telling your story in a way that connects and resonates with your audience, none of that matters. You will not persuade people to choose your company or follow your lead.\n\nMy question to you \u2014 and often to my clients \u2014 is which is more important: having a good story to tell, or telling your story well? Most people will immediately say that having a good story to tell is much more important. They will say that what matters is being a good company, having a good product, doing a good job. I agree that those things are important. But are they enough? Does the best prod\u00aduct always win in the marketplace? Does the best strategy always work in practice? How you tell your story is just as important as having that good story to tell. My job and the job of my firm is to ensure that companies, issues, and people who have an important point to get across are able to tell their story in the best way possible. That is what persuasion is all about.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n. * Lee Ross, Mark R.
