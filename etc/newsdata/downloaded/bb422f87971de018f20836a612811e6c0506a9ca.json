(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nDave Martinez was standing on the top steps of the Washington Nationals\u2019 dugout, as he always does, carefully watching pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez\u2019s mechanics during the fifth inning Sept. 15. Everything was normal. Then his chest began to tighten.\n\nIt was a sharp pain \u2014 \u201cHeartburn but way worse\u201d is how Martinez described it \u2014 and the 55-year-old manager was confused. He immediately ran calculations in his head: I\u2019m healthy. I work out every day. I try to eat well, though I do like steak. This can\u2019t be a heart attack.\n\nHe figured it was just a chest cramp. He tried to stretch it out, moving his right elbow like a windmill, but soon lost feeling in the arm. Then his left thigh felt numb and he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He called for Paul Lessard, the team\u2019s head athletic trainer, and it was decided that Martinez needed to go to the hospital. Immediately.\n\n\u201cI was so, so scared,\u201d Martinez said in an interview Saturday, offering his most detailed public account to date of the incident two weeks ago. Sitting cross-legged on a couch in his office, shaking a cold that felt trivial after what he had experienced, Martinez revealed the episode was far more alarming than previously known. There were tears in his eyes. \u201cI started thinking about my kids, my family, my players, this team,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Man, I am going to let so many people down.\u2019 If I can\u2019t do this, then what happens?\u201d\n\nIt happened on a Sunday. On Monday, when the team traveled to St. Louis, Martinez stayed in Washington and underwent a cardiac catheterization. The results were clean, and it was determined that the scare was exactly that. General Manager Mike Rizzo told reporters that Martinez was resting, had arrived home and could rejoin the team when cleared to fly. The tests were publicly painted as a precaution. The whole episode was barely discussed once Martinez returned in Miami after three days away.\n\nBut Martinez was shaken, and he often thinks about Sept. 15 as Washington prepares to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League wild-card game Tuesday night. He declined to provide further details in his first meeting with reporters at Marlins Park. He didn\u2019t mention then that he flew to Miami before doctors had cleared him to do so, because he couldn\u2019t stand watching games on TV and he felt up to being on a plane for a couple of hours.\n\nAnd he quietly told a few players, \u201cI really dodged a bullet.\u201d He told Max Scherzer, his ace and one of the club\u2019s leaders, \u201cIt was a lot more than just a little scare.\u201d He found an even bigger appreciation for showing up to the ballpark every day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around baseball for a really long time,\u201d said Martinez, who began his playing career with the Chicago Cubs in 1986. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could want to be here any more than I do, have any more love or passion for this. But being away, even for just a week, that was the worst. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. I never want to do that again.\u201d\n\nMartinez\u2019s mind began to wander when he was in the back of an ambulance that afternoon, strapped to a gurney, tubes attached to his body to provide fluids. The chest pains were subsiding, and he regained feeling in his arm and leg. He is a father of four, three sons and a daughter, and a grandparent. And he is a manager to dozens of players, even more than 25 in September, and didn\u2019t want them to lose him at such a critical point of the pennant race.\n\nThat\u2019s what he considered on the way to the hospital. He also kept wondering what caused the chest pains in the first place. It had been a stressful weekend at Nationals Park, particularly the night before he had to leave in the sixth inning. Fernando Rodney hit Charlie Culberson in the face with a fastball. While Culberson was on the ground bleeding and in considerable pain, the umpires checked if he had swung on the pitch. Martinez got ripped in articles and on social media for being insensitive. He emotionally defended himself, that night and the next morning, before later realizing that it could have contributed to what happened in the dugout.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this game really stressing me out that much?\u2019 \u201d Martinez recalled. \u201cWe had been in really tight games and the race, what happened with Culberson was unfortunate, and I just worried that it had maybe become too much. I requested that they do a stress test just to see. It seemed to make the most sense.\u201d\n\nThe stress test didn\u2019t reveal any issues. He remembered the doctors telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re about as calm and normal as anybody we\u2019ve seen.\u201d They instead changed Martinez\u2019s diet, told him to stop consuming caffeine \u2014 he was up to five or six cups of coffee a day \u2014 and quit drinking alcohol for the time being. He\u2019s been instructed to stand less during games and has mostly listened. Lessard is keeping a close eye on him. Everyone is, so much so that Martinez joked in Miami that he\u2019d have to save a new bottle of wine until the winter holidays.\n\nOnce the team returned from that Miami trip Sept. 23, at the start of its final homestand, Martinez went back to the hospital for a scheduled round of follow-up tests. The results were good. He will have routine check-ins with a cardiologist in the coming months. After this one, in the afternoon before a night game against the Philadelphia Phillies, the doctor suggested he go home and rest. Martinez smiled.\n\nThen he went straight to the ballpark.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him\n\nBoswell: Sharks are chomping at Nats Park, and I think we\u2019re going to need a bigger bandwagon\n\nThe 12 best moments from the Nationals\u2019 wild 2019 season\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history", "description": "Washington's 55-year-old manager, who missed three games earlier this month after feeling chest pains in the dugout, offered his most detailed public account to date of the incident.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/R--SSh4lSlddYO9WezJQEBmcgCM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRWWIBWBIYI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
