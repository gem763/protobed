Video picture taken October 26, 2019. U.S. Department of Defense/Handout via REUTERS.\n\nThe declassified, grainy, black-and-white aerial videos from Saturday\u2019s raid showed U.S. special operations forces closing in on the compound and U.S. aircraft firing on militants nearby.\n\nThe most dramatic video showed a massive, black plume of smoke rising from the ground after U.S. military bombs leveled Baghdadi\u2019s compound.\n\n\u201cIt looks pretty much like a parking lot, with large potholes,\u201d said Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East.\n\nMcKenzie, briefing Pentagon reporters, said the idea of destroying the compound was at least in part \u201cto ensure that it would not be a shrine or otherwise memorable in any way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another piece of ground,\u201d he said.\n\nBaghdadi here an Iraqi jihadist who rose from obscurity to declare himself \"caliph\" of all Muslims as the leader of Islamic State, died by detonating a suicide vest as he fled into a dead-end tunnel as elite U.S. special forces closed in.\n\nMcKenzie said he brought two young children into the tunnel with him - not three, as had been the U.S. government estimate. Both children were believed to be under the age of 12 and both were killed, he said.\n\nHe portrayed Baghdadi as isolated at his Syrian compound, just four miles from the Turkish border, saying fighters from other militant groups nearby probably did not even know he was there. McKenzie suggested it was unlikely that Baghdadi used the Internet or had digital connections to the outside world.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d find (he was using) probably a messenger system that allows you to put something on a floppy or on a bit of electronics and have someone physically move it somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nMcKenzie said Islamic State would likely try to stage some kind of retaliatory attack.\n\n\u201cWe suspect they will try some form of retribution attack. And we are postured and prepared for that,\u201d he said.\n\nWHIMPERING AND CRYING?\n\nMcKenzie did not back up or knock down Trump's dramatic account of Baghdadi's final moments, which the president delivered during a televised address to the nation on Sunday. Trump said Baghdadi \"died a coward \u2014 crying, whimpering, screaming.\" here\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s account, McKenzie said: \u201cAbout Baghdadi\u2019s last moments, I can tell you this: He crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up as his people stayed on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you can deduce what kind of person he is based on that activity... I\u2019m not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can\u2019t confirm that one way or another.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also declined to confirm Trump\u2019s account, saying he presumed Trump got that information from his direct conversations with members of the elite unit that conducted the operation. Milley had not yet spoken with them, he said.\n\nMcKenzie suggested the U.S. military had secured a large amount of intelligence about Islamic State\u2019s activities during the raid.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cWhile the assault force was securing the remains, they also secured whatever documentation and electronics we could find, which was substantial,\u201d McKenzie said, declining to provide further details.\n\nMcKenzie said Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria this month, and the U.S. pullback from the border, was not a factor in deciding the timing of the raid. Instead, McKenzie pointed to a host of other factors, including the amount of moonlight.\n\n\u201cWe struck because the time is about right to do it then, given the totality of the intelligence and the other factors that would affect the raid force going into and coming out,\u201d McKenzie said.", "description": "The Pentagon on Wednesday released its first images from last weekend's commando raid in Syria that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and warned the militant group may attempt to stage a \"retribution attack.\"", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191031&t=2&i=1446725758&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9U001", "published_at": "2019-10-31"}
