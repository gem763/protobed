Police allege that the two switched to saying \u201cn*****\u201d when they reached the parking lot, which was loud enough for two people inside to hear.\n\nThe two were charged under a Connecticut State law that criminalizes ridiculing \u201cany person or class of people on account of creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality, or race.\u201d The misdemeanor is punishable by up to 30 days in jail, a fine of $50, or both. The third individual was not charged for saying the slur.\n\nIt is unclear whether the statute violates First Amendment grounds.\n\n\u201cIt is supportive of our core values to pursue accountability, through due process, for an egregious assault on our community that has caused considerable harm,\u201d UConn President Thomas C. Katsouleas said in a statement late Monday.\n\nKaral and Mucaj were released after promising to return for a scheduled court date on October 30.\n\nAfter the video went viral online, Campus blowback was swift. The administration, which learned of the incident October 11, faced severe criticism from students and activists. On Monday, the university\u2019s NAACP chapter published a letter to the editor in the campus newspaper lambasting the university\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cIf the university does not adequately address and handle these occurrences of racism appropriately, it will create a culture in which racism is tolerated and normalized,\u201d the NAACP letter reads. \u201cWe demand for your full assurance that you will take appropriate measures to hold the students involved in these heinous acts of racism accountable.\u201d\n\nOn Monday afternoon, hundreds of students chanted \u201cit\u2019s more than just a word\u201d during an on-campus march and rally. During the march, Katsouleas voiced support for the students and extended an invitation to discuss the incident during his open office hours scheduled for Friday morning.\n\nUConn\u2019s president also announced a nationwide search for a chief diversity officer in a letter to students on Friday. But students and professors criticized the president for his slow and inadequate response.\n\n\u201cNo stance is a stance,\u201d Conn senior Areon Mangan told the Chronicle. \u201cNot saying anything says a lot.\u201d\n\nIn its letter to the campus newspaper, the NAACP released a list of eight demands, including new student guidelines and punishments for instances of racism, a new first-year course on diversity training, and increased hiring of black administration, faculty, staff, and police officers.\n\nDemocratic State Senators Mae Flexer and Gregory Haddad, both UConn alums, voiced their support for students during the Monday rally.\n\n\u201cWhite people can\u2019t just say they care about this with words,\u201dFlexer said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say you\u2019re an ally. You need to be a co-conspirator.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I want to lift your voices up,\u201d Haddad added.", "description": "Students Jarred Karal and Ryan Mucaj were arrested by campus police Monday night after using a racial slur in an incident captured on video.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
