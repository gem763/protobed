The other only place I don\u2019t hear them is in my bedroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So I\u2019ve been a prisoner in my bedroom except when I\u2019ve had to go out and get shopping.\u2019\n\nMs Bradby, who is unemployed and on disability benefit, says she has never been able to tolerate high pitched noises, with certain sounds leaving her in a \u2018state of complete exhaustion\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019ve ended up screaming with pain. It\u2019s been a gradual deterioration in my health.\n\n\u2018I have a very rare neuromuscular disease called dystonia and I\u2019ve had brain surgery to halt it. That\u2019s left some small brain damage. Not intellectually or anything like that, it\u2019s physical.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018These wind chimes have been up since March. It started with headaches and nerve pain on my left side.\n\n\u2018And now I\u2019m getting very strong muscle spasms and I\u2019m getting auras as if I\u2019m going to have an epileptic fit.\n\nChrissie says she is forced to hide upstairs in her bedroom (Picture: BNPS)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had to triple the medication I take and I also have to use alcohol to help me relax.\n\n\u2018Otherwise I\u2019m just a ball of tension and pain. My doctor has given me a letter to show to the police.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a legal matter because there is no law that prevents them from hanging these wind chimes right next to my boundary.\u2019\n\nMs Bradby claims Quay Living, which rents out the property in Poole, Dorset, have accused her of being anti-social and will not move the wind chimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelen Challis, a partner at Quay Living, said they had reported Ms Bradby to the police for harassing their tenants and warned her not to contact them.\n\nChrissie alleges she\u2019s had to triple her medication to cope with the wind chimes (Picture: BNPS)\n\nMs Challis refused to add any further comment.\n\nAn officer from the council\u2019s environmental health department did investigate the dispute and found that even in \u2018high winds\u2019, there was no was \u2018no significant noise\u2019 from the wind chimes.\n\nKelly Ansell, director of communities at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, said: \u2018BCP Council has investigated, attended both properties and worked with colleagues from Environmental Health to access any noise from the wind chimes.\n\n\u2018Even during high winds, the noise has not been deemed to be significant.
