The twitching nights on the eve of each match, the punch he\u2019d feel rip through his gut as he sat in the dressing room and the walk over a sea of needles in the tunnel as air sputtered from his lungs\u2026 and then he laughs. A deep, throaty machine gun treble that echoes through the North London townhouse. It\u2019s only when the recently retired centre-back chuckles that his schoolmasterish aura disintegrates and a thicker German accent returns to his voice. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t miss [playing],\u201d he says, relaxing into his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve played for 15 years and played in five major tournaments. I know what it gives me in terms of the joy, in terms of the love for the game. But I\u2019m done with it.\u201d\n\nMertesacker\u2019s metamorphosis from player to coach was unnaturally smooth. Still only 34, he might have attempted to extend his illustrious playing career well beyond his time at Arsenal. But, after the doctor informed him that the cartilage in his knee was worn to a cinder, he was consumed by a sense of relief. For years, he\u2019d hidden his anxiety from his teammates, even his own family, and his body ached with exhaustion. During his final season at Arsenal, he even found himself praying to be left on the bench, fearing he'd meet a bitter end like an aged boxer before finally making his escape. \u201cOnce I had made the decision to stop, it relaxed me,\u201d he says. \u201cI was making sure that I was well prepared for something that is totally unknown to me.\u201d\n\nThe thought of moving into the small office that overlooks the training pitches at London Colney had never appealed to Mertesacker. In the year after winning the World Cup, he revealed he was desperate \u201cto get respected in a different way, not in football\u201d. Yet, when Arsenal offered him the position of Academy Manager, he was captivated by the prospect of returning to a time when his love of football was still raw \u2013 a second life in the sport he instead refers to in his new autobiography as \u201cthe beginning\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cFor almost 15 years, professional football is about yourself: How can I improve? How can I make myself better?\u201d He says. \u201cBefore winning a game was the short-term reward that meant everything. Now, I can look at the bigger picture. I want to make an impact on young players\u2019 lives. I want be part of their future.\u201d\n\nIt is the way past professionals live vicariously through their proteges. Mertesacker may have gracefully walked out on a 15-year career, but he still carries the addiction. He treats his role at Arsenal with the same leadership and diligence he did as a player, combatting the interfering bubbles of social media and premature wealth just as he approached uniting a national team fractured between Bayern and Borussia or barking at Mesut Ozil. He is unashamedly old fashioned, a tailored suit in an era of tracksuits but, most importantly, Mertesacker can still relate to the younger generation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You won\u2019t make it. Let\u2019s just forget about the whole thing.\u201d It\u2019s the oldest scar Mertesacker carries, the smoking gun that kickstarted his career, and the rock he leans on when he has to issue that same verdict to idling prospects.\n\n\u201cYou need to deliver those messages when kids are 15,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you get a scholarship, yes or no. Do you get a pro deal when you are 17/18, yes or no. I\u2019ll be up front, try and paint the picture of my experiences.\n\n\u201cYou cannot turn the clock back 20 years. I had a totally different upbringing, totally different background, raised in Germany, small town, now I am in London taking care of 180 kids who think they are the one percent who can make it in professional football. So that\u2019s what I deal with on a daily basis. How do I manage that? By being myself, being authentic, and not lying.\n\n\u201cIf someone had judged me as a 16-year-old then I would have been out of academy football. How do you recover from that? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to bring in now, so you can say: \u2018if we don\u2019t take you now, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s another pathway for you\u2019\u2026 A similar reward would be, just for the sake of argument, a doctor in America.\u201d\n\nMertesacker handles his role combatively. After accepting the job, he declared that he wanted to \u201cattack the system\u201d and describes his first year in the position as tackling \u201ca monster\u201d. To him, football has always been black and white, a case of hard work trumps talent. It\u2019s why the biggest changes he\u2019s sought to make thus far have been cultural. \u201cI would say these three words: respect, discipline and humility play a big part in what we are trying to achieve and are the foundation for me to have an impact,\u201d he says, beating his hand against an invisible drum. \u201cIf there is a really good player at U16 level who disrespects the coach, if you then say: \u2018You can go somewhere else then. That is not how we do things here.\u2019 That would be powerful.\u201d\n\nThey are, after all, the core values that moulded Mertesacker from a self-described \u201cblond beanpole who should have stuck to swimming\u201d into a 104-cap international. The same man who spent 18 months as a teenager working in a psychiatric hospital and insisted \u20ac50,000 of his transfer fee from Hannover to Werder Bremen be spent on an artificial pitch for the former\u2019s academy.\n\nBut Mertesacker isn\u2019t blind to the business-centric and often cynical nature of his position either. He hails the rejuvenating success of Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson, but goes on to list the sales and percentages recouped from Alex Iwobi, Xavier Amaechi and Krystian Bielik\u2019s departures \u2013 \u201cgetting value back to invest again\u201d \u2013 as key motivators of a \u201creally positive summer\u201d.\n\nIn the long term, he hopes to transform that air of optimism into a renewed connection with the fans and build an A-list academy capable of pushing the club towards Premier League titles. \u201cI think you really want to build the best connection between players and fans so that everyone feels that this is actually the best club,\u201d he says. \u201dA real culture [where] everyone trusts each other that we can be world class again.\u201d\n\nThat desire is in part debted to Mertesacker\u2019s lasting allegiance to Arsene Wenger, as well as the grief he still feels over the manager\u2019s sacking. \u201cYou feel almost responsible for the lack of success,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to build on that legacy and thank him [Wenger] for what he did for myself, for the club and give it a real go towards the titles we expect.\n\n\u201cTo be world class again, that is what I am looking at. He built the expectations of the club, he built the profile of this club.\u201d\n\nAs Mertesacker continues to reiterate his desire to return Arsenal to those heights, it\u2019s hard to envisage the dog-tired figure who\u2019s choking anxiety had left him unable to eat properly in the hours before each match. After months spent craving the end to his playing career, he finds himself reliving its beginning with a freedom that's allowed him to fall in love with football all over again.\n\nPer Mertesacker\u2019s autobiography, Big Friendly German, is available in all good bookshops and signed copies available at www.decoubertin.co.uk/BFG.
