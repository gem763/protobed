REUTERS/Stephen Kalin\n\nThe Pentagon said the deployment would involve a moderate number of troops - not numbering thousands - and would be primarily defensive in nature. It also detailed plans to expedite delivery of military equipment to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nReuters has previously reported that the Pentagon was considering sending anti-missile batteries, drones and more fighter jets. The United States is also considering keeping an aircraft carrier in the region indefinitely.\n\n\u201cIn response to the kingdom\u2019s request, the president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at a news briefing.\n\n\u201cWe will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s late Friday announcement appeared to close the door to any imminent decision to wage retaliatory strikes against Iran following the attack, which rattled global markets and exposed major gaps in Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defenses.\n\nTrump said earlier on Friday that he believed his military restraint so far showed \u201cstrength,\u201d as he instead imposed another round of economic sanctions on Tehran.\n\n\u201cBecause the easiest thing I could do, \u2018Okay, go ahead. Knock out 15 different major things in Iran.\u2019 ... But I\u2019m not looking to do that if I can,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nBut the deployment could further aggravate Iran, which has responded to previous U.S. troop deployments this year with apprehension. It denies responsibility for the attack on Saudi Arabia.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition that includes the UAE, has claimed responsibility for the strikes.\n\nATTACK LAUNCHED FROM IRAN?\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated sharply since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nFor months, Iranian officials issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran were blocked from exporting oil, other countries would not be able to do so either.\n\nHowever, Iran has denied any role in a series of attacks in recent months, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and strikes claimed by the Houthis.\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have fingered southwest Iran as the staging ground for the attack, an assessment based at least in part on still-classified imagery showing Iran appearing to prepare an aerial strike.\n\nThey have dismissed Houthi claims that the attacks originated in Yemen.\n\nOne of the officials told Reuters the strike may have been authorized by Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe United States is wary of getting dragged into another conflict in the Middle East. It has troops positioned in Syria and Iraq, two countries where Iranian influence is strong and Iran-backed forces operate openly.\n\nU.S. officials fear Iran\u2019s proxies might attempt to strike American troops there, something that could easily trigger a broader regional conflict.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2019.
