For example, the region's overall dependence on oil imports is forecast to exceed 80% in 2040, up from 65% today.\n\nWith no change in policy, Southeast Asia's energy demand is expected to grow by 60% by 2040, accounting for 12% of the rise in global energy use as its economy more than doubles, the IEA said. This was slower than the region's 80% growth since 2000.\n\nSoutheast Asia's growth in electricity demand, at an average of 6% per year, has been among the fastest in the world, the IEA said. Still, some 45 million people there still lack access to electricity. The region is well on the way to achieving universal access to electricity by 2030, it added.\n\nOil demand in Southeast Asia, home to nearly 10% of the world's population, would surpass 9 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, up from just above 6.5 million bpd now, the IEA said.\n\n\"Oil continues to dominate road transport demand, despite an increase in consumption of biofuels,\" the IEA said.\n\n\"Electrification of mobility, with the partial exception of two and three wheelers, makes only limited inroads. This pathway suggests little change in Southeast Asia from today's congested roads and poor urban air quality.\"\n\nDemand for coal is also projected to rise steadily over the coming decades, largely fuelled by new coal-fired power plants, despite headwinds facing such projects that include increasing difficulty to secure competitive financing for new facilities.\n\nThe IEA said the region's increasing reliance on imports of natural gas made the fuel less price-competitive though it appeared to be a good fit for the fast-growing cities and lighter industries in the region.\n\n\"In our projections, it is industrial consumers rather than power plants that are the largest source of growth in gas demand,\" the IEA added.\n\nRenewable energy is set to play a larger role, but without stronger policy frameworks the share of renewables in power generation would rise only to 30% by 2040, from the current 24%, the IEA said.\n\nWind and solar energy are expected to grow rapidly, while hydropower and modern bioenergy \u2013 including biofuels, biomass, biogas and bioenergy derived from other waste products \u2013 would remain the mainstays of Southeast Asia's renewables portfolio.\n\n(Reporting by Koustav Samanta and Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "description": "Southeast Asia could become a net importer of fossil fuels in the next few years, raising the financial burden on governments and increasing carbon emissions in the region, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in a report.
