Trump\u2019s surprise decision to abandon the Kurds and sign off on Turkey\u2019s operation in Syria drew condemnation in the West, but was cheerfully welcomed in Russia, and, for those who follow Russia closely, the contrast revived the ghosts of Helsinki, where Trump\u2019s surrender of American values was on full display.\n\nThere in Finland last year, the leader of the most powerful country in the world demonstrated cringeworthy servility toward Vladimir Putin\u2014president of a rogue government sanctioned by the West for a great number of malign activities, including Russia\u2019s brazen interference in the U.S. elections.\n\nThe world\u2019s pariah looked triumphant next to the deflated American president. As Trump stood hunched over, with a blank expression, Putin was practically glowing\u2014and he wanted the world to know just how great the meeting went for Russia. Putin held up a thick stack of his notes with both hands, showing them off for the world to see, in effect giving himself the thumbs-up.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Invasion of Kurdish-Controlled Syrian Territory Stalls as Soon as it Starts, But For How Long?\n\nDiscernible portions of the first page, purposely written in abnormally large script, included references to the election interference, Putin\u2019s request that Russia be allowed to interrogate the former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, and also the British businessman Bill Browder, pursuant to the 1999 Treaty with Russia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. There was a reference to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. And at the bottom of the first page, Putin\u2019s notes also mentioned Syria, where Russia has been wreaking havoc and committing mass atrocities in concert with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and Iran.\n\nFor public consumption, the Russian president\u2019s handwriting mentioned \u201cjoint humanitarian operations with the goal of creating conditions for the return of refugees.\u201d The reality on the ground tends to create\u2014not dissipate\u2014the flood of refugees, essentially weaponized by Russia and Syria to destabilize Europe.\n\nOn Wednesday this week, President Trump nonchalantly commented that if the thousands of ISIS prisoners that are currently being held by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces escape, \"they will be escaping to Europe.\" Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also threatening Europe with a flood of refugees, publicly proclaiming, \u201cWe will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way.\u201d\n\nMystery surrounds the rest of the topics discussed by the President of the United States with the Russian leader in Helsinki, since President Trump confiscated the American interpreter\u2019s notes and remains tight-lipped about his exchanges with Vladimir Putin. But one thing is clear: Trump is moving down Putin\u2019s wish list, fulfilling the Kremlin\u2019s aims at a rapid pace. He is chipping away at U.S. sanctions against Russia, deepening America\u2019s internal divisions on the basis of race, faith, sexual orientation and political affiliation, vocally undermining confidence in our elections, intelligence agencies and institutions, all the while empowering our foreign adversaries and undermining NATO alliances.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims that Ukraine\u2014not Russia\u2014 is somehow responsible for the 2016 election interference fall right in line with conspiracy theories the Kremlin has been propagating for years. The Russians have long been promoting the notions that prompted President Trump\u2019s outrageous demands from the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, ultimately leading to the commencement of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe ousting of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, was also in line with the Kremlin\u2019s wishes. She stood up for Ukraine\u2019s interests, opposing Russia\u2019s aggressive posture with respect to Donbas. Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin\u2014who is the godfather of Medvedchuk\u2019s daughter\u2014has a longstanding grudge against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Medvedchuk cheered for the U.S. Ambassador to be recalled and the Russian state media predicted that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be Trump\u2019s \u201cfirst victim in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s fingerprints seem to appear on every controversial foreign policy decision undertaken by President Trump. Prior to Turkey\u2019s ongoing offensive against the Kurds, Turkish President Erdogan met with his Russian and Iranian counterparts, reaching \"important decisions.\"", "description": "Mikhail Klimenyev/GettyPresident Donald J.
