But how those funds are distributed to good causes is no lottery. It\u2019s a stitch-up.\n\nThe bulk of the proceeds go to prosperous towns and cities.\n\nA breakdown of funding by Parliamentary constituency showed Manchester Central got \u00a331.6million in 2015, Barnsley East less than \u00a390,000. Nottingham South got \u00a364.8million but Ashfield, a few miles away, just \u00a3930,000.\n\nIt has long been suspected that areas which spend most on tickets get the least in grants.\n\nWe cannot know for sure because Camelot refuses to say how many lottery tickets are bought in any particular place.\n\nWhy would they if it were found that the poorest are paying for arts and sports schemes in already wealthy areas?\n\nLabour\u2019s Tom Watson is right to demand the operator not only reveals where tickets are bought but gives local people a greater say on how the proceeds are spent.\n\nThe National Lottery should serve the whole country.
