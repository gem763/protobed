It\u2019s used in a similar manner to physical scarring.\n\nThere\u2019s even a fan wiki devoted to baddies with \u201cmental illness\u201d.\n\n\u201cA villain who is perfectly coherent and stable can still be qualified as mentally ill if the evil deeds they perform are extremely fiendish,\u201d it declares. Arrrrghhh. Where do you start?\n\nJoker\u2019s director, Todd Philips, also made the The Hangover and Borat. He says that he\u2019s lately struggled to direct comedies \u201cwith this woke culture\u201d that apparently makes it too easy to offend people.\n\nRead more\n\nA masterpiece or a danger? Joker isn\u2019t smart enough to be either\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to read that as anything but a heap of crap. You can make people laugh without being a dick if you just use your head. That includes being edgy, even offensive. What makes people cross is when filmmakers resort to bullying, persecuting people who get enough of it in their every day lives.\n\nJoker, nominally a comic book movie, is, however, trying to be a \u201cserious\u201d character study.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t things to like about the film for geeks like me or for other cinephiles.\n\nThe retro look of Joker is superb. It throws you into a Gotham City of maybe 30 years ago (no specific date is given) that\u2019s in the midst of an economic crisis. It\u2019s run by a heartless political class with wealthy would-be mayor Thomas Wayne, an obvious analogue for Donald Trump or Boris Johnson, openly expressing his contempt for the poor. If you recognise that name but aren\u2019t a comic book fan, you\u2019ll realise that he\u2019s Batman\u2019s dad, who is usually presented as a rich guy with a conscience, although he\u2019s also been pitched as a brutal version in this version of the tale.\n\nThe film at one point does something interesting. Warning: spoilers coming.\n\nJoker, as Arthur Fleck, sits opposite his social worker/therapist expressing his frustrations. She doesn\u2019t listen to him, he complains. She interrupts his monologue to tell him that their conversations are going to have to come to an end as a result of city cutbacks. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a shit about people like us,\u201d she says.\n\nBut the idea isn\u2019t really followed through, and it isn\u2019t the cause of Joker\u2019s rampage. By then it has already started.\n\nIn the streets, members of an angry underclass are rioting in clown masks, V for Vendetta style, using Joker\u2019s murderous acts as inspiration. But Joker tells Robert De Niro\u2019s bullying TV host character that revolution was not his intent. He\u2019s not political, he isn\u2019t interested in politics.\n\nHe just kills, brutally, not just those who\u2019ve wronged him but anyone that he feels has crossed him, including the woman who won\u2019t be the girlfriend he has cast her in the role as.\n\nWarner Brothers has said Joker is not supposed to be seen as a hero. However, there are people who may see this version of him: a lonely embittered white guy, beaten up and abused by people around him, beaten down by society before violently striking back, as one. There have been concerns expressed about what this may lead to if people come away from the movie with the wrong impression.", "description": "At its core, when you set aside the A-grade acting, cinematography, and the look of the thing, Joker relies on a tired and destructive trope: child abuse leads to mental illness that is murderous in character.This has become a sort of short hand for villainy.
