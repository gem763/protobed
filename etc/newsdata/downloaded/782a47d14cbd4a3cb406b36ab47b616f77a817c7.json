underway at the Supreme Court in London to decide whether the decision by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to suspend Parliament is a matter for the courts \u2014 and, ultimately, whether it is lawful.\n\nBut with several such cases being brought to various courts around the UK recently, what is the significance of this particular hearing?\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court?\n\nThe Supreme Court in the UK is the country's highest court, and gives the final say on cases that affect the entire population and have been appealed by lower courts.\n\nEstablished in October 2009, the court became a means to create a clear separation between senior judges and the Upper House of Parliament, ie: The House of Lords.\n\nIt also serves in a role that sits above the UK's three separate judicial jurisdictions \u2014 England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland \u2014 as the highest power of appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court in session\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe building is situated in the heart of London and is close to many iconic structures of the UK's capital city.\n\nIn its own words, the court \"forms part of a pre-existing quadrangle made up of the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the Treasury\".\n\nWho are the main players?\n\nUnlike the lower courts, which are presided over by judges, the UK's Supreme Court has justices \u2014 12 in total.\n\nIn order to become a justice, a potential candidate must have held a high position in judicial office for at least two years, and must have been qualified in practicing law for 15.\n\nIt is led by the president of the court, who is currently Baroness Hale of Richmond.\n\nBrenda Marjorie Hale, the Lady Hale of Richmond, rose from her position as deputy to take the helm in 2017 from Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury.\n\nShe is a woman with a history of firsts, having become the first High Court judge in 1994 to be a career academic and public servant rather than a practicing barrister, and was the first female Law Lord.\n\nIn 2009, she became the first female justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nSo, what is the role of the Supreme Court in the prorogation of Parliament?\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently hearing the case over Johnson's decision to prorogue \u2014 or temporarily shut down \u2014 Parliament.\n\nHe has been accused by critics of using the suspension scheduled until mid-October as a means to give opposition MPs less time to stop him from pushing through Brexit on the 31st \u2014 deal or no deal.\n\nBut the prime minister insists he was just following procedure by shutting down parliament in the lead-up to the Queen's Speech, which opens a new parliamentary session by setting out the government's priorities.\n\nBusinesswoman Gina Miller initially brought the case to the High Court in England and Wales, claiming the prorogation was an \"unlawful abuse of power\".\n\nThis was eventually rejected by the High Court as a case that was purely \"political\" and \"not justiciable\", ultimately deciding it was \"not a matter for the courts\".\n\nIt specifically noted: \"The prime minister's decision that Parliament should be prorogued at the time and for the duration chosen and the advice given to Her Majesty to do so in the present case were political.\"\n\nGina Miller brought the case to the High Court in England and Wales\n\nMeanwhile, 75 MPs brought the case last week to the Inner House at the Court of Session in Scotland, which found the case was, in fact, a matter for courts, and later ruled the advice Johnson gave to the Queen on his reasons to suspend Parliament as \"unlawful\".\n\nAs a result, it also deemed the suspension \"null and of no effect\".\n\nFollowing this, the government requested to appeal the ruling with the Supreme Court, which would have a final say on the issue.\n\nIt is being heard by 11 of the 12 justices, and is focusing on three things:\n\nWhether the case is justiciable, ie: whether it is a matter for the courts\n\nWhether the appeal \"is academic\" \u2014 or practical \u2014 \"given Parliamentary sittings before the UK\u2019s exit from the EU\"\n\nAnd, if the case is found to be justiciable, whether Johnson's advice to the Queen was lawful\n\nIf the case is not found to be justiciable, or if it is found to be justiciable but not unlawful, then the suspension of Parliament can continue until its scheduled date of October 14.\n\nIt is as yet unclear what will happen if the Supreme Court finds the case both justiciable and the advice to the Queen unlawful.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said last week that the government would obey a ruling from the Supreme Court \u2014 but we will have to wait and see.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "As the three-day hearing
