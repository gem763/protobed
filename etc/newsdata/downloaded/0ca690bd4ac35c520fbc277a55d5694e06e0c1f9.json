He gave a broad smile and said: 'You were, really? Oh that's very sweet of you. I was a big fan of my mother too. She came here three times. I was very small.'\n\nThe visit by Prince William and Kate is designed to champion the importance of quality education, and highlight how girls benefit from pursuing higher education and professional careers.\n\nKate dazzled crowds as she stepped out in a traditional blue kurta and scarf by local designer Maheen Khan, while William opted for a casual shirt and trousers to stay cool in the Pakistan heat.\n\nThe Cambridges pulled up tiny chairs so they could sit and chat to pupils in their classroom at the school, which also teaches young boys.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge laughs while playing a game with pupils at the Islamabad Model College for Girls today\n\nThe couple are visiting the Islamabad Model College for Girls in the capital, touring classrooms and posing for a group picture with some of the young students, ranging from kindergarten age students to sixth formers\n\nKate looked relaxed as she stepped out of the royal car wearing a stunning blue traditional kurta and a pair of nude heels\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for a group photo as they visit a school today in Islamabad, Pakistan\n\nKate looked happy and relaxed as she chatted to children in the classroom.

The kurta is a long loose-fitting collarless shirt, with the style originating in India. The clothing has its roots in Central Asian nomadic tunics. Ms Khan opened her first shop in Lahore, 'The Seamstress', in 1972 and has since taken part in 20 international shows. She is the chief executive of Fashion Pakistan Week and has had her collections featured at Milan Fashion Week as well. Khan was recently dubbed the 'Coco Chanel of the East' and is renowned for her flattering cuts and mastery of the use of chiffon. She was commissioned by Harrods to make a replica of the Queen's coronation dress for the 60th anniversary celebrations, but ultimately it wasn't used so she presented it to the British High Commission in Karachi instead.\n\nUK aid has helped more than 5.5 million girls get a quality education since 2011, according to the British High Commission. The duke spoke of the UK's aim of teaching young people about mental health as he was leaving the school.\n\n'In the UK we're trying to make sure mental health is part of education as well,' the duke told a teacher.\n\nHe said students from disadvantaged backgrounds do not have a 'stable health platform to build on' and that education in this area is important.\n\nWilliam has frequently spoken out on mental health, including recently lending his voice to a promotional video for Every Mind Matters, an initiative by Public Health England and the NHS.\n\nHe and Kate heard how students are benefiting from the Teach For Pakistan programme, a fast-track teacher training scheme modelled on the UK's successful Teach First.\n\nMohammed Sohailkhan, area education officer, explained that the quality of education, particularly for girls, varied across the country.\n\n'In recent years there has been gradual progress in understanding how important education is for girls and young women. There is a realisation of what it can mean in terms of jobs and prospects,' he said.\n\n'I can't paint you an entirely rosy picture. It does still fluctuate wildly, particularly in rural regions, where there has traditionally been cultural barriers towards this, notably in terms of sending girls away to college. But these barriers are slowly being broken down. '\n\nThe couple's next engagement was at the Margalla Hills National Park, north of Islamabad, where security officials were seen tightening up operations this morning in preparation.\n\nContinuing the theme of education, the couple were meeting children from three local schools in the hills, which sit in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nThe Cambridges looked keen to begin chatting to pupils at the school in central Islamabad, which teaches boys and girls\n\nKate looked deeply engaged in a conversation with teachers and pupils at the Model College for Girls in Islamabad today\n\nKate may have left her children at home in London, but she looked thrilled to be chatting to youngsters at the school today\n\nA little boy from the school in Islamabad looks shy as Kate leans in to talk to him at his classroom table this morning\n\nKate showcased a dazzling pair of earrings that matched her royal blue kurta and scarf designed by Maheen Khan\n\nA group of girls and boys crowded around the Duchess as she sat at their classroom table for a chat this morning\n\nHello!

The duke and duchess' 9.35am departure on the British government's official Voyager plane from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire yesterday morning was timed so that they could see their children off to school first, sources have revealed. And the trip will conclude on Friday evening so that they can spend the weekend with their young brood. It is all part of a concerted attempt by the couple and their staff to finely balance their growing official duties on behalf of queen and country with family time, say aides. While they are away Kate's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, will be helping long-term nanny Maria Borrallo with childcare responsibilities. After their official welcome, William and Kate headed off in a heavily-guarded convoy to their base for the week, the High Commissioner's official residence in the capital, Islamabad. William was expected to spend the evening working on a major speech to be delivered today in which he is set to highlight the 'unique bonds' between the two countries, particularly the 1.5 million people of Pakistani origin living in the UK, saying:'Pakistan is the world's sixth largest country bye population. It has an unbelievably diverse geography that spans deserts to glaciers and everything in between. It is the birth place of the youngest ever Nobel Peace prize winner. 'We share unique bonds and so it will always be in our best interests for Pakistan to succeed. Not least because of the 1.5 million people living in the Uk with Pakistani origin and the fact that the Uk is one of the biggest investors in Pakistan's economy. 'You can always rely on the UK to keep playing an important role as a key partner and friend. ' The couple are also, for the first time, taking their own medic as part of their official entourage , a friend from William's days working as a pilot for East Anglian Air Ambulance.

Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said that while Kate Middleton, 37, hadn't had an easy time at the beginning of her time with the royal family, she has 'won people over' by working hard and making few mistakes. The royal commentator also suggested the royal tour of Pakistan, which starts today, was an indication of the respect the Queen had for Kate. She told Hello! magazine: 'The Pakistan Tour is very serious and politically sensitive and it's a great honour that she and William have been asked to do it. The Queen has obviously got a terrific faith in their ability to do it brilliantly.' And Ingrid suggested the royal trip was coming at a very happy time in the Duchesses' life, pointing to her 'family unit' and successful summer of projects as evidence.\n\nSkirmishes between the two sides at the de-facto border have increased this year, causing troop and civilian casualties.\n\nPakistan has seen a number of security incidents in recent months, including a bombing outside a shrine in central Lahore, as well as an attack by armed militants on the Pearl Continental Hotel in Gwadar, Balochistan.\n\nWith Brexit looming, the tour comes as London hopes to bolster its international relationships, while Islamabad is keen to promote itself as a tourist destination amid concerns over security and violence in the region.\n\nIt will span more than 620 miles of the country, including the capital Islamabad, the city of Lahore, the mountainous countryside in the north and border regions to the west.\n\nTheir itinerary includes a range of occasions and locations.\n\nWilliam and Kate are expected to meet leaders from government and well-known cultural figures and sporting stars, as well as visiting programmes which empower young people.\n\nThey will also cover how communities in Pakistan are responding and adapting to climate change, and are due to spend time understanding the 'complex security picture' of the region.\n\nTheir tour of Pakistan comes more than 13 years since the last royal visit, seen as one of the most perilous royal foreign tours for some time, when the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall travelled to the country in 2006.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Aga Khan Centre in London at the beginning of October - ahead of their trip to Pakistan\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with guests during the special event hosted by the Aga Khan in London at the beginning of October\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla arrive at Islamabad Airport at the start of their official visit to Pakistan in October 2006\n\nCharles and Camilla tour the ruins of houses in Pattika, Pakistan, in November 2006 - a year after it was hit by an earthquake\n\nCharles holds a traditional Pakistani hat known as a 'Tasher' he was presented with as Camilla laughs in Islamabad in 2006\n\nWilliam and Kate are following in the footsteps of both his parents, as Diana, Princess of Wales, made the journey several times through her charity work.\n\nThe image of the Princess cuddling a gravely ill seven-year-old boy Mohammed Ashrif in 1996 was among Diana's favourites and she kept a copy of it always\n\nAn image of the Princess cuddling a gravely ill seven-year-old boy was among Diana's favourites and she kept a copy of it always.\n\nIt was taken amid the chaos of a Pakistan cancer hospital in 1996 and was a reflex action on her part.\n\nThe little boy did not once look at her because he was blind and had just weeks to live.\n\nTo Diana, the picture represented everything about how she wished to be seen: compassionate and ready to break down the barriers of protocol.\n\nThe Princess visited the country three times, once when married to Prince Charles and twice more after her separation when she was in love with the Pakistan-born heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.\n\nAt the time, she was considering marriage to him and even moving to his homeland.\n\nDuring her trips, she would slip away privately to meet his family but there will be no such cloak-and-dagger antics for Prince William.\n\nIt is far more likely that he and Kate will follow the template of Diana's 1991 tour, her first solo visit representing the Queen to a Commonwealth country.\n\nThe couple have left their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, at home during their visit.", "description": "Kate and William are visiting the Islamabad Model College for Girls in the capital, touring classrooms and posing for a group picture with some of the young students.", "authors": ["Rebecca English", "Royal Correspondent In Islamabad For The Daily Mail", "Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19725110-0-image-a-17_1571117699745.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
