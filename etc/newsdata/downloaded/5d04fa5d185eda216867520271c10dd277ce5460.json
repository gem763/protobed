(AP) - Judges in state and federal court have declined to stop Michigan\u2019s ban on flavored electronic cigarettes in the short term, although a hearing is in the works just hours before the policy takes effect.\n\nFederal Judge Robert Jonker and Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens separately rejected requests for retraining orders Monday. But Stephens says she\u2019ll hold a hearing Tuesday in Petoskey.\n\nMark Slis wants an injunction that would allow him and others to continue to sell flavored vaping products. He operates 906 Vapor in Houghton. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s ban starts Wednesday.\n\nWhitmer accuses the makers of using candy flavors and deceptive ads to hook children. But Slis claims the emergency rules circumvented Michigan\u2019s typical regulatory process.\n\nJonker says he\u2019ll give the state 14 days to respond to a different lawsuit filed in federal court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Judges in state and federal court have declined to stop Michigan's ban on flavored electronic cigarettes in the short term, although a hearing is in the works just hours before the policy takes effect.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
