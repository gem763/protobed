You just get beat, and I got beat today.\u201d\n\nKang\u2019s short game has been in searing form but failed her on the second play-off hole \u2014 the 412-yard 18th \u2014 when a putt from 10 feet skirted around the hole, prompting the American to throw ip her arms in frustration.\n\nJang claimed the title on the next hole with a birdie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also happy that I went into play-off with one of my closest friends,\u201d she said after claiming the trophy.\n\n\u201cOut on the course, we\u2019re really good rivals. She\u2019s really good competition, and we\u2019ve had this relationship for 15 years,\u201d Jang added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really happy that we managed to make a really good memory on this course.\u201d\n\nIt was Jang\u2019s first victory in a US LPGA tournament since February 2017 in Australia, shortly before she abruptly returned to domestic competition to spend more time with her family.\n\nBut she said any talk of returning to the American tour was premature.\n\n\u201cMy mother is not quite well yet,\u201d Jang said. \u201cI think I would have an answer for you regarding returning to the LPGA later on. I can\u2019t say right now.\u201d\n\nLocal contenders dominated the top of the leaderboard, with 10 South Koreans placing in the top 12 finishers.\n\nAmy Yang finished third on 16-under for the tournament, four clear of Chun In-gee and Somi Lee.\n\nWorld number one Ko Jin-young struggled after leading with Kang on the first day, rounding out the weekend with two rounds of 71 to tie for ninth.", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 South Korea\u2019s Jang Ha-na clinched the inaugural BMW Ladies Championship in a nailbiting finale with Danielle Kang", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/655951_jang-ha-na-has-claimed-her-lpga-title-leaving-us-tour-play-in-domestic-competition-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
