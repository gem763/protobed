That is to say, when Mi MIX Alpha lights up \u2013 the front, side, and back of the phone are almost entirely on display.\n\nXiaomi said in a statement that behind the Surround Display is a series of groundbreaking technologies that required a new method of device assembly. Unlike traditional smartphone assembly methods, Mi MIX Alpha\u2019s internal assembly is first carried out, while its display layer, touch panel, and protection layers are laminated one-by-one.\n\nAll display component layers are compiled in that order to achieve high curvature Surround Display design, so internal stress caused by bending the display layers can be released layer by layer. To achieve a smooth and flat surface, Mi MIX Alpha also uses a durable protective layer that optimizes the screen stack structure, the company added.", "description": "Xiaomi Corp unveiled its latest concept phone, the Mi MIX Alpha, on Tuesday, as the Chinese smartphone vendor tries to show the world how future 5G phones will look.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201909/24/5d8a0bc2a310cf3e979dc21d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
