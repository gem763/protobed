From there, they will conduct operations to prevent the Islamic State's resurgence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters on Sunday.\n\nEsper has not ruled out the idea of troops conducting counterterrorism operations from Iraq into Syria. He said that decision would be worked out in time, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe troops will have two missions in Iraq.\n\n\u201cOne is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,\u201d he said. \u201cThings could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that\u2019s the game plan right now.\u201d\n\nAs it currently stand, 5,000 American troops are currently deployed in Iraq, which stems from an agreement between the two countries. Troops were originally pulled out of Iraq when operations ended in 2011. They were redeployed in 2014 when the Islamic State began taking over large portions of the country.\n\nEsper made clear the withdrawal will take \"weeks not days,\" allowing for a safe and deliberate transitions.\n\nTrump took to Twitter Sunday morning to let Americans know what Esper told him:\n\nMark Esperanto, Secretary of Defense, \u201cThe ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with the Kurds.\u201d USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nEsper's comments come after President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that he would be withdrawing troops from northern Syria after a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In the call, Erdogan made clear his forces plan to invade Syria to push back Kurdish forces, known as the YPG, which Turkey deems terrorists. The YPG has been America's biggest ally in fighting the Islamic State.\n\nTrump has faced criticism for his decision from both sides of the aisle. His former Defense Secretary, James Mattis, voiced concerns about the Islamic State's resurgence should American troops be completely withdrawn from the area.", "description": ".10/20/2019 12:52:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/44/652000b4-731c-4e1f-a70b-bae9ba0aa1d7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
