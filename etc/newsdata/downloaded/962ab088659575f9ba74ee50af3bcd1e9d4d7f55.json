The results thoroughly surprised both Tesla\u2019s and Elon Musk\u2019s critics. The market had expected the company to report a loss, but it turned an unexpected profit in the quarter despite lower revenue.\n\nTesla reported revenue of $6.3 billion, missing the consensus expectation by nearly $100 million. Its revenue fell about 8% YoY (year-over-year) due to the increase of the lower-priced Model 3 in its overall sales mix.\n\nFord\u2019s and GM\u2019s results\n\nOn October 23, Ford (F) also reported its third-quarter earnings results, which were better than expected. However, its weak outlook disappointed investors. General Motors (GM) is set to release its results on October 29.\n\nTesla crushed third-quarter earnings estimates\n\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter EPS came in at $1.86, crushing analysts\u2019 estimate of -$0.23 for the quarter. Apart from a reduction in costs, certain one-off items helped the company\u2019s bottom line. Its gross margin came in at 18.9% compared to 22.3% during the previous year\u2019s quarter despite the increase in the number of Model 3s in its mix. The company was able to reduce significant costs, leading to stronger margins. It also reported an increase of $383 million in its cash and cash equivalents to $5.3 billion to end the quarter.\n\nElon Musk provided updates on project timelines\n\nApart from the company\u2019s strong numbers, Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, updated investors and analysts on the timelines of various products and facilities. Optimistic timelines and management outlook also helped the investor sentiment for the stock.\n\nChina Gigafactory ramping up fast\n\nIn its investor letter, the company mentioned that while last year, its story was all about ramping up Model 3 production, this year it\u2019s focusing on growth and cost control. In terms of growth, the company is quickly ramping up its China Gigafactory. The factory is already ahead of schedule, with Tesla starting the production of vehicles on a trial basis. Because the price of its Model 3 is on par with gasoline-powered midsize sedans in China, the company expects China to become its biggest market for Model 3s.\n\nThe start of the China Gigafactory will be a major milestone for the company, as it will not only reduce its tariff uncertainty but also reduce its costs, thereby improving its margins. You can read Could Tesla\u2019s China Gigafactory Be Its Secret Weapon? for a detailed analysis of this topic.\n\nModel Y production expected sooner\n\nApart from the China Gigafactory, the Model Y is one of the key catalysts that could help Tesla turn profitable on a sustainable basis. During its earnings results, the company provided an update on the progress of this product. It stated that the Model Y was ahead of schedule, and production could start by the summer of 2020. Previously, the market had been expecting production to start in the fall.\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s earnings call, Musk said, \u201cI think it\u2019s quite likely to \u2014 just my opinion, but I think it will outsell Model S, Model X and Model 3 combined.\u201d We\u2019ve discussed the Model Y in much more detail in Could the Model Y Change Tesla\u2019s Profit Game?\n\nTesla\u2019s energy business\n\nThe company was also focused on Tesla Energy. During the earnings call, Musk said Tesla\u2019s energy business could be the same size as, or even bigger than, its automotive sector. He added, \u201cThis is the most underappreciated group. I think it could be bigger, but it\u2019s certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar.\u201d\n\nAs far as vehicle deliveries are concerned, the company expects to deliver more than 360,000 vehicles in 2019. This expectation, however, is down from its previous expectation of 360,000-400,000.\n\nTesla stock\n\nFollowing the above-mentioned positive developments and outlook, Tesla stock surged about 20% in after-hours trading on October 23. Until yesterday, Tesla stock had lost about 23% of its value. As expected, the company\u2019s move toward profitability was enough for it to start eliminating its losses. This positive momentum, if sustained, could erase its losses for the year.\n\nWas the third quarter redemptive for Musk?\n\nTesla\u2019s results have been positive for Musk, whose leadership style has often been questioned by skeptics. In Why Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Need to Be Tesla\u2019s CEO, we talked about how despite Musk\u2019s strengths, James Anderson of Baillie Gifford thought Tesla could work without him.\n\nMusk has had several encounters with regulatory authorities about his brash tweets. The most controversial tweet came on August 7, 2018, when Musk wrote, \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d The situation ultimately led to Musk stepping down as Tesla\u2019s chair. Long-time Tesla bear and hedge fund manager David Einhorn also asked for Musk\u2019s resignation over Tesla\u2019s recent solar fires.\n\nWhile Tesla could probably survive without Musk as its CEO, the development would make a lot of shareholders unhappy. Many have remained with the company due to Musk\u2019s vision and charisma. In China Did for Tesla What Trump Didn\u2019t, we discussed that Tesla was the only foreign automaker to have received a 10% purchase tax exemption in China. The development came after Musk met with Chinese Minister of Transport Li Xiaopeng.\n\nTesla\u2019s latest results and expedited timelines for several projects have certainly been redemptive for Musk.", "description": "Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings results on October 23.
