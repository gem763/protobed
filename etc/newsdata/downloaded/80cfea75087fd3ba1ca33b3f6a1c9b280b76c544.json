Further, the public will be wise to such behaviour in future towards women by you and others like you.\n\n'The courts will always try to keep abreast of developing criminal trends which cause public disquiet, concern and even outrage and will take appropriate steps to tackle these.'\n\nHe praised Ahmed's victims for giving evidence, adding: 'The mental scarring won't leave in a hurry but they will be fortified that by giving evidence of what really happened you will be held to account.'\n\nPolice began an investigation after his behaviour was revealed by the BBC's The Social show.\n\nAhmed, of Glasgow, disputed his actions were unlawful and in evidence accused his victims of lying or misconstruing him\n\nHis lawyer Donna Armstrong later told he court heard he had not intended to cause fear and alarm, but he was found guilty earlier this year.\n\nThe court heard Ahmed had previous convictions, including for drink-driving and a firearms charge, and had previously been jailed seven times - the longest for two years and three months.", "description": "Adnan Ahmed called himself 'Addy A-game' in videos he uploaded on YouTube showing himself approaching girls in Glasgow in a bid to instruct others how to 'pick up' women.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20043404-0-image-a-132_1571759608793.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
