But it's not true,\" Cardinal Maradiaga said.\n\nMr Nuzzi has made a name for himself by publishing a series of books on Vatican financial scandals. In his latest, published Monday, he analyses the Vatican's books for 2018, showing them to be in the red and getting worse.\n\nThe book says APSA, a department of the Holy See which oversees real estate and investments, had a deficit of nearly 44 million euros (S$66.7 million) in 2018, compared to 32 million the previous year.\n\nMr Nuzzi said the real estate portfolio was worth an estimated 2.7 billion euros and was badly managed.\n\nSome 800 properties were lying empty, he said, while 15 percent of the 3,200 rented properties were being let for free, and others were being rented out below market prices.\n\nAn internal report by the pope's advisors, quoted in the book, warns that the Vatican \"deficit is recurrent and structural, and has reached worrying levels, with a risk of default if urgent action is not taken\".\n\nAPSA head Bishop Nunzio Galantino also rebuffed the book's findings.\n\n\"There is neither backruptcy nor default\", just a need for a savings plan \"to contain expenses\", he told the Avvenire daily.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [VATICAN CITY] Pope Francis's economic adviser on Tuesday denied reports the Vatican was at risk of default, saying the allegations were part of a campaign to discredit the pontiff. .
