The three-day conference featured Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, among others.\n\nAt the top of Monday\u2019s broadcast of the ABC chatfest, The View\u2019s Whoopi Goldberg noted that current White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday morning that the president \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the video while also claiming that he hadn\u2019t seen it yet.\n\n\u201cWith all the Twitter stuff he does, he couldn\u2019t come out and condemn it himself,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cHe had someone else do it.\u201d\n\nHuntsman, meanwhile, pointed out that the video is \u201chorrific\u201d before imploring viewers not to seek it out because \u201cit\u2019s vile\u201d and \u201cone of the most disgusting things I have seen.\u201d\n\nThis prompted fellow conservative host and former Fox News personality Meghan McCain to weigh in, saying she had gotten into arguments with fellow conservatives on Twitter who were saying this was \u201cjust free speech or being a snowflake.\u201d McCain, went on to add that besides Trump shooting her deceased father in the parody video, the clip shows Trump taking aim at other real people and could be seen as making a threat against someone in office.\n\nThe panel then talked about the widespread outrage that followed comedian Kathy Griffin over the photo of her holding up a mask made to look like Trump\u2019s decapitated bloody head, saying that if you were upset about that you should also be upset over the violent video.\n\nNoting that this clip was shown to attendees at a pro-Trump event at one of the president\u2019s properties, Huntsman took issue with the president finding time to tweet about a whole range of topics on Monday morning while ignoring the video.\n\n\u201cIf you are tweeting about Dancing with the Stars,\u201d it is now 11:00 a.m. on the East Coast,\u201d she declared. \u201cWe have not\u2014we have not read a tweet yet from the president denouncing this saying that this is violent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I say, where is the leadership?\u201d Huntsman added. \u201cBecause I\u2019m just grateful my kids are too young to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAs of publication, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed was filled with requests to vote for Sean Spicer on DWTS, clips of his favorite Fox News programs, quotes from One America News personalities, and criticism of Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade for disagreeing with the president on Syria. But, alas, nothing condemning the video made by pro-Trump memesmiths.", "description": "Co-host Meghan McCain also blasted conservatives for defending the video as free speech while taking issue with the clip including her now-deceased father.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571071063/view_77_kpxbz3", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
