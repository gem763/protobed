And in fairness, that was probably the only choice the Sooners had. The ball was at Kansas\u2019 44-yard-line.\n\nOklahoma had to punt because it backed itself up once it got to the Kansas 7. A holding penalty on first down moved the ball to the 17. The Jalen Hurts got sacked on the resulting first down and the ball got pushed back to the 25.\n\nA failed play on second down meant a loss of 23 yards to the Kansas 48 when a reverse to wide receiver CeeDee Lamb lost a bunch of yards and then decided to flip the ball back to quarterback Jalen Hurts, who ended up losing even more yardage.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere\u2019s an aerial perspective of where Oklahoma was after that play.\n\n3rd & goal from midfield pic.twitter.com/jTfDnp1Quv \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 5, 2019\n\nOklahoma got 19 yards back on third down but lost 15 of those when offensive lineman Marquis Hayes got called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after the play. And then the punt had to happen.\n\nOKLAHOMA FOURTH-AND-GOAL PUNT \ud83d\ude0d pic.twitter.com/dUclYVcPRj \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 5, 2019\n\nThe punt led to a TD\n\nThe decision ultimately worked out. Reeves Mundschau\u2019s punt was downed at the Kansas 2. The Jayhawks couldn\u2019t do anything with the ball backed up near the goal line and then had to punt themselves.\n\nStory continues\n\nLamb had a long punt return and that, coupled with a Kansas penalty on the punt, put Oklahoma at the Kansas 10 \u2014 or 34 yards ahead of where it was when it punted in a goal-to-go situation on the previous drive. On the first play of this drive, Hurts tossed the ball to Lamb, who scored a 10-yard TD and ultimately gave Oklahoma a 21-7 halftime lead.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The punt ultimately worked out, as Oklahoma soon scored a touchdown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FkGFv_z6sbBz0133jDIGgQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9_IPqvhC.hvuXqKhrQhPmg--~B/aD0zNDcxO3c9NTIwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/424f9650-e79b-11e9-8f31-fdcc8f5d6275", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
