They realised this was not right,\" he said.\n\nSchool apologises\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the school apologised for offending anybody.\n\n\"Curro extends an unreserved apology to all those community members who have been affected and offended by the artwork in question. We urge the community to support Curro, Grantleigh and its leadership in their sincere and determined efforts to ensure that we continue to offer the best quality education to every learner under our care.\"\n\nIt said that following an internal investigation, Curro determined that the duty of care and guidance offered to the learner did not always adequately address the underlying issues and potential implications of producing a visual art piece, the content of which was controversial and likely to stir emotive responses.\n\n\"It is also important that art is subjective and open to interpretation; art encourages people to voice an opinion, either for or against the work in question,\" it stated.\n\nIt noted that the Independent Examination Board (IEB) confirmed that an independent examiner already examined the exhibition and found it to comply, in every respect, with the examination brief and IEB academic standards. It was not reported as problematic to the IEB.\n\nThe school body acknowledged that the content of the artwork was controversial and likely to stir emotive responses.\n\n\"It is also important that art is subjective and open to interpretation; art encourages people to voice an opinion either for or against the work in question,\" the statement read.\n\nThe school \"reaffirmed\" its commitment to the Constitutional right of every individual with respect to their religious belief, race or ethnicity, gender orientation.\n\nIt would actively include this as part of their ongoing good practice as an institution of learning and to rigorously avoid any action that constitutes incitement to cause harm.\n\nMoney, blind faith\n\nThe matric artist has also seemingly responded to the outcry, Parent24 reported, with a statement explaining the context of the work, and asking that \"before anyone speak, they perhaps think\", adding that \"I cannot damage that which has already been shattered.\"\n\nNews24 is working on verifying the contents of the statement through the school.\n\nThe Zululand Observer reported that the pupil explained the artwork \"demonstrates organised religion's preoccupation with making money and its exploitation of those with blind faith\".\n\nIt reported that he said one of the pieces was symbolic of the lack of choice children have when they are born into and raised in a particular faith.\n\nAnderson was told that it had been displayed due to a \"lack of knowledge\" about the content, and that everybody was too afraid to speak out before he made his video plea.\n\nThere was an agreement that in the future, religious content in art would still be allowed, but it had to be positive and in line with the school's ethos of \"to God be the glory\".\n\nAnderson felt that \"that barrier cannot be crossed\", and wanted religion to be used in a positive way.\n\nHe said freedom of expression was important, but it needed to be framed within the context of the school's ethos.\n\n\n\nHe said the art teacher was new at the school, which may have contributed to a \"lack of knowledge\" about \"Satanism\" and Satanic imagery.\n\n\n\nNews24 will update the story if the school issues further information later on Wednesday.", "description": "Grantleigh Curro's controversial art exhibition on the relationship between money and religion has been taken down in the wake of an outcry that it was 'demonical', the man who complained about it says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/b50173d8359e4c1187f3a6422c94e0e9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
