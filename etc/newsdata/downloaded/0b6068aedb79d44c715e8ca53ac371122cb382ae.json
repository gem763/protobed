Chuck Grassley\u2019s office on Tuesday sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray asking for an update on the status of criminal referrals made during the Brett Kavanaugh nomination. All Republican members of the Judiciary Committee at the time have signed on to the letter except one.\n\nWith the exception of Ben Sasse, every current GOP senator who was on the Judiciary Committee during the Kavanaugh hearings signed this letter to DOJ/FBI demanding to know the status of criminal referrals for false statements from Kavanaugh hoaxers. https://t.co/PaafD02Izb \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 8, 2019\n\nGrassley writes in a statement:\n\nIn the process of evaluating claims against the then-nominee, committee investigators collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals. Those investigations culminated in the nominee\u2019s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations. Last year, then-Chairman Grassley referred to the Department of Justice four individuals for investigation for potential criminal conduct including the submission of materially false statements to the committee, obstruction of Congress and conspiracy to submit false statements or obstruct Congress.\n\nThose GOP senators signing on to the letter include Grassley, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, Mike Crapo, Thom Tillis, John Kennedy, and Marsha Blackburn.\n\nHas Sasse offered any rational explanation for not holding them accountable? \u2014 Sandy (@RightGlockMom) October 8, 2019\n\nHe's a dick. \u2014 Sandy Parker (@RHWOOBsandy) October 8, 2019\n\nSounds like Sasse needs to go. \u2014 Brendon Daniels (@bdaniels1996) October 8, 2019\n\nSasse \u2014 JM Conservative (@JMuser16) October 8, 2019\n\nWhere was @BenSasse ? Must have been sick that day\u2026 \u2014 the individualist (@theindividuali7) October 8, 2019\n\nHope the voters in Ben's state send him packing \u2014 Martha (@Martha6448) October 8, 2019\n\nSasse is weak \u2014 Terry Inman\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@TerryInman11) October 8, 2019\n\nThe fact Sasse did not sign is incredibly telling. \u2014 Dmac (@sioux4evrr) October 8, 2019\n\nFigures.. As @dbongino says, some Republicans are Democrats but no Democrats are Republicans. @SenSasse is a Rino. \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 AMERICA 1st\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Monica4Trump) October 8, 2019\n\nWell he is a prick but in his defense he probably already knows nothing's happening. \u2014 HR (@HR49783712) October 8, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Sen.
