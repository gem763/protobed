(Picture: Backgrid)\n\nGemma Collins has revealed that she believes she has psychic abilities and has compared herself to Stranger Things character Eleven.\n\nThe reality star admitted that she could \u2018see and feel things that others didn\u2019t\u2019 when she was younger and added that now she notices that her \u2018breasts get heavy on the full moon\u2019.\n\nShe\u2019s even spent thousands of pounds on psychic readings over her lifetime.\n\nWho knew she was so into the supernatural?\n\nSpeaking in an upcoming episode of her BBC podcast The Gemma Collins Podcast, Gemma let loose about her psychokinetic abilities, saying: \u2018When I was younger like I didn\u2019t really understand that I could feel things that maybe other people didn\u2019t or see things that other people didn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s only when I watched Stranger Things\u2026 now I feel like Millie Bobby Brown and I get it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddressing the breasts comment, Gemma explained her additional belief that astrology can have an impact on her physical body.\n\nGemma compared herself to Eleven from Stranger Things (Picture: Netflix)\n\nShe once spent \u00a31000 on a psychic after she broke up with an old boyfriend (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know about you but my breasts get so heavy on a full moon. Literally I can barely move,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018They fill with water. When I looked into this, the moon\u2019s made up of water and that can affect water within.\u2019\n\nAnd while she was on the subject, the former Towie queen admitted she also believes in aliens.\n\nThis is getting deep!\n\nGemma proceeded to try and address aliens and told them: \u2018Aliens if you can hear me please, I\u2019ve got lots of land here where we live.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s lots of green fields. Land your UFOs where I live, I wanna talk to you, I wanna hug you, I wanna meet you. I\u2019m not scared of aliens.\u2019\n\nSo she\u2019s searching a bit further afield for friends than one usually might.\n\nGemma Collins had a horrendous fall on Dancing on Ice (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nGemma also confessed that she\u2019s used the supernatural several times in her life.\n\nOnce she spent over \u00a31000 seeing a psychic after she broke up with an old boyfriend, hoping they would reignite their romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen following her terrifying fall on Dancing on Ice in February, the star brought in a shaman to hopefully cleanse the ice rink of any more negative vibes.\n\nAt least she\u2019s trying to right her wrongs.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
