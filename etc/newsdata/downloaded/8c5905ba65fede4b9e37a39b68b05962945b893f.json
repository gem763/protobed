The plea, from Dep Chief Constable Mark Roberts, National Police Chiefs' Council's Football Policing Lead, and backed by the FA, was ignored.\n\n\"It started when one or two fans threw bottles at the police,\" said one eyewitness, who did not want to be named.\n\n\"They landed near the police vans and at first they ignored it. But then one bottle hit the meshed window of a police van, and that was the trigger for them to act.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"The England fans then threw three or four bottles, and the cops moved in with batons drawn as they set off the two stun grenades to disperse the crowds.\n\n\"Then the men involved were arrested and held down on the ground before they were taken away.\"\n\nMr Roberts warned Czech offiers to prepare for 'flashpoints', with the fixture designated as high risk.\n\nThe trouble came around 7pm local time, as the 3,800 England fans with tickets for the game were preparing to set off for the 21,000-seater Sinobo stadium, around half an hour from the city centre.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAnti-riot units, helicopters and officers on horseback were being deployed with hundreds more on standby in what is one of the biggest ever security operations seen in the city.\n\nIt was put in place as up to 300,000 mourners were expected to pay their last respects to pop star Karel Gott, a national icon, in services yesterday (fri) and today (Sat).\n\nThe Football Supporters Federation handed out leaflets to England fans which warned: \u201cThere will be no alcohol on sale in the ground, and anyone looking drunk is likely to be refused entry.
