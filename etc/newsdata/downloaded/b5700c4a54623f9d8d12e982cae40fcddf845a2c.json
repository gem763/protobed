When Judy was entering into the movie business, that was the zenith of culture, not just pop culture,\" she explained. \"As Americans, we all shared the same cultural experiences, we buy the same records, the same songs on the radio, and the movies played for months in the movie theaters. So we were all watching the same things, and shaping the conversations.\"\n\nJon Kopaloff/FilmMagic More\n\nThe Garland biopic shows the actress and singer's journey to London in 1968 for a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town, which came nearly 30 years after her breakout role in The Wizard of Oz. Garland's time across the pond came amid battles with her management, a whirlwind romance with her fifth husband, Mickey Deans, and her deteriorating health, which resulted in her death by accidental overdose in 1969 at age 47.\n\nFor the premiere, Zellweger paid tribute to the Hollywood legend with her elegant and regal red gown.\n\n\"A little brocade in Judy's honor. Oscar de la Renta. Festive and fun!\" she noted, also showing off her gorgeous David Webb ring.\n\nJudy arrives in theaters on Sept. 27.
