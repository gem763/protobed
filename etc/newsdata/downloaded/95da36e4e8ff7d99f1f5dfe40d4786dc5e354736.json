I feel offended as a professional and I\u2019m disappointed,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cThe defender doesn\u2019t even look at the ball and goes straight for Llorente to try and stop him from jumping. It was a clear penalty. They made a dreadful mistake.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you didn\u2019t even need VAR but it\u2019s ridiculous that the referee didn\u2019t go to see the replay \u2026 I don\u2019t want to say anything else because I wasn\u2019t shown respect and nor was my club.\u201d\n\nMilik also twice hit the woodwork for Napoli before finally getting his goal.\n\nNapoli remained three points behind Atalanta but fell to sixth.\n\nLAST-GASP WIN\n\nRonaldo had a goal disallowed in stoppage time but then won and converted a penalty to eal the victory against Genoa, which played nearly all of the second half with 10 men.\n\nMaurizio Sarri\u2019s men were looking to bounce back from a disappointing 1-1 draw at Lecce at the weekend and Leonardo Bonucci headed them in front in the 36th.\n\nBut Christian Kouam\u00e9 leveled five minutes later with a bit of luck as he miskicked the ball off his other leg and it wrongfooted Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nFrancesco Cassata was sent off for a second yellow card five minutes after the interval but Genoa\u2019s chances to hold on were boosted when Juventus substitute Adrien Rabiot was also dismissed for two bookings three minutes from time.\n\nRonaldo, who had earlier missed a sitter, thought he had won the match in the fourth minute of stoppage time but the goal was disallowed for offside.\n\nThe Portugal international was given a second chance minutes later when he was tripped by Antonio Sanabria and he drove the penalty into the bottom left corner.\n\nOTHER MATCHES\n\nRoma defender Federico Fazio was sent off after just 32 minutes but the capital side managed to win 4-0 at Udinese to move fourth.\n\nLazio is a point further back after beating Torino by the same scoreline.\n\nAlso: Calgiari beat Bologna 3-2, Fiorentina won 2-1 at Sassuolo and Sampdoria drew 1-1 with Lecce.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atalanta rallied to draw 2-2 at Napoli on Wednesday in an entertaining Serie A match between two of the league's most attack-minded sides.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Daniella Matar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/italy_soccer_serie_a_20126_c0-127-3072-1919_s1200x700.jpg?26f73de878dc5073a0131850fdc05e67e05018ac", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
