As opposition leader in 2014 he organised months of mass protests in Islamabad that failed in a bid to bring down the government.\n\nWith the ability to mobilise tens of thousands of madrassa students, JUI-F protests have a history of stirring unrest, and authorities are sealing off the capital\u2019s diplomatic enclave with shipping containers.\n\nA violent crackdown risks sparking a wider backlash in the Muslim-majority country, where mainstream politicians have long tried to keep the conservative right on side.\n\n\u2013 Bad blood \u2013\n\nRehman\u2019s bad blood with Khan runs deep.\n\nKhan ran on an anti-corruption agenda in 2018 and called out \u201cMaulana Diesel\u201d, as he dubbed him, for his alleged participation in graft involving fuel licenses.\n\nRehman, in turn, refers to the former World Cup-winning cricketer as \u201cthe Jew\u201d \u2014 citing his first marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, along with incoherent anti-Semitic conspiracies.\n\nRehman, a maulana (cleric) whose orange turban sports a traditional pattern from his northwest hometown, lost his parliamentary seat in 2018 to a candidate from Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party.\n\nStill smarting from that loss, Rehman has chosen this moment carefully.\n\nKhan\u2019s government has been under pressure for months as anger simmers over the dire state of the economy.\n\nUnemployment, double-digit inflation, and rising utility costs have hit ordinary Pakistanis hard \u2014 issues other opposition parties have also railed against \u2014 and Rehman has been eager to exploit the unhappiness during the march.\n\nAs the protest moved toward the capital this week, traders across the country launched a two-day strike, piling further pressure on Khan.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Cheated\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe cleric insists that Khan needs to be removed from office, and a new \u201cfree and fair\u201d election held.\n\nBut he remains vague about how he aims to achieve their goals.\n\nThat lack of substance has led some observers to suggest Rehman\u2019s protest is more a salve for his ego after the humiliating election drubbing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been left out of a game and he thinks he\u2019s been cheated out of his rightful place,\u201d said columnist Arifa Noor.\n\n\u201cThe (economy) is more of a stick to beat the government with.\u201d\n\nRehman has rotated in and out of successive governments for decades, forging alliances with both Islamist and secular parties while enjoying occasional support from the military establishment.\n\nHe was once a hardline Islamist and anti-American firebrand, calling for the implementation of Shariah law publically backing the Afghan Taliban, but more recently has tried to rebrand as a moderate.\n\nThat has not stopped him from dismissing the attack on Nobel prize laureate Malala Yousfazi in 2012 as a fabricated conspiracy, and protesting the exoneration of Asia Bibi \u2014 a Christian woman at the centre of Pakistan\u2019s most high-profile blasphemy case.\n\nWhether the march ends in violence or not, it has undeniably thrust Rehman back into the spotlight after suggestions he was increasingly becoming irrelevant.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time the maulana dominated the news agenda this much?\u201d asked Noor.\n\nsjd-jaf-zz-ds/st/fox", "description": "Islamabad (AFP) \u2013 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan faces the first major challenge to his leadership as a grey-bearded, orange-turbaned rival he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/81cae0_maulana-fazlur-rehman-is-leading-thousands-protesters-in-on-islamabad-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
