She gave up alcohol and went sober, realizing that her drinking had gotten out of hand. She was no longer drinking for fun, but rather, to mask the pressures of motherhood.\n\n\u201cInstantly, it made me feel better,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cI had rules because I didn\u2019t want to be irresponsible, so I would drink a lot at home \u2014 wine. Just a glass or two and I feel better. Then, I [would] get the kids again and I would drink like the rest of the bottle and start on another one.\u201d\n\nWatch the full story on \"Nightline\" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC\n\nABC\n\nHobbs, who had a successful career working in insurance, decided to become a stay-at-home mom when she had her kids. She said she \u201cloved the idea,\u201d but didn\u2019t expect it to be as stressful as it turned out to be. She said that from the moment she woke up, she would look forward to the glass of wine she would have later. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d she said.\n\nAt her peak, Hobbs was drinking a bottle-and-a-half each day, she said, adding that it had progressed to that point over the years.\n\n\u201cSo it started out with maybe two glasses, and then eventually...I needed more and more to feel relaxed,\u201d Hobbs said.\n\nCourtesy of Modern Mommy Madness\n\nHer drinking eventually began to affect her family. She was often angry and she would release these emotions on her husband, Robbie Hobbs, and her children, she said.\n\n\u201cI had all this unresolved stuff [and] I didn\u2019t know why, and I drank to make it go away but it never really went away,\u201d she said. \u201cAlcohol made me more depressed. So I was just...miserable.\u201d\n\nNobody was aware of the extent to which Harmony Hobbs\u2019 drinking had become a problem. Robbie Hobbs, whose long hours at work kept him away from home, said that he only became concerned once his wife told him that she might have an alcohol issue.\n\nABC\n\nHarmony Hobbs\u2019 oldest son, 10-year-old Maverick, said he thought the drinking was normal because he had only known his mother to consume alcohol.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was out of the ordinary because that\u2019s how I grew up. That\u2019s what I was used to,\u201d Maverick said. \u201cSo like, every night she would...get a glass of wine and I asked her, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 She was like, \u2018It\u2019s wine. It\u2019s alcohol.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh, I heard of that in school. Doesn\u2019t that make you addicted to it?\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, but I\u2019m not addicted.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaverick added that although he couldn\u2019t tell at the time, looking back at it, he said that \u201cmaybe she was trying to deny the fact that she is using [alcohol] as an outlet for stress.\u201d\n\nCindy Feinberg, a recovery coach and addiction specialist, described how many of her cases involving mothers with alcohol problems were rooted in mental illnesses, like depression and anxiety.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, what I see is people are looking to self-medicate because they\u2019re not really sure how to talk to somebody about what\u2019s going on...people feel a lot of shame about what they\u2019re struggling with,\u201d she said.\n\nHarmony Hobbs was finally pushed to take action on her drinking problem after her best friend Audrey Hayworth called her out on it. The two had hosted a YouTube series called \"The Mom Cave,\" where they would imbibe while reviewing different products. But Hayworth said that in retrospect, Harmony Hobbs would drink more than her during the taping.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cI think we were filming three or four episodes and at the end of it, I still had half a glass of wine left, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Are you going to finish that?\u2019\u201d Hayworth said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2026 In retrospect, now I can see that she wanted to finish my wine.\u201d\n\nLooking back, Harmony Hobbs described this moment as \u201ca wakeup call.\u201d She said it never occurred to her that she could be addicted to alcohol, often describing herself as \"high functioning\" while drinking. But she realized how in denial she was. She said that on the day she acknowledged she was an alcoholic, she quit cold turkey.\n\nCourtesy of Modern Mommy Madness\n\nWith her newfound self-awareness, Harmony Hobbs appeared in a video with Hayworth to announce to their thousands of followers that she was addicted. She also transformed her blog about drinking into one that chronicled her painful road to recovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that at 37 years old, I\u2019m going to have to relearn how to cope with the difficulties of life: grief and pain and abandonment and loss and the everyday stress that accompanies motherhood,\u201d Harmony Hobbs wrote in a blog post after being sober for 25 days. \u201cMaybe I never knew how to handle those things in the first place, and that\u2019s what landed me in a 12-step program. The \u2018hows\u2019 and \u2018whys\u2019 don\u2019t matter \u2014 I just want to get better.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Modern Mommy Madness\n\nIn the first days of her recovery, Harmony Hobbs said she just wanted to die. \u201cI thought I told Robbie, \u2018I can\u2019t drink. I\u2019m not sure if I can go on,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is, though. It\u2019s like the only way that I knew how to cope with life was drinking\u2026 I honestly didn\u2019t know how to function.\u201d\n\nBut as she navigated through recovery, she began to surround herself with other mothers \u2014 some of whom weren\u2019t even addicted to alcohol \u2014 who understood her addiction and her journey to recovery, and who also rejected \"mommy wine culture.\"\n\nThese sentiments are shared by a larger group within the so-called \"sober curious\" movement, a phrase coined by lifestyle journalist Ruby Warrington, who wrote a book about her sobriety journey.\n\nAmong these people is Paola Atlason, a mother of two who chose to be sober for health and lifestyle reasons. She said she is \u201cglad\u201d the sober curious movement is challenging the notion that moms should drink.\n\n\u201cI used to see advertising or promotion where it was like \u2018mom wine special: two bottles [for the price of] one,\u2019 or coffee in one hand and wine in the other. \u2026 There was a yoga class where you would drink wine. Now we\u2019re really hitting a low point here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is challenging it in a very positive way because it\u2019s just bringing awareness, and understanding that maybe there\u2019s too much of an attachment and that you have a choice.\u201d\n\nAtlason said the idea to stop drinking first emerged when she was 40 years old and feeling unwell. She said she wasn\u2019t \u201cconnected to who I was,\u201d and that to make a change, she looked at what she was eating and drinking.\n\nCourtesy of Modern Mommy Madness\n\n\u201cSome of the benefits of quitting alcohol...mental clarity is a huge one,\u201d Atlason said. \u201cMood shifts. I think you become [a] lighter, better sleeper. And I would think just more joy. I just feel more joyful. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s meditation or quitting the drinking, but...there\u2019s a spark. I don\u2019t know how to describe that.\u201d\n\nAlthough Feinberg said \u201cmommy wine culture\u201d most likely isn\u2019t making women alcoholics, she said that \u201cif somebody has a propensity to be an alcoholic, this would be a perfect breeding ground to bring that out of [them].\u201d\n\nBoth Feinberg and Harmony Hobbs believe moms \u2014 and the general public \u2014 should reevaluate their drinking habits from time to time. \u201cI think it\u2019s always good to question your behavior,\u201d said Harmony Hobbs.\n\nCourtesy of Modern Mommy Madness\n\nToday, Harmony Hobbs\u2019 circle is filled with other moms who have chosen to be sober. As their children play together, they engage in deep conversations and face life\u2019s hurdles head on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like friendship intimacy and showing who you really are and not who you want people to think you are, and accepting [that],\u201d said Lacy Dicharry, a friend of Harmony Hobbs. \u201cLike that\u2019s what I love about hanging out with Harmony \u2014 that I never ever have a fear of judgment \u2026 I know that I can show the full of me and I\u2019ll be accepted...no matter what I\u2019m doing or going through. And that\u2019s really why...it\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Harmony Hobbs feels like she\u2019s found herself again and said she\u2019s not trying to \u201crun away from me anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always thought this would happen in mid-life, like, you become comfortable in your own skin,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s sobriety.\u201d", "description": "Harmony Hobbs once wrote a blog about drinking alcohol but has since gone sober.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/harmony-main-abc-ay-190905_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
