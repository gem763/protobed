One of the activities involves 10-year-olds being split into groups and pointing out one another\u2019s \u201cprivate parts\u201d and explaining why they think its private\n\nPupils in Grade 6 learning about the dangers of sexual content on social media. In one scenario a girl considers sending a topless photo of herself to boys on a WhatsApp group and the class is required to discuss whether it\u2019s a good idea;\n\nIn Grade 7 pupils will learn about boys and girls who masturbate. \u201cThis is normal and will not hurt you,\u201d the study guide says.\n\nPupils in Grade 8 will begin to distinguish between biological and gender identity and how it differs. They will learn about unsafe abortions. In the guide for the lesson, an hour is prescribed for descriptions of vaginal, oral and anal sex, fertilisation, the biology of pregnancy and the chances of getting it pregnant;\n\nThe grade 9 book has a seven-step, illustrated depiction of how a female condom should be correctly placed in position inside the vagina. There is also a compulsory group activity in which pupils learn to say \u201cno\u201d through role play. One character tries to convince the other to have sex, while the other is meant to turn it down while still \u201cmaintaining a positive relationship\u201d; and\n\nIn grade 10 and 11 pupils will learn about the various sexual orientations; that it\u2019s not a choice; and how to be accepting towards a transgender woman, for example, who now identifies as male.\n\nFrom a very early stage, pupils will encounter case studies in which adults assault children and in Grade 5, they will be given an example of \u201cMax\u201d, who is sexually assaulted by other boys at their school.\n\nThey smack his butt and convince him to grab another boy\u2019s private parts. Max immediately reports it to his teacher.\n\n\n\nElijah Mhlanga, spokesperson of the department of education, did not react to a request for comment.\n\nAngie Motshekga, minister of basic education, writes in a preface guideline that government had begun to revise the curriculum as early as 2011 because the previous focus on HIV and pregnancy did not have the desired outcome.\n\nThe department strongly promotes abstinence from sex until a suitable age is attained, she writes. Pupils will still be encouraged to put off having sex.\n\nBut the curriculum had to be aligned with international standard guidelines drawn up by the UN\u2019s education body, Unesco, in cooperation with leading experts in the field.\n\nKlopper said this was misleading.\n\nEarlier this year, when there were suggestions that masturbation would form part of the curriculum for Grade 4s, the SAOU held a meeting with teachers.\n\n\u201cThe documentation and examples that were presented to us six years ago, were relatively acceptable. After studying the latest examples we are unfortunately forced to conclude that we have been deliberately misled\u201d.\n\nPaul Colditz, chief executive of the Federation for School Governing Bodies, was shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat we see now was not shared with us so we could obtain insights from parents and does not appear to be age-appropriate, sensitive or value-driven.\u201d\n\nColditz said there would be another meeting with the department on November 27, and that a hard line would be taken.\n\nThe Christian lobby group, For SA, shared examples of the material and expressed its outrage.\n\nIn particular, they are opposed to the \u201cnormalisation\u201d of homosexuality in the curriculum and \u201cideological preconceptions\u201d with which they don\u2019t agree.", "description": "Outrage over a \u2018grossly insensitive\u2019 new curriculum that will teach pupils all about sex, including masturbation.", "authors": ["Jaco Nel", "Landi Slatter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/5995a26b23ed49eea1941a32ee8b61c1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
