Opposition activists, journalists and human rights defenders are often jailed, while security forces loyal to Maduro commit abuses with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of Venezuela and Brazil to the human rights council marks a backwards step in the advancement of human rights in the region,\u201d said Rodolfo Montes de Oca, a lawyer at Provea, a Venezuelan rights group.\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly praised the torturers of the country\u2019s military dictatorship, encouraged police to carry out extrajudicial killings and said that he hopes criminals will \u201cdie in the streets like cockroaches\u201d.\n\nHowever, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said that Brazil\u2019s institutions still offered a degree of protection.\n\n\u201cDespite Bolsonaro\u2019s very poor record and anti-rights rhetoric, Brazil is still a democracy in which the judiciary, an independent media and NGOs are bravely pushing back,\u201d Vivanco said. \u201cThe Brazilian congress has also been able to stop some of the most egregious draft legislation proposals promoted by Bolsonaro to grant the police power to kill with impunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Venezuela is beyond the pale,\u201d Vivanco said. \u201cIts authorities are responsible for systematic egregious abuses and a humanitarian emergency.\u201d\n\nA coalition of western countries, led by the US, backs Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, officially recognizing him as the South American nation\u2019s legitimate president in January this year.\n\nBut Maduro still clings to power and will probably be emboldened by his country\u2019s new post at the UN.\n\n\u201cThey can say they were elected to the human rights council and from there have a voice to push back on their critics,\u201d said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank.\n\nOpposition politicians, however, were appalled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, a travesty,\u201d said Vanessa Neumann, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to the UK, who added that the vote will do little to silence Maduro\u2019s critics. \u201cUltimately the march of history\u2019s harsh judgment on Maduro and his regime will not be stopped by this.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, issued a scathing report on Venezuela, which described widespread cases of torture, extrajudicial killings and withholding food and medicines from civilians.\n\nThe UN human rights council is no stranger to controversy, with repressive countries including Cuba, Saudi Arabia, China, Indonesia and Russia taking seats in the past.\n\nThe US abandoned the council for the second time in June last year, claiming the institution was biased against Israel.", "description": "Other seat for Latin America went to Brazil, whose far-right leader has expressed contempt for the concept of human rights", "authors": ["Joe Parkin Daniels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c105fb62cfdeb02f1c83a362788a6114fd36e568/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f7f27c148a05d11775b1cd6977a5842", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
