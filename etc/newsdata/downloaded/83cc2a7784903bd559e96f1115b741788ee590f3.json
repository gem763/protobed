Like in April 2015, when teenagers were participating in something called the Kylie Jenner Challenge, in which they\u2019d attempt to plump up their lips, Kylie Jenner-style, by sucking the air out of a shot glass; the subsequent friction would cause the person\u2019s lips to swell temporarily. As one would expect, some of the participants ended up with painful bruising and swelling, and it might have been all for naught: Jenner finally admitted to having lip injections a month or so after the challenge went viral.\n\nFour years later, the internet has generated a new lip-related challenge, this one born from the bowels of TikTok. This time, the challenge requires some sort of sticky adhesive, like eyelash glue, which is then applied to the person\u2019s Cupid bow. After letting the glue dry for a few seconds, the person presses their top lip against their Cupid bow, resulting in the appearance of plump lips. As Paper reports, the trend appears to have been started by TikTok user @chloehammock4.\n\nimagine you\u2019re talking to someone and your lip falls down by accident pic.twitter.com/kDD9CqHOr6 \u2014 Shafeeq (@Y2SHAF) September 7, 2019\n\nI mean, it works for the most part! Or at least enough to put on some lip gloss and snap a few selfies for the \u2019gram.\n\nYall I did that trend where you glue your lip up... im dying \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/mIHlZmd4tC \u2014 \ud83c\udf38 Alexandra Daniels \ud83c\udf38 (@alexdanielsxo) September 8, 2019\n\nYOU GUCKING GLUE UR LIP UP pic.twitter.com/h7WT7GnFfM \u2014 maddie\ud83e\udd8b (@nukethebeans) September 8, 2019\n\nSo, is there anything actually risky with this one, or can we let the kids have some fun? Dr. Jessie Cheung, a board-certified dermatologist in Chicago, says that even though eyelash glue is safe to use on the eyes, there are always potential irritants and allergens in it, which can cause a rash or other harm. \u201cThe glue can rip off your skin to cause superficial tears and abrasions. You can develop scars and discoloration,\u201d Cheung says.\n\nNot to encourage anybody, but this challenge doesn\u2019t seem as dangerous as sucking the air out of a shot glass. \u201cWhile no long-term damage should arise from a teenager doing this challenge once, the risk for irritation and discomfort are not worth the novelty of this challenge,\u201d Dr. Manish Shah, M.D., a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Denver, adds. \u201cIf a child uses a stronger adhesive for this purpose, like super glue, this may carry a higher risk of skin damage, redness, and agitation to the dermis and epidermis above the lip.\u201d\n\nRead that, fellow youths?
