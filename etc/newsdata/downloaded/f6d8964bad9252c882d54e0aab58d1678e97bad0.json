They knew they\u2019d be eliminated with the combination of a loss to Washington and a win by the Rays at Toronto.\n\nGerardo Parra had four RBIs to lead the Nationals to their sixth straight win. The Indians have lost three straight, totaling just two runs and seven hits in the last two, and their loss clinched a wild-card berth for Oakland.\n\nWhen Cleveland\u2019s loss closed, Tampa Bay was leading Toronto 5-2 in the eighth.\n\nAsked beforehand whether he\u2019d talked to his players about where things stood, Indians manager Terry Francona replied: \u201cThey can add. They know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nWashington also had reason to keep an eye on the out-of-town scores posted on Nationals Park\u2019s right-field videoboard.\n\nThe Nationals clinched a playoff berth Tuesday and will participate in the NL wild-card game next week. What\u2019s still undecided, though, is who the Nationals\u2019 opponent will be and whether they\u2019ll play at home or on the road: The Milwaukee Brewers began Friday one game behind them in the league\u2019s wild-card standings.\n\nParra broke a 2-all tie for Washington with a sacrifice fly in the sixth off Nick Goody (3-2), and Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera followed with a double that added two more runs. Goody was then replaced by Adam Cimber, who promptly served up Trea Turner\u2019s 19th homer of the year, a two-run shot to left that made it 7-2.\n\nParra also hit two-run double off Zach Plesac in the second, and a solo homer off Dan Otero in the eighth.\n\nThe Indians\u2019 runs came on an RBI double by Ryan Flaherty and a sacrifice fly by Francisco Lindor against Austin Voth (2-1), who went six innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nIndians: 3B Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez was out of the lineup with a sore right hand; he recently returned from being out with a fracture. \u201cHe\u2019s just a little sore. He\u2019s not hurt,\u201d Francona said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was realistic to think that he would be able to play the whole way out.\u201d\n\nNationals: C Kurt Suzuki made his first start since Sept. 5, limited since then to pinch-hitting duty because of a sore right arm. Suzuki played nine innings and went 1 for 3 with a walk and two runs scored.\n\nSCHERZER GOES WILD\n\nThe Nationals don\u2019t know which team they\u2019ll face in the NL wild-card game or where it will be played, but they do know this: Three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer will be their starting pitcher Tuesday night against Milwaukee or St. Louis. Strasburg and Patrick Corbin will be available to pitch in relief.\n\nNATIONALS AWARDS\n\nReliever Sean Doolittle was picked as the winner of Washington\u2019s \u201cGood Guy\u201d award in voting by local media members. Strasburg was chosen as pitcher of the year; 3B Anthony Rendon got player of the year honors.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Corbin (14-7, 3.05 ERA) starts for Washington against Cleveland RHP Adam Plutko (7-4, 4.25).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Cleveland Indians are in danger of sitting out the postseason for the first time since 2015, pushed to the brink of elimination from the AL wild-card race Friday night with an 8-2 loss to the playoff-bound Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/indians_nationals_baseball_17836_c0-147-3521-2199_s1770x1032.jpg?53a69d844bb57c75987d683d24657057fe719781", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
