'He's better and he's going to improve more.\n\nHazard will want to forget his glaring miss, having only missed an open goal on Tuesday night\n\n'The important thing is that he continues to have chances, because he's going to put them in.'\n\nAlthough it was too close for comfort at times, the Madrid boss admitted that he was overall delighted with the result in Istanbul.\n\nToni Kroos scored the only goal to lift Madrid off the bottom of Group A and into second place behind Paris Saint-Germain, who beat Club Brugge 5-0 on the same night.\n\nZidane added: 'I'm delighted for the whole team because there's been a lot of criticism, it's not an easy place to come to and we showed good character.\n\nToni Kroos celebrates with team-mates Marcelo and Hazard after giving Real Madrid the lead\n\n'It's important to win when you play every three days and tonight we were focused right from the off.\n\n'We created a lot of chances after some really good moves and I would have liked to have seen us get a second and even a third because that would have meant that the opposition would have eased off in terms of their pressing.\n\n'At 1-0 they still believed they could level things up right until the end, but we were focused from the first minute until the last.\n\n'We worked hard and were strong and that's what got us the win.'", "description": "Zinedine Zidane has insisted he has no concerns about Eden Hazard after the Belgian missed an open goal against Galatasaray on Tuesday evening.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline", "Pa Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/08/20073028-0-image-a-34_1571816937805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
