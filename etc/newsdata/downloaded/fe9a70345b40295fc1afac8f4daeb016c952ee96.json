And more people than ever \u2014 28.5 million people, or half the freelance workforce \u2014 say it's a long-term plan.\n\nFreelancers who are \"significantly better than average\" at their jobs tend to do well, says Stephane Kasriel, Upwork's CEO. \"Stronger pros can really dictate their terms.\"\n\nGig work apps capitalized on this dream to attract millions to their platforms: Work whenever you want to make some spending money on the side, they promised.\n\nBut for those without a rare or standout skill, reality hasn't quite panned out that way.\n\n\"People turn to this work, but it's not as lucrative as they think it's going to be,\" says Alexandrea Ravenelle, a UNC professor who interviewed dozens of workers for her recent book, \"Hustle and Gig.\"\n\n\"I'm finding a considerable number of workers end up turning to gig work, they think, for the short term \u2014 and they're still doing it 4 years later,\" Ravenelle says. There's no time to network or send out resumes when you're spending every working moment hunting for the next job.\n\nThe bottom line: \"Given that being in the traditional workforce typically comes with benefits and protections, I think most workers would be better off being there rather than having to constantly hustle for the next gig,\" says Ravenelle.", "description": "For some, self-employment is flexible and lucrative.
