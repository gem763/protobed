Last week, far-right political figure and alleged felon Jacob Wohl said, \"If you endorse Elizabeth Warren, you're the b---h.\"\n\nWarren, a Democratic front runner in the presidential race, has been called \"divisive\", \"too-professorial\" and \"hard to love.\" Last week, Wohl called a press conference and handed out a statement alleging that she was a cougar \u2014 a stereotypical caricature of a sex-crazed older woman preying on younger men \u2014 who engaged in BDSM play.\n\nCalling a press conference to present an erotic scenario in order to smear a candidate is a new kind of political tactic, but the underlying misogyny is an enduring American political tradition.\n\nInstead of mocking Warren, Wohl mocked the men who endorse her\n\nIt's easy to dismiss Wohl as simply mocking a powerful older woman for daring to assert her knowledge and power. Members of the kink community know better. Really, he's mocking the men who dare to endorse or admire her.\n\n\"What they're doing is basically calling any male who follows her, votes for her, supports her, a cuckold,\" said Natasha Strange, the co-owner of Sub Rosa, a kink and education space in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn addition to her work as an educator and coach, Strange works as a professional dominatrix. In her eyes, Wohl's tactics are textbook plays on old-as-dirt ideas about gender and power dynamics, with sexual power dynamics in particular used to humiliate Warren and her followers.\n\njacob wohl capitol More\n\nJacob Wohl/Instagram\n\n\"This is about emasculating men,\" said Strange. \"And that if you're a strong man, you would never put up with a dominant woman. Men who are insecure love to feed into that idea that he has to constantly be one-upping the woman, that you have to keep the woman in her place.\"\n\nWohl hits below the belt on purpose. Pitting \"alpha\" men against their fears of being perceived as \"beta\" is his bread and butter.\n\nWohl's tactics call back to a 1993 magazine cover featuring Hillary Clinton in dominatrix gear\n\nWohl is taking a page from one of the dustiest political books out there. In 1993, Spy magazine edited a photo of Hillary Clinton to put her in dominatrix gear, not only to mock her for daring to assert herself in the role of First Lady, but to bust Bill Clinton for not being man enough to keep her in her place.\n\n\"Sex smears are as old as politics, they prey on sexual fears, taboos, and inhibitions,\" said author and sexologist Gloria Brame, PhD. \"The more sensational the claim, the more knee-jerk negativity you can elicit from your target group. In this case, they were specifically playing to misogynists (male and female alike).\"\n\nWarren is being painted into a caricature of a dominant woman \u2014 cruel, a man-hater, and a sadist. Wohl alleged she even used a whip to leave scars on the man who accused her having violent kinky sex with him.\n\n\"They likely targeted cougar and BDSM in specific hopes of appealing to the social tropes that Grandma-aged ladies are only normal if they're sweet asexuals who bake cookies for their grandchildren,\" said Brame.\n\nCalling her a cougar also appeals to those who think older women with fire and ambition should be content to live out their days out of the spotlight.\n\n\"In pop culture, a woman with any kind of kink or sexual quirk is the butt of the joke,\" said Strange. \"And if an older woman loves sex and has nonstandard desires, oh my God, it is the comedy trifecta.\"\n\nBut if it's the man who admires her, he's the punchline.\n\nNOW WATCH: This Disney hotel serves adorable character-themed dim sum", "description": "Far-right figure Jacob Wohl recently held a press conference to accuse presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren of being a cougar who engages in BDSM.", "authors": ["Lindsay Goldwert"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZIt.Z.zCLeTtzOd7chYNRA--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/7e6907e9e2f63c7b05d85fc77b0a1fc5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
