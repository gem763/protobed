The announcement alleviated fears that travelers would be unable to leave their hotels until payment was settled.\n\nOn Saturday, some British tourists described being stopped from checking out of their hotel in Tunisia over concerns the hotel might not be paid.\n\nThe effects of the collapse will ripple out far from Britain, the headquarters of Thomas Cook. In Greece, where 50,000 vacationers are expected to be repatriated to their home countries in the coming days, there are fears about the effect of the company\u2019s collapse on the local economy.\n\nMichalis Vlatakis, the head of Crete\u2019s union of tour operators, described the developments as a \u201c7-magnitude earthquake,\u201d adding that the local tourism sector was now \u201cwaiting for the tsunami.\u201d\n\nAbout 70 percent of tour operators on Crete have contracts with Thomas Cook, he said, adding that so far this year the British company brought 400,000 visitors to the island, and other islands that are even more reliant on tourism.\n\nThomas Cook was struggling with debts approaching 2 billion pounds, or nearly $2.5 billion, forcing it to enter negotiations with shareholders and creditors that came at least \u00a3200 million short of what was needed to keep the company running. With no other choice, Thomas Cook ceased operations.\n\n", "description": "The liquidation of the world\u2019s oldest travel company has set in motion what was being described as the biggest peacetime repatriation in British history.", "authors": ["Michael Wolgelenter"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/world/23thomascook-1/23thomascook-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
