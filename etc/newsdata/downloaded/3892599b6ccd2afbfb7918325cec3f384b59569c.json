The people who run British architecture seem to think so.\n\nA council estate in Norwich has become the first development completely made up of social housing to be awarded this year\u2019s prestigious Royal Institute Of British Architects' Stirling Prize for the UK\u2019s best building.\n\nIn a move which the leading architectural body in the country hopes will herald a renaissance for social housing, and go towards helping solve the housing crisis, the Goldsmith Street estate was hailed by the judges as a \u201cmodest masterpiece\u201d.\n\nInstead of a cutting-edge glass and steel tower the judges chose a high density housing development incorporating the latest environmental design techniques to minimise its carbon footprint.\n\nThese include each of the two storey houses and apartment blocks facing south to maximise solar gain, every wall built over 600mm thick, and the roofs angled at 15 degrees to ensure each terrace does not block sunlight from homes in the street behind.\n\nEven the smallest details have been considered with the environment in mind. Letterboxes are built into external porches rather than the front doors, to reduce draughts, while perforated aluminium \u2018brise-soleils\u2019 provide shade from the sun above windows and doors.", "description": "Could this be the moment council housing became fashionable again?", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Senior News Reporter", "Howard Riddle", "Philip Johnston", "Iain Duncan Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212395272-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
