Dylan believes his knowledge and experience of rowing in open water helped him build a solid foundation for both forms of the sport.\n\nDylan (far left) started rowing in 2015, and he learned open water techniques.

Not many people can endure the long outdoor races, or commit to early morning practices.\n\n\u201cThe initial skills for rowing are very simple, so the sport is quite easy to pick up. But if you want to go far, it requires a lot of effort and mental strength. The amount of training matters a lot,\u201d says Dylan, who trains six days a week.\n\nThe German Swiss International School student notes that without his teammates, who serve as his support system, he probably wouldn\u2019t have kept up with the sport.\n\n\u201cRowing is such a team thing, it is where I\u2019ve found some of my best friends,\u201d he says.\n\nHK Sports Institute professional athletes prove hard work leads to more than success - it can bring happiness\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere in the team is so supportive and enjoyable that makes me want to attend practice every day.\u201d\n\nThe teen rower still clearly remembers that on his first day with the junior team, he was met with rough weather conditions, such as a tailwind (wind blowing from behind) and large waves.\n\nFour kilometres into his 16km practice piece, Dylan embarrassed himself in front of the new coach and the whole team by capsizing his boat.\n\nThe coach still asked him to row to the finish line. That rough first day still serves as a reminder that he must stay the distance no matter what.\n\nMulti-sport athlete Alyssa Ho of King George V School can beat you at squash. And hockey. And probably long-distance running too\n\n\u201cThat was probably the worst time I ever had while rowing, but it really helped me in the future, because I knew that even if the conditions were so bad, I could still push through,\u201d he said.\n\nWith his tenacious spirit and optimistic personality, Dylan has proven to be an asset to the team.\n\nLast year, he helped the team win a bronze medal in the Junior Men\u2019s Four event at the 2018 Asian Rowing Junior Championships held in Korea.\n\nHe will have another chance to shine in December, when he\u2019ll pair up with a teammate to strive for a gold medal in the Junior Men\u2019s Pair event.\n\nSuper typhoon Mangkhut derailed his training, but HK teen rower Wong Wai-chun can't wait for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games\n\nSpeaking of his partner, Dylan says that, given the difference in their physique, he thought rowing with him might not work out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tall and skinny, while my partner is short and stocky, I\u2019m not sure why our coach stuck with us,\u201d he says, with a laugh.\n\nAfter adjusting their rowing styles, though, the unlikely pair has emerged as the team\u2019s gold medal hope. \u201cIt was really tough in the first month, but we got through it. I had to shorten my stroke a bit, and he had to lengthen his \u2013 but we matched up eventually.\u201d\n\nAlthough Dylan is spending more time training in flat water, he admits the thrill of competing in and watching coastal rowing races cannot be beat.\n\nNational Youth Games karate champion has found the perfect recipe for the winning edge\n\nThe Year 12 student will have a chance to watch and learn from the best from around the world soon, as the World Coastal Rowing Championship is set to take place in Hong Kong next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too young to take part in the race this year, but I will definitely be watching,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere may be some Olympians from the Hong Kong team racing, too. I\u2019m really hoping they will do well.\u201d", "description": "Serious rowers usually only focus on fine rowing, but Dylan Robinson of German Swiss International School learned open water techniques as well.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/5846211a-ea4b-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires113838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
