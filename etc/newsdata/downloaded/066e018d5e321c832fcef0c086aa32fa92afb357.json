I only say that because I just want people to know the story is completely different. We have a completely different premise for the story. The characters are all different. There are a few similarities. There is a freak. There is a castle. There is a character named Rebecca and there\u2019s a character named John, but who they are and their relationship is completely different, and we have a whole new cast of characters.\n\nZombieland 2: Double Tap\n\nSpeaking with Fandango, director Ruben Fleischer revealed the film\u2019s zombies can be divided into four categories: Homers, Ninjas, Hawkings and the newly-evolved T-800s.\n\nI think our heroes are a little complacent because the zombies don\u2019t present much of a challenge anymore. They\u2019ve started to categorise them into different groups. There\u2019s ones that they call Homers, who are kind of the dumber zombies. There are the Ninjas who are a little bit more crafty and they might sneak up on you. And then there\u2019s the Hawkings, who are smarter zombies. There\u2019s a new kind of zombie that they haven\u2019t met before called a T-800, a name for the infamous Terminator. These T-800s are much more dangerous, threatening form of zombie. For the first time, I think our heroes feel like they\u2019re in true jeopardy because of this newly evolved form of zombie.\n\nElsewhere, Bloody-Disgusting has a gallery of character posters. Click through to see the rest.\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths\n\nIn an article discussing Michael Rosenbaum\u2019s reticence to reprise his role as Lex Luthor for Crisis on Infinite Earths, Deadline reports Lynda Carter may \u201creturn as some version of Wonder Woman\u201d instead of her Supergirl character, former president Olivia Marsdin.\n\nKaty Keene\n\nDeadline also reports Broadway performer Daphne Rubin-Vega has joined the cast of the CW\u2019s musical Riverdale spinoff as Luisa, a former Rockette and \u201cdoting mother\u201d of Katy\u2019s roommate, Jorge/Ginger, who now owns a bodega in Washington Heights.\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nIn conversation with Variety, Jeffrey Dean Morgan stated he believes The Walking Dead has \u201canother three years\u201d of material before it\u2019s \u201crun into the ground.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to run it into the ground. Me personally, I\u2019d say let\u2019s go out on top. Let\u2019s go out still being the number one show in the world. Whether or not that happens, I don\u2019t know. I think if we just stuck with the comic book, we\u2019ve still got another three years. We do deviate a lot, but I think there\u2019s probably a good three years of material there.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man\n\nThe Superior Spider-Man meets Venom in the synopsis for his October 14 episode, \u201cSuperior\u201d.\n\nSuperior Spider-Man must face his most challenging opponent yet when Venom escapes from stasis and attacks Midtown High.\n\n[Spoiler TV]\n\nNancy Drew\n\nThree short trailers for the CW\u2019s Nancy Drew highlight its spooky tone.\n\nAmerican Horror Story: 1984\n\nFinally, Ray appears to be grievously wounded after falling into a punji trap in the trailer for \u201cSlashdance\u201d, next week\u2019s episode of American Horror Story: 1984.", "description": "Production has wrapped on the Quiet Place sequel.
