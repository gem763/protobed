It said the plans could amount to the mass collection of data on a \u201csignificant scale\u201d, with information being automatically mined rather than gathered for specific, suspicious cases.\n\nThe watchdog said such a massive collection of data could \u201csignificantly change individuals\u2019 behaviour online, where they might not feel able to express themselves freely on the platforms in question\u201d.\n\nThe French government has suggested the trial would only run for three years.\n\nHMRC already has a similar computer system allowing it to collect and use information from social media to identify potential tax fraud.", "description": "Scheme would allow authorities to collect personal data on a massive scale, says watchdog", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb0e04ec937b8c29eeb0e196bde2280a45ed43d/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e444818c0f5a4e6bf2163ffa7f4c073", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
