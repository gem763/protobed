Some passengers were transported from the airport in an ambulance, but others left with the assistance of residents, including families who planned to host the visiting swimmers, Paulin said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the airplane entered the water. The plane appeared to have been forced beyond its planned landing area by high winds the community has been experiencing recently, Paulin said.\n\nThe Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities said in a statement that the Unalaska and Dutch Harbor Airport has been closed and transportation department airport rescue and fire personnel have responded to the scene.\n\nThe plane was carrying members of a high school swimming team from Cordova, City Manager Erin Reinders said. She said she is also the local swim coach and was at the airport waiting to greet the team from Cordova.\n\nA statement posted on the Cordova School District's website said the flight carrying swimmers and their chaperones experienced difficulty stopping on the airport runway.\n\n\"At present, all students and chaperones are accounted for and are OK, albeit a bit shaken up,\" said the statement by Cordova Superintendent Alex Russin.\n\nRussin said he spoke with Unalaska City School District Superintendent John P. Conwell, who assured him the students were safe.\n\n\"I spoke again with Superintendent Conwell who stated that the team was together, seemed fine, and were eating pizza. Mr. Conwell assured me repeatedly that the students would be well looked after and taken care of,\" Russin said.\n\nUnalaska is about 825 miles (1,328 kilometers) west of Anchorage in Dutch Harbor, one of the nation's busiest fishing ports.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Brian Hannon contributed to this report.", "description": "A commuter airplane has crashed near the airport in a small Alaska community on the Bering Sea.
