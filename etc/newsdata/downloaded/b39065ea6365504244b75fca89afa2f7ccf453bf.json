Someone is going to die tonight. One of you lot is going to die.\u201d\n\nHe took it to the streets of Castle Cary, a small market town in Somerset, before going to his girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\nArmed police officers surrounded the property at 2.45am on January 23, following 999 calls from members of the public.\n\nBody-worn video footage shows two officers, known only as IC and IX, making their way towards the front door.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA police helicopter can be heard overhead as IC and IX shine lights on the end-of-terrace house on Park Street.\n\nOne says \u201cWindow, movement\u201d before they shout \u201cArmed police, armed police, put your hands up to the window now\u201d.\n\nShots are then heard, with video showing one of the officers shooting back towards the window and shouting \u201cshots fired\u201d.\n\nHannam is on trial at Bristol Crown Court, where he denies two charges of attempting to murder a police officer, relating to IC and IX.\n\nThe prosecution case was opened on Tuesday by David Scutt, with jurors visiting Castle Cary on Wednesday.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Scutt told them: \u201cRealising he was surrounded and desperate, he deliberately fired at armed police officers intending to kill them as they tried to gain entry to that house.\n\n\u201cThey were at the front door of the house and the defendant went to the front bedroom. \u201cHe opened that window and he fired down onto the officers outside.\u201d\n\nThe jury was played bodycam footage of IX and IC twice approaching the front door\u201d In the footage, the officers shout \u201carmed police\u201d and \u201cput that down now\u201d before \u201cshots fired\u201d and \u201cget back, get back\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOne of the officers shouts: \u201cYes I fired\u201d.
