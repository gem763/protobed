Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, have been married for more than 73 years \u2014 26,766 days to be exact. That\u2019s more than the previous record holders, George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush, who were married for 73 years and 102 days until Barbara\u2019s 2018 death.\n\nCongratulations to Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter. They are now the longest married presidential couple and still going strong at 26,765 days! pic.twitter.com/nbdRYk932J \u2014 The Carter Center (@CarterCenter) October 17, 2019\n\nThey have been married for longer than more than half of all the U.S. presidents were alive. Twenty-five presidents had shorter life spans; plus, two living presidents \u2014 Barack Obama and Bill Clinton \u2014 have yet to reach that mile marker. (George W. Bush was born the day before the Carters married.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Carters married in 1946, when he was 21 and she was 18. But they have known each other for as long as Rosalynn has been alive; she lived down the road in their hometown of Plains, Ga., and was a frequent playmate of Carter\u2019s little sister Ruth.\n\nIn his book \u201cA Full Life: Reflections at Ninety,\u201d Carter said he learned later that Rosalynn had a crush on him for a long time and that she and Ruth had conspired for years to try to get him to notice her.\n\nDuring a month-long leave from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1945, Carter spent most of his time at home with another young woman, a beauty pageant winner. On his last night of leave, she was busy. Carter was driving around town with his sister and her boyfriend when they spotted Rosalynn coming out of church. She agreed to go to the movies with him.\n\n\u201cShe was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussion on the rumble seat of the Ford Coupe,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe next morning, Carter\u2019s mother asked him what he thought of Rosalynn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the one I\u2019m going to marry,\u201d he replied, surprising even himself.\n\nThey dated over his Christmas break. When she visited him in Annapolis for Presidents\u2019 Day, he proposed.\n\nShe said no.\n\nRosalynn later explained in a letter that, six years earlier, she had promised her father on his deathbed that she wouldn\u2019t marry until she finished college. At that point, she was a student in junior college but had yet to graduate. She continued to date young men at her school.\n\n\u201cI was distressed,\u201d Carter wrote. He kept writing to her and calling her, letting her know that he was serious. By summertime, she had finished junior college, he had graduated from the Naval Academy, and they married on July 7, 1946. They moved into an apartment together in Norfolk, where Carter was stationed.\n\nAD\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn, 92, fought Jimmy\u2019s brain cancer together in their hometown of Plains. As The Washington Post\u2019s Kevin Sullivan and Mary Jordan wrote last year, they still hold hands when walking down the street. He affectionately calls her \u201ckid.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAD", "description": "The Carters married in 1946, when he was 21, and she was only 18.", "authors": ["Gillian Brockell", "Staff Writer For Retropolis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mJeUXs6-F0IIJbetAZ7j0Im8Fhg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U6KGAL6YT5DBJGFBQXOUILLYIQ.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
