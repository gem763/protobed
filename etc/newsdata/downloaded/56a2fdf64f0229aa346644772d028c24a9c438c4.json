I just think that we need to stay on the right path to make it work,\u201d Rodman told Reuters on Monday. \u201cSo, I think that people should not give up on the U.S. trying to engage with North Korea in a good, safe manner.\"\n\nDenuclearization talks between the two nations have stalled, and North Korea again embarked on so-called missile diplomacy Tuesday by firing two unidentified projectiles into the East Sea -- the country's eighth weapons test since July. North Korea has demanded that the U.S. lift crippling economic sanctions in order to move forward and possibly dismantle its nuclear program.\n\nThis is not the first time Rodman, 58, has weighed in on the North Korea issue. The onetime Chicago Bull has called Kim his \u201cbest friend.\u201d Kim is said to be a big fan of the Bulls, and of Rodman, who first visited North Korea as a private citizen in 2013 and met Kim. During one of his trips to North Korea, Rodman organized a basketball game and famously sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Kim.\n\nRodman has said his \u201cbasketball diplomacy\u201d could help ease tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, and he sent a letter to President Trump offering to help after the second Trump-Kim summit collapsed with no deal in February.\n\nNORTH KOREA FOLLOWS TALK OF RESTARTING NUKE TALKS BY FIRING OFF 2 PROJECTILES\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said over the weekend, before the latest North Korea launches, that the U.S. \"was hopeful that in the coming days or perhaps weeks we'll be back at the negotiating table with them.\"\n\n\u201cI think Kim Jong Un wants peace,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cI know him very well, I think he wants peace.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea had said Monday it was open to another round of talks with the U.S. later this month, according to state-run media.\n\nNORTH KOREA WILLING TO HOLD DENUCLEARIZATION TAKLS WITH US IN COMING WEEKS, STATE MEDIA SAYS\n\nRodman, who appeared on the Trump-hosted reality show \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d in 2009 and was fired, also said this week that Trump had him on the show \u201cto help and guide me \u2026 because I was out there being buck wild, doing my thing, having a good time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his way of showing that he cares about me,\u201d Rodman said of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Nicole Darrah and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.", "description": "Former NBA\u00a0star Dennis Rodman\u00a0thinks President Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un can still make a deal to have peace on the Korean Peninsula.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/31213_rodman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
