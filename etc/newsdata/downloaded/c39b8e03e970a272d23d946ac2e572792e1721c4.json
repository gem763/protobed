He's happy there.\"\n\nTech3 team boss Herve Poncharal - though not present at the meeting - backs up Leitner's claims that Oliveira was asked to replace Zarco in '20 and opted against a move.\n\nKTM explains why Oliveira didn\u2019t get promotion More\n\nPoncharal added: \"I have been told - I was not at that meeting - that in Misano factory KTM [management], which was Mike Leitner and Pit Beirer, had a meeting with Miguel Oliveira and asked him 'in case we have to take somebody to replace Johann Zarco, would you be ready to come?'\"\n\n\"They told me that Miguel confirmed in Misano that he said if I've got the same technical treatment, I'd like to stay with Tech3.\n\n\"This is his own choice. Next year KTM has made a point that everybody will have the same machinery with the same evolution and the same specification.\n\n\"So at the end of the day this is more a human environment than anything else, and Miguel feels [good in] the team.\n\n\"Miguel has a lot of trust with Guy Coulon - his crew chief. So, for me this was a clean and clear decision, but believe me Red Bull KTM is 200 percent behind Miguel.\n\n\"They like him, they trust him. He's been with them since Moto3, Moto2 and there is no reason to do something that would hurt Miguel's career, absolutely not.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "KTM boss Mike Leitner says Miguel Oliveira was offered Johann Zarco's vacant factory MotoGP seat for 2020, but was \"very clear\" in his decision to remain with Tech3", "authors": ["Lewis Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2gnHWMIupp67O3sgJMZPsg--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/b9f9c1d2c077d453f2bd7312e0b266e5", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
