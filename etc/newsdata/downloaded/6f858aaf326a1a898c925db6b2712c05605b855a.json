Those efforts may help Fisher maintain its asset base, which stood at $114 billion this week and is concentrated among high net worth individuals.\n\nBut holding on to high-profile pension and fund contracts may now prove difficult. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the Texas Employees Retirement System said after a due diligence review sparked by Fisher's comments it is withdrawing $350 million from Fisher, citing \"our fiduciary duty.\"\n\nThe money is being redistributed within a portfolio of stocks, said spokeswoman Mary Jane Wardlow.\n\nIn addition, a securities filing on Friday by Goldman Sachs states Fisher's asset management unit will no longer be a subadviser to the $600 million Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund , effective on or around Oct. 31.\n\nA Goldman Sachs spokesman did not comment on how much Fisher manages for the fund or give a reason for the change. Fisher was among 10 outside managers listed by the fund in a company disclosure as of March. Fisher managed $234 million for the fund, according to a source close to the matter.\n\nFisher did not comment on the moves, which bring to more than $3 billion the total withdrawn after comments Fisher made at an investor conference this month. Others that dropped his firm include Fidelity Investments and pension managers in Michigan and Iowa.\n\nAccording to a conference attendee, Fisher made derogatory remarks about genitalia and picking up girls among other topics.\n\nAfter a public backlash, Fisher apologized in a memo to his firm's employees, and to the public.\n\n\"Some of the words and phrases I used during a recent conference to make certain points were clearly wrong and I shouldn\u2019t have made them. I realize this kind of language has no place in our company or industry. I sincerely apologize,\" Fisher said in a statement sent by a representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by David Gregorio and Nick Zieminski)", "description": "A Texas retirement system and Goldman Sachs Group Inc pulled a combined $584 million from Fisher Investments on Friday, after allegations that firm founder Ken Fisher made sexist comments at a conference.
