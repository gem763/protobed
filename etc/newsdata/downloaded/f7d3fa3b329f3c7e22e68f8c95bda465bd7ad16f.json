Last Saturday, far-right thugs at a demonstration in Westminster lunged at remainer and leftwing activists as they chanted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lamppost just for you\u201d and, \u201cWe love you, Boris\u201d. The jailed fraudster and thug Tommy Robinson has declared, \u201cWe back Boris\u201d, commending him for taking on Tory rebels and Labour \u201ctraitors\u201d, while one of his key allies has promoted a video clip featuring Johnson with his thumbs up, captioned \u201cThe people\u2019s prime minister\u201d and \u201cParliament vs the People\u201d, and accompanied by a football stadium-style chant of \u201cBoris for England!\u201d\n\nNigel Farage won't be allowed anywhere near government, say Tories Read more\n\nWhile Margaret Thatcher whipped up fears of Britain being \u201crather swamped by people with a different culture\u201d, and held out the \u201cprospect of an end to immigration\u201d, the National Front \u2013 the dominant far-right movement of the time \u2013 never saw her as one of its own. If Johnson is privately concerned about becoming the pin-up for a resurgent far right, he has shown no signs of it. Instead, he and his co-prime minister, Dominic Cummings, casually play with matches, even though they know that Britain is a tinderbox.\n\nThe far right \u201csee themselves as the shock troops of Brexit now,\u201d as Hope Not Hate\u2019s Matthew McGregor puts it. That self-perception must be challenged: when media outlets describe these thuggish extremists as \u201cpro-Brexit activists\u201d, they not only insult millions of leave voters who abhor their perverse ideology, they also confer a legitimacy the far right otherwise lacks. Just as the Eurosceptic Tory right saw Brexit as something bigger than reconfiguring Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU \u2013 a blunt instrument in a cultural counter-revolution \u2013 the far right also spot an opportunity. For Robinson and his supporters, the goal is nothing less than driving out of public life those they regard as \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2013 including anyone espousing any sort of progressive politics.\n\nHe and his co-prime minister Dominic Cummings casually play with matches, even though they know that Britain is a tinderbox.\n\nOutside a Brexit party rally in Kensington, west London, on the eve of the European elections, an angry crowd shouted that Nigel Farage\u2019s movement would remain \u201cuntil you\u2019ve gone away \u2026 the Guardian class, the whole political class\u201d. When Saturday\u2019s far-right mob plotted to charge a leftwing rally, this grand purge of \u201ctraitors\u201d \u2013 through thuggery and intimidation \u2013 was what they had in mind. The murder of Jo Cox by a far-right terrorist, who later bellowed, \u201cDeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d, should have led to a national reckoning; instead it was followed by three years of media outlets screeching about \u201csaboteurs\u201d needing to be crushed and \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. Those responsible aren\u2019t naive. They understood the political consequences \u2013 specifically, fuelling and providing legitimacy for far-right extremists \u2013 but they simply did not care.\n\nJohnson and his entourage know that there is an emboldened far-right movement who are, in McGregor\u2019s words, \u201cencouraged by the language of betrayal\u201d. The \u201cstab in the back\u201d narrative \u2013 blaming the failure of a grand national project on domestic subversion and treachery \u2013 has always underpinned the far right, and Theresa May\u2019s failed promises of \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d and Brexit by 29 March have only fuelled them.\n\nIf the Tory Brexiters are the \u201csuits\u201d doing the work in parliament, the far right see themselves as the \u201cboots\u201d on the streets: the self-appointed enforcers of an endangered national-conservative revolution. The boots have now swung behind what was supposed to be Britain\u2019s mainstream centre-right party.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson: \u2018Does the sight of tanked-up far right thugs chanting your name in central London not give you pause for thought?\u2019 Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nThis development should be an alarming warning for Johnson and Cummings. When you assail opponents for backing a \u201csurrender bill\u201d or denounce them as \u201ccollaborators\u201d, as Johnson has done; when you paint a picture, in primary colours, of \u201cparliament versus the people\u201d \u2013 as though a den of traitors is at war with the populace \u2013 are you really oblivious to the consequences? Does the sight of tanked-up thugs chanting your name in central London not give you pause for thought? A far-right street movement is real, serious and determined, and our rulers cannot dismiss it as irrelevant. Already, individuals with public platforms who hold unapologetic progressive opinions know that to express them is to put themselves and their loved ones at risk.\n\nThe danger is that recent events foreshadow something much uglier. In the last election, Labour members were demonised as terrorist supporters and Britain-haters \u2013 tropes embraced by the far right. This time, the boots on the street are stronger, the political context more vicious and defined by increasingly irreconcilable divisions. In such a setting, what will an even uglier campaign waged by the Tories and their media outriders mean? Even before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team was surrounded by far-right activists \u2013 yelling \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cWe love you, Boris, we do\u201d \u2013 in Salford last week, members of his operation fretted about the rising security threat.\n\nTo be blunt, it is likely that more people will be hurt. When that happens, we can expect Donald Trump-style talk of \u201cboth sides\u201d \u2013 and \u201cwhat about the left and their own inflammatory rhetoric?\u201d Toxic attempts to muddy the waters are belied by the facts: leftists have not sought to hurt, let alone kill, Conservative activists or MPs, while a global far-right movement has slaughtered socialists, Muslims, black people and Jews, from Norway to Yorkshire. The far right can only ever be defeated by a non-violent protest movement \u2013 but their enablers must be confronted, too.\n\nTo repeat for the benefit of our prime minister: a thuggish far right is real and dangerous, they treat you as their pin-up and they are emboldened by your rhetoric. You will be held accountable for whatever they do from here on in.\n\n\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The prime minister has become a pin-up for thuggish extremists and he doesn\u2019t care about the consequences, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones", "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42090cca69a46d29e07727720db85207eaa81757/0_263_3859_2316/master/3859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=53312eaeaac9818585010a6e66f3b495", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
