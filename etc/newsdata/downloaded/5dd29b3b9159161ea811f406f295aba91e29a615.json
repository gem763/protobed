Colgan also said US companies would face \"a host of practical challenges\" to operate in Syria.\n\nEven getting Exxon or another major oil company to develop Syrian oil would be a \"hard sell\" given its relatively limited infrastructure and small output, said Ellen R. Wald, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center.\n\nSyria produced around 380,000 barrels of oil per day before the country's civil war erupted. An International Monetary Fund working paper in 2016 estimated that production had declined to just 40,000 barrels per day.\n\nStill, the United States should be concerned about the fate of the Syrian oil fields, said Alex Cranberg, chairman of energy firm Aspect Holdings LLC, which has explored production in Iraqi Kurdistan but no longer has active projects in the region.\n\n\"It's not that the oil itself matters much to the US, but that its misuse could fund future problems for us\" if it falls into the wrong hands, Cranberg said, noting his company has not been approached by the White House.\n\n\"US control over the disposition of the fields and the hard currency they offer would provide a significant influence over the shape of Syria's future,\" he said.\n\nRobert O'Brien, a US National Security advisor to the president, said a US military presence will be required to protect the Syrian oilfields, suggesting it also should have a say on their proceeds.\n\n\"We're going to be there for a period of time to maintain control of those and make sure that there is not a resurgence of ISIS and make sure that the Kurds have some revenue from those oil fields,\" Mr O'Brien said, speaking to NBC News' Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [NEW YORK] US President Donald Trump's suggestion on Sunday that Exxon Mobil or another US oil company operate Syrian oil fields drew rebukes from legal and energy experts. .
