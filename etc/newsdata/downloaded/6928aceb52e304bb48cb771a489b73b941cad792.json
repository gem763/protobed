While some people consider sugar relationships a form of sex work, it\u2019s a label rejected by sugar dating sites and some members themselves. Regardless, prostitution is a dangerous and illegal activity. This story is part of a series on the financial side of relationships, and you can read other entries in the series here.\n\nSix months ago, I decided to become a sugar baby.\n\nMy reasoning was simple. I\u2019d grown frustrated with dating men in my city \u2013 maybe I\u2019d just had one too many Tinder dates end in mediocre conversation. My day job offers me control over my schedule, since I don\u2019t work a traditional nine-to-five. I wanted to supplement my income and have some fun doing it, so I decided to try finding a sugar daddy.\n\nFor the uninitiated, \u201csugaring\u201d is a form of dating in which one partner financially supports the other, often in the form of cash or gifts. As a woman in a major city with an appreciation for societal deviance, I figured the lifestyle might suit me well.\n\nWhether it was exhaustion of millennial swiping, or maybe the thrill of experiencing life outside my usual means, I found myself creating a profile on the primary website for sugaring connections, SeekingArrangement.\n\nRelated: My divorce cost me $17,695 \u2013 these were the most surprising expenses I faced\n\nIn the half-year since then, I\u2019ve met some highly interesting people \u2013 not to mention I\u2019ve received thousands of dollars in cash, trips across the country, access to five-star hotels and restaurants, and expensive gifts like shoes and clothing I never could have ordinarily afforded.\n\nRead on for a firsthand look at what it\u2019s really like to be a sugar baby.\n\nBefore I found my first sugar daddy, I needed an idea of why I was sugaring\n\nsource Syda Productions/Shutterstock\n\nAs with regular dating, if you dive into the sugaring lifestyle without an idea of what you want, you\u2019re likely to be disappointed.\n\nDo you want a cash allowance, and do you have a set amount in mind? Is it certain bills you want covered? Do you want gifts, shopping, and travel? Having a clear idea of what kind of \u201csugar,\u201d or exchange, you want for the relationship is key.\n\nHow about the actual dating part \u2013 do you like dating older men? Because sugar daddies tend to be older than the women they date. How much time do you want to spend with your sugar daddy? And does your current lifestyle give you the freedom to do so?\n\nIn my short time as a sugar baby so far, men have paid me $500 a date and bought me designer clothes, $400 dinners, and stays at 5-star hotels I could never afford on my own\n\nIn the six months since I became a sugar baby, I\u2019ve started relationships with men who pay me $500 a date and have purchased me shoes and outfits from designers I could never afford on my own. I dined at restaurants where the bill was $400, and we\u2019d still leave hungry. I spent weekends tucked away in five-star hotels, lazily ordering room service with cringeworthy markups.\n\nWhile I enjoy expensive dinners and staying in fancy hotels, ultimately I was searching for a friendly relationship that provides a cash allowance. Some men don\u2019t wish to provide an allowance, and I avoid meeting and dating those men, often called \u201cexperience daddies.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting you should never become a sugar baby just for the money\n\nIf you\u2019re considering sugar dating solely for the money, it will be much more stressful, since it\u2019ll become a second job.\n\nSugar dating amplifies the faults of regular, or \u201cvanilla,\u201d dating. You may receive messages from, go on first dates with, and be ghosted by far more men than in vanilla dating. And it\u2019s a bad idea to depend on sugar as a primary source of income, because there\u2019s never really any guarantee of stability.\n\nAdditionally, financial desperation makes you vulnerable to malicious men who have no intentions to provide sugar, or it might influence you to date men you otherwise wouldn\u2019t consider having a relationship with.\n\nAnonymity is key for sugar babies and sugar daddies \u2014 I created an alter ego just for my online sugaring presence\n\nsource Vivek Prakash/Reuters\n\nIt\u2019s common practice to adopt a sugar identity separate from your real-life identity. My online profile uses a generic name, and I do not disclose my real identity \u2013 even after I meet my sugar daddy in person, in some cases.\n\nI\u2019m glad I do that, since every sugar daddy I\u2019ve met has similarly guarded his identity. I suggest creating an alter ego for anyone considering trying any sort of internet fringe dating, especially sugaring.\n\nAlong the same lines, I signed up for a few anonymous messaging apps, as well as a fake number. Popular messaging apps for \u201cmoving the conversation off the website\u201d include WhatsApp, Kik, Snapchat, WeChat, and Signal, but a phone number is often the preferred method. I suggest getting a Google Voice number attached to an anonymous email account.\n\nThere\u2019s an art to making a sugar-baby profile \u2014 and certain precautions you have to take\n\nsource Marcus Hessenberg/BarcroftImages/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nGetting started with a dating profile as a sugar baby is pretty simple. I described my personality and wrote a few charming epithets that I thought might be appealing to the kind of man I\u2019d like to spend time with.\n\nThe key thing is honesty, both in your self-descriptions and your pictures. While face-altering filters exist and can help mask your identity, apparently it\u2019s a turnoff for men. (And I\u2019ve had men straight-up message me, \u201cThank goodness you don\u2019t have a dog-filter picture!\u201d)\n\nI think the most common misconception about becoming a sugar baby is that sugar daddies are looking to date only 18-year-old blond models. This is largely untrue \u2013 being traditionally attractive certainly helps, but a sugar baby can look like any woman of just about any age. I don\u2019t get discouraged, and I try to attract only men who I think will find me attractive. Being deceptive with appearances will only hurt you later.\n\nThe secrecy of the sugaring lifestyle means I have to be careful about the pictures I use on my dating profiles. Many sugar daddies will run a reverse-image search of sugar babies\u2019 profile pictures in an attempt to avoid scammers who are using photos from models and influencers.\n\nTo protect my identity, I make sure not to use photos that exist anywhere on my social-media accounts. I have a strict \u201cno cross-contamination\u201d rule when it comes to photos. Also, I make sure I know which photos are viewable to the public and which are available by request only. I\u2019ll often check back and remove viewing privileges from certain men if the conversation didn\u2019t lead any further.\n\nI quickly learned some of the lingo that sugar babies and sugar daddies use\n\nsource Richard Levine/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nAfter dipping my toes in the sugaring community, I began to adopt the language used by sugar babies and sugar daddies in the online world.\n\nSugar babies and sugar daddies are often referred to as SBs and SDs \u2013 partly for brevity\u2019s sake and partly because some people are weirded out by saying \u201cbaby\u201d and \u201cdaddy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the \u201cmeet and greet,\u201d or M&G \u2013 the sugaring community\u2019s term for a first date. Usually, money doesn\u2019t change hands here, though it\u2019s not unusual for the sugar baby to receive a small gift. Some of the things I\u2019ve received on my first dates include stuffed animals, books, and $300 cash.\n\nSome relationships are PPM, or \u201cpay per meet\u201d \u2013 in those arrangements, the sugar daddy gives the sugar baby a specified amount per date. In another type of relationship, sugar daddies give an \u201callowance\u201d on a set schedule, like monthly or biweekly, either in cash or through a payment app like Venmo. Many relationships start out PPM, as it\u2019s less risky for the sugar daddy than setting up an allowance right away.\n\n\u201cExperience daddies\u201d are the ones who don\u2019t pay sugar babies in money \u2013 just gifts like fine dining, hotel stays, and glamorous vacations. A \u201cSplenda daddy\u201d is a sugar daddy with a cheaper budget. And a \u201csalt daddy\u201d is just a jerk, especially if they\u2019re faking generosity just to get into your pants.\n\nAnd though the term\u2019s a bit crass, sugar babies have to be wary of what the community calls a \u201cpump and dump\u201d \u2013 the common occurrence of a false sugar daddy not providing any allowance or PPM, getting intimate with a sugar baby, and ghosting. To avoid falling victim to one of these, you should never initiate any intimacy with a sugar daddy unless you\u2019ve already received your sugar.\n\nBefore I meet up with any guy, I iron out the terms of our arrangement\n\nsource Hero Images / Getty Images\n\nTo get what I was looking for out of a sugar relationship, I had to become comfortable bringing it up with men.\n\nThere are plenty of men on the site trying to get laid free, so I learned to not assume they\u2019d provide any financial compensation on their own.\n\nI would bring up the subject before the meet-and-greet. When I first began meeting men off the site, I was pretty timid about even mentioning an allowance \u2013 and regrettably realized they had no intention of sugaring me.\n\nSome people would say on their profiles that they \u201cdon\u2019t want anything transactional,\u201d usually meaning they don\u2019t want to pay for sex or dating \u2013 in fact, the word \u201ctransactional\u201d in a profile is pretty much a red flag that sugar babies avoid at all costs.\n\nA lot of sugar daddies are married, which provides some challenges\n\nsource Pavel Yavnik/Shutterstock\n\nThough there are no age limits for sugar babies and sugar daddies, it\u2019s common for a sugar daddy to be significantly older than the sugar baby.\n\nAnd in many cases, the sugar daddy is married.\n\nHaving an extramarital sugar baby requires some level of discretion. Being recognized in public could cause either of you personal or professional distress, not to mention it could lower your sugaring prospects.\n\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t have a problem dating sugar daddies who were married. After all, they were the ones who contacted me \u2013 and if they are willing to go through the effort of messaging me and agreeing on an arrangement, they\u2019d be willing to do it for someone else.\n\nRelated: 8 things I wish I knew before I got divorced\n\nAll sugar babies have to decide how much of a commitment they want with their sugar daddies\n\nsource Shutterstock\n\nIt\u2019s important to be on the same page about how much of a time commitment you want in your sugaring relationship.\n\nSome sugar daddies want to meet several times a week, while others prefer once a month.\n\nI find myself liking the attention of men who enjoy hearing from me throughout the week but don\u2019t need my attention all day, every day. I certainly can enjoy the company of an older man and don\u2019t have qualms about being seen in public with a sugar daddy. It\u2019s a decision every person needs to make for themselves.\n\nThere are a ton of safety concerns I have to keep in mind as a sugar baby \u2014 as well as scams that fake sugar daddies try to run\n\nOn top of setting up a Google Voice number, there are several other safety precautions I had to take as I got deeper into the sugaring lifestyle.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s always good to let people know where you are when you\u2019re meeting strangers from the internet. I tell all my dates that I have a friend I need to check in with on first dates, and I have never had a negative response to this. Everyone agrees \u2013 safety first.\n\nI also was very careful when accepting Uber rides or Venmo transactions early on in a relationship. Giving away your address or your regular Venmo handle is giving away free information. In an age where our phone apps hold so much personal information, being in control of the flow of your personal information is vital.\n\nWhen I first made my profile, I got an initial flood of messages from men. \u201cHow did they even find me?\u201d I wondered. The answer is that scammers prey on new accounts. I learned to hold the excitement for a bit and I got comfortable recognizing and weeding out the scammy, copy-paste introductions.\n\nAdditionally, I quickly realized that anyone who asks you for your bank information to send you money before you\u2019ve met is a scammer. A common scam involves them sending a check or MoneyGram in excess of your allowance and asking you to purchase a gift card with the excess. This scam works on naive sugar babies who think they\u2019ve received a large gift, when in reality they\u2019ve cashed in on money that their bank will eventually find is fake, while the scammer walks away with a free gift card.\n\nEven after meeting, there are plenty of better methods to send you your allowance. No one needs your personal information to wire to your bank as if it\u2019s the 1990s. As the eternal truth stands \u2013 cash is king.\n\nI don\u2019t consider what I do sex work, but sugar babies have a range of opinions on it\n\nsource Reuters/Claro Cortes IV\n\nLots of sugar babies shudder at the idea of what they do as sex work.\n\nI think of sugaring as an enjoyable deviance with a financial benefit, and while I don\u2019t consider it sex work, I understand why some might.\n\nWhen opening yourself up to fringe dating of any sort, you\u2019ll attract men with varying goals. Some men on SeekingArrangement are looking to spend $200 for a quick romp. Other men will want to provide a monthly allowance and business insight for their dates, have an intimate relationship, and even consider marriage down the line.\n\nI find myself somewhere in the middle. I don\u2019t enjoy one-night stands, and I definitely enjoy indulging in a relationship, but wouldn\u2019t consider something permanent with any of the men I\u2019ve been on sugar dates with.\n\nInterestingly, not all sugar daddies want a sexual or intimate relationship\n\nSome sugar babies will ask about platonic arrangements, being turned off by the idea of intimacy with a sugar daddy.\n\nNot surprisingly, most sugar daddies won\u2019t see the value in financially providing for a sugar baby without intimacy.\n\nThat said, I have actually met two so far, but not because I went looking for such an arrangement. In one case, the man had some qualms about being intimate, so he paid me for an afternoon of tea and board games, and we had a lovely afternoon just not being lonely.\n\nYou don\u2019t find these situations \u2013 they find you.\n\nAnd yes, \u2018sugar mamas\u2019 exist \u2014 but they\u2019re exceedingly hard to find\n\nsource Shutterstock/Dodokat\n\nOften on forums where sugaring is discussed, it\u2019s very common for newer sugar babies to ask for advice from the community. One of the most popular repeated posts are men looking for \u201csugar mamas.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming response is: Women do not need to pay for sex, and therefore, sugar mamas are next to impossible to find.\n\nThat is not to say they don\u2019t exist, but they are the exception, not the rule.\n\nBeing a sugar baby requires a lot of patience \u2014 but it\u2019s worth it\n\nsource Getty Images\n\nAs sugaring becomes more mainstream, the potential to have your time wasted by a Splenda daddy or a scammer increases.\n\nBecoming a sugar baby requires a great deal of patience and willingness to go on bad dates before you find someone you want to pursue a relationship with.\n\nBut it can also be incredibly rewarding and a great deal of fun. I\u2019ve taken multiple flights, received a wide range of allowances and gifts, and met some very interesting people during my short time as a sugar baby.\n\nThe lifestyle may not be for everyone, but it works for me.", "description": "Business Insider - Sugar babies have specific ways to vet sugar daddies and spot scammers online.
