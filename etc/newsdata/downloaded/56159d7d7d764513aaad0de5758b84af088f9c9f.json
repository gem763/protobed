Now he hopes to cement his place in the annals of sporting legends.\n\nTwo years ago, the Kenyan narrowly missed out in his first bid when he finished in two hours and 25 seconds. This time he is adamant he will succeed in a mission that is innovative, controversial and extraordinary in equal measure.\n\nWhat is this all about?\n\nSixty-five years ago, Roger Bannister broke one of the most famous barriers in sport when he became the first to run a mile in less than four minutes. The two-hour marathon holds similar intrigue.\n\nLast year, Eliud Kipchoge smashed the world record in Berlin with 2hr 1min 39sec. It raised the question of whether someone was capable of breaking two hours, but for now the answer remains no \u2013 not legally anyway. This attempt will take place under heavily manufactured conditions, in a time trial rather than a race and it will not count as an official world record. Yet this remains a big deal for Kipchoge \u2013 even with the Olympic titles, world titles and world records he has accumulated \u2013 and his wife and children have travelled to watch him race for the first time ever.", "description": "At around dawn on Saturday, Eliud Kipchoge will begin his quest in Vienna to become the first person to complete a marathon in less than two hours.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212507315-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX0kxSjxoDpjMU82a4enB3fNHnl40VDcetx6YRY4uiw4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
