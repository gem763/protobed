REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nSitting next to each other on a hotel stage in New York at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference, the men brushed away the acrimony of two years ago when Peltz\u2019 Trian Partners was battling P&G over its strategy and asking for a board seat.\n\n\u201cThat was the fog of war,\u201d Peltz said, dismissing the rough comments P&G had made about the veteran activist who works to present himself as a partner who can offer constructive advice rather than a corporate raider intent on breaking up companies.\n\nAfter an incredibly close proxy contest, which could have dragged on for months, Taylor invited Peltz to join the board, which he did in early 2018.\n\nSince then, the men say the have communicated a lot as the company took Trian\u2019s white paper to heart and hired consulting firm McKinsey for additional input on how the consumer products company, whose brands include Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, can move more quickly and nimbly.\n\n\u201cI found that the most important ingredient a CEO needs to have is to be a good listener,\u201d Peltz said, adding: \u201cNobody has a monopoly on good ideas. We have an attitude at Trian, we steal any good idea. We\u2019d rather be rich than right.\u201d\n\nThe partnership is clearly paying off for all shareholders as P&G\u2019s share price has surged 50% since before Peltz joined the board and has gained 32% in 2019 alone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to be right. I have to get the right thing done,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nPeltz joked that he had promised to shave his beard when P&G hit a price of $120 per share and he made good on that Wednesday when he cut it off, with P&G razors, of course.\n\nAs the men bantered, their once bitter fight brought home some parallels to a contest taking shape between AT&T (T.N) and Elliott Management.\n\nInvestors in the audience, including powerful pension funds from Massachusetts and Florida, got a glimpse at how activists and companies can work together, as AT&T undertakes a review of suggestions for a corporate overhaul from Elliott.\n\nElliott has urged AT&T to divest some units, save $5 billion in costs, stop acquiring more companies and review its leadership. While the hedge fund has a number of potential board candidates, it has not disclosed their names and said privately it has no specific number of directors in mind.\n\nRecent academic research has pointed to a growing appetite for settlements between activists and companies.", "description": "Eighteen months after officially burying the hatchet in one of America's most bitter proxy contests, Procter & Gamble Co CEO David Taylor and billionaire investor Nelson Peltz proclaimed their mutual respect on Thursday, underscoring how activists and corporations can end up working collaboratively.", "authors": ["Svea Herbst-Bayliss", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431741588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1YE", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
