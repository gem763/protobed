The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi\u2019s head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Islamic-State-Turncoat-Inside-Baghdadis-Hideout-Critical-To-Success-Of-Raid-Officials-Say"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
