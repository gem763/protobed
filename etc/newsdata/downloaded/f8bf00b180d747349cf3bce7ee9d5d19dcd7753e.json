(AP) - Allen Lazard wasn\u2019t even on the Packers\u2019 initial 53-man roster.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 receiver was cut before the season, signed to the practice squad, only to end up on the roster in short order.\n\nBut on Monday night, Green Bay needed Lazard, and the undrafted second-year pro delivered with a career-high four catches for a career-best 65 yards and his first career touchdown in a 23-22 win over Detroit.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously an awesome moment, getting my first touchdown, especially here in Lambeau,\u201d Lazard said. \u201cJust kind of fulfilling the journey of being able to be here with this amazing organization. To catch a touchdown in a critical moment is something huge and something that, as a kid, you grow up dreaming about. It feels great to fulfill it.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nMatt LaFleur and Aaron Rodgers. The Packers are 5-1 and in sole possession of first place in the NFC North, and yes, their defense is a big part of that. But all the noise surrounding the relationship between the 39-year-old first-year coach and the 35-year-old Super Bowl-winning quarterback has been drowned out by the franchise\u2019s best start since 2015 and best start in the division (3-0) since 2012.\n\nIn order for Green Bay to have success this season, LaFleur and Rodgers were going to have to learn to trust one another. They have. Rodgers has trusted LaFleur\u2019s playcalls. Even when they didn\u2019t work. And it was LaFleur and his staff who trusted Rodgers on Monday night when Rodgers lobbied for Lazard, the sixth receiver in the Packers\u2019 six-man receiving group, to get in the game.\n\n\u201cI may have put in a good word there in the fourth quarter to get him some opportunities,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nRodgers said he went to wide receivers coach Alvis Whitted and asked \u201cif 13 could come in for a little bit.\u201d\n\nLazard had never caught a pass in a regular-season game from Rodgers before Monday.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOT WORKING\n\nA win\u2019s a win. But the Packers offense is still struggling. Green Bay was 4-for-12 on third down and 1-for-4 in the red zone on Monday. LaFleur said Tuesday that he and his staff also counted six dropped passes against the Lions, including the dropped touchdowns by Aaron Jones and Jimmy Graham.\n\n\u201cThere certainly were some drops out there that our guys would like to have back,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cAaron (Rodgers) is so consistent, and that\u2019s why he is who he is. And any time you have a quarterback like that, you always believe that you can come back and win a football game and I think our guys believe that as well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to ask Rodgers to keep bailing out his teammates. They have to help him out by grabbing the catchable passes.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLazard. With Rodgers\u2019 top target Davante Adams sidelined indefinitely with turf toe, Geronimo Allison leaving Monday\u2019s game with a concussion and rookie Darrius Shepherd\u2019s stock falling (see below), Lazard\u2019s stock has never been higher. He has the trust of Rodgers and that goes a long way and will likely result in more targets.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nShepherd. Everyone has bad games. Everyone doesn\u2019t have bad games on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d as an undrafted rookie. Shepherd fumbled a punt return and had a pass from Rodgers bounce off his hands and facemask near the goal line and land in the hands of a Lions defender. Luckily for Shepherd, both plays only resulted in field goals and he seems to still have the backing of his head coach.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough night, but he continued to battle and he\u2019s going to have to put it behind him,\u201d LaFleur said of Shepherd. \u201cI know that I certainly still trust him. But it was a rough night and he\u2019s just going to have to bounce back and we\u2019re going to support him. We\u2019re just fortunate to come out on top.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nIf Allison (chest, concussion) and Adams (toe) can\u2019t suit up against the Raiders on Sunday, general manager Brian Gutekunst will need to add another receiver. Green Bay only has Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Jake Kumerow, Lazard and Shepherd.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n5-1 - LaFleur is 5-1 in his first season as an NFL head coach. The other five rookie head coaches are a combined 6-22-1.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Packers have a short week to prepare for the Raiders. Green Bay will play its fifth home game in six weeks when it hosts Oakland on Sunday. The Packers have won their past seven regular-season matchups against the Raiders.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Allen Lazard wasn't even on the Packers' initial 53-man roster.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/lions_packers_football_00286_c0-191-4586-2866_s1200x700.jpg?a9691ca0dc8bbe884bb1590e082acb0a8c7496c4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
