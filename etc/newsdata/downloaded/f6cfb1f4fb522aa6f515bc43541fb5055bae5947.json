I started well in the first set, but I wasn\u2019t sharp enough.\u201d\n\nUntil Friday\u2019s match, Djokovic had won 24 straight sets in Asia, a run that included last year\u2019s Shanghai Masters and the title in Tokyo last week.\n\nTsitsipas has now beaten Djokovic twice in three matches. The 21-year-old Greek defeated Djokovic in their first meeting at the 2018 Toronto tournament and Djokovic won their match in Madrid this season.\n\nTsitsipas also earned a place at the year-end ATP Finals for the first time on Friday. But that was guaranteed when third-seeded Daniil Medvedev beat Fabio Fognini 6-3, 7-6 (4) in another quarterfinal match.\n\nMedvedev, who will face Tsitsipas in Saturday\u2019s semifinals, is one match away from reaching a sixth consecutive tournament final. He reached his first Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open, and then won titles in Cincinnati and St. Petersburg.\n\nMedvedev leads the tour with 57 match wins this season and is 40-1 on hard courts when winning the first set. The only time he lost a hard-court match after winning the first set was against Gael Monfils in Rotterdam.\n\nPrior to Friday\u2019s match, Fognini said Medvedev was one of the most dangerous players to face.\n\n\u201cIf some top players like Fabio can say this about me, shows that I\u2019m on the good way, I\u2019m playing good, and it\u2019s not easy to play against me,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cSurely, yeah, that\u2019s what I tried to show today on the match and it worked out.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Novak Djokovic's semifinal streak in Shanghai is over.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sandra Harwitt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/china_tennis_shanghai_masters_18694_c0-208-5000-3124_s1200x700.jpg?74d48b7b24509088c15947da9892024c1a07cb57", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
