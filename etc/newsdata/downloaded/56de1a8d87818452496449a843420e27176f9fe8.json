He asserted that Trump made a mistake by \u201cdivulging operational details of the raid that horrified national security professionals\u201d and argued that the president\u2019s detailed statement on the terrorist\u2019s final moments was largely embellished.\n\nBoot also took issue with Trump\u2019s characterization of al-Baghdadi \u201cdying like a coward.\u201d The notorious Never Trumper concluded that the president\u2019s assessment is \u201ccontradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up,\u201d implying that his suicide was, somehow, an act of bravery.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nA president who has never heard a shot fired in anger reveled in Baghdadi\u2019s last moments, even claiming \u201che died like a coward \u2026 whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d Trump could not possibly have heard \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d on the overhead imagery because there was no audio, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pointedly refused to confirm those details. The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\n\nAs the president detailed, al-Baghdadi ran into a cave along with three children and detonated his suicide vest, killing himself along with the children after finding himself entrapped by U.S. forces.\n\nAs Trump detailed:\n\nThe U.S. personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification it was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread \u2014 terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS, origins, future plans, things that we very much want.\n\nBoot\u2019s column would not be the only controversial piece to come out of the Post in recent days. The paper came under heavy scrutiny on Sunday after announcing al-Baghdadi\u2019s death with a title reading, \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at the helm of Islamic State, dies at 48\u201d:\n\nEnemy of the people??? With headlines like this and the fact that the @washingtonpost and others in the MSM have harsher criticism for The President of The United States than they do for the leader of ISIS, a known serial rapist and murderer, you really have to start to wonder!!! pic.twitter.com/JH448bCA7Y \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 27, 2019\n\nEvery day The Washington Post uses harsher words against @realDonaldTrump than they do in writing about one of the world\u2019s most evil terrorists.
