Oh my goodness! ... Oh my gosh! ... I knew I was going to get one today, folks,\" Ke'Mari was seen screaming in excitement.\n\nWhile the fish that Ke'Mari hooked was amazing, it was what the pint-sized fishermen did next that drew a massive fan base online, including \"When They See Us\" creator and director Ava DuVernay who shared the post on Twitter.\n\nCourtesy Velt Cooper\n\nIn the ultimate display of compassion, Ke'Mari gently released the fish back into the water with a kind message as he rubbed the scales and sent the fish off.\n\n\"Let's put this baby back in the water.

It kept me out of trouble. It kept me humble. Fishing keeps me patient,\" Velt Cooper told ABC News.\n\nVelt Cooper said he is not only impressed by his Ke'Mari's skills but also motivated by him.", "description": "Ke'Mari Cooper, 10, of Florida, was fishing with his father when he caught the 7-pound bass.
