The two leading candidates \u2014 Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, probably in that order \u2014 both faced tough questions that could damage them in the general election. And neither appears prepared to defend themselves against what is coming.\n\nBegin with Biden, who has a simple problem with no clear solution. His son, Hunter, traded on his father\u2019s name. In Ukraine, Hunter Biden accepted a lucrative position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. Burisma surely believed hiring the vice-president\u2019s son would give it political juice with the United States government. It did not. Joe Biden\u2019s positions as vice-president did not benefit Burisma. He advocated the good-government line that everybody else in the Obama administration and the (small-D) democratic world took, pushing out that country\u2019s corrupt prosecutor. His substantively correct stance did not benefit Burisma in any form.\n\nYet this does not fully absolve either Joe or Hunter. The latter was implicitly selling access to his father, and the fact that he did not deliver it means that he essentially conned Burisma. At minimum, the arrangement marginally spent down the moral capital of the American government and economy by promoting the perception that official favor can be purchased through family members of powerful officials.\n\nTrump, of course, has degraded that moral capital a million times over with his open nepotism and self-dealing. The problem Biden faces is that it is difficult to communicate the nuance of his position. How do you simultaneously say: (1) Hunter Biden was wrong to take that job and Joe was wrong to let him, (2) Joe Biden did not take any official action that benefitted his family, and (3) Trump is using this minor corruption as cover to enable oligarchical corruption several orders of magnitude greater?\n\nBiden\u2019s response to this dilemma was to elide it completely. At the debate, Biden simply insisted he and Hunter did nothing wrong while deflecting the inquiry:\n\nLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\n\nAnd what I wanted to make a point about \u2014 and my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. [Changes subject to Trump.]\n\nWhen the moderator pointed out he was dodging, Biden merely repeated the refrain (\u201cmy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself\u201d). For human and understandable reasons, Biden is obviously reluctant to scold his troubled son in public. Yet the fact is that his son\u2019s behavior is an albatross for the father, and all indications suggest that, if Biden wins the nomination, the damage from this relationship will only grow.\n\nWarren, for her part, faced yet another round of criticism over her refusal to acknowledge the financing mechanism of the health-care plan she has endorsed. The political weak point of the Sanders plan is that it would move 157 million Americans off of employer-sponsored insurance and onto Medicare. In theory, this should work out great. (I would be happy to trade my employer insurance for Medicare.) In practice, this requires convincing half the country to swap their current insurance for a government plan, and to convert their health-care premiums (which are nontransparent and remitted directly by their employer, reducing their wages only indirectly) into taxes (which are paid directly). Poll after poll shows both these changes turn the abstractly popular notion of broader coverage upside down.\n\nWarren\u2019s strategy is to dodge both objections. She has, in the past, avoided the question of people losing their employer insurance by saying nobody likes their insurance company. (That\u2019s not true: People tend to express satisfaction with their current coverage.) On taxes, she changes the question to total cost and refuses to acknowledge that taxes will go up in the swap.\n\nWarren\u2019s admirers consider this dodge to be clever, but the last debate shows just how politically corrosive it could become. The problem is that Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, openly admits taxes would go up. \u201cI do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d he conceded, while noting that \u201cfor virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less \u2014 substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.\u201d The contrast between one Medicare for All supporter honestly admitting how the plan would work, and the other one refusing to admit it, did not make her look good. It gave her opponents an opening to cast her as shady, which they seized.\n\nPete Buttigieg pointed out that Warren\u2019s response was \u201ca yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer.\u201d Biden said, \u201cit\u2019s important to be straightforward with them,\u201d and Amy Klobuchar added, \u201cat least Bernie\u2019s being honest here.\u201d This is not merely a problem of Warren being associated with an unpopular policy. It is a question that is corroding her reputation for honesty, which is a foundation of her outsider, truth-telling brand.\n\nAs with Biden, Warren will find the reality that Trump is orders of magnitude worse to be of little value. Republicans have a party-controlled mass-media apparatus that has trained its rank and file to support liars, but the Democrats do not.\n\nWarren painted herself into this corner by making an elementary mistake: She outsourced her policy position to a rival candidate. Sanders doesn\u2019t care if he takes positions that poll horribly among the electorate as a whole \u2014 either he is genuinely invested in a magical-thinking theory of \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d that sweeps away all electoral and legislative constraints, or he\u2019s running a message candidacy that isn\u2019t even trying to win at all. By endorsing Sanders\u2019s health-care plan, she gave him control of her message on the issue.\n\nIf Biden wants to beat Trump, he needs to put more distance between himself and his son. If Warren wants to beat Trump, she needs to ditch Bernie\u2019s health-care plan and come up with one that doesn\u2019t have political poison pills. The question with both candidates is, what steps are they willing to take to win?", "description": "Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren both faced tough questions, about Hunter Biden and Burisma, and the Bernie Sanders plan to replace health-insurance premiums with taxes.
