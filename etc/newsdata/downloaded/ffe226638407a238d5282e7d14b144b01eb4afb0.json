Su was eventually allowed to return to China, but the news of his death has been ignored except on unofficial websites.\n\nIn his earlier career, Su would admit, he had \u201cput obedience to the [Communist] party in first place\u201d, churning out what was required to \u201celaborate the thoughts of Chairman Mao\u201d. He made up for this in the 1980s by denouncing the party\u2019s \u201cfeudalism and Stalinism\u201d and proposing democratic reforms that are still unachieved. Privately he was even more outspoken, telling me in 1985 that \u201cwe need to make a clean sweep of the leadership\u201d, which still insisted on rigid control.\n\nIn 1987 Su and four other leading pro-reform intellectuals were purged from their positions in what became known as the \u201cincident of the five gentlemen\u201d. They were the targets of conservative party leaders who were alarmed at the open-minded debate encouraged by the party\u2019s secretary general, Hu Yaobang. Hu\u2019s enforced resignation and subsequent death would trigger the student protests of spring 1989 and the Beijing massacre.\n\nSu was lecturing in the US at the time and would remain there for over two decades, reflecting on the failure of reform and what he saw as the rise of a type of fascism. When Mao\u2019s successor Deng Xiaoping died in 1997, Su wrote in the Guardian that Deng had remained as dedicated as Mao to the dictatorship of the party.\n\nSu gained an orthodox academic education while China was falling apart during the 40s under Nationalist rule. Born in Beijing, into a family that was ethnically Manchu \u2013 the former imperial ruling class of Qing dynasty China (1644-1911) \u2013 he moved with them first to Shanghai, then in 1942 to inland Chongqing, fleeing from Japanese occupation. Su, already known as a brilliant student, was recruited by the economics research department of Nankai University, which had also moved to western China.\n\nAfter the war Su joined the staff of Fudan University in Shanghai, where, during a brief period of cooperation between nationalists and communists, he discovered the works of Marxism and Mao Zedong. Impressed by the moderate programme known as \u201cnew democracy\u201d then being put forward by Mao, Su hoped to work towards a synthesis of liberal and Marxist economic theory.\n\nReturning to Nankai University, now relocated in Tianjin, Su earned his doctorate in 1949 at the end of the civil war. This was one of the first to be awarded under the new communist regime \u2013 and one of the last, too, because all advanced degrees would soon be abolished.\n\nSu, like thousands of other young graduates, gladly joined the enterprise of \u201cnew China\u201d. He would remember being deeply moved by a performance of the tear-jerking revolutionary opera The White-Haired Girl. Before long Su was attending lectures in Marxist economics at the Beijing People\u2019s University, given by professors from the Soviet \u201cbig brother\u201d: he regretted later that his own work had been influenced by their dogmatic approach. In 1953 he joined the Communist party, and as well as teaching political economy at Fudan University he became a party cadre, ensuring that the curriculum faithfully followed the official \u201cline\u201d.\n\nAll went well until 1959, when Su criticised the exaggerated claims for economic success in the Great Leap Forward and became too friendly with Hong Wenda, an economics teacher who was labelled a \u201crightist\u201d. Even so, he was protected by senior officials who realised that if they sacked all the \u201crightist\u201d economists there would be no one left.\n\nIn 1963, as the Sino-Soviet dispute came into the open, Su was moved to Beijing to join a team gathering material for a series of polemics proving that the Soviet Union had \u201cbetrayed Marxism\u201d. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), Su was sent to a \u201ccadre farm\u201d in the countryside \u2013 relatively mild punishment for intellectuals in need of ideological remoulding. It also meant that, being removed from the political scene, he did not have to write to order for the Gang of Four, led by Madame Mao (Jiang Qing).\n\nEmerging unscathed after Mao\u2019s death and the rise to power of Deng, Su finally found his voice as Chinese intellectual life began to thaw under Deng\u2019s protege Hu. At the path-breaking Wu Xu seminar on ideology organised by Hu in 1979, Su produced a joint statement with the veteran philosopher Feng Yulan criticising the official line that China was moving seamlessly through the \u201csocialist stage\u201d towards communism.\n\nAt another seminar, in 1986, Su called for an end to the party\u2019s \u201cfeudal autocracy\u201d, denouncing corruption among the children of senior officials, and urging intellectuals to display \u201creal courage and boldness of vision\u201d.\n\nAppointed the director of a leading theoretical thinktank at the Academy of Social Sciences, Su condemned the gap between party theory and reality. The Chinese constitution guaranteed freedom of expression, he pointed out, \u201cbut if you criticise someone for violating the constitution, many people will laugh at your foolishness\u201d.\n\nIn the conservative backlash of 1987 Su was dismissed from his Academy post, but he continued to speak out. \u201cThere is too much concentration of power, no democracy and no real supervision of government officials,\u201d he said early in 1989, as the political climate worsened in the run-up to Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhen the Beijing massacre occurred, Su was expelled from the Communist party and placed on a blacklist. He was given temporary refuge at Princeton University, in New Jersey, with other exiled scholars, and later joined the editorial board of the dissident journal Beijing Spring. In 1996, Su published Shinian Fengyu (Ten Years of Storm) which gives a valuable account of the ideological struggle during the 80s in which he had played such a prominent part.\n\nLater, he edited a memorial volume In Memory of Hu Yaobang (2006) lamenting the lost opportunity of that decade. Its last chance, he believed, disappeared during the Tiananmen protests when Hu\u2019s successor, Zhao Ziyang, who was sympathetic to the students, was forced to resign.\n\nAfter more than two decades in vocal exile, Su finally accepted the need for silence if he was to return home. The importance of the efforts of Su and other scholars to reform Chinese socialism was forgotten as China embraced economic globalisation while retaining strict one-party rule. This has been taken further since 2012 under the leadership of Xi Jinping, whose repressive and neo-Maoist style of leadership is exactly what Su was arguing against in the 80s.\n\n\u2022 Su Shaozhi, political scientist, born 1923; died 27 May 2019", "description": "Chinese political scientist who was forced into exile after the Tiananmen Square massacre", "authors": ["John Gittings"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b8e48d76faf5521b2251b67a3c38a78094c7e72/400_177_511_307/master/511.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72c2e5509553f6efbb73058063fa1ba7"}
