Brian Schatz earlier this year, Chairman Jerome Powell wrote that the Fed takes \"severe weather events\" into account in its role as a financial supervisor. Meanwhile, the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve \u2014 responsible for banking oversight across a major swath of the American West \u2014 has been more blunt, writing this past March that volatility related to climate change has become \"increasingly relevant\" as a consideration for the central bank.\n\nWith Thursday's actions, the San Francisco Fed has taken a further step. The research, conducted by 38 academics and practitioners from around the country and published with the knowledge of the Fed's board of governors, presents in precise language a dire picture of the risks of a changing climate and warns that local governments don't have the means to deal with them.\n\n\"The associated risks and effects of climate change are relevant considerations for the Federal Reserve,\" wrote Ian Galloway, director of the San Francisco Fed's Centre for Community Development Investments.\n\nThe new research calls on lenders and other businesses involved in community development \"to take a leadership role in preparing vulnerable regions most at risk for a 'new abnormal,'\" Galloway wrote in a foreword to the papers, which appeared in the journal Community Development Innovation Review.\n\nAs the research makes clear, that new abnormal is already here.\n\nClimate change has begun to affect the real estate market, according to a paper by Asaf Bernstein, an economist at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and two co-authors. His research shows that properties likely to be under water if seas rise 30 centimetres now sell for 15 per cent less than comparable properties with no flood threat.\n\nThat decline in property values is likely to ripple through the financial system, scaring banks and other lenders away from those areas, according to a paper by Michael Berman, a former chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which represents lenders.\n\nIt could also lead to a practice Berman described as \"blue-lining,\" in which banks would avoid lending to flood-prone areas \u2014 a reference to the practice known as redlining, in which banks discriminate against African American neighbourhoods by not lending there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"At some point in the next 20 to 30 years, absent substantial new approaches to reducing and managing flood risk, there may be a threat to the availability of the 30-year mortgage in various vulnerable and highly exposed areas,\" wrote Berman, who is president and chief executive of M & T Realty Capital, a major mortgage lender.\n\nThe result, Berman said, would be to further imperil the financial health of places, particularly poorer ones, already struggling with flooding. \"There is a real possibility that real estate values in communities will be decreasing due to increased flood risk just as the real estate tax base is being relied on for funding of new flood mitigation infrastructure,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the San Francisco Fed, Tom Flannigan, said the Fed \"does not advocate on any policy positions\" but instead seeks to \"share expert opinions and research while supporting the thoughtful exchange of ideas on subjects like climate change that we recognize to be important in our district.\"\n\nStill, change is necessary, according to Jesse Keenan, editor of the papers. He argued that the private sector must assume a greater role in preparing for the effects of climate change.\n\n\"The private sector has always adapted,\" Keenan, a faculty member at Harvard University, wrote in the introduction to the research. \"One either adapts to new markets, products or services, or they go out of business.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Climate change has begun to affect the real estate market, with a US Federal Reserve Bank office publishing a study of dangers from outside experts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2724%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6e5e7514da9a0787ab36a7fa4cdc9bf1dc49e8e5", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
