The move will shave GE's pension deficit by as much as $8 billion and its net debt by as much as $6 billion.\n\nAs part of the pension freeze, the industrial conglomerate said it will freeze supplementary pension benefits for approximately 700 employees who became executives before 2011. Supplemental pension plans are typically designed for higher-ranking employees and offer benefits beyond the typical pension plan.\n\n\"Returning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today's decision to freeze the pension is no exception,\" said Kevin Cox, chief human resources officer at GE.\n\nAs part of such efforts, the company said last month it would spend $5 billion to pay down debt. But the effort to reduce debt could also damage employee morale at a time when CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. is trying to turn around the troubled conglomerate.\n\n\"The impact on employee engagement/morale of some of these pension measures is unlikely to be positive, but in a situation of 'corporate battlefield surgery,' this tends to be a typical, if unfortunate casualty,\" noted Barclay's analyst Julian Mitchell in a Monday research note.\n\n@generalelectric is freezing the pension of thousands of workers to reduce debt. @equilarinc notes that CEO of GE H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. earned $15,312,165 in 2018, 345 times the 2018 median GE employee wage.$GE #corpgov #execcomp #employeepay\n\nSource: https://t.co/4guU47seCR \u2014 Equilar Inc. (@equilarinc) October 7, 2019\n\nCulp, a turnaround specialist, was paid more than $15.3 million last year, or 345 times the 2018 median GE employee wage of around $43,500, according to Equilar.\n\nWhat is a pension freeze?\n\nA pension freeze effectively puts a hold on new benefits from accruing to a retirement account, according to the Pension Rights Center. GE said the 20,000 workers affected by the change won't accrue additional benefits nor make employee contributions after January 1, 2021.\n\nGE booted from the Dow Industrials\n\nGE said the pension freeze won't impact GE retirees already collecting pension benefits or employees with production benefits.\n\nLike other corporations, GE has been phasing out its pension amid a push toward self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k)s. GE said it hasn't allowed new workers into its pension plan since 2012.\n\n\"Today's actions more closely aligns GE benefits with current industry standards and competitive market practices,\" the company said Monday in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, GE also said it's offering a lump-sum option to about 100,000 former employees who have not started their monthly pension payments. The company said it's sending out notices to those eligible employees, and will pay the lump sum in December.", "description": "The action will hit company's salaried workers and is designed to reduce billions in pension deficits and debt", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/09/84f47709-de2f-42d2-a165-52f9750ce3e3/thumbnail/1200x630/8053a533500b65734410b5c44395faa7/ge1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
