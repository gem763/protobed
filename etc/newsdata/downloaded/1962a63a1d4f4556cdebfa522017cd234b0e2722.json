It is important to ensure the countries are being open to trade,\u201d said Saadia Zahidi, a Forum managing director, when asked to comment on the impact of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nShe noted the lack of \u201chard data\u201d on the impact of US tariffs imposed on several of its main economic partners, as the set of products impacted remains limited compared to overall trade.\n\nBut, she said, \u201cthe sentiment\u201d surrounding investing in the US \u201chas been going down,\u201d she told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\u201cThat will end up impacting long-term investment; that will end up impacting how decision makers are thinking; that will end up impacting the view of non-American business leaders (of) the United States. So it does matter in the long-term,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Forum\u2019s competitiveness report relies in part of executive surveys, in addition to hard economic data.\n\nZahidi said that the US had also fallen in the rankings because healthy life expectancy in the country was now lower than in China.\n\nIn data published last year, the World Health Organization said that a newborn in China could expect 68.7 years of healthy living, compared to 68.5 for American newborns.\n\n\u2013 Singapore surge \u2013\n\nThe report measures competitiveness on a scale of zero to 100 based on factors that include infrastructure, health, the labour market, the financial system, quality of public institutions and economic openness.\n\nSingapore scored 84.8 out of 100, but the Forum noted that the country had benefited from trade diversion through its ports triggered by the tariff battles between the world\u2019s top economies.\n\nAt 83.7 the US slipped from a score of 85.6 in 2018.\n\nHong Kong rose four spots to claim third place with a score of 83.1, but the Forum said the data used in the report was collected before waves of pro-democracy protests began shaking the financial hub.\n\nThe Netherlands finished fourth \u2014 up two slots from last year \u2014 while Switzerland came in fifth place.", "description": "Geneva (AFP) \u2013 The United States fell to second place behind Singapore in the World Economic Forum\u2019s flagship Global Competitiveness Report,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/3bc489_singapore-surged-top-spot-forum-noting-country-had-benefited-trade-diversion-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
