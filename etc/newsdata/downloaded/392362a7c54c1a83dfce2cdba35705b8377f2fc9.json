He was teaching delinquent teenagers in Birmingham back in the 1980s. \u201cI used to think software was some kind of lingerie,\u201d he says.\n\nThen he discovered the Acorn BBC Micro. \u201cThere was this kid, aged 16, put away for a double murder. He couldn\u2019t read or write. He\u2019d pick a fight rather than answer a question. But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed \u2013 for the better.\u201d\n\nIf he got it wrong, he could start again. \u201cHe could fail without humiliation,\u201d says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn\u2019t judgemental.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhich is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as \u201cTech4Good\u201d, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.\n\nThere was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. \u201cThe tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost \u00a3150 each and he could only make a few hundred.\n\nThe idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and make more units \u2013 for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. \u201cThe NHS was spending millions but I didn\u2019t think they were spending it wisely,\u201d he explains, adding: \u201cMy wife was appalled when I quit.\u201d But he got the price down to \u00a310 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time.\n\nNow 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexic (as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as \u201cliberating people\u201d.\n\nHe was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.\n\nEven if they couldn\u2019t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. \u201cWe changed the lives of thousands of people,\u201d he says. \u201cYou had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people\u2019s lives depended on it.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won\u2019t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.\u201d Lightwave, however, uses a dedicated radio protocol.\n\nThe emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. \u201cIt\u2019s democratising,\u201d he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012, Lightwave produced a pioneering \u201cgateway\u201d device for a house. \u201cWe made all the mistakes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now it works.\u201d\n\nLightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers. They design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it\u2019s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps in some ways. \u201cI can\u2019t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t code either, but I do have the ideas.\u201d He carries a \u201cdaybook\u201d around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.\n\nShermer says that Alexa and other virtual assistants have also made a big difference on the domestic front. Fifty per cent of all commands are now sent via voice. His own mother is 87. \u201cShe can\u2019t use a computer but she can still talk to Alexa,\u201d he says.\n\nShermer is proud of being \u201can unknown little British tech company\u201d up against the giants of the industry. \u201cThey\u2019re still getting it wrong,\u201d he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn\u2019t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to work.\u201d Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.\n\nWhether you have dementia or you\u2019re easily distracted, it\u2019s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on. \u201cWe don\u2019t make gadgets,\u201d Shermer says dismissively. \u201cWe make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that\u2019s permanent and increases the value of your home.\u201d Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies such as Honeywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.\n\nShermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. \u201cBut we stand our corner,\u201d he says. He reckons that the larger companies are at a disadvantage in that they produce generic products, whereas Lightwave can be more bespoke. \u201cThey\u2019re top-down, whereas we grew up looking at it from the user\u2019s point of view.\u201d\n\nShermer reckons he could also come up with a much better system for Hawking if he was still around. \u201cIt was a slow, stilted conversation with him. He would take a minute to say \u2018I agree\u2019. And it was an American voice system. There are still tens of thousands in his situation who would benefit.\u201d", "description": "John Shermer, the founder of Lightwave, had some of his best ideas in borstal.
