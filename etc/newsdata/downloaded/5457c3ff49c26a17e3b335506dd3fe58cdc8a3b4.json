LOUIS (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Braves are promising to continue their dialogue with the Native American community in the wake of Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley's criticism of the Tomahawk Chop chant.\n\nHelsley told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he thinks the chant is insulting, and the 25-year-old rookie was disappointed when it was heard during Game 1 of the NL Division Series against Atlanta.\n\nHelsley is a member of the Cherokee nation. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma, native speaks the Cherokee language and is one of only a few Native Americans in the majors.\n\nThe Braves say they \"appreciate and take seriously\" Helsley's concerns. The team says Saturday in a statement that it has \"worked to honor and respect the Native American community through the years.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
