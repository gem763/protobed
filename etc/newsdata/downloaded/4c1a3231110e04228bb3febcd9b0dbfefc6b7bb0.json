Johnson previously announced he was skipping the president\u2019s speech because he felt the \u201cvalues of the people of Chicago\u201d were inconsistent with what the president was going to say. From the podium, Trump took Johnson to task for his failure to appear, and for his failure to keep Chicagoans safe.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs, most respected people in the country, in his hometown, and with the president of the United States,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAnd you know why? It\u2019s because he\u2019s not doing his job,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLast year, 565 people were murdered in Chicago. Since Eddie Johnson has been police chief, more than 1,500 people have been murdered in Chicago and 13,067 people have been shot.\u201d\n\nShortly after the president concluded his remarks, Superintendent Johnson issued a statement of his own chastising Trump and claiming he criticized all Chicago officers, not just the top brass.\n\nBREAKING: After #Trump slams #Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson for city\u2019s 565 murders last year, Johnson holds newser to point out the city\u2019s steady decline in gun violence since he became top cop in 2016: \u201cThe same police department he criticized spent all day protecting him.\u201d \u2014 Chip Mitchell (@ChipMitchell1) October 28, 2019\n\nWhile President Trump was blasting Johnson for Chicago\u2019s continued gang violence, he also told the assembled chiefs that gun control laws aren\u2019t the best way to deal with violent crimes.\n\n\u201cThe best way to reduce gun violence is to put criminals with firearms behind bars,\u201d Trump said to applause from the audience. \u201cAnd just so you understand, we will always protect our Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech, the president also announced a new executive order establishing a Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, which will focus on addressing some of the root causes of violent crime like homelessness, drug abuse, and mental illness. Many of the chiefs in attendance praised the idea.\n\n\u201cThese are issues that have been dumped on the doorstep of law enforcement for years without funding or support,\u201d said Buffalo Grove Police Chief Steven R. Casstevens, who will become IACP president on Tuesday. \u201cLaw enforcement has to become mental health professionals dealing with homelessness \u2026 drug overdoses. It\u2019s terrific he showed up here to show support and recognize law enforcement officers,\u201d Casstevens said. \u2026 Naperville Police Chief Bob Marshall said Trump\u2019s \u201ccare and concern for police and our families was evident to me\u201d by the president\u2019s recognition of several law enforcement officers for bravery and leadership. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the signing of the executive order to study and get at the root cause of mental health, drug abuse, homelessness and their relationship to crime,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI liked the president\u2019s comments regarding gun violence, being tougher on those criminals who commit violent crimes by the use of firearms upon our citizens.\u201d\n\nGiven the fact that the International Association of Chiefs of Police has been very vocal about its support for new gun control laws like a ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d, waiting periods for firearm purchases, and universal background checks, it was refreshing to hear President Trump bluntly tell the assembled chiefs that Chicago\u2019s gun control laws aren\u2019t the answer to reducing violent crime. The president has been telling supporters and Second Amendment organizations that he\u2019s no longer on board with gun control measures like a \u201cred flag\u201d law or changes to our current background check requirements, and his message to the police chiefs was devoid of any support for the gun control policies. The assembled police chiefs may have applauded Trump\u2019s new executive order, but it was what the president didn\u2019t say that has gun owners cheering his Chicago speech.", "description": "Speaking to a police group, President Trump took Chicago's top cop to task for the city's violent crime rate, and said Chicago's gun laws aren't working.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/283/6a11a7b9-fc41-43a5-a398-31c610458c0d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
