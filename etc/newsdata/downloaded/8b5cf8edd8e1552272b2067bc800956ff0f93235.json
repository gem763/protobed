That\u2019s what these Wall Street Democrats say they might do if Elizabeth Warren gets the nomination", "language": "en", "text": "Last week, Leon Cooperman, the billionaire boss at Omega Advisors, joked to a crowd at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York that if Elizabeth Warren were to win the presidency, the stock market might not even open.\n\nBefore that, CNBC host Jim Cramer talked about how the prospect of such an anti\u2013bank candidate in the White House is stoking fear across the industry. \u201cWhen you get off the desk and talk to executives, they\u2019re more fearful of her winning,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s been hearing the phrase, \u201cShe\u2019s got to be stopped,\u201d bouncing around Wall Street since her rise in the polls.\n\nIt could be that the backlash is gaining momentum, as Warren\u2019s candidacy does likewise. According to CNBC, several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers on Wall Street say they may end up backing Donald Trump in 2020:\n\n\u2018You\u2019re in a box because, you\u2019re a Democrat and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI want to help the party, but she\u2019s going to hurt me, so I\u2019m going to help President Trump.\u201d\u2019\n\nThat quote, CNBC reported, is from a senior private-equity executive \u2014 just one of many sources said to have cited \u201cwidely shared\u201d concerns.\n\nThe fear, if the account is accurate, stems from Warren\u2019s focus on curbing the power and influence of big banks, whether via a wealth tax or holding private-equity firms responsible for debts and pensions at the companies they buy.\n\nAnother source from one of the nation\u2019s biggest banks is quoted as having told CNBC that her policies could be worse than Obama\u2019s when it comes to Wall Street. \u201cThey will not support her,\u201d that source reportedly said. \u201cIt would be like shutting down their industry.\u201d\n\nDoes this bother Warren? Not by the looks of this tweet:\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nAs for Trump, he reiterated on Thursday his stance that anybody other than him at the helm of this country would mean trouble for investors:\n\nIf they actually did this the markets would crash. Do you think it was luck that got us to the best Stock Market and Economy in our history. It wasn\u2019t! https://t.co/V0WGVWEWTN \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019\n\nNo crash yet, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.30% was trading lower as the prospect of his impeachment hovers over Wall Street.", "description": "According to CNBC, several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers on Wall Street say they may end up backing Trump in 2020 if Elizabeth Warren ends up...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS011_biden__ZG_20190925092351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
