Tulsi Gabbard is controversial within her party.\n\nShe says the U.S. should talk to its enemies. She was criticized for meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.\n\nBut Democrats were supposed to be the anti-war party, I say to her in my newest video.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re heavily influenced by a foreign policy establishment \u2026 whose whole power base is built around continuing this status quo,\u201d Gabbard tells me. \u201cSo much so, to the point where when I\u2019m calling for an end to these wasteful wars, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, gosh, Tulsi, why are you such an isolationist?\u2019 As though the only way that we can relate with other countries in the world is by bombing them.\u201d\n\nGabbard is a veteran, and now says, \u201cHonor our servicemen and women by only sending them on missions that are worthy of their sacrifice.\u201d\n\nShe enlisted because of the 9/11 attacks. However, there, too, she thought a limited response was necessary but now says that our government has \u201cused that attack on 9/11 to begin to wage a whole series of counterproductive regime-change wars, overthrowing authoritarian dictators in other countries, wars that have proven to be very costly to our servicemembers.\u201d\n\nShe blames both parties. \u201cI call out leaders in my own party and leaders in the Republican Party (and all) who are heavily influenced by the military-industrial complex that profits heavily off of us continuing to wage these counterproductive wars.\u201d\n\nShe also wants to end our big domestic war, the war on drugs. She\u2019d start by legalizing marijuana.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never smoked marijuana,\u201d she says. \u201cI never will. I\u2019ve never drunk alcohol. I\u2019ve chosen not to in my life, but this is about free choice. And if somebody wants to do that, our country should not be making a criminal out of them.\u201d\n\nEven if they use stronger drugs? Heroin? Meth?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the direction that we need to take,\u201d she says.\n\nAlthough Gabbard just barely polls well enough to make the Democratic debates, she made a big impact at one debate by basically knocking Sen. Kamala Harris out of the race.\n\nGabbard simply pointed out Harris\u2019s hypocrisy in suddenly becoming a criminal justice reformer.\n\nGabbard said, \u201cShe put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.\u201d\n\nThat debate clash crushed Harris in betting predictions about who the Democratic nominee would be. Harris\u2019s numbers started dropping from that moment, and she quickly fell from first place to, as I write this, seventh.\n\nGood for Gabbard for bringing up the drug war -- and for running an ad that at least mentions America\u2019s huge federal debt.\n\nBut like most Democrats, Gabbard would spend billions on expensive new programs, funding it with military cuts.\n\nBut Bernie Sanders admits that \u201cMedicare for All\u201d alone would cost $3 trillion. The budget for the entire military, by comparison, is $700 billion per year.\n\n\u201cThe money that we are going to save by ending these wasteful wars -- you\u2019re right, it won\u2019t cover every other thing that we need to accomplish,\u201d Gabbard admits.\n\nAt least she\u2019s willing to debate with me. No one else polling over 1% has been willing so far.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are increasingly unwilling to sit down with those who may be \u2018on the other team,\u2019\u201d she explains. \u201cLook, I love my country. You love our country. Let\u2019s come together as Americans with appreciation for our constitution, our freedoms, civil liberties and rights, and have this civil discourse and dialogue about how we can move forward together.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Rep.
