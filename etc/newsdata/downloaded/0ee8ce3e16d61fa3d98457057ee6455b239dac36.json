All over the team, we were enthusiastic, energetic, in their faces. We\u2019ve set our standard now and that\u2019s how we always need to play. Nothing less.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The atmosphere was great on Sunday, they were behind us for the whole game, and it makes a big difference when they do that. We\u2019re very thankful for that and we\u2019re just glad that we gave them three points.\n\n\u201cWe rolled our sleeves up and we got a big reaction. That\u2019s exactly what we needed, so it\u2019s been a really good week.\u201d\n\nThe defender added: \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy this little international break and after that, we\u2019ll start planning for another big game at Chelsea (on October 19).\n\n\u201cI think momentum is a big thing in football but I think a little break won\u2019t do us any harm and we can refresh but still knowing that we\u2019ve just beaten Man U, and we\u2019re still on a high from that, so hopefully we can go into the Chelsea game full of confidence.\u201d", "description": "Jamaal Lascelles says Newcastle \u201cset our standard\u201d in Sunday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Manchester United and has stressed they must try to maintain that level of performance.
