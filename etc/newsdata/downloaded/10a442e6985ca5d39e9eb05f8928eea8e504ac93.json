You may just be in luck.\n\nOn Tuesday, Thiel's venture firm Founders Fund announced Hereticon, a conference for \"ideological outcasts.\" The conference will run for three days in May 2020 in New Orleans at an undetermined location, according to a blog post announcing the news.\n\n\"We believe dissent is essential to human progress and hope Hereticon will spark important conversations within our community and beyond \u2014 that's really the only goal,\" Founders Fund vice president Michael Solana told Business Insider over email.\n\nRead More: Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is making its first cybersecurity investment in a $37 million deal with 2 former Air Force pilots\n\nThe post lists a range of topics up for discussion, including immortality, doomsday preparation, biological modification, UFOs, and drag culture, among others. The form linked at the bottom of the post allows those interested to submit any topics or ideas they would also like to discuss if outside the already lengthy list outlined in the post.\n\n\"After dark, on the top floor of our hotel, in a hidden room plastered in newspaper clippings of sightings and secret bases, there may be a talk or two on UFOs and literally a s\u00e9ance. Let's get weird,\" Solana wrote in the post.\n\nWorth noting is Thiel's reputation in Silicon Valley, where he's known as a contrarian and an iconoclast. Thiel is one of the most vocal supporters of President Trump in Silicon Valley, historically a liberal enclave. He's also been known to use controversial blood transfusion therapies in pursuit of his dream of living forever.\n\nHereticon will welcome intellectuals from all walks of life that have been banned from other conferences, the post says. The announcement invokes thinkers like Galileo and Jesus Christ, saying that without dissent, growth is all but impossible.\n\n\"But while our culture is fascinated by the righteousness of our historical heretics, it is obsessed with the destruction of the heretics among us today,\" Solana writes in the blog post.\n\nFounders Fund is reportedly an investor in some of the controversial industries that leave more traditional investors hesitant, including a cybersecurity startup and Palmer Luckey's secretive digital border wall startup Anduril.\n\n\"A world without heretics is a world in decline, and in a declining civilization everything we value, from science and technology to prosperity and freedom, is in jeopardy,\" the post concludes.", "description": "The invite-only conference will run for three nights at an undisclosed hotel in New Orleans in May 2020.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a90b79eaae60540028b46fc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
