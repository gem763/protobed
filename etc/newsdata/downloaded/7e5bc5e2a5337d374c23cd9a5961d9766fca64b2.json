It not only created the most ubiquitous piece of computer software in existence but also the company that twice has become the most valuable on the planet.\n\nOh, and that brain mainstreamed the idea that those who've benefited greatly should use that benefit for the good of society. Like, for real. Give the guy credit for not only committing to give away at least half of his Microsoft fortune but also recruiting dozens of other billionaires to do the same with theirs. That's a lot going on in one brain.\n\nBut, believe it or not, this column isn't about how great Bill Gates is, and it's not about the three-part documentary (though it's an interesting watch if you have a few hours). Instead, it's about that brain, and the thing Bill Gates says is his greatest fear.\n\n\"I don't want my brain to stop working,\" Gates tells us in the first two minutes of the film, which was directed by Oscar-winner Davis Guggenheim.\n\nI'm sure to some extent Gates means that in the literal sense that everyone can relate to. No one really wants their brain to stop working, and there is no shortage of human conditions, like Alzheimer's, that could lead to the diminishment of one's brain functioning. And maybe that's entirely what he meant.\n\nBut I think there is something a little deeper, and it's something worth paying attention to. In fact, I think that it's the thing every entrepreneur should be afraid of.\n\nThat's because there are certainly moments when it would be easier to stop working on new things, to stick with one idea,, and see how far it will take you. But at some point, you have to ask yourself, if your brain isn't 'working' \u2014 if you aren't using it productively \u2014 what are you really doing? I think that's something we should all fear.\n\nAnd the good news is that while modern medicine hasn't yet found a way to prevent our brains from eventually failing, whether or not it's working is entirely up to you.", "description": "In a new Netflix documentary series, Gates, when discussing his fears, said, \"I don't want my brain to stop working.\"", "authors": ["Jason Aten"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c420c1f55ab0b5ad46f1df7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
