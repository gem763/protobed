Elizabeth Warren and social media giant Facebook continued this week as Warren\u2019s campaign ran a series of Facebook ads falsely claiming that Mark Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump for reelection.\n\nWarren\u2019s ad targets Facebook\u2019s policy that states ads by politicians are exempt from third-party fact-checking, essentially giving candidates a possible platform to spread misinformation. It\u2019s a policy that the Democrat presidential candidate has repeatedly criticized.\n\nThe ad reads: \u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. You\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possible be true?\u2019 Well it\u2019s not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2014 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThere\u2019s no love lost between the Massachusetts senator and the social media giant. Warren has repeated criticized Facebook while campaigning, and leaked audio of a Facebook meeting in July revealed Zuckerberg promising to fight Warren\u2019s proposal to breakup the company were she elected President. He also said that her election would \u201csuck\u201d for the company.\n\nWarren hit back in a tweet:\n\nRecently, the Trump campaign has been running a social media ad that falsely claims Joe Biden promised money to Ukraine to fire a prosecutor investigating his son. There\u2019s no evidence this ever occurred. Reuters reports that the Biden campaign sent letters to Facebook, Twitter and Google asking them to take down the ad.\n\nOn Tuesday, Facebook responded in a letter to the Biden campaign that said the ad did not violate the company\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d the New York Times reports Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, wrote in the letter to the Biden campaign.\n\nWrite to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com.", "description": "To draw attention to Facebook's ad policy, Warren ran a series of Facebook ads falsely claiming that Mark Zuckerberg endorsed President Trump.", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/elizabeth-warren-facebook-ad-mark-zuckerberg.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
