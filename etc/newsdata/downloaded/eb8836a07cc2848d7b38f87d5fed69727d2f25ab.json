That\u2019s why we love this sweet and soothing tea, in the style of teas sipped across the Middle East and North Africa \u2014 from Greg and Lucy Malouf\u2019s cookbook Suqar. The blend serves as a sort of transitional sipper, bringing the best summer and fall flavours together in one steaming mug.\n\nApple-Mint Tea\n\nBy Greg and Lucy Malouf\n\nFrom Turkey to Tehran, and right across to North Africa, tea is usually drunk hot and sweet. This hybrid recipe combines some of the region\u2019s favourite flavours \u2014 Turkish apple and Moroccan mint \u2014 and finishes with the classic Arabian garnish of pine nuts. For our taste, the apple juice provides sufficient sweetness, but add extra sugar if you like. Serve in attractive glasses with your favourite wafer biscuit.\n\nIngredients\n\n500 mL water\n\n1 tsp good-quality black tea leaves\n\n60 mL clear organic apple juice\n\n1 pink lady apple, cut through the core into 2 mm (\u215b in) slices\n\n1 lime, cut crossways into 2 mm (\u215b in) slices\n\n1 bunch mint, washed\n\n20g pine nuts\n\nPreparation\n\nBring the water to the boil in a medium saucepan, then tip onto the tea leaves in a warmed ceramic bowl. Stir in the apple juice. Add most of the apple and lime slices and most of the mint, reserving some of each to garnish. Cover the bowl and leave to steep for 10 minutes.\n\nOnce steeped, strain the tea back into the saucepan and bring it back to the boil. Tip into a teapot and add the reserved fruit slices and mint sprigs.\n\nServe in little glasses, and garnish each with a few pine nuts.\n\nExcerpted from Suqar by Greg Malouf and Lucy Malouf.
