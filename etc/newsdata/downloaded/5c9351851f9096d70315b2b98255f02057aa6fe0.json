Following his departure \u2013 and the election of President Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine \u2013 Poroshenko appointed Saakashvili governor of Odessa oblast in Ukraine. Saakashvili received Ukrainian citizenship and a mandate to weed out corruption.\n\nSaakashvili found corruption, organized by Poroshenko\u2019s political allies, and resigned in disgust shortly after. Poroshenko\u2019s forces abducted him and deported him to Poland for good in early 2018, after Saakashvili founded a political party and began campaigning against Poroshenko. Poroshenko revoked his citizenship while in Poland; Saakashvili lost his Georgian citizen by default when he obtained Ukrainian citizenship. He legally became a stateless person until Zelensky made him Ukrainian again in May.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s office, the highest in the country, announced on Monday that Saakashvili had filed charges for \u201cabduction and violent actions\u201d against him by the Poroshenko government. He is arguing that the decision to deport him to Poland \u2013 a country that he has no ethnic ties to and has never had legal residence or citizenship in \u2013 was a violation of his rights. The Prosecutor General\u2019s office did not specify if Saakashvili had filed any criminal complaints against individuals in particular, instead vowing an official probe into who ordered his deportation and why.\n\nSaakashvili alleges that Poroshenko forces violently abducted him and forced him out of the country.\n\nThe former Georgian president first got into the crosshairs of Kyiv in 2016, when he resigned from his post as governor of Odessa.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand this, I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m tired of this. And I want to say: nobody in my life has lied so much or so cynically to me,\u201d Saakashvili said of Poroshenko at the time.\n\n\u201cIn reality, in Odessa region, the president personally supports two clans,\u201d he alleged, suggesting that Poroshenko ordered him to identify and punish corrupt political actors while also obfuscating his investigations and protecting his corrupt allies.\n\nSaakashvili then founded the Movement of New Forces party, which some compared to the movement that brought President Donald Trump to the White House. In response to Saakashvili\u2019s agitation, Poroshenko revoked his citizenship, leaving Saakashvili without citizenship in any nation, a violation of international law. He then deported Saakashvili to Poland, which accepted him as an anti-Putin ally and spouse of a European Union citizen. Poroshenko officials since attempted to paint Saakashvili as a Putin supporter \u2013 a claim widely dismissed due to Saakashvili\u2019s prominent place at the head of the anti-Putin movement when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008.\n\nBy late September 2017, Saakashvili was back in Ukraine thanks to the work of hundreds of supporters, who blocked Ukraine border patrol officers by forming human chains so that Saakashvili could physically force his way into the country. The roaring crowds of anti-corruption protesters accompanied Saakashvili in Kyiv, where authorities repeatedly attempted to arrest and deport Saakashvili again.\n\nIn December of that year, police wrestled Saakashvili off a Kyiv rooftop and smuggled him into a police van, only to have hundreds of supporters physically pull him out of the car to freedom.\n\nAmazing scenes in Kyiv as #Saakashvili's supporters free him from police van following his detention. Gov't now gives him 24 hours to turn himself in. #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/o05A9MyUcQ \u2014 Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) December 5, 2017\n\nSaakashvili\u2019s final deportation under Poroshenko occurred in February 2018. Authorities waited for the crowds to subside and, according to surveillance video, apprehended Saakashvili in a restaurant, assaulted him violently, and shipped him to Poland. Police still had to contend with throngs of Saakashvili supporters at the Kyiv airport to get him on a flight to Warsaw.\n\n\u201cDear Ukrainian citizens, your country is run by liars, by people who\u2019ve been lying to you and who lied to you four days ago,\u201d Saakashvili said at the time. \u201cWe need to save Ukraine from corruption. Ukrainian citizens deserve a better life.\u201d\n\nThe Saakashvili scandal significantly hurt the Poroshenko administration, brought to power by a wave of protests against pro-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko. Ukrainians soundly rejected Poroshenko and elected an untested comedian known for playing a schoolteacher who abruptly becomes president of Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelensky, who Saakashvili has endorsed. Zelensky returned the favor by granting Saakashvili his Ukrainian citizenship back as one of his first acts as president this year.\n\nSaakashvili claimed upon return to Ukraine that he is not interested in political ambitions at the moment, but does support Zelensky\u2019s attempts to oust entrenched Kyiv interests and eradicate corruption.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Zelensky will open an investigation into Ukraine stripping former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1146871555-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
