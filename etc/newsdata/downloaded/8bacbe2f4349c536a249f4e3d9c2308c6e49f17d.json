The top 10 men and women were invited to race in the final in Nepal. It will take place on Friday, near Annapurna, with a technical 42km race that reaches 3,800 metres in altitude.\n\nJornet was on Everest this month, but turned around before the summit when the weather turned.\n\n\u201cAfter an expedition you are very tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not really been running at all for the last month. I think I\u2019m just getting back to running shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing at 8,000m, it gives much more fatigue than strength. After the expedition I\u2019ve had a few days travelling back, so it\u2019s not really resting, but I\u2019ve started running again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first days you run, you don\u2019t run very fast but the last three or four days the feelings have started coming back.\u201d\n\nOf the seven races, Jornet won the 42km Pikes Peak, the 31km Sierre-Zinal in Switzerland and the 42km Zegama in Spain. He is sitting on top of the standings on 300 points, 24 ahead of Nadir Maguet of Italy.\n\n\u201cWhen I ran Sierre-Zinal or Pikes Peak I was running my own race. I had my times in mind. I was running by myself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here [Nepal] it will be more of a strategic race. You\u2019ll see how the others are doing, their strengths and weaknesses, so you know when you can attack.\u201d\n\nJornet has a host of victories to his name, including multiple wins at the competitive 171km Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc. But being involved in a series presents a different challenge.\n\n\u201cIn a way, there is less pressure because you can fail at some races,\u201d Jornet said. \u201cYou have to be consistent. It\u2019s not that day you have to be strong, but it\u2019s if you are in good shape during the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emotion, it\u2019s bigger when it\u2019s one event because it\u2019s that day and that moment, but the series is more like what your real shape is. It\u2019s not just if that day everything goes well.\u201d\n\nIf all goes to plan, he believes he can win, which is not surprising given he is one of the best mountain runners in the world. \u201c[But] to get on the podium will be tough as the guys are very strong. If I can get on the podium I will be very happy with that.\u201d\n\nMaude Mathys, of Switzerland, is the second-placed woman coming into the final. She won Pikes Peak in a new course record and won in Sierre-Zinal, too. But before this season she was relatively unknown. Her rapid rise means finding the fire to win the final may prove difficult.\n\n\u201cI want to do the best and have a good race but at the same time, here it\u2019s like a holiday,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s difficult to motivate myself to fight. It\u2019s like an angel and devil [on my shoulders]. I feel good, it\u2019s the end of the season but I\u2019m not very tired, so I will see if it is angel or the devil that will win?\u201d\n\nShe hopes to finish in the top three, but the race involves a long and technical downhill, which Mathys says is not her forte. However, half of Pikes Peak is downhill and she crushed it there.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to win. But the record? No. It was incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the last 30 minutes I knew I was near the record but there was downhill, and I know I\u2019m not very good in downhill so I didn\u2019t know if the record was possible.\u201d\n\nThis is her first season in the GTS. \u201cIt\u2019s another world,\u201d she said.", "description": "Annapurna is the stage for the epic final as 20 of the top runners face off to conclude the series", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/23/a6e33b0a-f4be-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_113241.jpg?itok=x0CAITsY&v=1571801572", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
