We get that, but we\u2019re still going there,\u201d Mulvaney had told reporters.\n\nHe said Doral would put on the event at cost, which he claimed would be as much as half what it would be at other venues. But he gave no estimates of the cost or comparisons.\n\nAn important draw is the club\u2019s size \u2014 900 acres, including three golf courses, according to Mulvaney, who said all the foreign delegations and the press could be housed \u201con campus.\u201d\n\nThe US last hosted the group of world leaders, then known as the G8 before Russia was disinvited, in 2012. The venue was Camp David.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday the next G7 summit will not be at one of his own Florida golf clubs, reversing a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/f8d554_trump-national-doral-in-miami-won-by-us-host-g7-summit-all-corruption-allegations-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
