They are the parents of a 10- and 15-year-old, respectively.\n\nWritten in French, the legal action alleges that when a person is engaged in \"Fortnite\" for a long period, the player\u2019s brain releases the \u201cpleasure hormone, dopamine\u201d and that \"Fortnite\" was developed by psychologists, statisticians and others over four years \u201cto develop the most addictive game possible,\u201d all so Epic could reap lucrative profits.\n\nAn Epic spokesperson said the company does not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nKindle for kids: Want your kids to read more? Amazon has a new Kindle for them\n\nThough \"Fortnite\" is free to play, kids spend gobs of real money purchasing the in-game currency, V-Bucks, used for dances (which are called \u201cemotes\u201d), skins and custom outfits for their virtual alter-egos.\n\n\u201cThe defendants used the same tactics as the creators of slot machines, or variable reward programs, (to ensure) the dependence of its users, (and) the brain being manipulated to always want more,\u201d the suit alleges in a rough translation. \u201cChildren are particularly vulnerable to this manipulation since their self-control system in the brain is not developed enough.\u201d\n\nFortnite.

The case could take up to a year or so.\n\nAlessandra Esposito Chartrand, an attorney with Calex L\u00e9gal, told the CBC in Canada that the suit is based on the same legal basis as a Quebec Superior Court ruling in 2015 that determined that tobacco companies didn\u2019t warn the public about the dangers of smoking. Chartrand said it was Epic\u2019s duty to issues similar warnings around the addictive nature of \"Fortnite.\"\n\nLast year, the World Health Organization classified \"gaming disorder\" as a diagnosable condition, giving mental health professionals a basis for setting up treatment and identifying risks for addictive behavior.\n\nIn a Common Sense/Survey Monkey poll released last December, about one in five parents found it at least moderately difficult to get kids off \"Fortnite,\" and about a quarter said they were concerned about how much time their kid played.\n\nThe Canadian suit isn\u2019t the first time Epic Games has faced a potential class action. In June, a federal case was brought in the northern district of California that alleged in part that \"Fortnite\" lacks built-in \u201cparental controls that would allow parents or guardians of minors to make informed decisions regarding in-app purchases\u201d and that minors who change their mind after making a purchase, even minutes after doing so, are not allowed a refund.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/07/fortnite-producer-epic-games-lawsuit-says-addictive-as-cocaine/3900236002/", "description": "Quebec parents sued \"Fortnite\" publisher\u00a0Epic Games for a third-person shooter they allege is as addictive and dangerous as cocaine.", "authors": ["Edward C.
