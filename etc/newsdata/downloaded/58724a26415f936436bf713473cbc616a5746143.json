Most of our major trading partners tend to be more mercantilistic, meaning they are open to use state power to protect their markets from other imports from other countries.\n\nSo the U.S. economy must prepare for a future of higher import duties and non-tariff barriers than we have seen historically, Bullard said.\n\nThis might hit the U.S. consumers directly because they own shares in many Fortune 500 companies which earn the bulk of their profits overseas, he said.\n\nBullard dissented last Wednesday from the Fed\u2019s decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-of-percentage point to a 1.75%-2% range. He wanted a more aggressive half-point reduction, in part due to his concerns of a more severe economic slowdown looming.\n\nFed\u2019s Bullard: Dissent was due in part to worries about a slowing economy\n\nAs things stand now, Bullard said he would back another quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s October meeting.", "description": "St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Monday the U.S. economy is at risk because the era of free-trade, which has bolstered growth, is ending.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR899_white__ZG_20190923153909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
