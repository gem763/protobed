Why are they telling us that?\u201d Carlson wondered aloud.\n\n\u201cMore than that, it\u2019s even worse,\u201d Nunes responded. \u201cYou have all the conspiracy theories, they are chasing daily conspiracy theories on this Ukraine hoax.\u201d\n\nThe pro-Trump California lawmaker, after essentially calling the House impeachment inquiry a conspiracy theory, went on to say that he\u2019s told his Republican colleagues how they should view those reporters.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk down the hall, I have to continuously tell these reporters that \u2018Look, I\u2019m not going to tell you in this lifetime or the next,\u2019\u201d the GOP congressman declared. \u201cBecause these aren\u2019t real reporters. They are assassins. They are assassins that are taking information from the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee and they are spreading it out there.\u201d\n\nCarlson agreed with Nunes, adding: \u2018They are DNC operatives.\u201d\n\nNunes, one of the president\u2019s most loyal soldiers on Capitol Hill, has inserted himself directly into the current controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine to dig up dirt on his domestic political rivals.\n\nBesides his top aide leaking the whistleblower\u2019s name, Nunes used a closed-door hearing earlier this month to bring up the Steele dossier to attempt to explain why the president could possibly be upset about Ukraine. It has also been reported that a protege of Nunes\u2019, Kashyap Patel, was also involved with feeding negative Ukraine-related information to the president earlier this year.", "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson agreed with Nunes, adding: \u201cThey are DNC operatives.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572313834/tucker-carlson-tonight_-_2019-10-28T204941.719_kxwpt5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
