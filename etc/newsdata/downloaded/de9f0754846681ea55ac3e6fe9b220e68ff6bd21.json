It\u2019s not between Turkey and Syria and the United States.\u201d\n\nDespite calling the deteriorating situation on the ground \u201cbrilliant,\u201d Trump has announced sanctions and tariffs intended to bring Turkey into negotiations for a cease-fire.\n\nTrump said the Kurdish militia forces that fought alongside U.S. troops in the successful war against ISIS are \u201cnot angels \u2014 they\u2019re not angels.\u201d He added that the Kurds \u2014 who have been fleeing the Turkish invasion by the hundreds of thousands \u2014 \u201care much safer now.\u201d\n\nThe president suggested without evidence that jailed ISIS fighters were released on purpose after the withdrawal to make the United States look bad.\n\nTrump admitted that the pullback will create a vacuum that Turkey and \u201cprobably Russia\u201d will fill in northern Syria. The U.S. is \u201cnot a policing agent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish them all a lot of luck,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there.

The White House said Pence plans to reiterate Trump\u2019s \u201ccommitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.\u201d\n\nErdogan, after reportedly telling reporters he wouldn\u2019t speak with Pence, has agreed to meet with the delegation but has shown no willingness to commit to a cease-fire.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops, which he made after a phone call with Erdogan, was met with intense bipartisan criticism.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper admitted Sunday that the situation on the ground is deteriorating rapidly and \u201cgets worse by the hour.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d earlier this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been one of Trump\u2019s strongest Republican allies in the Senate, said Kurdish fighters in Syria had been \u201cshamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nGraham predicted Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal will be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\nAt a joint press conference with the Italian president in the East Room later Wednesday, Trump took aim at Graham, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nTrump hits key Senate ally @LindseyGrahamSC:\n\n\n\n\"Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers, and fighting other peoples' wars.
