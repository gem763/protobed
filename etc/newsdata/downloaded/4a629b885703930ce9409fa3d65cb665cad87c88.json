The seminar was the latest in a series of public hearing sessions the opposition parties aimed to hold in every region on the issue.\n\nThe seminar also addressed issues specific to the Muslim-majority south, including religious tensions in the mostly Buddhist country, and how the constitution could be amended to solve them.\n\nAn ongoing insurgency has dragged on since 2004 in the southern border provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, which were part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate before Thailand annexed them in 1909.\n\nPiyabutr Saengkanokkul, secretary-general of opposition Future Forward Party, said the sedition accusation was the military resorting to the \"same old tactic\" to silence political opponents.\n\n\"We, the opposition parties, will push ahead to amend the constitution,\" he said in a news conference.\n\n(Reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat and Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "description": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's military has filed a sedition case with police against a group of opposition politicians and academics, accusing them of stirring unrest with talk of amending the constitution, police said on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
