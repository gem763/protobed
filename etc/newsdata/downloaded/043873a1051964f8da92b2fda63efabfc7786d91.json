United overcomes crucial missed call, closes in on MLS playoff berth", "language": "en", "text": "The missed call hung over D.C. United\u2019s tense match Sunday at Portland for more than 50 minutes, an apparent goal acknowledged by neither the match officials nor the video assistant referee.\n\nWith United clinging to a precarious one-goal lead, the mistake figured to cost the visitors at some point \u2014 and dent their MLS playoff hopes \u2014 amid the Timbers\u2019 constant pressure in the second half.\n\nBut D.C. survived the officiating miscue to escape with an inartistic but satisfying 1-0 victory before the announced sellout crowd of 25,218 at rainy Providence Park in Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it went in,\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said after watching postgame video, \u201cbut the good news is we didn\u2019t let that affect us and we continued to grind away and grab three points.\u201d\n\nThe goal that did count was an own goal in the 25th minute, when Ulises Segura\u2019s cross was inadvertently pushed into the Portland net by Timbers defender Bill Tuiloma, who slid at the ball as goalkeeper Steve Clark came forward.\n\nTake it how you get it. @USeguraCR gets the credit for this one \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f@dcunited goes up 1-0 pic.twitter.com/HK3pHV6HL3 \u2014 Major League Soccer (@MLS) September 15, 2019\n\nWith that, United (12-10-9) remained in the thick of the chase for a top-four finish in the Eastern Conference \u2014 and home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs \u2014 and expanded its cushion for one of the seven postseason berths in the conference to eight points with three matches left.\n\nA victory over the Seattle Sounders next Sunday at Audi Field would clinch a playoff slot.\n\nThe controversy \u2014 and the source of United\u2019s anger and subsequent anxiety \u2014 came in the 38th minute.\n\nThe ball struck Portland\u2019s Eryk Williamson, then caromed off Clark and toward the net. Williamson recovered to clear it, and play continued.\n\nA freeze-frame of the official video replay showed the ball probably crossing the goal line as Williamson made contact. An ESPN replay showed it clearly over the line.\n\nVideo replay, a global innovation that seems to have generated as much controversy as it has alleviated, is supposed to correct such errors.\n\nIn this case, however, video assistant referee Ricardo Salazar did not alert referee Drew Fischer to award a goal or at least review the video.\n\nIn response to a question from a pool reporter, the officiating crew said: \u201cThe decision on the field was that the ball had not fully crossed the line. The VAR checked the play and determined that the available angles did not show a clean error.\u201d\n\nSo United had to settle for a halftime lead of one goal instead of two \u2014 a massive difference on the road against the dangerous Timbers (13-12-4), who are hard to beat on artificial turf.\n\nThey had threatened early in the match when Diego Valeri nodded a 12-yard header off the near post and, over the course of 90 minutes, enjoyed huge advantages on shots (23-7) and percentage of possession (67-33).\n\nIn the second half, Jorge Moreira\u2019s cross took flight and stung the crossbar. United\u2019s Russell Canouse, a natural midfielder starting again at right back, was fortunate to avoid a handball call in the penalty area when the ball popped up and struck him in the arm.\n\nUnited could have put the outcome to rest in the 82nd minute, when, on one of its few quality possessions in the second half, Segura set up Paul Arriola for a clear run. However, Clark, a former D.C. goalkeeper, made a sensational hand save, making just enough contact to direct the ball off the crossbar.\n\nDown the stretch, United blocked shots in the box and did not allow the Timbers to seriously test Bill Hamid, who recorded his 11th shutout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know you\u2019ve got guys in the trenches willing to do what it takes to get results,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThe amount of blocked shots, guys putting their heads in tough spots, clearing balls \u2014 it was just a really great defensive effort.\n\n\u201cWe have recommitted ourselves the last couple weeks to be a team that is very hard to play against. The players have done a good job responding. It starts with us getting to a good defensive structure and understanding we are at our best when we are tough to play against and gritty out there.\u201d\n\nNotes: Forward Ola Kamara, who scored two goals in the previous match, was scratched because of a tight hamstring. Wayne Rooney, who had missed the previous two games because of a red-card suspension, started instead. \u2026\n\nUnited improved to 6-6-4 on the road, the third-best away record in the 24-team league. \u2026\n\nPortland\u2019s starting lineup included two players from the Washington area: Williamson (Alexandria, University of Maryland, D.C. United academy) and nine-goal scorer Jeremy Ebobisse (Walter Johnson High, Bethesda-Olney Soccer Club).\n\nRead more:\n\nAmericans abroad weekend roundup: Lynden Gooch scores in Sunderland victory\n\nSpirit settles for a draw with Reign after late drama at Audi Field\n\n\u2018I am in your head.
