The company is virtually guaranteed to not go public in 2019. How the company will finance itself is now an open question.\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nThe highly-valued company said in a statement that it has \u201cdecided to postpone our IPO to focus on [its] core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong,\u201d and that the management team has \u201cevery intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future.\u201d\n\nThe future is the key operative there. It\u2019s going to take some time to de-poison the company\u2019s cost structure and culture. Regarding the former, the company\u2019s financial woes are well-known (and well-illustrated in its S-1). Turning to the latter, here\u2019s merely the latest in a number of pieces detailing what was wrong at the company.\n\nSo What\n\nThat WeWork is pulling its IPO isn\u2019t a huge surprise. The firm couldn\u2019t generate sufficient investor interest at a fraction of its preceding valuation due to low margins, high costs, and astronomical cash burn. Its founder was found to be in the middle of a web of self-dealing that was impossible to defend. And WeWork\u2019s internal culture and corporate governance were bonkers.\n\nNow the CEO is out, the governance is changed, the non-core businesses are being sold off, layoffs are likely, and the IPO is off. That leaves WeWork with a slimming cost structure, yes, but also a possibly serious cash situation. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve covered before.\n\nIn short, WeWork\u2019s cash burn is astronomical. The firm\u2019s cash immolation in the first half of 2019 was around $2.54 billion, between operations and investing categories. WeWork had $2.47 billion in cash-on-hand at the end of the second quarter of this year (gross cash and equivalents). You can do the math.\n\nProvided that WeWork can dramatically slow its spend, its burn may fall. But the company looks shaky without some money coming in. And now we know that it won\u2019t come from public investors. At least for some time.\n\nSo much for October.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Wilhelm"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MMfeature.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
