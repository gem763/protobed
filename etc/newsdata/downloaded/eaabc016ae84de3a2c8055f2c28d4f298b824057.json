According to top executives at the social media giant, they are \u201cincredibly involved.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because with Facebook under fire from regulators over questions on several fronts including possible antitrust violations, freedom of speech, data security, and national security, the focus of the company\u2019s two top executives reflects the social media giant\u2019s priorities and how it responds to myriad criticisms and challenges.\n\nIn an exclusive interview at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters with the three executives who oversee content at Facebook \u2014 Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management; John DeVine, VP of Global Operations; and Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity \u2014 all three executives spoke at length about the efforts the company was making to moderate content and mitigate and adjudicate hot-button issues like hate speech, misinformation, and hacking. With 2.4 billion monthly users spread globally across the company\u2019s four primary platforms \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger \u2014 it\u2019s no small task.\n\n\u2018The involvement is very deep\u2019\n\nThe three executives who spoke to Yahoo Finance describe the process of navigating sensitive content issues as \u201cnuanced\u201d where intelligent and good-intentioned participants often disagree. And they, and others at the company, spoke of Zuckerberg and Sandberg\u2019s stepped-up involvement in that process.\n\n\u201cAny time that we're dealing with something that is close to the line or it's something where it's not really clear how the policies apply or it's something that's particularly important, we will, at the very least, send an email up to Mark and Sheryl so that they know what's going on,\u201d Bickert told me. \u201cVery often, we will end up having a back-and-forth with them about why we're making the decision we're making, and make sure they're OK with it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Head of Policy Managment Monika Bickert participates in a discussion and question-and-answer session about 'Internet Security and Privacy in the Age of Islamic State' at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy February 26, 2016 in Washington, DC.

But it directed anyone seeing the post to fact-checking sites that described how the footage was manipulated. Bickert also told Anderson Cooper that Facebook \u201cdramatically reduced the distribution\u201d of the post. Soon thereafter a news report says the Pelosi post couldn\u2019t be found on Facebook, though Facebook says it hasn\u2019t been removed. The video appeared on other sites, as well. Twitter kept the video up, while YouTube reportedly took it down, stating that it violated its policies against deceptive practices.\n\nFacebook was widely criticized \u2014 including by Pelosi herself \u2014 for keeping the video up, though again, it appears to be unfindable on Facebook at this point. It\u2019s just one example of what the company has to address, as well as the different responses by its social media competitors. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are all sorts of distorted images of President Donald Trump on social media, including Facebook.\n\nWith the president, as well as high-level Democrats, highly tuned to the vagaries of social media, it\u2019s understandable that Zuckerberg and Sandberg would want to be kept in the loop when these issues crop up. It might also make it difficult, however, for them later to suggest they were out of the loop when it comes to a content issue at the company.", "description": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are \u201cincredibly involved\" with sensitive content issues.", "authors": ["Andy Serwer With Max Zahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UrEJTY1vkzMuYV1v.mTSUA--~B/aD00ODU7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-10/00951610-ce31-11e8-af7b-ff9dfc96fdf5", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
