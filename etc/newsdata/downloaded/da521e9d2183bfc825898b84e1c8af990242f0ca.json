(Luke) won\u2019t be ready.\n\nWelsh winger Daniel James, who has scored three goals in five league games this season, suffered a knock in a 1-0 win over Leicester City last weekend and was unavailable for Thursday\u2019s Europa League victory over Kazakh side Astana.\n\n\u201cDaniel James? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Solskjaer added. \u201cHe\u2019s not trained the last few days. Hopefully, but not sure. We\u2019ll have a recovery day with everyone tomorrow and we\u2019ll see on Saturday.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United's Marcus Rashford has not scored from open play since their opening game of the campaign but while manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says the England forward is not firing on all cylinders he is confident the goals will come.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431952909&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0TS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
