That number is also comparably small for other large U.S. players, including Green Thumb Industries Inc. at 3 per cent and Cresco Labs Inc. at about 1 per cent.\n\nThat gives an outsized influence to individual investors.\n\n\u201cThe stock price is driven by Canadian retail investors, and that Canadian retail investor is a fickle, ignorant investor that doesn\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re investing in,\u201d said Jeff Mascio, chief executive officer of Cannabis One Holdings Inc., a Denver-based pot company.\n\nCannabis One\u2019s share price has slumped 96 per cent from its high on April 23 to a market value of just $17 million (US$13 million). It recently laid off about 20 employees and found some other efficiencies in order to stop burning through cash, and is now focused on raising money from U.S. investors via a private placement. The company reported revenue of US$2.2 million for the quarter ended July 31.\n\nRaising Doubts\n\nMascio said the whole experience made him question whether listing in Canada was worthwhile.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I was like, \u2018That was a complete and utter mistake,\u201d\u2018 he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having to spend a lot of effort on the Canadian public side that\u2019s not delivering a whole lot of results.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, many pot companies haven\u2019t delivered results either, suggesting retail investors unloading their pot stocks aren\u2019t always ignorant. Most have yet to turn a profit, while the black market remains strong in key jurisdictions like Canada and California. In addition, specific cases have made investors wary of the whole sector. CannTrust Holdings Inc. had its license suspended and is the subject of a criminal investigation after it breached regulations, while Hexo Corp. last week cut a quarter of its workforce after saying it wouldn\u2019t meet revenue guidance this year or next.\n\nWe're having to spend a lot of effort on the Canadian public side that's not delivering a whole lot of results Jeff Mascio\n\nThe dominance of retail investors has been an issue even for larger U.S. companies like New York-based Columbia Care Inc., which has lost about two-thirds of its value since April but still has a market value of over $900 million.\n\n\u201cUntil the larger institutional investors in the U.S. begin to look at the sector from a long-term perspective, I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of volatility,\u201d CEO Nicholas Vita said in an interview at the company\u2019s office on Fifth Avenue. \u201cI think you\u2019re also going to see a thematic trend where people are picking baskets rather than picking companies because there\u2019s a lack of information and a lack of time to really sort out the differences between the different operators.\u201d\n\nPrivate Bets\n\nThe business case for investing in the burgeoning cannabis industry hasn\u2019t changed but private companies are currently a better bet, according to Matt Hawkins, founder and managing partner of private equity firm Entourage Effect Capital LLC, formerly known as Cresco Capital Partners.\n\n\u201cThe market\u2019s only going to get bigger and smart investors know that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, unfortunately for the public companies, prices are driven by retail investors who in some cases aren\u2019t savvy enough to be making the buy-sell decisions. They\u2019re losing money that they maybe shouldn\u2019t have been investing in the first place and they\u2019re spooked.\u201d\n\nThis means the trajectory of pot stocks could change dramatically when institutional investors begin to buy in, said Vita.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. investing community, particularly the U.S. institutional investing community, decides to lean in, you\u2019re going to see a massive spike in valuations,\u201d he said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "The trajectory of pot stocks could change dramatically when institutional investors begin to buy in, one expert says", "authors": ["Kristine Owram", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/weedmd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
