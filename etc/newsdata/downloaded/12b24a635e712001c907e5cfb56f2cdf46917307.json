That's where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes.\u201d\n\nTrump also said that Turkey and the Kurds had been \"fighting each other for centuries,\" adding that the Kurds \"didn't help us in the Second World War, they didn't help us with [the D-Day landings in] Normandy.\"\n\nLater, Trump said on Twitter that two British militants known as \"The Beatles\" had been moved out of a detention center in Syria and were in American custody. \"In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles [sic], out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!\"\n\nThe comments came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of military support for Kurdish forces in Syria, and denied it had granted permission for Turkish aggression, saying: \u201cThe United States didn\u2019t give Turkey a green light.\u201d", "description": "The Kurds \u2018didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with [the D-Day landings in] Normandy,\u2019 US president says.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180080522-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
