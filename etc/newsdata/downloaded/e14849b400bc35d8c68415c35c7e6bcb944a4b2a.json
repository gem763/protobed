Verrucas appear on the foot and are more likely to be painful whereas warts may be itchy. Creams or sprays may help treat warts and verrucas, but others may require a trip to a dermatologist or physician.\n\nSolvason told SWNS that within a few months, the spot had grown to the size of a penny, and it was hard to walk on. She was referred to Kidderminster Hospital where a biopsy revealed melanoma.\n\n\u201cThe diagnosis was so hard to take in,\u201d she told SWNS. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the sun but I\u2019m sure the rest of my body has seen more sun than the sole of my foot. Even the consultant was shocked as it didn\u2019t look like a typical melanoma and was in an unusual place.\u201d\n\nGERMAN HOSPITAL'S WASHING MACHINE HARBORED SUPERBUG THAT WAS 'TRANSMITTED REPEATEDLY' TO NEWBORNS: REPORT\n\nThey removed the cancer from her foot, leaving her with a large hole near her heel, but in late 2017 she noticed a lump in her groin, which was later diagnosed as melanoma. She had her lymph nodes removed, but the melanoma returned in her leg last summer, according to SWNS. It was then revealed that the cancer had spread to her lung and stomach lining.\n\n\"To be told you're in the clear and then to be told it has spread further. Then having another operation. It\u2019s just been hard on the whole family,\u201d she told SWNS.\n\nFor some patients, melanoma may never go away completely, according to the American Cancer Society. In these cases, patients may receive regular immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy or other treatments to help keep the cancer under control.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nFor Solvason, she told SWNS that she is currently cancer-free but is receiving immunotherapy every four weeks. She\u2019s also working with Stand Up To Cancer to raise money for research.", "description": "Rachel Solvason, 40, said in 2016 she felt as though there was glass sticking out of the bottom of her foot.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/cancer-woe-mum-418250.jpg"}
