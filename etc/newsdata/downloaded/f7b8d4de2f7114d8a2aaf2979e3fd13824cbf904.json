Here's What to Know", "language": "en", "text": "U.K. officials are asking that diplomatic immunity be waived after the wife of a U.S. diplomat fled England following an August car crash that killed a 19-year-old on his motorcycle.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Superintendent Sarah Johnson confirmed in a statement released on Saturday that a 42-year-old American woman \u2014 who is a suspect in a car crash that killed Harry Dunn on Aug. 27 \u2014 left the county, even after telling authorities she had no plans to do so.\n\n\u201cNorthamptonshire Police followed all of its usual procedures following the incident, including liaising closely with the suspect, who engaged fully with us at the time and had previously confirmed to us that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future,\u201d Johnson said in the statement. \u201cDue process was also followed in seeking the necessary documentation to allow for the arrest and formal interview of the suspect, and the force is now exploring all opportunities through diplomatic channels to ensure that the investigation continues to progress.\u201d\n\nThe suspect, who Northamptonshire Police have identified as the wife of a U.S. diplomat, has not been named by the U.S. Embassy, citing privacy and security concerns.\n\n\u201cHarry Dunn\u2019s family deserves justice and in order to achieve this, a full and thorough investigation, with the assistance of all parties involved, needs to take place,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nWhat happened in the crash\n\nPolice said in an August statement that Dunn\u2019s motorbike was hit head-on by a Volvo after exiting the Royal Air Force Croughton air station in Northamptonshire, England, around 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 27. The suspect was driving on the wrong side of the road, Northamptonshire police said.\n\nDunn died later at the nearby John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, police said.\n\nThe debate over diplomatic immunity\n\nNick Adderley, Chief Constable for Northamptonshire Police, tweeted Sunday that as the wife of a U.S. diplomat, the suspect is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Adderley added he and Steven Mold, Northamptonshire Police Fire and Crime Commissioner have written \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d to the U.S. Embassy to urge them to waive immunity \u201cin order to allow the justice process to take place.\u201d\n\nThe short answer is yes. Both @Stephen_Mold and I have written, in the strongest terms, to the US Embassy urging them to apply the diplomatic immunity waiver in order to allow the justice process to take place. https://t.co/OKmRXLhJhO \u2014 Nick Adderley (@NorthantsChief) October 6, 2019\n\nBut U.K. officials may be facing an uphill battle. A State Department official told TIME in a statement that diplomatic immunity is \u201crarely waived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in this tragic traffic accident,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cAny questions regarding a waiver of the immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived. The U.S. Embassy has been and will continue to be in close contact with British officials.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, foreign diplomats and their family members are given certain protections that allow them to avoid arrest for almost any crime unless the diplomat\u2019s home country decides to waive immunity.\n\nMatt Zierler, Associate Professor of International Relations at Michigan State University, told TIME diplomatic immunity is considered a \u201ccornerstone of diplomacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the most part diplomats, especially the highest-ranking officials, have complete immunity over what they do and usually it extends to families, \u201d he tells TIME. \u201cThat\u2019s embedded into international law because really, its the cornerstone of diplomacy. It\u2019s one of those reciprocal actions that states grant each other in order to allow diplomacy to take place.\u201d\n\nZierler says he does not believe the U.S. will waive immunity for the suspect in Dunn\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe tend to have a broad expansive nature of diplomatic immunity because the U.S. would rather have a system that works smoothly, even in a case where an individual may have gotten caught violating the law,\u201d he says. \u201cThe larger purpose of keeping diplomacy open and trusting when we send diplomats and their families elsewhere is that they will be free from detention from another country. And the reciprocal, we do the same for diplomats in the United States.\u201d", "description": "U.K. officials are asking that diplomatic immunity be waived", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T7hcM7Kt9DJEZzhOLoUHTA--~B/aD03OTk7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3cb5c393a0d29cd8d37c9b3def2d0351", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
