(Photo: Jeff Curry, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nST. LOUIS \u2013 Daniel Hudson\u2019s journey from playoff hero to paternity leave and back again had the happiest of endings Saturday, as he returned to the warm embrace of a supportive clubhouse and a team on the verge of a World Series bid.\n\nHudson, bleary-eyed after the birth of his third daughter, Millie, hopped a 6 a.m. Southwest flight out of Phoenix on Saturday morning and landed after 11 a.m. in St. Louis, where he ultimately recorded the save in the Washington Nationals\u2019 3-1 victory in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series.\n\nThe Nationals won Game 1 without him, 2-0, and lead the NLCS by that same margin. Meanwhile, in the time it took Hudson\u2019s wife, Sara, to get into the hospital, have labor induced and give birth, Hudson\u2019s absence became something of a debate on employee obligation and parental leave.\n\nNationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle earned the save in Game 1.

Hudson then retired the Cardinals\u2019 two most dangerous right-handed hitters, Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna, on a fly ball and foul pop-up to end it.\n\nAnd Hudson, after a 72-hour odyssey that took him from Los Angeles to Phoenix to St. Louis, could ponder a good night\u2019s sleep before the Nationals return to Washington on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPretty well,\u201d he said when asked how he\u2019d sleep Saturday night.", "description": "Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle had some choice words for those criticizing teammate Daniel Hudson for taking paternity leave during NLCS.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
