Kumgang Resort", "language": "en", "text": "North Korea on Tuesday rejected South Korea's proposal of talks to discuss the situation surrounding halted tours to the North's Mt. Kumgang resort and a sprawling South Korean-funded hotel complex there.\n\nThe South had proposed working-level talks a day earlier to \"discuss a new development direction\" for the scenic resort and stop the North demolishing the facilities. But North Korea sent a notification to South Korea that it will go ahead with the demolition \"by exchanging documents without the need to hold working-level talks.\"\n\nLast Wednesday, state media revealed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered the destruction of \"all the unsightly facilities\" built with South Korean money in the early millennium, when a brief thaw got package tours to the mountain underway.\n\nThe government appeared unfazed and still busy trying to resuscitate the doomed cross-border venture, which was halted when a North Korean soldier shot dead a South Korean tourist in Mt. Kumgang in 2010.\n\n", "description": "N.Korea Rejects Talks Over Mt.
