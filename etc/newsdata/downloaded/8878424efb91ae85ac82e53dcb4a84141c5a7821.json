All states will use a large percentage of their settlements to reimburse federal Medicaid programs.\n\nSuboxone is a drug that reduces withdrawal symptoms and is used to wean heroin and opioid users off the addictive drugs while they are undergoing treatment. The medication and its active ingredient, buprenorphine, are still addictive.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, a multistate investigation showed that Reckitt Benckiser knowingly promoted Suboxone to doctors, who later prescribed the drugs for unsafe, ineffective and medically unnecessary uses.\n\n\u201cMisrepresenting the characteristics of any drug can have dangerous consequences for public health,\u201d West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) said in a statement. \u201cSuch conduct also steals precious resources from Medicaid and jeopardizes the program for those who need it most. We cannot tolerate such behavior and look forward to rooting out more fraud in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nThe company was also accused of attempting to improperly delay Food and Drug Administration approval of generic versions of the drug so it could remain in control of the drug\u2019s pricing, allowing the company to extend the time frame it could keep the price of Suboxone high.\n\nIn addition to the $700 million in state and federal settlements, the company agreed to forfeit $647 million to resolve a criminal investigation of its subsidiary Indivior, which marketed and sold Suboxone. The company also agreed to pay $50 million to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nAs part of the agreement, there was no determination of liability. When the settlement was first announced in July, the company denied the allegations and said it \u201cacted lawfully at all times.\u201d", "description": "A United Kingdom\u2013based opioid manufacturer has agreed to pay millions of dollars to a group of states\u00a0as part of a settlement over how the company marketed its opioid addiction treatment medication.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/opioids_102017getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
