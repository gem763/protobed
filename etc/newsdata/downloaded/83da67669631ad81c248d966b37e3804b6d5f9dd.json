Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nEconomic mainstay\n\nThe British Meat Processors Association represents the majority of companies working in the British meat industry, handling beef, lamb and pork products.\n\nIts members are responsible for supplying fresh meat and meat products to retailers, restaurants and food service companies throughout the UK.\n\nThe industry employs about 75,000 people and is worth more than \u00a37bn a year to the British economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK poultry industry employs more than 37,000 people and contributes more than \u00a33bn a year to the economy.\n\nA spokesperson for the British Poultry Council said the industry had grown \"beyond the UK labour availability in the areas we operate\".\n\nThis meant that it needed to find 7,200 non-UK workers every year to fill its vacancies.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"If these vacancies cannot be filled post-Brexit, we will not have access to the labour needed to feed this nation, which will have a significant impact on the production of, and therefore cost of food.\n\n\"This in turn would pose a risk to the affordability of British food.\"", "description": "Pigs in blankets might be scarce this Christmas because of labour shortages, says the meat industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25C8/production/_109427690_pib_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
