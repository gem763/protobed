He\u2019ll call on specific players to act on certain areas of the game, and to take leadership and control there.\n\n\"Ultimately, he surrounds himself with a mini-leadership group that really makes his job and his role a whole lot easier.\n\n\"But I think most importantly, at the end of the day, all that matters is that you lead by example in terms of your play, and I think he has been playing fantastic rugby.\"\n\nKick-off on Saturday is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Siya Kolisi has fully grasped his role as Springbok captain, says team-mate and loose forward companion Francois Louw.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7982/83756d4d1bd54f70be6a794b5535f437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
