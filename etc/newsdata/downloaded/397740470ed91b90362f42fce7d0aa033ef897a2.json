An American staple and iconic industrial company that has employed hundreds of thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of Americans over the years and paid benefits loyally to its workforce showed yet another flicker, like the incandescent bulbs it famously made.\n\nThe second: the American pension.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret the private-sector pension is on its last breaths. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of Fortune 500 companies that offer a traditional pension plan has fallen from 59% to 16%, according to Willis Towers Watson. Pension plan freezes have been on the rise as well.\n\nFor the entire workforce, only 4% of today\u2019s workforce has access to a traditional defined benefit pension plan, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nGE has frozen its pension for 20,000 workers and is offering buyouts to others. It marks another step in the death of the pension. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More\n\nBut the fact that GE, the shining example of a one-company-for-life, is shelving the practice and pushing the existing employees into 401(k)s is one of the last nails in the coffin for this retirement planning option. Similar corporate titans like IBM (IBM) and Boeing (BA) ceased pensions in the 2000s.\n\nIn the post-pension world, the risk shifts to the employee\n\nPensions and 401(k)s both provide means to save for retirement and to pay money out, but the way they accrue money has one key difference: who owns the risk and responsibility of investment management.\n\nFor a pension, the company and employee pay into a pool of money. Then the company invests that money and hopes that it\u2019s enough to pay a defined benefit when the employee retires. If the company isn\u2019t a successful investor and the money in the portfolio doesn\u2019t grow enough, the company has to pay the difference out of its own profits. According to JPMorgan Asset Management, the last 10 years have seen the funding of top pensions drop from over 100% (assets to liabilities) to around 84%.\n\nFor a 401(k) however, the individual takes on all the risk. They must do all the investing and administrative work, and then must hope the market gods smile down on them and that the amounts they decide they can take out every month are enough to live on \u2014 but not too much so they\u2019ll run out.\n\nPension access has plummeted to 4% of the workforce More\n\nWith the death of the pension comes a great big hole in the American concept of retirement, a hole leaves stress and uncertainty.\n\nCompanies have been pivoting towards 401(k) plans for quite some time, as it\u2019s much less costly. In many respects, it makes a lot of sense. Particularly because it\u2019s portable. Workers don\u2019t stay at one company their entire working lives anymore \u2014 they jump around and need a retirement framework with savings that can follow them.\n\nA long life is now a \u2018risk\u2019\n\nAs Brookings fellow and pension expert. Mark Iwry, has noted, \u201clongevity risk\u201d of outliving your savings presents an extremely challenging dilemma. How can you use a life expectancy table, when there\u2019s a 50% chance you will end up on the wrong side.\n\nThe 401(k) and IRA plans may offer people means to mimic what pensions have done in the past, but in addition to placing the risk of investment failure on employees and retirees, they also place the work. In their glory years, pensions were ingrained into company culture. In the case of GE, the company\u2019s famously generous pension was sometimes a key reason people chose to work there. Contrast this with today. Many companies offer 401(k) plans and many of them even automatically enroll employees into them and match contributions up to a point.", "description": "GE has frozen its pension for 20,000 workers and is offering buyouts to others.
