It explains a lot.\n\nEvery million people who march, every school pupil who sacks off lessons to protest, every 1,000 people who take a day off work to sit in the road, are doing two brilliant things.\n\nFirstly, they are doing a fine job of showing politicians how concerned large numbers of people are about single-use plastics, fossil fuels, cars, and a lack of legislation that binds humans into reducing their use of these things. The fact a large number of them are under 30 will be why politicians with an eye to getting re-elected might actually do something about it, and the world owes a fist-bump to Greta Thunberg for inspiring it.\n\nAnd the second is that, by demonstrating how thick large numbers of people are capable of being, it's highlighting the real cause of climate change.\n\nThe truth is that about two-thirds of those protesters need to not exist.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf every single person blocking a road in London today were to foreswear meat, farm their own vegetables, wear recycled clothing, rely on cockroaches for protein, use only hydrogen-powered public transport, drink water from a socialist aquifer and never fly to Ibiza again, it would not stop global warming.\n\nIf every single person on the planet were to do the same, it might slow down the temperature increase a bit, but at the expense of collapsing the global economy, causing mass starvation, wars and the spread of apocalyptic religious fundamentalism, none of which is particularly 'green'.\n\nThere are 7.7 billion people on the planet.\n\nExperts reckon that's about 5 billion too many.\n\nIf you really want to save the Earth, it means getting rid of 66% of human beings.\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\nThere are plenty of candidates for a cull, of course. But even if you could nominate all your enemies, it still wouldn't be enough.\n\nIf the UK was to become carbon-neutral, it doesn't just involve throwing up wind turbines. Because those turbines are built with steel, which is made by burning coal. The inner workings, the outer shell, the blades, the components, the turbines - all use steel.\n\nSolar panels rely on mining minerals to make photo-voltaic cells. Electric cars need lithium and cadmium for rechargeable batteries that are too toxic for landfill. If you want to buy your veg in a paper bag rather than wrapped in plastic, you'll need to devote land to growing the plants just to make the paper to wrap other plants in, power and resources to pulp, mash, roll, dry and glue it, and you'll still be using insane amounts of water to wash the mud off your carrots before anyone'll buy them.\n\nThere is not a single Extinction Rebellion protester who has yet been seen waving a placard demanding an end to smartphones, iPads, or computers. Yet the tantalum capacitors which make each of those possible are mined by children, in wars that rage because of the money involved, and are flown and shipped around the world, giving them some of the most blood-soaked carbon footprints it is possible to leave.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSitting cross-legged on the floor can achieve a lot. Just ask Gandhi. But it helps if you have a workable plan.\n\nExtinction Rebellion rightly says our climate is changing. It correctly pinpoints human behaviour as the cause, and therefore the solution. And, very succinctly, it has 3 demands produced by committee and which they want introduced as law.\n\nIt wants the government to declare a climate emergency; act to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and that all future ecological decisions must be made by a citizens' assembly.\n\nWhich is just dandy. So long as you can find a group of citizens prepared to commit either mass murder or mass suicide.\n\nSo a religious cult, then.\n\n(Image: James Beck/Freelance)\n\nYou'll never get governments to collapse their own economies. If you could, we'd have Brexited by now.\n\nYou'll never get humans to stop using the internet, or electricity, or personal vehicles, or steel, or mortar, or dredging up river sand, or building roads, or burning stuff, whether it's oil or gas or wood or their bank statements.\n\nThere are many middle-class, educated, concerned people who've just taken a day off work to protest, without noticing their privilege, house, education and work all rely on things which damage the environment in some way. But even a rag-clad, unwashed, bare-footed, career hippy at a roadblock does not want to turn off the NHS, its cancer scans, its replacement joints, or the brain implants helping the paralysed to walk again.\n\nPerhaps you'd like to argue the Earth could bear all that good stuff, if we just stop doing the bad. Tell the class how you will persuade the developing world to forego all hope of ever gaining the luxuries we take for granted, as well as the guns. Because unless the whole species acts together, it cannot work.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nThis is not to say that there isn't a fix. It's just the solution would be massively unwelcome to all those worried mums-of-three, divorced-dads with blended families, and much-loved siblings who are taking part in the protests.\n\nA worldwide single child policy might reduce the human population to a level acceptable to Mother Nature within 50 years or so. But it would require mass criminalisation, zillions in fines, social upheaval, and an ageing population with every 4 grandparents and 2 parents having to be sustained, in their old age, by the economic productivity of just 1 adult.\n\nIt would mean more abortions, more infant deaths, and gross state invasion of privacy. There'd be fewer consumers, lower tax revenue, more robots at work.\n\nBut hey, more water! Guilt-free plane trips! Steak for all, at last!\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe only thing that's caused more extinction than humans is the meteor which ended the age of the dinosaurs. And if we don't get our climate balanced, we might not live long enough to be wiped out by the next meteor. There's no harm in protesting that, although it's not clear how blowing whistles and getting nicked is going to solve anything beyond a chronic need for attention.\n\nThese protests irritate all the right people, but they're nothing more than a token nod towards a problem we don't want to really fix. The Earth needs an extinction - ours.\n\nEveryone doing a little bit to be less awful would help. But it'd help even more if everyone did something big, and chose to limit the number of children they poison the planet with. Because it's humans that are toxic, not carbon.\n\nOne less is a lot less. And no-one really needs 5, do they?", "description": "Extinction Rebellion wants humans to be nicer.
