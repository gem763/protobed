Add China as an interest to stay up to date on the latest China news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nOutside Hong Kong\u2019s Government complex, armed riot police stood guard though very few protesters could be seen while inside But as Lam entered the city's Legislative Council chamber, the only thing that could be heard however were chants of \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d being shouted from pro-democracy lawmakers.\n\nThe policy speech, which was expected to focus on land supply, housing and spending on livelihood matters in hopes of cooling down public anger was quickly cut short as Lam was escorted out of the chamber minutes after arriving.\n\nNot willing to go down without a fight, Lam returned 20 minutes later in a second attempt. That too proved to be infeasible as opposition lawmakers continued to shout, blare protest sounds from a portable speaker and project the \u201cfive demands not one less\u201d on the wall behind the Chief Executive.\n\nSome lawmakers were seen wearing paper masks of China\u2019s President Xi Jinping \u2013 a not so subtle nod to the newly enacted ban on wearing face masks.\n\nEd Jones/AFP via Getty Images\n\nYet despite her best effort to speak, Lam\u2019s voice was drowned out and, for a second time in less than 30 minutes, she was escorted out of the chamber flanked by security, this time being heckled all the way to the exit door.\n\nThe meeting was quickly adjourned and Lam, rather than attempting a third time to deliver her speech on the chamber floor per tradition, opted to issue it be pre-recorded video.\n\nIn the video, Lam spoke of the current unrest rocking Hong Kong saying \u201cWhile we respect different opinions and understand people\u2019s enthusiasm in fighting for justice and rights, I believe our society will agree that continued violence and spread of hatred would erode the core values of Hong Kong, disrupt social peace and undermine the excellent system that took years of efforts to build.\u201d\n\nLam emphasized citizens\u2019 rights to protest, however she made it clear that there was a red line not to be crossed saying \u201cany act that advocates Hong Kong\u2019s independence and threaten the country\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe protest movement which began in early June and has since grown increasingly violent started as a response to a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed suspected criminals in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial. Lam has since withdrawn that bill but protests continue.\n\nIn the closing of her video address, Lam said law and social order needs to be restored as \u201cearly as possible\u201d so that Hong Kong \u201cwill soon be able to emerge from the storm and embrace the rainbow.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Lam said she would once again listen to the concerns of Hong Kong citizens in a public forum. This time however, she will interact with netizens through Facebook on Thursday night.\n\nPatrick Sum contributed to this report", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
