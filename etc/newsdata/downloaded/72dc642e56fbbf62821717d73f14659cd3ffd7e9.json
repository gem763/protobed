Talks will continue throughout the day in Brussels as the two sides try to agree on how far Northern Ireland will be detached from the EU\u2019s customs union -- something that risks incurring the opposition of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose support will be vital for any deal to pass.\n\nOfficials may even have a draft legal text ready for diplomats to scrutinize on Wednesday, two people said. Earlier, the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal is possible this week -- but talks remain tough.\n\nAll time stamps are Brussels time (CET).\n\nKey developments:\n\nU.K. submits new proposals to resolve impasseA hard Brexit remains a tail risk which is simply too big to ignoreJohnson still needs to persuade his Northern Irish allies\n\nNegotiators Closing In on Draft Brexit Deal (4:30 p.m.)\n\nU.K. and EU negotiators in Brussels are closing in on a draft Brexit deal with optimism that there will be a breakthrough before the end of Tuesday, two EU officials said.\n\nAny draft legal text will hinge on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson believes he has the support of the U.K. Parliament -- crucially including the backing of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party. The pound extended its gain to more than 1% against the dollar.\n\nSaturday Sitting Will Depend on Talks: Rees-Mogg (3:15 p.m.)\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said it still hasn\u2019t been decided if the U.K. Parliament should meet on Saturday, and events at the summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday will determine if it does.\n\n\u201cThe events that might require a Saturday sitting have not yet reached their fruition,\u201d Rees-Mogg told the House of Commons. \u201cIt will only happen if we have something, subject to what happens in European Council, to debate on Saturday.\u201d\n\nHe said Parliament meeting on a Saturday for only the fourth time in 70 years would be necessary to fulfill the terms of the Benn Act, which requires Boris Johnson to write to the EU to request an extension if a Brexit agreement has not been reached by then. Chris Leslie, a Labour MP who backed the legislation, said it does not need Parliament to meet for the law to be obeyed.\n\nFinnish PM Says U.K. Making \u2018Real Effort\u2019 (1:45 p.m.)\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne said an extension to Brexit may come up at the EU leaders\u2019 summit at the end of the week and there are grounds to consider it.\n\nRinne, whose views are significant because his country holds the rotating presidency of the bloc, also said it\u2019s possible an extra summit on Brexit will be needed before the end of the month. \u201cIt makes sense to try to reach a common view until the last moment,\u201d Rinne told reporters in Helsinki.\n\n\u201cFor the first time during this process I have a feeling the U.K. is making a real effort,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain\u2019s actions have shown it is seeking a deal to avoid a hard Brexit.\u201d\n\nJohnson, Macron Had \u2018Constructive\u2019 Brexit Call (12:48 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson discussed Brexit with French President Emmanuel Macron in a 20 minute phone call, Johnson\u2019s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters in London.\n\n\u201cIt was constructive. I would say it was a good discussion,\u201d Slack said, without giving further details of the discussion.\n\nThe U.K. is working hard to reach a deal with the bloc as time runs short before Thursday\u2019s summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Slack said.\n\nThe Pound Pares Earlier Gains (12:25 p.m.)\n\nAfter rallying on Barnier\u2019s comments that a deal is possible this week, the pound pared some of its gains, as details emerged from the meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg, in which remaining sticking points were highlighted.\n\nIt was still up by 0.3% against the dollar as of 12:20 p.m in Brussels, amid cautious optimism that an accord is within grasp. The whipsaw between positive and skeptical headlines pushed one-week volatility to its highest since July 2016.\n\nFrance Says U.K. Made Serious Brexit Proposal (12:14 p.m.)\n\nThe French government believes that the U.K. presented a \u201cserious proposal\u201d to exit the EU, though it\u2019s too early to say if there will be a deal by the European summit later this week.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.British negotiators submitted a revised set of Brexit plans to Brussels amid growing optimism that a deal could be struck this week.The new proposals are aimed at clarifying the U.K.\u2019s suggested customs rules", "authors": ["Jonathan Stearns", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qWtPMaF.4TQ1JOnywk_iXg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/e77dd1c32d48aafe8044dac6a37563fb", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
