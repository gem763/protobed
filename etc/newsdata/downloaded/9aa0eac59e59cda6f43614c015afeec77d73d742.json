She began making scarves, napkins and teatowels using the Victorian Liberty prints she loved, but couldn\u2019t find in the shops.\n\nThe company branched out into clothes, with smock shirts and dresses, and the 1970s and early 1980s were the blockbuster years, with more than 70 shops.\n\nThen, after Laura died in 1985, the company floundered when fashion changed \u2014 90s minimalism and frilly blouses did not go.\n\nBut in recent seasons, there\u2019s been a return to sepia-toned femininity, florals and nostalgia.\n\nSo why on earth has Laura Ashley waited until now to grab a slice of the puff-sleeved pie? The verdict? Some pretty, well-designed pieces \u2014 but not quite the same trend-setting, dream-inspiring X-factor that made my 11-year-old heart beat faster.\n\nTop, \u00a355, Laura Ashley; trousers, \u00a3130, Jigsaw; shoes, \u00a3245, Russell & Bromley", "description": "Jess Wood revealed a selection of the best items in Laura Ashley's new Pimlico Collection.
