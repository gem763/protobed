A second strike this year would trigger a further vote on whether to spill the board and force all directors to stand for re-election.\n\nCynics say that, in this position, bank directors will act in self-interest rather than risk losing their lucrative board seats.\n\n'There's no way (boards) want to risk a second strike' \u2014 Anonymous banker\n\n\"The board will act in the board's interest,'' shrugged one banker. \"There's no way they want to risk a second strike, so they'll do whatever is required to avoid it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther bankers say the financial performance of all the major banks has suffered in the low interest rate environment. At the same time, the remediation bills of many banks continue to climb as their investigations into past misconduct have uncovered other problems.\n\nThe combination of lacklustre financial results and mounting compensation costs makes it all the easier for bank boards to justify taking an axe to senior executives' bonuses.\n\nBut some of the country's top directors are not persuaded that bank boards should blindly follow the CBA's lead.\n\nThey say CBA and NAB were subjected to the greatest shaming by the Hayne royal commission and Westpac and ANZ fared much better.\n\nThis puts Westpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted and ANZ chairman David Gonski in a much more difficult position.\n\n(NAB's acting chief executive Phil Chronican, who took the reins following the abrupt departure of the bank's previous boss, Andrew Thorburn in February wisely decided to take fixed salary with no bonus entitlement).\n\nSaid one of the country's most highly regarded directors: \"No doubt everyone's bonuses will be cut a bit. But I wouldn't be halving people's bonuses.\n\n\"I wouldn't be saying 'CBA has done it, so we should do it', because then how do you reward people for having done better?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the same, in the febrile atmosphere at present, bank directors could well decide that the most prudent course of action is to avoid further controversy by following the CBA's lead.", "description": "Already under attack over their failure to pass on official interest rate cuts in full, now the country's financial chiefs have a new source of angst", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98b5642c288c5930cd002a8aa68194effdc66b76", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
