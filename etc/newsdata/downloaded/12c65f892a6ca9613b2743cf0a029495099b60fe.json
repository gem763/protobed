It noted the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, a Canadian exchange-traded fund that tracks cannabis stocks, is down 47% since March.\n\n\u201cThe underperformance has made it increasingly more critical to allocate capital efficiently, given the current industry headwinds,\u201d MedMen said in a news release.\n\nThe deal was announced in December and was seen as a forerunner of a wave of marijuana industry mergers and acquisitions promising big returns for investors.\n\nBillions poured into marijuana stocks last year as investors got on board with the big, multistate operators with the funds to acquire costly licenses in the 11 states where it is legal to sell cannabis products.\n\nA flurry of deals in late 2018 and early this year continued to entice investors. But hopes of mergers getting quick regulatory approval soon faded as the U.S. Justice Department began to review the deals for potential antitrust violations. That review process has yet to be completed, though some analysts expect the deals could begin closing as early as this month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a delay in M&A; activity and that\u2019s prompted investors to step away from the sector until they know M&A; activity is going to pick up again,\u201d said Bobby Burleson, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of dampened enthusiasm for the sector, because that was one exit path that looked like it was closed temporarily.\u201d\n\nInvestors have had no shortage of reasons lately to sour on marijuana stocks, beyond the delay in deal approvals.\n\nVaping-related deaths and illnesses have contributed to the slide in some cannabis stocks. States including Massachusetts and Montana have also temporarily banned sales of flavored electronic cigarettes and vaping products in a bid to reduce underage use.\n\nVaping of marijuana products in states where it is legal for adults account for over a quarter of revenue for the sector and, in some cases, 30% or more of sales, Burleson said.\n\n\u201cPeople are waiting to see whether or not there\u2019s been a negative impact over all on industry revenue,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso weighing on marijuana stocks is a increase in stock market volatility brought about by a slowing U.S. economy and uncertainty over the trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nStill, cannabis stocks are a big loser so far this year, relative to the broader market.\n\nConsider, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange traded fund, which focuses on cannabis stocks: It is down 19.6% this year and off nearly 50% from a year ago. And shares in some of the biggest marijuana companies, including Tilary, Canopy Growth, and Aurora Cannabis are down more than 50% from a year ago.\n\nMany big companies that have invested in cannabis businesses are also down more than 10% from a year ago, including Altria Group, AbbVie, Molson Coors Brewing and Constellation Brands.\n\nBy comparison, the benchmark S&P; 500 index is up 15.4% this year and hovering slightly above where it stood 12 months ago.\n\nA less welcoming stock market can limit a company\u2019s ability to raise capital by issuing stock. MedMen noted that a large portion of PharmaCann\u2019s cultivation and manufacturing assets requires \u201csignificant capital expenditures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot less ability to go to the markets and raise capital, so investors are scrutinizing the balance sheets of public companies to see who\u2019s best positioned to weather the dry spell in capital markets,\u201d Burleson said.\n\nNow that it has backed out of its bid for PharmaCann, MedMen said it intends to focus on building its retail brand and online business. In exchange for forgiving some debt, the company is taking certain cannabis licenses and other assets in Illinois and Virginia from PharmaCann.\n\n\u201cLooking at the PharmaCann portfolio today, Illinois has emerged as the most attractive opportunity for our longer-term, strategic growth plan,\u201d said Adam Bierman, MedMen co-founder and CEO.\n\n___\n\nVeiga is a member of AP\u2019s marijuana beat team.
