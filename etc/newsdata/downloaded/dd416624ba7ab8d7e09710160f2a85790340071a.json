We don't have to live up to a style or any expectation that we had in the past. It's more so just how we're going to walk into this new chapter with a fresh start. That's easier to say with a new building than with the sights and sounds of Oracle, honestly, with all that happened in that building.\n\n'So I'm excited about that part for sure because if you're a newcomer to this team or one of the young guys, you know about it, but you kind of don't know what it feels like. This can be something that we create on our own, and that will be special and an advantage for us.'\n\nThe Warriors have a new home in the form of the Chase Center in San Francisco\n\nThe Western Conference is set to be tougher than ever with both the LA Lakers and Clippers providing huge competition for the Warriors.\n\nThe likes of the Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets, Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers will also be right in the mix but Curry insists every team remain wary of the threat of the Warrriors.\n\n'I mean, every year since we've been at this stage, every team is trying to get better, to knock us off when we won or just retool to win a championship,' the 31-year-old said.\n\n'That's what everybody is in this business to do. You know, look at every era of basketball, for a team to sustain this type of level of play and this greatness, it doesn't happen that often, and when you need to retool, it may look different, but the great teams, great players figure it out as they go.\n\nCurry's team have appeared in the last five NBA Finals but have many doubters this season\n\n'So no surprise there's a lot of talent and a lot of powerful line-ups that you look at, Western Conference, Eastern Conference, whatever it is. But we want to be a team that's feared across the league. When you see us on the schedule, regular season, we get to the playoffs, that they know what they're in for.\n\n'It doesn't mean that people are going to say we're the greatest or pick us as favorites or whatnot, but you know who those teams are, and we're going to be one of them.'\n\nSteph Curry's Golden State Warriors will feature as part of a record 48-games being broadcast at Primetime in Europe on Sky Sports this season.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Warriors have a new home in the form of the Chase Center in San Francisco after nearly 50 years spent playing at the Oracle Arena.", "authors": ["Spencer Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19754730-0-image-a-33_1571164245287.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
