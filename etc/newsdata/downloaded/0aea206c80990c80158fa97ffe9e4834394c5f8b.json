Then the whole character was cut from the Pixar film, which gets its digital release Tuesday, arriving on Blu-ray Oct. 8.\n\n\"It pained me to take Rib Tickles out,\" says director Josh Cooley.\n\nOfficer Tickles was supposed to star as the beloved former partner of Officer Giggle McDimples (voiced by Ally Maki), the miniature head of Pet Patrol and main confidante of Bo Peep (Annie Potts).\n\nReview: 'Toy Story 4' is one fun and rollicking existential crisis after another\n\nWas this the final 'Toy Story'? 5 signs that Pixar will make 'Toy Story 5'\n\nRib Tickles was eaten by a cat in \"Toy Story 4\" and then ended up on the cutting room floor. (Photo: PIXAR)\n\nThere was depth and pathos to this cop story. The usually chirpy McDimples recalled losing her partner prior to the movie: Officer Tickles had been eaten by the toy-hating cat who guarded the antique store.\n\n\"We had this film noir-like scene where Giggle just stares at a picture of Rib Tickles on her desk,\" says Cooley. \"She\u2019s lost in thought and says, 'Officer Rib Tickles, best darn cop that the Pet Patrol ever had.' \"\n\nCLOSE Want to bring your favorite new 'Toy Story 4' character home?

Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nAdds Valerie LaPointe, the head of the film's story: \"And there was a joke in there, of (Rib's death) happening right before his retirement, playing into the cop tropes of movies and TV.\"\n\nCooley even had Maki voice Giggle's mournful ode to her lost partner.\n\nRib's role was supposed to blossom during the film's major action sequence where Woody (Tom Hanks) and Bo break into the antique store to rescue the kidnapped Forky (Tony Hale). The same cat swallowed Giggle in the mayhem, but the officer was coughed out and escaped.\n\nWoody (left, voiced by Tom Hanks) rekindles his relationship with Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and meets her best friend Giggle McDimples (Ally Maki) in \"Toy Story 4.\" (Photo: PIXAR)\n\nThe filmmakers had come up with a twist where, after Giggle was expelled, Rib, too, was shockingly coughed out of the cat, alive and well.\n\nRough versions of the scene were previewed internally, which went over big with much laughter. The director dreamed of casting Pixar regular Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to voice the dog, the final cherry on the joke.\n\nBut the hilarious segment was ultimately deemed a distraction from the main story.\n\n\"It was too funny. It felt like a large set-up for something we were not fully paying off,\" says Cooley, ruefully. \"We worked so hard to craft a moment, capture it with timing, and it played great.\"\n\n\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThat\u2019s Giggle McDimple\u2019s beat partner, Officer Rib Tickles. He added to the world, but not the story so his existence was cut from the film. Ironically, he was inside the store cat for most of the movie anyway so you never really saw him. https://t.co/sxosoCob2e \u2014 Josh Cooley (@CooleyUrFaceOff) August 16, 2019\n\nEagle-eyed Pixar fans have noticed Rib Tickles made it onto some \"Toy Story 4\" merchandise. But the dog never had his movie moment.\n\nThere's a happy final note, however. Rib Tickles will appear this fall in the Disney+ spinoff short film series \"Forky Asks A Question,\" now as a female officer voiced by Aloma Wright. Producer Mark Nielsen says the clueless Forky will ask Rib, \"What is a pet?\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re able to give Rib new life,\" says Nielsen. \"What was a 'Toy Story 4' tragedy is a gain for the 'Forky' short films.\"\n\nThe prospect thrills Cooley. \"I love that Rib exists somewhere within the universe,\" he says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/01/toy-story-4-tragically-deleted-giggle-mcdimples-dog-partner/3807566002/", "description": "Officer Rib Tickles met a tragic end, death by cat, in \"Toy Story 4,\" before being cut from the movie.
