It was only Schiff\u2019s made up version of that conversation that was bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nThe mischaracterization of President Trump\u2019s July 25th call with Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky by a partisan CIA officer sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. In a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint, the officer alleged the president pressured Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden \u2014 a charge both world leaders deny. In recent days, several reports have raised red flags regarding the officer\u2019s credibility. According to the Washington Examiner, the officer is not only a registered Democrat but also previously worked with Biden in the White House during the Obama administration.\n\nNonetheless, Wallace has claimed that the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe is worth pursuing.\n\n\u201cIt may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there\u2019s going to be something here for Congress to investigate, whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don\u2019t know,\u201d the anchor said during a recent broadcast.", "description": "President Trump once again took aim at Fox News' Chris Wallace over his coverage of the president's telephone call with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-615697002-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
