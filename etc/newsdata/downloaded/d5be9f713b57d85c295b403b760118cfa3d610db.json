NPM provides a free, popular tool for coding in JavaScript, one of the world's most popular programming languages. Its free package registry powers much of the software that runs the internet.\n\nBogensberger's resignation is effective immediately, and he plans to pursue new opportunities. Bogensberger was asked to leave by the board, reports The Register, citing sources familiar. We've reached out for more details and will update when we know more.\n\n\"I am proud of the complete transformation we have been able to make in such a short period of time,\" Bogensberger said in a statement. \"I wish this completely revamped, passionate team monumental success in the years to come.\"\n\nUnder Bogensberger's tenure, NPM tried to break its reliance on venture capital by expanding into the lucrative enterprise market, trying to nab large companies as customers.\n\nHowever, as Business Insider reported in August, Bogensberger's time at the company was marked by controversy. In March, the company was criticized for how it handled the dismissal of 10% of its staff \u2014 and, not long after, several more employees also resigned. Sources told Business Insider that Bogensberger's management style rankled long-time employees.\n\nSome of those employees who were dismissed were involved in unionization efforts at NPM, resulting in complaints filed with the National Labor Relations Board. Three of the complaints were recently settled.\n\nAnd then, in July, NPM co-founder Laurie Voss resigned.\n\nRead more: NPM, a startup 11 million developers rely on, is tangled in a bitter cultural battle as it tries to actually make money\n\nCurrently, NPM's board of directors are searching for a new CEO. In the meantime, NPM will be led by a team comprised of senior NPM executives.\n\n\"Bryan brought his deep experience in guiding technology companies to position npm for future growth,\" NPM co-founder Isaac Schlueter said in a statement. \"On behalf of the board of directors and my colleagues at npm, we wish him the best.\"\n\nPrior to joining NPM, Bogensberger served as three years as the CEO of Inktank, which he cofounded and later sold to Red Hat for $175 million.\n\nJonathan Cowperthwait, NPM's former vice president of marketing, says that despite Bogensberger's resignation, NPM is still \"well-positioned\" in the developer tool industry.\n\n\"NPM is fundamentally well-positioned, and still has a unique advantage in the developer tools space by being the center of the open source universe,\" Cowperthwait told Business Insider. \"Many of us spent the last year watching our friends and colleagues' struggle through our fingers, but I'm still profoundly confident in the company's ability to turn this around. Sometimes bad executives happen to a good company.\"\n\nGot a tip? Contact this reporter via email at rmchan@businessinsider.com, Telegram at @rosaliechan, or Twitter DM at @rosaliechan17.
