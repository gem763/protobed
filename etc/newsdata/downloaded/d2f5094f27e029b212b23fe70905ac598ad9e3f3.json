The vast majority, 94 per cent, said they regretted buying a leasehold property. The survey revealed that when it came to completing the purchase, 65 per cent used the solicitor their house builder recommended, and some 15 per cent of those say they weren't told they weren't buying the freehold by a professional. In addition, nearly half didn't know they were only buying the lease until it was too late, and 57 per cent didn't understand what being a 'leaseholder' meant until they had already purchased the property. Almost half were unaware of escalating ground rents until it was too late, and as a result a third are now struggling to attract a buyer because of the onerous terms in the lease.\n\nIt also said it wants to understand the impact such practices have on homeowners, and so is calling on people to share experiences that could be relevant to its work.\n\n'Our investigation will shed light on potential misleading practices and unfair terms to help better protect people buying a home in future,' the CMA said.\n\nAnother area it will investigate is whether people are having to pay excessive fees due to unfair contract terms, including administration, service and 'permission' charges.\n\nThe latter charges relate to when homeowners must pay freeholders and managing agents before making home improvements \u2013 and ground rents.\n\nGeorge Lusty, CMA senior director for consumer enforcement, said: 'Buying a home is one of the most expensive and important purchases a person can make, so it's essential they fully understand the contract they are signing - including whether they will have to pay more than they bargained for.'\n\nIf the CMA thinks that what a company is doing is misleading, or that its contracts contain unfair clauses, it could take enforcement action to require the company to change how they operate.\n\nMark Hayward, chief executive of NAEA Propertymark, said they welcomed the investigation.\n\n'For too long, housebuilders and developers have not been transparent enough about what it actually means to buy a leasehold property,' he added.\n\nIt comes as a recent survey shows three in five, or 62 per cent, of those with a leasehold felt like they were mis-sold.", "description": "The Competition Market Authority's decision follows a scandal in the sector that has left up to 100,000 families facing crippling ground rents.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
