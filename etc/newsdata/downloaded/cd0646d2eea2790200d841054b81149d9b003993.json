Reminder: There are 105 days until the Iowa caucuses and 379 days until the 2020 election.\n\nDespite a wave of attacks from the Trump White House, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s national polling average is holding steady. Although Sen. Elizabeth Warren has gained ground on him over the course of the year, a series of polls taken after the most recent debate have been positive for Biden, including a CNN survey released Wednesday morning that showed him with his widest lead among Democratic voters since shortly after he entered the race in April: 34 percent to 19 percent for Warren and 16 percent for Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped establishment Democrats from worrying about his campaign or the party\u2019s chances against Donald Trump in 2020 with either Biden or one of the runner-ups, the two most liberal candidates in the race, as the likely standard bearer.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have anybody who can win the general [election],\u201d donor Jack Coale complained to the Washington Post in a story published Tuesday titled \u201cAnxiety rises among Democrats worried about party\u2019s prospects in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions, told the New York Times in another story about the \u201canxious Democratic establishment.\u201d\n\nWhy are Democrats anxious, apart from the fact that, as some of those interviewed pointed out, it is their natural state? A major factor is Biden\u2019s fundraising. In filings last week, it was revealed that his campaign has just $8.9 million cash on hand. In comparison, Sanders has $33.7 million, Warren has $25.7 million and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has $23.4 million.\n\nBiden also has a more limited donor pool, as just 38 percent of the $22 million he raised in the first half of the year came from donations of $200 or less. That\u2019s in comparison to 77 percent small donors for Sanders and 67 percent for Warren. Donors are allowed to give only $2,800 to each primary candidate, meaning donors who give in smaller amounts can give again, while candidates whose supporters max out early might face trouble later.\n\nHillary Clinton, John Kerry and Oprah Winfrey (Yahoo News photo illustration; photos: AP, Getty Images) More\n\nThere\u2019s also Biden\u2019s generally lackluster debate performances and his propensity to commit verbal blunders, which haven\u2019t inspired confidence in how he would handle a brutal campaign against Trump. While his national polling is strong, he\u2019s slipping in the first three states to vote, essentially tied with Warren in Iowa, trailing her in New Hampshire and locked in a three-way race with both Warren and Sanders in Nevada. Biden\u2019s South Carolina firewall remains strong, but questions remain of how it would hold up if he is coming off three straight defeats. There was also a HuffPost/YouGov poll released Tuesday that found 25 percent of Democrats would be upset if Biden won the nomination, versus 9 percent for Warren and 19 for Sanders.\n\n\u201cWith Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame, and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,\u201d said David Axelrod, a top Obama adviser, discussing Biden\u2019s arc.\n\nPart of the establishment\u2019s problem is that Sen. Kamala Harris, whose campaign staff contains a number of 2016 Clinton alumni, has tumbled in the polls, unable to climb out of single digits both nationally or in her native California. Buttigieg is polling well in Iowa and has plenty of cash, but there are concerns about his ability to appeal to nonwhite voters, as he has polled at zero among African-Americans in surveys of South Carolina. Following the most recent debate, the media has turned some of its focus on Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 including headlines like \u201cIn Iowa, Amy Klobuchar Gets a Second Look After Debate,\u201d \u201c\u2018It sure feels like Buttigieg and Klobuchar have wind in their sails\u2019\u201d and \u201cAmy Klobuchar says she\u2019s catching on at exactly the right time\u201d \u2014 but she has yet to clear 3 percent in any postdebate poll.", "description": "With questions about the former VP's fundraising and the general election viability of the two New England senators, the Democratic establishment is looking for a new option in the primary race.", "authors": ["Chris Wilson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oSowpsSV2BzfxpH3su1Elw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8fd01be0-f59a-11e9-ad98-2d9bfed71e12", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
