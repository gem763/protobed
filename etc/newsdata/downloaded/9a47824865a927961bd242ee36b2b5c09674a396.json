TIME Labs examined the 6.2 million people who follow at least one of the 16 candidates and looked at the overlaps for anyone who followed more than one.\n\nWhat\u2019s striking here is that, while Florida Senator Marco Rubio is only polling at around 5 percent, he is the most jointly followed candidate among 10 of his 15 competitors.\n\nWhile all the usual caveats about Twitter data apply\u2013the demographics are considerably younger than GOP primary voters, and a follower does not a voter make\u2013it\u2019s significant that so many people who follow any of the other candidates also follow him. This suggests that he may very well be the second choice of many people who support another candidate.\n\nIn a field of 16 that must eventually winnow to one, being anyone\u2019s second choice is not a bad place to be.\n\nAll photos from Associated Press.
