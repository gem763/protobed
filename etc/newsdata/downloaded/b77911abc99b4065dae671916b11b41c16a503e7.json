The 26-year-old won the silver medal in the Women\u2019s 20 km Race Walk at the 2014 Asian Games at Incheon, South Korea. With the victory, she became the first Indian woman to win a walking race Asiad medal. And according to reports, Kaur is already gearing up to represent India at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \u201cThe current government is giving a lot of importance to sports, which is very good and we are seeing a marked improvement. But the one thing I have realised is that we must start preparing for these kinds of events four to five years in advance,\u201d she says.Hailing from Nikka Rasalpur, a small town near Jalandhar, Kaur was raised in a family of farmers. At six, she lost her father, but her mother always encouraged her to take up sports. She worked in other people's houses to support the family and bring up the children. This led to her breaking national records in walking in 2008. She walked barefoot as she could not afford shoes.She was conferred with the Arjuna Award last year, and the athlete surely has many more records to break before she hangs up her boots.", "description": "Athlete Khushbir Kaur, who became the first Indian woman to win a walking race Asiad medal in 2014 will represent India at 2020 Tokyo Olympics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/khushbir-kaur-sm-thumb1572419399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
