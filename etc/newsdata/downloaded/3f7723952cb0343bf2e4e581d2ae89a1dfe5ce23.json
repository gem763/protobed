Walsh gives the example of a fast-food chain: selling burgers might be its main game, but to do that it needs a team of in-house software developers keeping the technology systems that underpin its stores.\n\nThis operational reliance on software, in turn, makes enterprises extremely reliant on their software providers \u2013 which investors love, according to the local head of Credit Suisse\u2019s TMT team, Tim McKessar.\n\n\u201cTheir retention rates are extraordinarily high. So while there\u2019s the question of what other industry's giving you 30 per cent-plus growth, the other thing is the resiliency of that growth, given the deeply entrenched customer relationships.\u201d\n\nAs the bank that brought giants such as Google and Alibaba to the public markets, Credit Suisse\u2019s global tech heritage is rich. Locally it has topped the league tables in terms of tech deals for two of the past three years and worked on prominent recent deals including the float of ASX darling Wisetech and the sale of Aconex to Oracle \u2013 notably, two enterprise-focused tech firms.\n\nWalsh says it was another Australian tech firm \u2013 the $44 billion project management software giant Atlassian \u2013 that underscored two key drivers of the enterprise software boom.\n\nThe first was to show that great software companies could be built anywhere in the world, thanks to the proliferation of relatively cheap IT infrastructure and tools. Indeed, Disney points out that tech firms from smaller markets such as Australia, where venture capital is less plentiful than in Silicon Valley, have often built far more resilient and profit-focused businesses.\n\nThe second thing Atlassian\u2019s rise did was to prove that selling enterprise software no longer required huge and expensive sales and marketing teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlassian\u2019s products were often simply embraced by teams inside an organisation, leading to them being adopted by the enterprise, rather than bought by the enterprise.\n\n\u201cThese companies have learnt to be remarkably efficient and reach profitability far earlier in their life cycle which is extraordinarily attractive to public market investors,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cThere is no better example of that than Atlassian. Investors today are looking for the next generational tech company and are agnostic to geography.\u201d\n\nHe says the recent pull-back in US tech valuations should not be mistaken for investors becoming hesitant about supporting growth-focused firms.\n\nResponsible growth\n\n\u201cThe public market is focused on responsible growth,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no hesitation to invest in companies losing money; however, investors want to see strong unit economics and a clear pathway to break-even. Many of the best performing IPOs of the year are still not profitable.\u201d\n\nWalsh expects US tech IPO volumes to remain robust over the next few years, particularly as companies that tapped private markets for capital move to the next stage of their fundraising journey.\n\nHowever, there may be some differences in how these companies come to market next year.\n\nSlack, for example, did a direct listing \u2013 selling shares directly to the public, rather through a traditional underwritten IPO \u2013 this year. And Credit Suisse recently helped Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic list using a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which is a combination of a shell company and an investment fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlack had about $US900 million on its balance sheet at the time of its listing, and so did not need to raise capital via a traditional float.\n\nBut its choice of a direct listing comes amid a crusade led by veteran venture capitalist Bill Gurley. The founder of venture firm Benchmark says IPOs are a \u201cbad joke\u201d for venture-backed tech companies, as they let investment banks sell shares to handpicked investors at a big discount, in part by convincing company founders that delivering a big jump in the share price on the first day of trade is actually something to celebrate and not a sign that lots of value has been left on the table.\n\nCiting research from University of Florida professor Jay Ritter, Gurley claims that venture-backed IPOs have been underpriced to the tune of $US171 billion over the past four decades.\n\nRitter has also released research showing that for venture-backed IPOs over the past 10 years, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley underpriced deals the most, by 33.5 per cent and 29.2 per cent respectively. Credit Suisse underpriced the least, with a discount of just 3.3 per cent, on Ritter\u2019s numbers.\n\n\u201cGiven the frequency with which technology IPOs have been underpriced historically, it is no surprise that companies are exploring alternative paths to the public markets.\n\n\u201cWe believe companies should look at all available options and chose the best path for them. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We currently have clients considering auction IPOs, SPACs and direct listings in addition to traditional IPOs.\u201d", "description": "While big consumer tech floats in the US have fallen flat this year, enterprise software firms are surging as the corporate sector goes digital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_82/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b99f162042a41b86b05036c770a60cd1135faeae", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
