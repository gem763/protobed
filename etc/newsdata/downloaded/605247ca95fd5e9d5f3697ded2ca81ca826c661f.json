Australian media reported that he had been undergoing chemotherapy since a cancer diagnosis in May.\n\nThe former road worker never admitted to the murders of the young men and women, some of whom were sexually assaulted, shot or stabbed. The bodies were found in shallow graves in a New South Wales forest.\n\nMilat was also linked to several other unsolved missing person cases, and died under suspicion of committing more crimes than those for which he was convicted.\n\nWhile in prison, he remained in the news, cutting his finger off and attempting to post it to the country's top court, swallowing razor blades or swallowing parts of toilet flushing mechanisms.
