In the repo market, an investment bank that needs a quick, temporary jolt of cash can borrow it by doing two things. First, it can put up safe collateral, such as Treasury bills. Second, it can promise to repurchase those bills back at a slightly higher price very soon \u2014 as soon as the next day. The difference between the two prices is the repo rate (1.8 percent as of this writing).\n\nWhat happened in September was that lenders in the repo market were themselves short of cash, and thus the daily repo rate more than doubled. Starting the next day, the Federal Reserve injected (through loans) tens of billions into the system and things appear to have settled down (repo market volumes are typically north of a trillion dollars per day). The disruption, in other words, was a temporary problem of clogged pipes, not a long-term, structural deficiency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are progressives who bridle at any sort of bank bailout, but I\u2019m not one of them. Frozen, or even lastingly clogged, credit flows are the stuff of recessions, and it\u2019s not the bankers who get hurt in downturns.\n\nBut this incident still gave me pause. I marveled at the speed with which the Fed has thus far injected over $200 billion \u2014 close to 1 percent of GDP \u2014 of bank reserves, enough to quickly get the repo rate back down to where officials wanted it. It\u2019s good that the Fed can rescue credit markets serving high finance. But where\u2019s the urgency for Congress and state legislatures to help people stuck in failing labor markets?\n\nConsider, for example, persistent place-based disparities. So far this year, the national unemployment rate has stayed well below 4 percent. But in Detroit, the 2019 jobless rate has been more than twice that, at about 9 percent. Relative to the nation, job growth has been slowing sharply in the Detroit area for a year now (i.e., before the strike against GM), and was last seen clocking in at around zero. Recent research by Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution points out that in 20 majority-black cities with more than 65,000 residents, the average black unemployment rate is 12 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese facts underscore the point that even with national unemployment at a 50-year low, there are people and places that have been left behind. Though the research refers to a few years ago, the Economic Innovation Group found that 50 million Americans lived in \u201cdistressed communities,\u201d characterized by high poverty rates, low educational attainment, with over 40 percent of working-age adults non-employed. Of particular concern, the gap between prosperous and distressed areas has grown in recent years, driven by a diverging trends in job growth and business start-ups.\n\nEconomists used to eschew place-based policies, blithely advising people in distressed places to move to prosperous ones. Thankfully, in recent years, such facile thinking is disappearing \u2014 in part because people are increasingly staying put \u2014 and ideas to help struggling communities are percolating. Economist Tim Bartik suggests ways to help revitalize manufacturing communities, including helping small manufacturers connect to broader supply chains and training local workforces; David Neumark proposes that the federal government subsidizes jobs in struggling places; Larry Summers has ideas for targeted infrastructure investment and taxing location-incentive subsidies by affluent cities, to \u201cgive more disadvantaged communities a fairer chance to compete\u201d for new businesses.\n\nSuch ideas aren\u2019t free, but neither are the Fed\u2019s loans to the banks that lend in repo markets. In both cases, however, because interest rates are low, whether we\u2019re unclogging credit flows or helping people and places get back on their feet, both investments are worth their costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, part of the difference is that the repo market went haywire all the sudden, while problems in the places described above are more like a slow burn. But that\u2019s no reason to only help the banks. In fact, the major distinguishing factor here is that the Fed operates politically independently (despite Trump\u2019s efforts to compromise this critical attribute), while policies like those noted above must be enacted by national or state legislatures.\n\nSome balance would be useful: I like credit flows as much as the next guy, but let\u2019s see the same urgency for the living standards of large swaths of people who\u2019ve been left behind for too long.\n\nAD", "description": "There's got to be some despairing people thinking: \"I wish I were the repo market because then policymakers would help me the minute I needed help.\"", "authors": ["Jared Bernstein", "Chief Economist To Former Vice President Joe Biden", "Is A Senior Fellow At The Center On Budget", "Policy Priorities."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VcFGsea_EwbVXwpi9h0J_ftm8Mg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AD3BF4HMGMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
