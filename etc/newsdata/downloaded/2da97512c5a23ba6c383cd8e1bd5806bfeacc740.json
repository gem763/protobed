What Happens Next?", "language": "en", "text": "Speaking to reporters shortly after the court ruling was announced, Mr. Bercow said that lawmakers would return to the Commons at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. Lord Fowler said on Twitter that the Lords would resume at 3 p.m.\n\nMr. Bercow, who has been a vocal opponent of Mr. Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament, said he welcomed the court\u2019s \u201cunambiguous decision\u201d and noted that he had been in touch with party leaders to inform them that business would resume.\n\nHe added that it would not be possible to hold prime minister\u2019s questions as usual for a Wednesday \u2014 Mr. Johnson is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly \u2014 but added, \u201cThere will be full scope for urgent questions for ministerial statements and for applications for emergency debates.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s opponents will now have a fresh opportunity to embarrass him, demanding answers from government officials and trying to hold the prime minister to account for misleading the queen over the suspension of Parliament.\n\nHad the suspension been upheld, it would have meant that Parliament\u2019s return in October would have been a new legislative session, and that any leftover bills would die. Mr. Johnson scheduled a queen\u2019s speech on Oct. 14 to lay out the government\u2019s agenda for the new session, which then would have been subject to days of debate, leaving even less time for Brexit.\n\nInstead, the Supreme Court ruling means the suspension never happened, so the old legislative session is still underway, and bills that were on the table can continue through the approval process. The queen\u2019s speech and the formal introduction of the government\u2019s agenda are on hold.", "description": "The ruling puts Parliament back in session almost three weeks earlier than expected, and has consequences for Brexit.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller", "Megan Specia"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24brexit-explainer1/merlin_160177854_5432da8b-9a45-4873-b476-d0b2ba10a98f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
