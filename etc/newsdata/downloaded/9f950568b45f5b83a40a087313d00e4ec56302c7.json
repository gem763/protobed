What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Catalent, Inc. (NYSE:CTLT) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Catalent\n\nHow Much Debt Does Catalent Carry?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Catalent had US$2.79b in debt in June 2019; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$345.4m, its net debt is less, at about US$2.45b.\n\nNYSE:CTLT Historical Debt, September 13th 2019 More\n\nA Look At Catalent's Liabilities\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Catalent had liabilities of US$670.7m due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.23b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$345.4m as well as receivables valued at US$716.4m due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$2.83b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nCatalent has a market capitalization of US$7.59b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nCatalent's debt is 4.5 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 2.8 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Fortunately, Catalent grew its EBIT by 8.4% in the last year, slowly shrinking its debt relative to earnings. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Catalent's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Catalent recorded free cash flow of 45% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.\n\nStory continues", "description": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about.
