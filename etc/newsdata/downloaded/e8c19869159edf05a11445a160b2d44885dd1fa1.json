Revenue fell in the same period from $139.5 million to $129.4 million.\n\nHowever, Seven pulled $8.3 million in costs out of PacMags during the year and now derives 30 per cent of its ad revenue from digital. According to Seven's annual report, digital revenue was up 106 per cent in the last financial year, driven by original videos.\n\nThe deal would allow Seven's new chief executive James Warburton to improve the company's tough debt position, giving its balance sheet some breathing room as he looks to transform the business and potentially look at new acquisitions.\n\nPrior to rejoining Seven, Mr Warburton was fronting a consortium, including listed investment vehicle CVC Limited, that was looking to acquire Seven's regional affiliate Prime Media, as revealed by The Australian Financial Review in June.\n\nThe new Seven boss was brought in by Kerry Stokes in August with a mandate to shake-up the business, a move which has seen its share price drop to record lows. Mr Warburton is known to be looking at M &A and new revenue opportunities.\n\nDigital push\n\nFor Bauer, the transaction is focused on what fixed costs it could pull out of the company business, but also how can it rework its business model to leverage growing digital audiences in some PacMags titles.\n\nPacMags' New Idea had a larger total audience in July 2019 compared with October 2018, according to Enhanced Media Metrics Australia data. A year-on-year comparison is not available due to a trend break brought in during October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile New Idea's monthly print audience fell from 2.64 million in October 2018 to 2.46 million in July 2019, its digital audience rose from 1.07 million to 1.49 million \u2013 the second-largest monthly digital magazine audience behind News Corp's Taste.com.au. This meant the magazine's total audience rose from 3.5 million in October 2018 to 3.7 million in July.\n\nBetter Homes and Gardens also grew its digital audience in the same period from 502,000 to 571,000, although print declines outpaced digital growth.\n\nBauer's Australian Gourmet Traveller grew its total monthly audience in the same period from 464,000 to 608,000, driven by growth in its digital audience from 196,000 to 349,000.\n\nThe magazine sector remains under significant pressure, however, as advertising shifts to the much tougher digital landscape where titles face competition from traditional rivals, overseas titles and social media. Many titles have seen their digital and print audiences decline and the past decade has seen a continued string of magazine closures.\n\nThere is belief by some in the sector that consolidation is needed to further pull down costs and to try to create an at-scale audience under topic segments.\n\nAccording to EMMA and Nielsen data, Bauer and PacMags had a combined print and digital audience of 7.9 million people aged 14 and over in July 2019.", "description": "Sources said Seven West Media and Bauer Media are working through a due-diligence process and warned a deal was not across the line.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_79/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/182fa7795baea9b76354683513b1a4c881edbbf6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
