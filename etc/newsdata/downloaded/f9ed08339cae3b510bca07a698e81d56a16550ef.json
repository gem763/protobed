It was Sept. 24 \u2014 19 days ago \u2014 that Speaker Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. Here's what has happened since then:\n\nA rough transcript of a July 25 phone call shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bringing up the possibility of buying more U.S. Javelin missiles for Ukraine's war against Russia, before Trump says: \"I would like you to do us a favor though.\"\n\nof a July 25 phone call shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bringing up the possibility of buying more U.S. Javelin missiles for Ukraine's war against Russia, before Trump says: \"I would like you to do us a favor though.\" Trump goes on to ask Zelensky to look into Ukraine's alleged involvement in the 2016 election, and to work with Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who did business in Ukraine.\n\nTrump maintains that the contents of the conversation were \"perfect.\"\n\nDemocrats say it's evidence of the president abusing his office to solicit foreign election interference.\n\nThe first witness to be deposed in the House's impeachment inquiry was former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nHe turned over text messages that show him coordinating with two other diplomats to secure a \"deliverable\" for Trump and Giuliani \u2014 a written statement from Zelensky announcing these investigations.\n\ntext messages that show him coordinating with two other diplomats to secure a \"deliverable\" for Trump and Giuliani \u2014 a written statement from Zelensky announcing these investigations.

Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, a million-dollar Trump donor, picks up the phone and calls Trump, before eventually responding to Taylor: \"The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind.\" (The WashPost reports in this morning's lead story that Sondland plans to tell Congress this week that he was just repeating what Trump had told him.)\n\n4 plot twists:\n\nA week into the inquiry, Trump told reporters on the South Lawn that Ukraine should start \"a major investigation into the Bidens\" \u2014 the exact request that prompted Democrats to launch their impeachment inquiry. Then Trump topped it: \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\" Last week, two Florida businessmen who helped introduce Giuliani to Ukrainian officials were indicted on charges of funneling foreign money into Republican campaigns. The former mayor himself is now under criminal investigation \u2014 by the very U.S. attorney's office he used to run. And the White House is trying to block any witnesses from cooperating with the impeachment inquiry, calling it \"constitutionally illegitimate.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Barring dramatic new information, expect Trump \u2014 like Bill Clinton \u2014 to be impeached by the House, then acquitted by the Senate.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
