It\u2019s so much a part of how most of us use the web that switching to another search engine, even if we deeply want to, can be a bit complicated.\n\nDuckDuckSometimes is a Chrome extension that automatically redirects a percentage of your Google searches to DuckDuckGo rather than Google.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar, DuckDuckGo is a search engine with a focus specifically on user privacy. Unlike Google\u2019s search results which are based in part of what the company knows about you, DuckDuckGo instead shows the same search results for a particular search term to all its users.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned with privacy (you should be) it\u2019s a better choice than Google, but it can be a difficult switch to make.\n\nOnce you install the extension, it will automatically redirect some of your searches to DuckDuckGo rather than Google proper.\n\nYes, some of your searches will also still go through Google, but you\u2019ll be able to cut down a bit on how many of those searches, allowing you to mindless switch to the search engine without having to remember to not \u201cGoogle that.\u201d", "description": "Google has made its search feature intrinsic to using the internet, to some extent.
