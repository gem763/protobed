(Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCtrl + N\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren singled out Facebook policy chief Joel Kaplan as she launched a plan to \u201cslam shut the revolving door\u201d between Washington and large corporations.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate wrote on Twitter that Kaplan, a former George W. Bush official, \u201cis flexing his DC Rolodex to help [CEO] Mark Zuckerberg wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.\u201d Warren says Kaplan\u2019s career move is indicative of a broader problem in Washington that hits across sectors. She wants to ban senior government officials from joining large corporations for at least four years after they leave government.\n\nIt's unclear how this would work in practice as many government officials leave for the private sector after their stint in Washington. And it\u2019s highly unusual for a presidential candidate to take aim at an individual company executive \u2014 especially one who is not a CEO or known to much of the public. But it dovetails with the broader trend of candidates more frequently calling out individual companies as liberal Democrats such as Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) run 2020 campaigns challenging corporate size and income.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Democrat in the primary running a populist campaign, playing on the notion that the system is rigged and evil and everything else, it\u2019s a popular position to take,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and political strategist who has worked with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York Sen. Charles Schumer (D).\n\nKaplan is a clear foil for Warren as she tries to rally the Democratic base. He\u2019s the Facebook executive who created controversy by sitting behind Brett Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. The Wall Street Journal reported that Kaplan pushed for the company to include The Daily Caller's fact-checking division among the company\u2019s partners to address conservatives' concerns of bias among its fact-checking partners. The same Journal article called Kaplan \"Facebook\u2019s protector\" against allegations of anti-conservative bias -- a charge that companies and most politicians on the left dismiss.\n\nWarren could have chosen to call out a long list of companies that have former Washington officials high in their ranks \u2014 including other tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft. But the focus on Kaplan highlights just how contentious Warren\u2019s relationship with Facebook has become in recent months \u2014 as the leading presidential contender has promised to break up the company, criticized it for allowing President Trump to distort the truth in ads and questioned the tech titan\u2019s ability to address election integrity issues ahead of 2020.\n\nIn announcing the policy, she even took a dig at Zuckerberg\u2019s recent comments leaked by The Verge, where he said a Warren presidency would likely result in a legal challenge for Facebook, and if Facebook faced such a challenge, \u201cYou go to the mat and you fight.\u201d From Twitter:\n\nExecutives have made it clear they're ready to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight, but that\u2019s not how our economy or our democracy is supposed to work. Together, we\u2019ll close the revolving door and break the grip of giant corporations on our economy and our government. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 29, 2019\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Warren\u2019s plan. It's specifically aimed at corporations she calls \"market-dominant,\" and she defines such companies as \"corporations worth over $150 billion and companies that control the product or labor supply in their industry.\" Breaking the rule would come with a hefty fines: Any company that violates this restriction will be required to pay a minimum of 1% of its net profit for a first violation, 2% for a second violation and at least 5% of profits for any subsequent violation.\n\nIf it amounts to more than a threat, Warren's plan would significantly change the way tech titans interact with Washington. In recent years amid increased antitrust and privacy scrutiny, many technology companies have been expanding or overhauling their policy and public affairs teams, bringing in more senior government officials. The tech companies were often criticized for not focusing enough on Washington or understanding how it works -- and one way in which they've tried to remedy that is by hiring some of the city's top players.\n\nWarren's plan could make it difficult to recruit top talent for her administration because potential hires may be concerned about the limits on their job opportunities after working for her administration.\n\n\"Companies should be able to hire talented people with government experience, and successful private-sector professionals should be encouraged to serve in government,\" she wrote in a blog post. \"But giant corporations should compete on a level playing field \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t be able to rig the system by scooping up every available former government official in an effort to get federal regulators off their backs.\"\n\nOther presidential contenders have promised to take on Washington\u2019s revolving door and yet it still keeps turning. President Barack Obama made such a promise central to his 2008 campaign, and yet many of his top officials went on to top lobbying roles, as Politico reported in 2015. President Trump has promised to drain the swamp, but has hired more ex-lobbyists during his time in office, so far, than his two recent predecessors.\n\n\u201cThey were overpromising on something they could never deliver,\u201d Melanie Sloan, former executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than doing nothing.\u201d\n\nRANT AND RAVE\n\nFacebook hit back against critics of its political ad policy in a USA Today op-ed yesterday. \u201cAnyone who thinks Facebook should decide which claims by politicians are acceptable might ask themselves this question: Why do you want us to have so much power?\u201d asked Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s public policy director of global elections, and Nell McCarthy, director of policy management.\n\nTwitter had some answers to their question:\n\nThe Verge's Casey Newton:\n\nMy ultimate problem with this logic is that \u201cnot making a call\u201d is just making another, equally consequential kind of call https://t.co/p7C4dyZYW7 pic.twitter.com/vKKpUBHZup \u2014 Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) October 29, 2019\n\nResearcher David Carroll pointed out that employees could suggest even bolder demands.\n\nThey\u2019re not calling for a moratorium on Custom Audiences where voter files get uploaded into Facebook to microtarget voters.

(Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBITS: WhatsApp sued software vendor NSO, alleging the Israeli firm helped governments break into the phones of civil rights advocates, journalists and other civil society figures. Human rights and privacy advocates have long complained about intrusive surveillance technologies, but this is the first time an encrypted messaging service has sued a malware manufacturer for spying efforts, my colleagues Craig Timberg and Jay Greene report. (Read more from my colleague Joseph Marks at The Cybersecurity 202).\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d John Scott Railton, a senior research at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School, who worked with WhatsApp on the case, told my colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone in digital rights and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe court complaint alleges that NSO employees created WhatsApp accounts that allowed them to initiate calls in April and May that injected malicious code into 1,400 devices. The malware gave hackers access to decrypted messages of at least 100 victims. The activity stopped after Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, closed the vulnerability in the middle of May.\n\n\u201cThis should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all Internet users,\u201d Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. \u201cTools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk.\u201d\n\nNSO's software has been implicated in a number of human rights abuses, including the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the attempted espionage of human rights group Amnesty International. The group has claimed it has no knowledge of the attacks and committed last month to protecting human rights in its work.\n\n\u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\u201d NSO said in a statement that was forwarded to The Washington Post by a Washington public relations agency.\n\nA ride-hailing vehicle displays Lyft and Uber stickers on its front windshield. (Richard Vogel/AP)\n\nNIBBLES: A campaign backed by Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart unveiled a new California state ballot measure that would ensure those companies can keep classifying their workers as independent contractors, according to a news release. The initiative \u2014 targeting the November 2020 ballot \u2014 is a direct response to a new California law threatening to force the companies to reclassify drivers as employees.\n\nThe Protect App-Based Drivers & Services Act would offer drivers new benefits, including a health-care subsidy, earnings tied to 120 percent of the minimum wage for hours spent engaged with passengers, and protection against discrimination and sexual harassment. The campaign argues it will give gig workers the flexibility they want while still affording them more protections.\n\n\u201cThe new law could take this flexibility away \u2014 potentially eliminating hundreds of thousands of work opportunities and forcing app-based drivers into rigid employment schedules whether they prefer it or not,\u201d the group wrote in a statement.\n\nUber, Lyft and DoorDash all put $30 million each toward the initiative this summer and have expressed a willingness to spend more if they can\u2019t reach a deal with the governors office. Instacart would not disclose if it donated when asked by TechCrunch.\n\nDrivers who fought for the California law, called AB5, are now turning their attention to combating the new initiative. A coalition of 20,000 drivers called We Drive Progress organized a news conference yesterday to voice opposition to the referendum, which they say doesn\u2019t provide the same protections as employee status.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another example of corporations and billionaires trying to exempt themselves from the democratic process by using wealth and fear tactics,\u201d said Edan Alva, a Lyft driver.\n\nFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott/File Photo\n\nBYTES: A San Francisco man launched a bid for governor this week in order to test Facebook's political ad policies. But now he's considering legal action as Facebook says it won't exempt his ads from fact-checking, as they typically do with ads from politicians, according to CNN's Donnie Sullivan.\n\n\"This person has made clear he registered as a candidate to get around our policies, so his content, including ads, will continue to be eligible for third-party fact-checking,\" Facebook told CNN.\n\nAdriel Hampton, the man who has been running stunts to test Facebook's political ad policy, hit back, telling CNN that the company has made a policy specific to him as he launches his bid for office \"to regulate Facebook.\"\n\n\"I am going to look at suing them -- I will immediately seek all available legal options,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he's looking into recruiting other candidates across the country to run false ads on Facebook.\n\nHampton also is the treasurer of the left-leaning group \"The Really Online Lefty League,\" and he created the ad that Facebook removed over the weekend that claimed Sen. Lindsey Graham supported the Green New Deal, highlighting how Facebook treats ads from political action groups differently than ads from politicians.\n\nPUBLIC CLOUD\n\n\u2014 News from the public sector:\n\nApple Pay in EU antitrust spotlight as regulators seek details Apple Inc (AAPL.O) faces more regulatory woes in Europe as EU antitrust regulators ask online sales companies whether they have been told to use its mobile payment service instead of rival services, an EU document seen by Reuters showed.

Rather than raise their hands in class, the students are required to use an app called e-Hallpass if they have to go to the bathroom or see a nurse. Christian started a petition to get rid of what he calls an \u201cinvasive technology.\u201d (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n-- A high school senior in Virginia is protesting his school's use of E-Hallpass, a digital tracker that monitors trips to the bathroom, nurse's office, and other places on campus for violating his privacy. His online petition highlights the student and parental privacy concerns sparked by the growing use of data-collecting applications by schools for everything from tracking homework to modifying behavior, my colleague Heather Kelly reports.\n\nParents who are asked to opt in to these technologies face a conundrum over whether to allow their children to use the services and how doing so will affect their digital footprint. E-Hallpass says that student data is not shared with third-party companies for marketing or advertising, and schools and parents can request data deletion.\n\nBut many apps are still selling easily de-anonymized data and track users, Girard Kelly, counsel and director of privacy review at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that reviews technology and media targeting young people, told Heather. While there are laws dictating data privacy for users under 13, for the most part, schools are not legally obligated to get permission from parents to use specific software in classrooms.\n\nThe sometimes hundreds of apps employed by schools, each of which have different rules for storing data, have left parents feeling helpless.\n\n\u201cEveryone feels overwhelmed, everyone feels like they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s because the technology is not transparent and does not allow for easy understanding of what your kid is using,\u201d said Monica Bulger, a research affiliate at the independent, nonprofit Data and Society Research Institute.\n\n\u2014 News from the private sector:\n\nTechnology Tweens, teens and screens: The average time kids spend watching online videos has doubled in 4 years The surge in consumption comes despite mounting concerns about the grip that smartphones and screens have on young people's lives and development.
