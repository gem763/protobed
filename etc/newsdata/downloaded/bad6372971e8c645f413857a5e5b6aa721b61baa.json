I told my boyfriend at the time, Brad Pitt.\n\nPaltrow continued: \"I told [Pitt] right away, and I was very shaken by the thing and I had signed up to do two movies with [Weinstein].\n\n\"I was afraid, and Brad Pitt, we were at the opening of Hamlet on Broadway... and Harvey was there, and Brad Pitt, it was like the equivalent of throwing him against the wall, energetically.\n\n\"It was so fantastic, because what he did was he leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn't have fame or power yet. He's the best.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWeinstein was fired by his own business, The Weinstein Company, in the wake of the allegations.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty in August to a new indictment that included two new charges of predatory sexual assault.\n\nThis was a development that has caused the judge to delay the start of his trial until early next year.\n\nELLE is out on October 22.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
