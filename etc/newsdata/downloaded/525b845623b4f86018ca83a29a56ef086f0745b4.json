If you\u2019d foreseen that, or anything close to it, on May 23, you could have turned a small mound of cash into a large hill of bills at the expense of someone in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Nats\u2019 93 wins are the most for a team that was 12 games under .500 at any point during a season since the 1914 Boston Braves finished 94-59 after being 28-40. That Boston club still has a nickname in baseball lore: the Miracle Braves. They swept the supposedly better Philadelphia Athletics, chocked with Hall of Famers, in the World Series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGood teams are a dime a dozen. Teams that mortify themselves for 50 games, fall near the bottom of the sport, provoke people (including me) to call for the firing of the manager, then play 74-38 ball \u2014 which is about as excellent (.661) as the best major league teams ever play for an extended period \u2014 are seriously uplifting.\n\nBaseball according to Gerardo Parra\n\nBefore the Nats engage in what is an often cruel one-game season Tuesday, in which either team may advance because of one fabulous play, one comic blunder or one total fluke, we should digest what we\u2019ve already enjoyed for the past 112 games. Because, unless you plan to live another 105 years, you\u2019re probably never going to see anything quite comparable again.\n\nLuckily for us, such tales are usually about something extra \u2014 a special component \u2014 in addition to normal baseball stuff. That\u2019s one of the game\u2019s gifts. This Nats season was about the power and joy of men from Venezuela to Folsom, La.; from the Dominican to Rapid City, S.D.; from Brazil to Las Vegas, joining in one uninhibited, embrace-our-diversity, summerlong party. It\u2019s about Kurt Suzuki, of Japanese and Hawaiian ancestry, dancing Bollywood style in the dugout after hitting a home run \u201cin honor of some of my Indian friends.\u201d It\u2019s about getting Stephen Strasburg to smile, dance and accept a group hug.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, I said to Nats closer Sean Doolittle, \u201cThey ought to change the name of this team to the Washington Internationals.\u201d\n\nDoolittle started laughing and said: \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s absolutely a strength of ours \u2014 100 percent. We didn\u2019t start winning until Gerardo Parra came in May. We\u2019re lucky to have these guys here \u2014 the Latin guys.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about the way this group clicks. The clubhouse is one big comfort zone. [The Latin players] bring energy. They have fun. They put other people at ease. People come out of their shell. We did not have that last year \u2014 for sure. The chemistry wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nOf course, having a veteran who chooses \u201cBaby Shark\u201d as his walk-up song has a way of making everyone act silly. It probably doesn\u2019t hurt that he drives a yellow scooter to the ballpark \u2014 and sometimes around the clubhouse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nEvery team in the majors looks for every edge from analytics, but how do you turn human interaction \u2014 clubhouse chemistry \u2014 into wins?\n\nIn the past two years, the Nats and General Manager Mike Rizzo have tried to crack the code. They hired a manager they thought matched the task, then last winter they grabbed every \u201chigh character\u201d or \u201cteam leader\u201d or \u201cglue guy\u201d on the market. Pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, catchers Suzuki and Yan Gomes and infielder Brian Dozier fit the bill. Revered Howie Kendrick returned from injury. Rookie Victor Robles, a natural leader at 22, went straight into the starting lineup. Also, a few players who departed may have been addition by subtraction.\n\nIn April and May, the Nats gazed, perplexed, at their chemistry beaker \u2014 which already had well-respected leaders such as Max Scherzer, Adam Eaton, Doolittle and, in their own ways, Anthony Rendon, Trea Turner and Juan Soto, just 20. Not a bad apple in the barrel. Yet the combination was inert.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen the Nats picked up castoff Parra because injuries had left them desperate for a warm, professional outfield body. The Nats weren\u2019t trying to be brilliant, though Rizzo knew Parra from his Arizona days. In his second game, Parra had a pinch-hit grand slam. This was no shock from a man with 1,312 career hits, two Gold Gloves and $42 million in salaries.\n\nWhat stunned the Nats was Parra himself. Just by being himself, he demanded, playfully, that everyone have fun, almost all the time. He hugged after hits. He and S\u00e1nchez cooked up the dugout dance party after every home run. Parra wore funky, orange-tinted sunglasses throughout the game. Soon, S\u00e1nchez was next to him in pink-tinted specs \u2014 standing on the top step for three hours, studying the game, chattering, joking, getting teammates involved in talking baseball during the game \u2014 even on days they didn\u2019t play.\n\nSoon, every Nat who got a single turned to the dugout and made a tiny gesture with his thumb and index finger \u2014 like a Baby Shark biting. For a double, they made their whole hand a Mama Shark snapping jaw. For a homer, the Nats made huge chomping Daddy Shark motions with both arms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whole crowd joined in. Soon cheesy, cheerful shark gear appeared.\n\nSomehow, the mystery of human interaction, the personalities of S\u00e1nchez and Parra, both from Venezuela, empowered all the other Latin players \u2014 Soto, Robles and Wander Suero from the Dominican Republic and Gomes from Brazil \u2014 to let out all the energy and joy that is ingrained in the b\u00e9isbol cultures of their countries. Later, Fernando Rodney of the Dominican Republic and another Venezuelan, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, joined the mix.\n\nI first encountered this phenomenon 40 years ago doing a series of stories on winter ball in Puerto Rico, then a couple of years later I went to Cuba, too, and eventually the Dominican Republic. I always came back saying: \u201cThat kind of joy, that love of detail and subtlety in play, that sense of style is how baseball should be played. That is how fans should be totally engaged, cheering on every pitch \u2014 because the count changed. They \u2018get\u2019 the game we invented better than we do. Cool.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo every wonderful or awful twist of the season, humiliation or glory, Parra would shrug and say, \u201cThat\u2019s baseball.\u201d A worldview in two words. The sport \u2014 not known for its playfulness toward those who try to master it \u2014 wrapped Parra in a hideous 3-for-51 slump in mid-August that left him without an RBI for 45 days. On Thursday, after the Nats had clinched a playoff spot, Martinez put Parra, usually a sub or pinch hitter, in the lineup every day to get him \u201cfixed\u201d so he, his glove, bat and energy could justifiably be part of the playoff roster.\n\nIn his last at-bat Thursday, he got a single. In 45 hours, from Friday night through Sunday afternoon, Parra \u2014 the man who went 45 days without an RBI \u2014 went 7 for 9 and drove in 11 runs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s baseball,\u201d Doolittle quipped.\n\nAD\n\n12 best moments from this Nats season\n\nThe Nats haven\u2019t invented anything new. Other fine teams have had an almost magical camaraderie, such as the 2017 world champion Houston Astros and the Boston Red Sox winners with David Ortiz at their center. Long ago, Joe Morgan, Tony Perez and Pete Rose assigned themselves the job of unifying the Big Red Machine. Many great teams have been jubilant, resilient melting pots.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, in these October matters, hitting, fielding and pitching \u2014 such as three-time Cy Young Award winner Scherzer starting Tuesday night \u2014 count for a little bit, too. You can\u2019t just cheer and dance your way to a ring.\n\nSome teams want to advance in the postseason for achievement and glory. No doubt, the Internationals do, too. But some teams are having such a fine time playing together that they just don\u2019t want to come in for supper because it\u2019s getting dark earlier. Hey, Mom, we want to keep playing! And the only way big leaguers are allowed to do that is to keep winning.\n\n\u201cSuch a fun group,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready for it to end.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe complete MLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\n15 most intriguing characters of the 2019 MLB playoffs\n\nEvery MLB playoff team\u2019s fatal flaw\n\nAD", "description": "Call it chemistry or call it fun, but Washington\u2019s baseball team is causing quite a reaction.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UK1UbW3TspThB7po5AskD4mmTWw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S2LKL2HCJEI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
