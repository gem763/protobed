REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nTrump\u2019s re-election campaign raised a quarter of a million dollars in just 15 minutes on Tuesday in the immediate aftermath of House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement about the probe.\n\nThe president, tweeting from Trump Tower in New York where he launched his 2016 campaign for the White House, blasted out a video shortly after she finished that highlighted how Democrats had talked about pushing him out for 2-1/2 years.\n\nFar from exuding an aura of concern that might accompany the disclosure that a president faced formal efforts to remove him from power, Trump\u2019s advisers appeared full of bravado and almost pleased by the news.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of things prepared just in case the Democrats were, in fact, that stupid. And in fact, they were,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, reacting to the impeachment process and disclosing the campaign\u2019s early cash haul.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re probably going to have a tremendous fundraising surge. We think that this gets the president just that much closer to a landslide victory.\u201d\n\nThe campaign prepared the video Trump tweeted some six weeks ago, he said, long before the latest controversy over his call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July.\n\nWith the impeachment inquiry, Democrats are levelling serious charges against Trump, accusing him of seeking Ukraine\u2019s help to investigate Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business in the country, in hopes of damaging Biden\u2019s candidacy ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\u201d said Pelosi, who for months had been reluctant to embrace an impeachment effort.\n\nTrump, who in a tweet after Pelosi\u2019s announcement, labelled the probe \u201cWitch Hunt garbage,\u201d also appeared to embrace the argument that the impeachment effort could help his 2020 prospects.\n\n\u201cThey all say that\u2019s a positive for me, for the election,\u201d Trump told reporters in New York. \u201cBut the good news is, the voters get it. This is why they say it\u2019s good for the election. But you know what? It\u2019s bad for the country.\u201d\n\n\u2018DEVIL IN THE DETAILS\u2019\n\nThe Republican National Committee pointed to polling from Monmouth University in late August that showed low support for impeachment among the public.\n\nThat sentiment, along with the fact that the Republican-controlled Senate almost certainly would not convict Trump if the Democratic-led House went so far as to impeach him, had previously weighed on Pelosi, who long resisted calls from left-leaning colleagues to make a move.\n\nTrump pledged to release the transcript of his call with Zelenskiy and Republicans said Democrats had moved too fast.\n\nThe belief that the process would backfire gave confidence to Trump and his team. One White House official said the president was not concerned, and another dismissed the move as evidence that Democrats were still not able to accept Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory.\n\nA former administration official said people around Trump expected an impeachment process and believed it would help him politically, but he cautioned that there were risks in that perception, depending on what further information came out.\n\n\u201cFolks around (him) think it was inevitable and will help politically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe devil is in the details however and that prediction of \u2018helps more than hurts\u2019 is only true if there is no there there.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump and his people were ready for the day Democrats decided to launch an impeachment inquiry against him.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433585936&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O05A", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
