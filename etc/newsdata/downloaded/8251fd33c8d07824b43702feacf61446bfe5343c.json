After the former Texas rep criticized the South Bend mayor\u2019s more moderate policies on gun reform, Buttigieg responded that he did not \u201cneed lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d perhaps alluding to his military service as a greater sacrifice than Beto\u2019s great Gen-X Battle of Making It in New York.\n\nO\u2019Rourke \u2014 who has prioritized gun reform following the El Paso shooting in August \u2014 then brought up Buttigieg\u2019s insult from a gun safety forum in Las Vegas earlier in October, when he called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s policy a \u201cshiny object,\u201d claiming that prior gun buyback attempts had largely resulted in hand-overs of antiques and heirlooms. Addressing the earlier dig, O\u2019Rourke said:\n\nMayor Buttigieg described this policy as a shiny object. I don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but for those who have survived gun violence, those who have lost a loved one to an AR-15 or an AK-47 \u2014 March for Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians \u2014 that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault \u2026 They must buy them back.\n\nPete and Beto GET INTO IT on the government buying back assault weapons so they're off the streets. Pete thinks that's a \"shiny object\" policy. #demdebate pic.twitter.com/WFpm9l3Ka1 \u2014 Pod Save America (@PodSaveAmerica) October 16, 2019\n\nThe field also weighed in on the issue: Amy Klobuchar, like Buttigieg, vowed to pursue policies with popular support, like the boyfriend loophole. Elizabeth Warren supported voluntary gun buybacks, while Kamala Harris repeated her call for mandatory buybacks.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro closed the topic with a strong statement on his problems with mandatory buybacks: that \u201cfolks can\u2019t define it,\u201d and that the increased contact with police that could be required by such a policy would represent a danger to black and brown communities:\n\nIn the places that I grew up in, we weren\u2019t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. Y\u2019all saw a couple days ago what happened to Tatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at two in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn\u2019t even announce himself, and within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home. And so I\u2019m not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.\n\n#RT @cnnbrk: RT @CNNPolitics: Juli\u00e1n Castro: \"I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/78jZhoTSgy \u2014 Your Reading News UK (@Yourreadingnews) October 16, 2019", "description": "At the fourth Democratic debate, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke argued over the efficacy of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory assault weapon buyback proposal.
