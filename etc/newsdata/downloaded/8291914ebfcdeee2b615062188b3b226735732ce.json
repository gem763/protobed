Photo: Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDoes Trump know \u2014 and I mean, really know \u2014 how many kids he has? Right now, it\u2019s unclear.\n\nThis cynical question presented itself on Wednesday, when Trump announced during a press gathering at the White House that his administration is planning to ban the sale of all flavored e-cigarettes in an effort to curb the growing teen-vaping epidemic \u2014 an issue that\u2019s especially important to Melania Trump. In fact, Trump even credited Melania as someone who helped to bring the issue to his attention, saying during the gathering, \u201cWe can\u2019t have our youth be so affected, and I\u2019m hearing it, and that\u2019s how the First Lady got involved.\u201d\n\nAnd then came his, uh, odd choice of syntax when speaking about Barron, as in, the biological son that he and Melania have spent the past 13 years raising together: \u201cShe\u2019s got a son, together, that\u2019s a beautiful young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it.\u201d\n\nOnce more, emphasis mine: \u201cShe\u2019s got a son, together.\u201d\n\nTrump indicates that his drive against vaping came at the behest of Melania. He then describes his son Barron in a very odd way.\n\n\n\n\"That's how the First Lady involved. She's got a son -- together -- that's a beautiful young man, & she feels very very strongly about it.\" pic.twitter.com/s5wNzUCSmj \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 11, 2019\n\nWhat exactly transpired behind the scenes in Trump\u2019s brain when he delivered this bizarre assertion is not totally clear. Maybe he just fumbled his words in an incredibly awkward way, or perhaps he momentarily forgot that Barron is his son? (If the latter is true, then yikes!)\n\nInstead of focusing on a distressing, unanswerable question, though, let us instead turn our attention toward a much more intriguing one: Does this mean that Barron got caught vaping???\n\nStay in touch.
