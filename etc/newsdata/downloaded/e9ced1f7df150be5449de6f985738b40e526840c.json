Matt Gaetz (R-FL)\u2014the ringleader of Wednesday\u2019s plan to derail the impeachment inquiry\u2014defended his actions by calling Democrats \u201crabid hyenas\u201d and claiming there are \u201cno rules\u201d when dealing with them.\n\nAppearing on Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson Tonight, Gaetz was asked what the purpose was of barging into a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), a move that ultimately delayed Cooper\u2019s testimony by five hours.\n\n\u201cWe had the audacity to want to know what was going on behind closed doors where Democrats have engaged in a strategy of secret interviews, selective leaks, theatrical, weird performances of transcripts that never happened and lies about whistleblowers,\u201d Gaetz declared. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to suggest we would want more transparency on behalf of the millions of people we represent.\u201d\n\nFox host Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, asked whether Gaetz and his colleagues have a right under congressional rules to demand more transparency.\n\n\u201cThere are no rules,\u201d the Florida lawmaker exclaimed. \u201cIf we had rules, Nancy Pelosi would have put this to a vote like established rules that happened with President Clinton, like happened with President Nixon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats want to preserve the most, like, operational flexibility,\u201d he added. \u201cSo if they\u2019re going to have a world with no rules, we have to stop thinking we can use the Marquis of Queensberry rules of engagement when we\u2019re fighting against an angry pack of rabid hyenas. I think the president is right. As Republicans, we need to be tougher in exposing this for the kangaroo court that it is.\u201d\n\nWhile Gaetz and other GOP congressmen took a victory lap on Fox News Wednesday night, however, new reporting suggests that rather than this being a principled stand for transparency, the entire thing was a made-for-TV publicity stunt.\n\nIt was reported that besides GOP leadership blessing the plan to storm the SCIF\u2014which featured a number of congressmen bringing in their cell phones, which is not allowed\u2014the president himself had advance knowledge of the protest and endorsed it. In recent days, Trump has grown visibly angry that Republicans on Capitol Hill aren\u2019t doing enough to defend him.\n\nElsewhere on Fox News, host and Trump confidant Sean Hannity brought on both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and two congressmen who took part in the protest\u2014Reps. Michael Waltz and Lee Zeldin\u2014and urged all of them to keep up the protests.\n\n\u201cI think you should do this every day,\u201d Hannity said.\n\nAs Hannity was giving the game away on the air, one of his colleagues was reporting elsewhere that the whole thing was essentially a play by House Republicans to get a dramatic TV moment.\n\n\u201cFox is told there was never any chance mbrs who barged into SCIF would be arrested by USCP,\u201d Fox News reporter Chad Pergram tweeted. \u201cBut some members asked to be arrested. They wanted the optic of being frog marched out of the SCIF in front of TV cameras. That would help w/GOP narrative of Dem process abuse.\u201d\n\nPergram also said his sources noted that there really wasn\u2019t anything security officials could do in the end, adding that there\u2019s no \u201creal punishment for breaking the rules\u201d as House members are just \u201cexpected to adhere to the rules.\u201d", "description": "Fox News reported Wednesday night that some Republicans were hoping to be arrested and marched out of the hearing in front of TV cameras.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571886133/tucker-carlson-tonight_-_2019-10-23T220203.663_svvfkn", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
