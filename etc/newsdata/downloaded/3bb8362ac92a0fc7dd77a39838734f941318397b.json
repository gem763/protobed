It\u2019s lush and thick, and it probably holds many secrets. But it\u2019s good for more than just outward handsomeness and face warmth. It also protects Harden from himself.\n\nHarden\u2019s Houston Rockets were facing the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night, and with both teams tied as time ran out in the second quarter, Harden desperately tried to get a shot off. The Pelicans\u2019 Josh Hart had him well-guarded, though, and Harden couldn\u2019t get the ball in the air as the buzzer sounded.\n\nAngry that a foul hadn\u2019t been called, Harden slammed the ball against the floor \u2014 and then it bounced back directly into his face.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHarden hit himself in the face and Josh Hart couldn't believe it \ud83d\ude05 pic.twitter.com/MeNR5qleJL \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 27, 2019\n\nHart\u2019s reaction to the entire episode is absolutely priceless. His face is a mixture of surprise and confusion, with a little bit of concern sprinkled on top. And rightly so, because the ball came back hard at Harden, who walked off like nothing had really happened.\n\nAfter the game, a reporter of course asked Harden if getting a basketball full in the face hurt. He said no, and credited his glorious beard for protecting him.\n\nJames Harden had to laugh about getting hit in the face \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/xXufOlHdb1 \u2014 ESPN (@espn) October 27, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s just one more reason Harden should never, ever shave.\n\nJames Harden's beard protected him after he angrily slammed a basketball and it rebounded directly into his face.
