Not fun. Lots of blood.\u2019\n\nGiving her fans some sound advice, she added: \u2018Just a reminder to be careful while handling knives.\u2019\n\nWith fans clearly worried about her, Marzia went on to say: \u2018Thank you all for worrying about the toe. It is a very dark purple colour near the cut, so it\u2019s not looking pretty BUT I\u2019ve been able to walk all day so I assume it\u2019s not that serious. I\u2019m hoping it will heal on its own.\u2019\n\nMarzia issued a warning to fans (Picture: itsmarziapie)\n\nShe later updated fans, assuring them that there\u2019s \u2018no need to worry\u2019.\n\nSharing a cute cartoon drawing of what her toe might look like IRL, the 26-year-old doodled her digit with a big smile on its face.\n\n\u2018I see lots of questions about my toe so here it is today,\u2019 she wrote, with a winking emoji. \u2018It\u2019s definitely getting better and I\u2019m totally fine so no need to worry.\u2019\n\nAlthough Felix has still been uploading videos every day, the pair have been enjoying a well-earned break in Japan (which is where they got engaged back in 2018) following their wedding in London\u2019s Kew Gardens earlier this year.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
