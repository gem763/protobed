The book details the discrimination Aluko faced during her England career.\n\nCustomers have used the platform to call the book \u201canti-white racist drivel\u201d and \u201cfiction\u201d and accuse the Juventus forward of choosing to \u201cplay the race card\u201d and \u201ccoming across as a racist herself.\u201d\n\nAluko, who is black, and her publishers have asked Amazon to delete the racist reviews but they remained on the site on Friday night. Amazon told The Associated Press it does not suppress reviews based on star ratings but does use investigators and automated technology to prevent and detect inauthentic comments.\n\nAluko said the offensive reviews were \u201cclearly motivated by tribalism, bitterness and hatred\u201d and wrote in a column for The Guardian that \u201csometimes the law is the only solution.\u201d\n\nPenguin Random House, the publishers of the book, told the AP that \u201cwe\u2019re working with our author, Eni, on this issue and are in contact with Amazon.\u201d\n\nThe players\u2019 union in England and anti-racism activists have denounced Amazon, whose CEO is Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, for not removing the posts.\n\n\u201cAmazon, just like social media platforms, have a responsibility to tackle any racist or discriminatory abuse on their website,\u201d Kick It Out, English soccer\u2019s anti-discrimination body, told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019re angered by the racial abuse directed at Eni Aluko just for telling her story and we fully support her as one of the leading voices in football shining a light on key issues that the game must address.\u201d\n\nThe use of online reviews to abuse players has opened up a new front to be tackled by the Professional Footballers Association, which met recently with Twitter, Facebook and Amazon after a spate of racist posts directed at its members.\n\n\u201cWe have been proud of Eni for standing up against injustice in the past and we applaud her for her brave stance in this instance,\u201d PFA head of equalities Simone Pound said. \u201cAs a prominent female player and role model Eni is at the forefront of challenging abuse where and when it happens.\n\n\u201cWe are increasingly seeing our members being abused and harassed as they are fulfilling workplace commitments both on and off the field. As a member Eni will continue to have the full support of the PFA.\u201d\n\nThe book went on sale on Aug. 29 on Amazon.\n\n\u201cSome of what has been written about myself and my book is defamatory,\u201d Aluko said. \u201cIt is intended to put people off buying my book, and I intend to make sure they understand the consequences of such hatred.\u201d\n\nAluko capped 102 times for England and is a lawyer. She spent two years trying to convince the English Football Association to believe Mark Sampson as national team manager made offensive comments in 2014 about whether her relatives coming from Nigeria for a game were infected with Ebola.\n\nPressure from Aluko led to a new FA investigation after allegations of wrongdoing had been initially dismissed. The FA apologized to Aluko in 2017 after a review established she and a teammate had been racially discriminated against by Sampson but that the coach was not racist.\n\n\u201cAccusing someone of racism isn\u2019t something I would ever do lightly,\u201d Aluko wrote in her book. \u201cIt certainly hasn\u2019t been a pleasant experience. I\u2019m willing to bet that no one ever cried racism for fun, or for power, and yet so many people of color don\u2019t share their experiences because they would be shouted down, in the hideous phrase, for \u2018using the race card.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe autobiography covers identity and race issues, footballing successes that have seen Aluko win league titles with Chelsea and Juventus, and her career as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cI love being a black women, I wouldn\u2019t change it,\u201d Aluko wrote. \u201cIt has always been a cause for celebration and empowerment, never a crutch or an excuse.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Soccer star Eni Aluko has condemned Amazon for not removing racist reviews of her memoir posted on the online retailer's web site.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/britain_soccer_amazon_racism_69247_c0-544-2876-2220_s1770x1032.jpg?b6cb2fadfdff7dafa39780cce4820f3e101071e6", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
