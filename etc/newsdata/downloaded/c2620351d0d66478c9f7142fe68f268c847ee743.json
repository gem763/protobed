He frustrated the Padres for the most part, except in the third when Eric Hosmer hit a two-run single to pull San Diego to 3-2. That hit brought in Garcia, aboard on a leadoff walk, and Nick Martini, who had doubled.\n\nThe Padres had runners on the corners and no outs in the first but Melville got out of the jam. Garcia was thrown out by left fielder Raimel Tapia trying to score on Machado\u2019s fly ball, and Melville struck out Hosmer.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of borderline calls go my way early that helped out, but Tapia just making a play off a ball that could have been 500 feet from Manny Machado, that was amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was a turning point for me. We got on the board early, too, that\u2019s important in games like this.\u201d\n\nBlack said the rookie \u201cwobbled early. Tapia made a nice throw home for the double play. He weaved his way out of the third inning again, and then he sort of got it together in the fourth and fifth. That was good for him.\u201d\n\nIt was a matchup of the worst teams in the NL West. The Rockies, who made the postseason each of the last two seasons, came in 32\u00bd games behind the division-leading Dodgers. The Padres, who have struggled since the All-Star break, came in 26\u00bd games back.\n\nJairo Diaz pitched a perfect ninth for his first big league save.\n\nPadres starter Dinelson Lamet (2-4) allowed three runs - only one earned - and six hits in six innings.\n\nSan Diego manager Andy Green said the first inning \u201cstings a little bit. We haven\u2019t exactly been swinging the bats crazy here lately, so Hoff (coach Glenn Hoffman) took a chance over at third base, and it didn\u2019t work out for us. They made a really nice play at the plate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got them on the ropes right there. You kind of want to make him pay a little bit. We didn\u2019t do that. He got to settle in after that. Two runs came across on Hos\u2019 single. Outside of that we didn\u2019t really have a lot of good at-bats.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (1-5, 7.35 ERA) is scheduled to make his 11th start and second against the Padres. He allowed one run and three hits in five innings against San Diego on June 14 but got a no-decision in a 16-12 loss at Coors Field.\n\nPadres: LHP Joey Lucchesi (9-7, 4.00 ERA) is scheduled to make his team-leading 27th start Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Colorado rookie Tim Melville got Manny Machado to fly out in the first inning, which led to Greg Garcia being thrown out trying to score.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/rockies_padres_baseball_91381_c0-181-4325-2702_s1770x1032.jpg?3ad6f3cb8a9fa6a0e707eb490b798233b5273532", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
