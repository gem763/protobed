He remains a passive investor, his aides said, though they declined to describe the size of his investment. Employees at Farallon screen out any fossil-fuel-related holdings from his portfolio, and he no longer earns a share of the profits from the fund, the aides said.\n\nFarallon is still invested in carbon-generating industries, and the aides declined to say whether Mr. Steyer had asked it to sell those holdings, a request that would presumably hold significant sway given his role as a founder.\n\nThe Australian mine, known as Maules Creek, illustrates the complexities of Mr. Steyer\u2019s efforts to distance himself. Farallon was a major investor in a 2009 deal aimed at developing the mine, lending an Australian entrepreneur hundreds of millions of dollars to buy out the previous owner, according to people involved in the transaction. Eventually, the entrepreneur took the mine public, turning Farallon\u2019s investment into a large profit. An executive involved in the original deal estimated that Farallon earned tens of millions of dollars.\n\nFarallon remains an investor in Maules Creek to this day. Mining at the site, expected to start in 2015, will last up to 30 years, yield as much as 13 million tons of coal a year and generate about 30 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, according to Ian Lowe, the former head of the School of Science at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. (The company that owns the mine, Whitehaven Coal, disputes the carbon dioxide projection.)\n\nGiven Mr. Steyer\u2019s reputation as an active environmentalist, Australian opponents of the mine were startled to learn of his firm\u2019s role as an early investor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gobsmacking,\u201d Philip Spark, president of the Northern Inland Council for the Environment, a nonprofit trying to stop construction of the mine, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that such a person could have been involved in this project.\u201d\n\nMark Carnegie, an investment banker in Australia who was involved in the Maules Creek deal, said he could sense even then that Mr. Steyer was struggling to reconcile his motivations as a profit-seeking investor with his growing anxieties about the environment.", "description": "Though the environmentalist Tom Steyer has vowed to sell his investments in companies that generate fossil fuels, the projects his hedge fund bankrolled may emit carbon for decades to come.", "authors": ["Michael Barbaro", "Coral Davenport"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/05/us/STEYER/STEYER-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2014-07-05"}
