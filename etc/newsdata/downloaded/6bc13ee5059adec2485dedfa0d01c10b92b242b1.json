In a game with the matador defense of an All-Star Game \u2014 the score was 110-87, Pelicans, at the end of the third quarter, finishing at 133-109 \u2014 Williamson nonetheless forced his way into the NBA conversation, now and for the foreseeable future. He finished with 16 points on 6-of-13 shooting, with seven rebounds, three assists and three steals \u2026 plus a handful of dunks that will dominate Twitter for the next 12 hours.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThose dunks, man \u2026 those are going to be something to watch this year. Williamson followed that early windmill with a pump-jam from the heart of the paint, and then a stiff-legged throwdown midway through the second quarter. And each time, the hometown crowd responded with an, \u201cOHHHHHHH!\u201d like they\u2019d taken a kick in a bad spot. It\u2019s Zion\u2019s go-to move, but it\u2019s one he knows he can\u2019t rely on all by itself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think just dunking would have gotten me here,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to be something of a good basketball player. But I\u2019m glad to get the chance to showcase my abilities.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWilliamson was playing in the midst of the first of what will surely be a hundred media dustups, this one a gentle swirl over the comparisons of LeBron James \u2014 who played his first NBA game 16 years ago to the day \u2014 to Williamson.\n\n\"They shouldn't do that,\" Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry told ESPN before the game. \"We are not doing that. We are comparing Zion to Zion. We want Zion to be the best Zion Williamson that he can be. Not anybody else. We want him to be the best basketball player he can become using his name and no comparison.\u201d\n\nVince Carter, the ageless Jedi still suiting up for the Hawks, knows exactly what Williamson\u2019s going through.\n\nZion Williamson's here. (Illustration by Paul Rosales)\n\n\u201cThe world we live in now, there are expectations, people will try to compare you to someone else,\u201d Carter said after the game. \u201cI remember coming out and people were trying to compare me to Michael Jordan. Michael\u2019s Michael. I wanted to have fun and enjoy the game and show people what I can do.\u201d\n\nEven so, Williamson\u2019s arriving in the league hauling a Mardi Gras float of expectations from all sides: teammates, opponents, media, fans. Before Monday\u2019s game, State Farm Arena didn\u2019t have the full-to-the-brim contingent of bandwagoners it usually draws whenever a big name comes to town. But there were enough fans sporting brand-new Pelicans No. 1 jerseys to make Williamson and crew feel at home.\n\nAs Williamson sat on the bench, singing along to the overhead sounds of Bell Biv Devoe\u2019s \u201cPoison,\u201d they bellowed his name, they extended jerseys helpfully stretched out on cardboard, they sported signs that looked suspiciously overenthusiastic for a guy none of them had ever heard of 16 months ago:\n\nAfter his warmups, which mostly consisted of some ball-handling and agility drills, Williamson walked off the court and over toward the hungry crowd, and it was there he made a rookie mistake: he stopped moving. One too-long autograph led to a selfie led to another autograph, and before long the crowd had consumed Williamson like a Walking Dead horde. Pelicans assistants pried him out of the mire, perhaps with a bit of advice: sign and move, sign and move.\n\nYou see him carve his way through a defense like Thor arriving in Wakanda, and it\u2019s easy to forget that Williamson was born in a year that starts with a \u201c2.\u201d But watch closely, and you\u2019ll see it. His first basket of his NBA career \u2014 yeah, in a preseason game, but still \u2014 was a kiss off the left glass, and as it dropped, Williamson pumped his fist like the kid at the end of the church-league bench who finally got his first bucket. And he grinned during his postgame interview. Grinned! Nobody smiles in postgame interviews! Hasn\u2019t anyone told him that?\n\n\u201cIf it was up to me, I\u2019d be out there laughing and joking more,\u201d he smiled. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m a rookie. I\u2019m trying to feel things out. If I feel like I can laugh and play, I\u2019ll do it. But for now, low-key.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t perfect. His jump shot came and went, the Hawks were able to exploit the many holes in his defense, and his free throws were \u2014 well, not Shaq-like, but not good. (The merciless Sixth Man crew in Section 122 lit up Williamson with shouts of \u201cO-VER-RA-TED!\u201d and he responded by \u2026 missing both free throws.) The Pelicans ran a free-flowing offense with few set plays installed, and that left Williamson on the margins and out of position during many of the team\u2019s possessions. But that\u2019s the kind of problem that resolves itself quickly in practice.\n\n\u201cHe had his moments, and he continues to improve,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cHe\u2019s got work to do defensively, but that\u2019s the case with pretty much every kid that comes into this league.\u201d\n\nPlus, Williamson learned a bit about the vast difference between the NBA and, well, every other league. Late in the game, he drove the lane and tried a soft, left-handed floater. The Hawks\u2019 Alex Len, six inches taller than Williamson, blocked the shot and knocked Williamson to the floor. If that had happened in Durham, Len would have been arrested and jailed without bail. Here? Play on, gentlemen.\n\n\u201cPeople are much stronger [in the NBA],\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to find more skilled ways to score. But I feel like with my size, that\u2019s not going to be a big adjustment.\u201d\n\nJust after the final horn, Williamson made his way over to the Hawks, embracing Trae Young and former teammate Cam Reddish. He was about to leave the court when Carter, 42, pulled him close to speak a few words in the young star\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cEnjoy it,\u201d Carter said. \u201cLive in the moment. They drafted you because of who you are and what you can do.\u201d\n\nWhat he can do is already pretty damn impressive. If he continues to improve, we\u2019ll look back on this season as the start of something special.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
