Capital Economics now expects underlying inflation to fall towards zero next year.\n\nThe nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.3% in September from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast and slowing from a 0.5% gain in August.\n\nIt marked the slowest consumer inflation since April 2017, when the index rose 0.3%, the data showed. Prices of some 297 items rose but 168 items fell, while 58 others were unchanged.\n\nUnderscoring fragile domestic demand, an index stripping away the effects of fresh food and energy costs, which is seen by the BOJ as a key indicator of inflation, was up 0.5% in the year to September, slowing from the previous month\u2019s 0.6% gain.\n\nREADY TO ACT\n\nWith inflation stubbornly low, the central bank has signalled its readiness to expand stimulus by issuing a strong warning about overseas risks that threaten the economy and inflation momentum.\n\nTwo-thirds of economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to loosen monetary policy this month. Some 28 of 37 economists said the BOJ had already started laying the groundwork for deepening negative rates.\n\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda had said the move was among options the central bank would consider if it was to ease policy, despite concerns such a move could further hurt profits at financial institutions grappling with already thin margins.\n\nPolicymakers also worry that the export-reliant economy may lose support from domestic demand if the sales tax hike to 10% deals a blow to consumer sentiment and household spending.\n\nPedestrians walk at a scramble crossing at Shibuya shopping district in Tokyo, Japan September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/Files\n\nSlowing global demand and the fallout from the bruising U.S.-China trade war have taken a toll on exports and the business mood, clouding the outlook for Japan\u2019s economy and leaving the BOJ in a bind.\n\nYears of heavy money printing have failed to prop up prices and change public perceptions that inflation will be subdued, dashing the hopes of BOJ policymakers that aggressive monetary easing will lift Japan sustainably out of deflation.\n\nWith interest rates already at zero and companies hoarding cash instead of spending, many analysts doubt whether additional monetary easing would do much to lift inflation.", "description": "Japan's core consumer inflation slowed to near 2-1/2-year lows in September, dragged down by sliding energy prices and raising the chance the central bank will top up its already massive monetary stimulus at its review this month.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442106811&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H040", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
