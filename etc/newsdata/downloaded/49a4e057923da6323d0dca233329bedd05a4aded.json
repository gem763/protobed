Nothing wrong with it.\n\n\u201cWhen we returned the house was a mess, and when I went upstairs to my bedroom, I discovered that my bed was broken. I felt very violated by the fact that she broke it and didn\u2019t actually care that she broke it.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 10)\n\n(Image: Channel 10)\n\nA baffled Kyle told Rhiannon: \u201cOn mum\u2019s bed? Darl, that\u2019s the least romantic place I could imagine being with someone, on mum\u2019s bed.\u201d\n\nRhiannon went onto explain she broke the bed with some \"intense passion\".\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bang in the other bed?\u201d Kyle asked her.\n\n\u201cThe honest truth, my other friends were in that bed,\u201d she replied.\n\nWhen Rhiannon said she couldn't afford to pay the $2099 (\u00a31,632) that her mum wanted for a replacement bed, Nicole yelled: \u201cYou broke the bed, you pay for the bed.\n\n(Image: Channel 10)\n\n(Image: Channel 10)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just move on from this because I\u2019m getting married in nine weeks and she\u2019s supposed to be my bridesmaid, and we can barely speak two words to each other because of her lack of responsibility.\u201d\n\nIn a desperate bid to end the mother/daughter feud, Kyle wrapped up the case by ruling in Nicole\u2019s favour.\n\nHe said: \u201cRhiannon, really, you\u2019re responsible for breaking your mother\u2019s bed, so the ruling is $2099 so your mum can consummate her future relationship in her own bed.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 10)\n\nWhen she was outside the courtroom, Rhiannon continued to argue her case on camera and claimed she wasn\u2019t solely responsible for the broken bed.\n\n\u201cMy mum most definitely contributed to the breaking of that bed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have heard things that you cannot unhear as a daughter.\u201d", "description": "Rhiannon claimed her mum was also to blame for the broken bed and she has \"heard things that you cannot unhear as a daughter\"", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Angry-mum-demands-daughter-buys-her-new-bed-after-she-broke-it-having-sex-with-boyfriendo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
