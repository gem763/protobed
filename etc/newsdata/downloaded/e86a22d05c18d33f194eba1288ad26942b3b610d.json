After Roger Bannister in 1954 it took another 63 years, I tried and I did not get it.\n\n'After 65 years, I am the first man! I want to inspire many people, that no human is limited.'\n\nKipchoge, the four-time London Marathon winner whose official world record time is 2:01.39, added: 'I can say I'm tired. It was a hard run. Remember, the pacemakers are among the best athletes in the world.\n\n'I can say thank you to them, I appreciate them for accepting and together we made history on this one.\n\n'We can make this world a beautiful world and a peaceful world. My wife and three children, I am happy for them to come and witness history.\n\n'The positively of sport, I want to make it a clean sport and an interesting sport.'\n\nKipchoge warms up on the start line ahead of beginning his record marathon attempt\n\nThe Kenyan marathon man was attempting to run the first sub-two hour marathon in Vienna\n\nKipchoge runs with seven of the 41 pace-setters who helped him to reach his target\n\nThe pacer car fires a fluorescent green laser beam onto the road to mark where he needs to be\n\nKipchoge and his pacemaking team follow the timing vehicle as it emits a green laser\n\nKipchoge was racing alone but assisted by 41 pacemakers, including former Olympic and world record holders, in his attempt to achieve the milestone.\n\nThe time will not be an official world record but is nonetheless a historic moment in distance running.\n\nThe INEOS 1:59 Challenge was Kipchoge's second shot at the record after missing out by 25 seconds in his first attempt in Monza two years ago.\n\nHe had been greeted with a misty autumnal morning as he tore up the specially tailored course over 4.4 laps of the Prater Hauptallee, a park in central Vienna.\n\nGuided by lasers on the road from a support car in front and surrounded by seven pacemakers at a time, the world record holder stuck to a pace of 2min 50sec per kilometre.\n\nHe hit the hour-mark with 11 seconds to spare and with 500m to go burst clear of his support team to finally break the hallowed two-hour barrier.\n\nKipchoge was being guided by rotating seven-man teams of pacemakers, many themselves world class runners, and by an electric pacecar that emitted green lasers to show the ideal pace and the position they should be running.\n\nA smattering of crowds gathered in Vienna to watch the sub-two attempt on Saturday morning\n\nThe runners make their way past the Lusthaus on a chilly autumnal morning in Austria\n\nKipchoge takes the acclaim of the crowd as he races towards the finish line\n\nThe highly controlled attempt to break the two-hour barrier consisted of 4.4 laps of a 9.6 kilometre course, including a long straight with a loop at each end.\n\nThe sport's governing body, the IAAF, are not recognising the run as an official record because it is not in open competition and it uses in and out pacemakers.\n\nIn Monza, the scientific support team was put together by Nike.\n\nThis time, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, through his company Ineos, funded Kipchoge's shot at history.\n\nAs in Monza, Kipchoge ran in the Vaporfly, a Nike shoe containing a highly controversial carbon-fibre plate in the soles, supposedly capable of improving times by one per cent over any other shoe.\n\nLast September he ran the distance of 26 miles and 385 yards in the Berlin Marathon just 99 seconds outside the two-hour mark, shattering Kimetto's record by a minute and 18 seconds.\n\nIn April, he eased away from Sir Mo Farah soon after crossing Tower Bridge, finishing in 2hr 2min 38sec.\n\nBritain's richest man and founder of INEOS, Jim Ratcliffe (left), congratulates Kipchoge", "description": "Amid jubilant scenes in Vienna on Saturday morning, Eliud Kipchoge became the first runner to finish a marathon in under two hours.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/09/19620856-0-image-a-33_1570868442502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
