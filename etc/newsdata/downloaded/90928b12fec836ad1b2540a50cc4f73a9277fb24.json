We talked about that as a team.\n\n\u2018Sometimes those sorts of things can be overwhelming, but I think it came out in the mix today. While we are celebrating a lot of people are suffering.\u2019\n\nSkipper Michael Leitch revealed that the players discussed the tragedy on Sunday morning at their hotel, which swayed in the storm, before they cut Scotland apart to secure a four-try bonus point inside 43 minutes.\n\n\u2018The players knew how this game was more than just us,\u2019 said Leitch. \u2018A lot of people out there suffered in the typhoon. For this game to happen, there were guys up late last night with sponges at the ground. We are grateful for the opportunity to inspire Japan and we showed that for 80 minutes out there.\u2019\n\nTyphon Hagibis was one of the country's worst ever tropical cyclones and killed 23 people\n\nJapan now face a quarter-final with South Africa on Sunday and hope to repeat their heroics from the 2015 tournament when they beat the Springboks 34-32.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great for Japanese rugby,\u2019 said Leitch. \u2018Now we\u2019ve qualified for the quarter-finals, we\u2019re shifting the goalposts. We are not coming out next week to have a good game and lose. We\u2019re coming out to win.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Stuart Hogg admits he and Scotland were not good enough to reach the last eight.\n\nA minute's silence was held before kick off to remember the victims of devastating typhoon\n\nJapan produced a stunning display to become the first Asian team to reach the quarter-finals\n\n\u2018We\u2019re absolutely devastated to be heading home,\u2019 said Hogg. \u2018This has given me the kick up the backside that I probably needed to get better and I can guarantee that every single player in that Scotland dressing room is the same.\n\n\u2018If we were at our best we wouldn\u2019t be going home, it\u2019s as simple as that. This will eat away at me for a long time and it\u2019s going to hurt.\n\n\u2018You just have to say we were beaten by the better side. There were a lot of things that went wrong for us but you\u2019ve got to give credit to Japan. We\u2019ll be backing them now.\u2019", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKOHOMA: The Brave Blossoms beat Scotland on Sunday to complete a clean sweep of victories in Pool A and became the first Asian side to reach the knockout stages.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/20/19663244-0-image-a-2_1570993737515.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
