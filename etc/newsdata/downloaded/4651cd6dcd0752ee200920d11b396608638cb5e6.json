They also rushed to stores to buy flashlights, ice chests and batteries.\n\nPG&E said it planned to update customers by text message and email to Tuesday where and when the power would be cut off. Its website, where people could check whether their addresses would be affected, was down Tuesday afternoon after being overloaded with visitors. In Southern California, the largest numbers of potentially affected customers were in Los Angeles County and to the east in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\nWinds can knock down live wires and power poles or drive trees and other vegetation into contact with them \u2014 and some of California's most destructive blazes in recent years were started by PG&E power lines.\n\nBut the potential planned outages will not be limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimise the risk of wildfires.\n\nPublic agencies throughout the region were urging people to prepare by buying water and non-perishable food, getting a full tank of gas, having cash at hand and parking vehicles outside garages or making sure they know how to manually open their garage doors.", "description": "Two years to the day after some of the deadliest wildfires tore through Northern California wine country, a utility announced on Tuesday it will shut off power to more than 800,000 customers in the largest preventive outage in state history - to try to prevent wildfires caused by faulty power lines.With", "authors": ["Janie Har", "Olga R Rodriquez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iLzzFQhAYgjSnBT5JY1JGw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/94e908b91a1a4cdecb87229b81e6bebc", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
