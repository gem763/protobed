For the nine-month period ended September, net profit dropped 49% on year to Y92.35 billion, Canon 7751, -0.53% said.\n\nThird-quarter revenue decreased 6.2% from a year ago to Y869.50 billion, falling short of the FactSet estimate of Y891.89 billion. Drops in sales for its office printer, camera and industrial equipment businesses failed to offset some gains in its medical equipment segment.\n\nBy geography, sales fell in all regions except for Japan, with sales in Europe and Asia-Oceania dropping particularly sharply.\n\nCanon cut its full-year revenue and net profit forecasts. It now expects revenue to decrease 8.3%, compared with its previous forecast for a 5.2% fall, and it expects net profit to drop 45%, compared with its previous expectation for a 37% decrease.", "description": "By geography, sales fell in all regions except for Japan, with sales in Europe and Asia-Oceania dropping particularly sharply.", "authors": ["Kosaku Narioka"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
