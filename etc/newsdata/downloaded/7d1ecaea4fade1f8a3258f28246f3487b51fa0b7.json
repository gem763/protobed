Justin Amash says there is already a remedy provided by the Constitution: impeachment.\n\nDuring an interview with NPR, Pelosi said, \"I do think that we will have to pass some laws that will have clarity for future presidents. [A] president should be indicted, if he's committed a wrongdoing \u2013 any president. There is nothing any place that says the president should not be indicted.\n\n\"That's something cooked up by the president's lawyers. That's what that is,\" she continued. \"But so that people will feel 'OK, well, if he \u2014 if he does something wrong, [he] should be able to be indicted.'\"\n\nPelosi noted it is Justice Department protocol not to pursue charges for a sitting president. She said that should be changed.\n\n\"The Founders could never suspect that a president would be so abusive of the Constitution of the United States, that the separation of powers would be irrelevant to him and that he would continue, any president would continue, to withhold facts from the Congress, which are part of the constitutional right of inquiry,\" she reiterated.\n\nCurrently, according to the Constitution, punishment for breaking the law is impeachment under Article II, Section 4, stating that the president \"shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n\nThe Trump Admin is clearly violating federal statute by blocking the head of US Intelligence from providing Congress with a whistleblower complaint described as being of \"urgent concern & credible.\u201d The stonewalling must end. What is the President hiding? https://t.co/Yg0LqT5HMd \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) September 20, 2019\n\nAmash, who was the only GOP member of Congress to come out in favor of impeaching Trump in light of the Mueller report before he left the party to become an independent, fired back at Pelosi, tweeting that there doesn\u2019t need to be new legislation because the \u201cConstitution already provides a remedy: It\u2019s called impeachment. I\u2019m available to serve as speaker if I can be of help.\u201d\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t need this legislation to hold a president accountable, and it\u2019s not even good policy to allow a sitting president to be indicted. Moreover, the Constitution already provides a remedy: It\u2019s called impeachment. I\u2019m available to serve as speaker if I can be of help. https://t.co/OIAT6XQUeh \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 21, 2019\n\nPelosi has not shifted her position on impeachment, tamping down expectations by saying the American people must be persuaded with the strongest possible case by supporting the Judiciary Committee's investigation to determine whether or not to \"recommend articles of impeachment.\"\n\nA majority of Americans oppose impeaching Trump, according to a recent poll by Monmouth University released in August.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Pelosi calls for law to indict presidents, Amash cites impeachment", "description": "During an interview, Pelosi explained she thinks there needs to be a law to allow a sitting president to be indicted.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LdcDb7vSblEQUUO5lT9g.g--~B/aD0zMTY1O3c9NDUzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/91b6f50b6254b3218f3acf8836eacc82", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
