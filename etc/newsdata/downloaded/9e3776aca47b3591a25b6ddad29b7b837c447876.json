But that\u2019s hardly conclusive one way or the other, and we\u2019ll obviously have to put it through some proper testing with some more serious applications when it releases next month. (An early demo of the 8cx running Firefox conducted by my colleague Sean Hollister last December also impressed, though, so there\u2019s some room for optimism here.)\n\nAs for the hardware itself, Samsung\u2019s done a nice job here. The Galaxy Book S is ultra-thin and ultra-light (to the point where it fails the \u201cone-hand test\u201d for opening the lid without raising the whole laptop.) The aluminum case does suffer from the same, slightly cheap feeling that Samsung\u2019s other laptops have had in the past, but that\u2019s part of the price you pay for a 2.11 pound laptop.\n\nAnd despite how early leaks compared it to Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop, the actual Galaxy Book S feels a lot more like Apple\u2019s most recent MacBook Air in size, shape, and design. The trackpad uses Microsoft\u2019s Windows Precision drivers, the keyboard is pleasant to type on, despite the limited room for key travel, and the screen is a standard 13.3-inch FHD panel that neither astounds nor overly disappoints. Also unlike other thin-bezel laptops, Samsung has thankfully kept the webcam up top, where it belongs (although Windows Hello is only accessible through the fingerprint-reading power button.)\n\nThere are phone influences too, though, like the aforementioned Qualcomm processor that will make or break the Galaxy Book S and a combination SIM/MicroSD card slot hidden on the bottom (although unlike the just-announced Note 10, there\u2019s still a headphone jack.)\n\nGrid View Photo: Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nPhoto: Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nPhoto: Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nAssuming the processor and battery life hold up, though \u2014 and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d at this stage, given the history of ARM-based laptops to date \u2014 the $999 price point Samsung is targeting may be fair, and could let the Galaxy Book S usher in a new era of portable laptops.", "description": "Samsung just announced the Galaxy Book S, a device that looks to promise the best of both worlds by marrying the the battery life and LTE data of a smartphone with the power and feature set of a full Windows 10 laptop.
