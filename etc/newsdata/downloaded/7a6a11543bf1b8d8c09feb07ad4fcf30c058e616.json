Also, anyone missing a wheel?\u201d tweeted 25-year-old Ocean Cleanup founder Boylan Slat.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup's U-shaped plastic-catching system is engineered to passively collect trash from the garbage patch using the ocean's current.\n\nAP\n\nThis first year of testing in the unforgivable environment of the high seas strongly indicates that our vision is attainable and that the beginning of our mission to rid the ocean of plastic garbage, which has accumulated for decades, is within our sights,\u201d AP quoted Slat as saying.\n\nLate last year, the barrier broke under the constant pummeling by wind and waves in the Pacific, requiring four months of repairs before being relaunched from Vancouver in June.\n\nThe system also experienced a problem with \u201covertopping\u201d \u2014 waves that pushed the plastic over the line of floating corks that hold the screen. That was solved by using a line of larger corks to corral the plastic.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Slat plans to build a larger version of the system next year.\n\nSlat, a Dutch inventor who gained attention as a teenager when he developed the floating boom system which uses technology used for anchoring deep sea oil rigs.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A floating boom designed by a Dutch inventor to catch a huge island of floating plastic waste is finally working.
