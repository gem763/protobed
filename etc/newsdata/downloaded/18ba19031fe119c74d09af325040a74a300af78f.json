On the next drive, the Hokies scored to push their lead to 17-3. Hooker found Damon Hazelton -- who scored two touchdowns on Saturday -- for a 37-yard scoring strike.\n\nURI scored the game's next 11 points to pull within 17-14 early in the third quarter. Ram quarterback Vito Priore found Ahmere Dorsey on a nine-yard touchdown pass and then made the 2-point conversion.\n\nVirginia Tech scored on the next drive when Hooker led a 93-yard touchdown march. He hit Dalton Keene on a three-yard touchdown pass to give the Hokies a 24-14 lead.\n\nThe pattern of URI staying close and Virginia Tech promptly answering the visitors continued.\n\nThe Rams again moved within one score late in the third quarter. A 10-play drive produced a 41-yard C.J. Carrick field goal to make the score 24-17 in favor of Virginia Tech.\n\nThe Hokies responded to the challenge by scoring on the next possession.\n\nDeshawn McClease rushed for a 1-yard touchdown run to restore a two-score lead at 31-17 with 13:41 left in the fourth quarter.
