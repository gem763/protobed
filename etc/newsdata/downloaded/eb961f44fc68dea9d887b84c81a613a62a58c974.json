But the biggest drinkers are the Irish - they drink almost 15 litres per person a year.\n\nAs well as the famous Hen\u2019s Turd apple, you can make cider with apple varieties including Cat\u2019s Head, Sheep\u2019s Nose, Foxwhelp and Yellow Willy. The most widely planted cider apple is the Dabinett, while the Kingston Black is said by many to be the \u2018king\u2019. These cider apples differ from normal apples in being high in tannin and bittersweet. Bite and beware!\n\nTo make simple scrumpy or old leg-bender, all you need to do is crush and press your apples (harder than it sounds) add some yeast and leave to ferment. The natural sugars will turn to alcohol, but we can\u2019t guarantee how good this will taste. Some professionals use the wild yeast on the apple skin, while others pasteurise. Always make sure your equipment is completely sterilised.", "description": "With over 200 varieties of cider apple, here are some appley facts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p04sc6wl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
