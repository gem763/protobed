HKEX has until Wednesday to table a formal offer or walk away.\n\nHKEX indicated last month it may offer \u00a383 per share for LSE \u2013 valuing the business at \u00a329.6bn\n\nThe current offer is backed by more than \u00a322billion of HKSE shares. But a slide in the share price, which has already left a \u00a31.7billion hole in the funding, and hardnosed demands from LSE investors for more money means HKEX chief executive Charles Li will need to dig deep to win support.\n\nInvestors told The Mail on Sunday they would not relinquish control for less than \u00a390 a share. That is 22 per cent higher than the LSE\u2019s current share price of \u00a373.80.\n\nThe investors said they were braced for HKEX to improve its offer after Li made clear his determination to conclude a deal.\n\nOne shareholder said: \u2018I believe the chief executive doesn\u2019t take no as an answer. He would want to show a bit of resilience. The offer has to be significantly higher. The Hong Kong stock exchange has understood that a better headline price has to be offered.\u2019\n\nLi\u2019s proposal has so far been poorly received by the LSE board because it would scupper its plan to buy data firm Refinitiv for \u00a322billion from private equity firm Blackstone.\n\nLSE boss David Schwimmer said last month he wants to push ahead with the bid for Refinitiv, which provides trading screens. But investors said Li\u2019s representatives had made persuasive arguments in private meetings. HKEX has pointed out that the Refinitiv deal will leave the LSE saddled with debt. In addition, HKEX has said a Hong Kong tie-up will give even greater access to Chinese markets than the LSE\u2019s existing arrangements.\n\nConcerns that China is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong has been central to fears surrounding the bid. Six of the company\u2019s 13 directors are appointed by Hong Kong\u2019s government, which is the biggest investor with 6 per cent.\n\nLSE\u2019s shareholders said the Hong Kong exchange, which is willing to shake up its board, must take steps to address fears about China. This could include adding LSE directors to HKEX\u2019s board and establishing a dual listing in London to ensure regulatory scrutiny in the capital.\n\nHKEX and the LSE declined to comment.", "description": "The Hong Kong stock exchange is under pressure to find another \u00a34billion to convince London Stock Exchange investors to back its takeover bid, it has emerged.", "authors": ["Helen Cahill For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
