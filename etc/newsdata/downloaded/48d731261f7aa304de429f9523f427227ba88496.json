Trump never gave a direct reply.\n\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Trump asked Mason. \u201cWe have the president of Finland. Ask him a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have one for him,\u201d Mason responded. \u201cI just wanted to follow up on the one that I asked you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d the president expostulated, and demanded Mason ask Niinist\u00f6 a question. \u201cI\u2019ve given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question, don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump during a news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP) More\n\n\u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t want to be rude, I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question I asked you,\u201d Mason said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax, and do you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,\u201d Trump said, pointing to Mason.\n\n\u201cAnd I say in many places, the corrupt media because you\u2019re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it\u2019s corrupt, and you have some very fine people too \u2014 great journalists, great reporters, but to a large extent it\u2019s corrupt and it\u2019s fake. Ask the president of Finland a question, please.\u201d\n\nMason eventually gave up and posed a question to Niinist\u00f6 about his view of U.S. democracy, and another on foreign trade.\n\nTrump interrupted with a boast about the American economy and \u201ca big win for the United States\u201d before the Finnish president could answer.\n\n\u201cI think the question is for me,\u201d Niinist\u00f6 said mildly.\n\nWhen Trump told Niinist\u00f6 to \u201cpick somebody who\u2019s really nice\u201d from Finland to ask a question, a Finnish reporter asked, \u201cBecause this is the biggest issue here at the moment, I have to ask, what kind of favors has Mr. Trump asked from you?\u201d\n\nThe question drew gasps and laughter from the room.\n\n\u201cI think you mean the other way around,\u201d Trump said.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n", "description": "President Trump lashed out at a reporter Wednesday during a joint press conference with the Finnish president when pressed on the phone conversation that is the basis of an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hOgS4uBBFEM6TOCkNiQ2PQ--~B/aD0zODM4O3c9NTc1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1e9a4b80-e555-11e9-87e1-c5da51eb5a60"}
