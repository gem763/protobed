There are roughly 12,000 ISIS prisoners in Kurdish detention facilities, and it is not clear what will happen to them as a result of fighting between Kurdish and Turkish forces.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\u201d Mattis continued.\n\nAs reports came in of ISIS prisoners escaping detention, Trump suggested on Monday that the Kurds were deliberately releasing prisoners to try and drag the U.S. back into the region.\n\n\u201cKurds may be releasing some to get us involved,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cEasily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump announced on October 7 that the U.S. would pull troops from the Syrian-Turkish border in anticipation of a Turkish invasion of the region.\n\nTurkey has already begun to conquer territory in northern Syria, which it will use to resettle Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey. The incursion is also intended to push back Kurdish militia groups that Turkey considers terrorist organizations, some of which allied themselves with U.S. forces to fight ISIS.\n\nOn Monday, the E.U. unanimously condemned Turkey\u2019s invasion into Syria and called on member states to impose an arms embargo on Turkey.", "description": "James Mattis suggested during a Sunday interview that President Trump's withdrawal of troops from Syria would encourage a resurgence of the Islamic State.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
