How does it help me to make the quality decision that I need to make about strategic initiatives and capital allocation decisions if I get a 300-page report?\n\n\"When I was in private equity, one of the tests that we got was that we had to prepare position papers that were no longer than three pages. It was some of the hardest, rigorous discipline that I learned in my career,\" Ms Holman said.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of directors said they would need to make significant changes to remuneration structures as a result of the prudential regulator's proposed rules, the survey found.\n\nPWC Australia chairman Peter van Dongen says boards are understanding the need to think more carefully about non-financial risks. Rob Homer\n\nIn July the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) introduced draft rules that will require bonus payments to be based no more than 50 per cent on financial measures in an effort to stamp out bad behaviour, particularly by the banks.\n\nDespite outcries from some directors, who argued that new rules would curtail their ability to steer companies in the right direction, a survey by professional services firm PwC found that 58 per cent of directors had either made changes to bonus payments, or were anticipating making similar changes to the ones proposed by APRA.\n\n\"There is pragmatism among directors that they need to make changes to the way they think about non-financial risks and the APRA model goes to that,\" Mr van Dongen said.\n\nHe added that the need to rethink bonus structures had already been flagged by the Hayne royal commission and APRA's review of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, published in April last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr van Dongen said the willingness of directors to consider using more non-financial metrics when calculating bonuses was consistent with other parts of the survey, given to BOSS exclusively, which show that board members are increasingly requesting management to report on non-financial risks.\n\nSome 57 per cent of directors are asking management to disclose more risks such as technology, cyber-security and regulatory risks, while 55 per cent are demanding greater insights into customer complaints, both data and verbatim comments.\n\nMr van Dongen said any anxiety in the director community was related to the difficulty in measuring non-financial risks. \"There's the what and the how. How we do it is the million-dollar question,\" he said.\n\nIn a roundtable discussion, to be published in BOSS on Friday, Graham Bradley, chairman of HSBC Australia and Graincorp, warned that the definition of a financial target was vague.\n\n\"What is a financial measure? Is a cost reduction target a financial measure? Is a reduction in bad debts a financial measure? To my mind, they are, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what APRA has in mind,\" Mr Bradley said.\n\nBOSS will be published on Friday in The Australian Financial Review.", "description": "Just over one-third of directors said management had a tendency to be overly optimistic when it came to fixing complex issues, while nearly 39 per cent said management had a tendency to \"present\" to the board.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bcddcc6ea6c25b28fb7ec977ebf185ccae5062e6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
