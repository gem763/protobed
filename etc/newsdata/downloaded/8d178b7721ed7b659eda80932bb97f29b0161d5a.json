We'll see. That would be under the streaming umbrella,\u201d Dunn said of the idea to create a different type of album.\n\n\u201cA label executive came to me a few months ago and I blew him off at first,\u201d Dunn added. \u201cHe said, 'What do you think about doing like, three, maybe four songs of classic rock songs or songs out of the Brooks and Dunn-era that your fans would have listened to when they weren't listening to country?'\u201d\n\nDunn said he immediately knew which tracks he wanted to include in the mix as he already had a playlist on his computer filled to the gills with the era-appropriate cuts he enjoyed the most.\n\n\u201cI just opened it up and cherry-picked 12 or 13, I guess you could categorize them as classic rock songs, and I picked three songs to experiment with and doing it with the guys in the studio,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the guys right here have played on some of those records or with some of those bands and it snowballed and suddenly the label guy disappears because I think he's realized he's lost control of the session and it went from three to 24 [songs] in just a matter of days.\u201d\n\nRONNIE DUNN, K.T. OSLIN TO JOIN NASHVILLE SONGWRITERS HALL\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe next thing I know, I'm meeting with the label going, 'You know what, I think I'm not going to ask you to pay for this. In fact, why don't you just let me have it and I will just go until I run out of money or whatever. We're dedicated to any project, and the next thing I know we're getting ready to do the contracts and set up with all the streaming entities and my attorneys call and said, 'Look, you're crazy to not try and at least put a few of these out.\u201d\n\nThe 28-time Academy of Country Music Award winner said his process of selecting which records to play is simple. \u201cYou know, it's just gut feel,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I just let my unbridled artist do its deal and see what happens. Nine times out of 10, it's a train wreck \u2013 every now and then it hits and this one felt like it hit.\u201d\n\nDunn explained that he expects criticism from detractors who balk at the idea of a country singer covering rock 'n' roll records, but said the songs he is recording are already massively successful, so he is not concerned about unwritten rules.\n\n\u201cI love every song on here. That has nothing to do with me being a part of it. It's just that I love these songs,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cThey're already massive hits \u2013 that's good and bad at the same time because I'm sure I'll be crushed by some critics for trying to take these songs on, and especially on the rock side. But I just kind of don't care, you know. I had too much fun doing it. It's the most fun I've ever had on a project. I'm sure everybody says that after they come out of the studio with a record, but this really is.\u201d\n\nRECENTLY REUNITED BROOKS & DUNN REVEAL WHY THEY SPLIT\n\nEach of the 24 songs Dunn is reprising was hand-picked by the 15-time Country Music Association Award-winning artist and each carry with it a special moment that Dunn said makes the song a personal standout.\n\n\u201cThere is always that dynamic of where were you when you first heard this song or what was going on in your life when this song played, and we could play that game all day long with every song on here,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cSo that had a lot to do with it.\n\n\u201c\u2018Wonderful Tonight,' I had buddies in Tulsa who were in Eric's [Clapton] band back in the day and they were involved with recording that,\u201d Dunn recalled. \u201cI remember him talking about it and that's the reason I picked it.\u201d\n\nDunn said recording this album was the \u201cmost fun\u201d he\u2019s ever had on a project and touted the unconventional process of having a studio room full of contributors each with creative input or simply there for the ambiance, as a different dynamic that he found refreshing.\n\nBROOKS & DUNN DOMINATE AT CMA AWARDS\n\n\u201cThe players that I worked with, I think it's really a lot of fun if and when you can get these guys both motivated and fired up about a project and doing stuff,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cThere is a room full of producers when that happens \u2013 they all have input. They'll step up and go, 'Well, this is just not another session. We're not just playing songs for some producer doing records.\u201d\n\nThe two-time Grammy Award winner said he was just excited about being around a group of folks who loved to produce and make great music and said many of the recording sessions felt like old-school jam sessions.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn't leave once we started. Usually, they'll cut a song or two and they'll all go out to the lounge or something and hang out and they'll come back, a few more minutes and you call 'em back to cut another one or whatever, but everybody flooded into the control room and it was like it was chaos in there,\u201d Dunn recollected.\n\n\u201cOne guy is telling stories about how his uncle was in on the mixing of the 10cc song, 'I'm Not In Love,' so all that stuff is going on at the same time and it's really a blast. It's like, if there is any way that you can create that environment every day to cut a record, I would say that's the perfect way to do it.\u201d\n\nA recent inductee into the Songwriter\u2019s Hall of Fame, Dunn can now add one more accolade to his jacket. He and his crooning partner Kix Brooks will be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame in October, an honor Dunn said he still can\u2019t wrap his head around.\n\nBROOKS & DUNN REWORK HITS WITH NEW CLASS OF COUNTRY STARS\n\n\u201cKix [Brooks] and I were in a meeting in my barn, but it was storming like mad and two women came up, then they came in and I didn't recognize them \u2013 Kix knew them from, I guess the Hall of Fame and our manager was there,\u201d Dunn explained of the moment he and Brooks received news their country music legacy would be cemented forever. \u201cAnd, I'm thinking well, how odd, you didn't say anything about anyone coming over and Clarence, my manager stopped and he said, 'Hey, why don't y'all tell the guys what you're here for,' And I'm still going, 'I don't know who or where they're from,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cIt was storming like mad \u2013 so first of all, I'm thinking they probably had to swim back here,\u201d quipped Dunn. \u201cAnd they said, 'Well, we're just here to let you know that you're being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October,' and I was numb.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThen there was a long pause \u2013 a moment of silence and I think they were obviously waiting to see what the reaction was going to be, you know. And both Kix and I just looked at one another, then looked away and kind of went, 'Oh, wow \u2013 cool.' We didn't know what to say. I still don't know what to say. You know, this was a month or two ago and now that the official induction is in October, I don't know what I'm going to say.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDunn joked that while he has an innate ability to write and record hit songs, he \u201ccan\u2019t put a sentence together when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll be out walking around or something somewhere and I'll keep it low when I'm writing stuff down, but I don't know,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cKix is like \u2013 I call him the Churchill of country music, he's a great orator. It's gonna be politically correct and right down the pike, he's gonna hit all the bullet points, it's gonna be perfect and I'm going to stumble through it and I don't know what I'll do.\u201d\n\nDunn released his new cover of George Strait\u2019s \u201cAmarillo by Morning\u201d as well as \"Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress)\" on Friday. The singer and photographer will release two new singles every four weeks (one country and one rock) leading up to the album\u2019s launch in January 2020.", "description": "Ronnie Dunn is bringing his iconic style to some of his favorite country and rock music hits in a new solo album.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/RD-Promo2-Photo-Credit-Steven-Martine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
