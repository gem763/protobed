While Everton were on top by the time Holgate came up for a corner and stuck around to score the opening goal, they will have to play a lot better against Tottenham on Sunday if they are to avoid a sixth league defeat in seven games. The Carabao Cup may not come to Silva\u2019s rescue should that happen, for a side who take over an hour to score against Watford has no business dreaming of Wembley with Liverpool and Manchester City still at large. Tottenham are not bottom of the Premier League, and neither are they likely to make eight changes.\n\n\u201cWe deserved to win, we were the best team on the pitch, but we did not create much in the first half,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt is hard against a team with nine men behind the ball but we were more assertive in the second half.\u201d Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores said Watford\u2019s plan had only half worked. \u201cOur limitations are in the final third,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe defend well but we don\u2019t finish our counterattacks.\u201d\n\nSergio Ag\u00fcero hits double but Saints avoid hiding at Manchester City Read more\n\nRicharlison was booed throughout by the Watford supporters and initially seemed unnerved by it. His first few touches were indecisive and when Lucas Digne presented him with space to run into down the left \u2013 right in front of the travelling fans \u2013 the Brazilian made a complete mess of a good chance to open the scoring.\n\nQuick guide Carabao Cup roundup Show Hide Sunderland's Will Grigg and Marc McNulty both failed to convert from the spot as Oxford United won 4-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw at the Kassam Stadium. Oxford, who dumped West Ham out after winning 4-0 in the previous round, led at the break through Rob Hall's effort before McNulty equalised for Sunderland with 12 minutes left. James Henry, Anthony Forde, Tariqe Fosu-Henry and John Mousinho all converted in the shoot-out for Oxford, while Grigg blazed his spot kick off target and McNulty's effort was saved. Colchester extended their run into the latter stages of the competition with a 3-1 win at League Two rivals Crawley, the first time Colchester have reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup since 1974. Dannie Bulman's curling first-half finish for Crawley was cancelled out two minutes later by Luke Norris's header. Michael Luyambula's own goal early in the second half gave Colchester the lead and Luke Gambin added their third.

It that was an attempt to raise spirits and introduce a little cheerfulness, it failed to take into account the mordant Scouse wit. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d a supporter boomed as he took his place behind the directors\u2019 seats. \u201cHas Silva been sacked already?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marco Silva issues instructions to S\u00e9amus Coleman.

It was perhaps not the most difficult of saves, though Pickford was doing well just to be awake after enduring 60 soporific minutes as a spectator, and Gray\u2019s shot came with little warning.\n\nAt least it brought the game to life in the last half hour, and with Adrian Mariappa stopping a shot from Andr\u00e9 Gomes on the line and Iwobi hitting the angle of post and bar, Everton were suddenly looking most likely to score.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nDigne hit the bar with a free-kick as they stepped up the pressure, then after Walcott won a corner on the right he popped up on the left to collect a cross from Iwobi that would otherwise have run out harmlessly, returning it with more pace for Holgate to head home from the six-yard-line.\n\nStill Everton were defending doggedly when Richarlison scored the stoppage-time second that made for a somewhat flattering scoreline. Home hearts were in mouths when Gerard Deulofeu lined up a last attempt against his old club that might have taken the game to penalties, only for Cenk Tosun to sweep the ball upfield after the shot had been blocked to allow Richarlison to finish stylishly at the other end.", "description": "Everton made it through to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals after Mason Holgate and Richarlison scored in a 2-0 win over Watford", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66e124f052f0557ee9d4cc3d20098cd1946243ed/55_80_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47c216b2246fedc58181199c859faa53", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
