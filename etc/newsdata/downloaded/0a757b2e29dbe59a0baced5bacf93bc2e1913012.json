Stopping diplomacy, by contrast, is relatively easy. Hard-liners across the Middle East know this, and long have acted accordingly.\n\nThis rule of thumb is important to keep in mind in the aftermath of the weekend aerial attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil installations, including on the most important crude-oil processing facility in the world.\n\nResponsibility for the attacks remains uncertain. Iranian-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, locked in a bitter fight with the Saudi regime next door, claimed responsibility, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pointed the finger directly at Iran itself. U.S. officials on Monday went further, saying intelligence indicates the missiles came from Iranian territory.\n\nIn any case, the timing is deeply suspicious. The attack came just as President Trump has been considering taking a small step back from his campaign of harsh economic sanctions on Iran, to open the door to a dramatic meeting with Iran\u2019s president or foreign minister at the United Nations in coming days. France has been working hard to arrange just such a mini-rapprochement.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think the administration should move forward in its diplomatic efforts with Iran? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nBut there are plenty of people who don\u2019t want an outbreak of diplomacy, and some of them have missiles at their disposal to create a crisis that can stop the process in its tracks. Perhaps that is what the world saw play out over the weekend.\n\nThe list of suspects starts with hard-liners in the Iranian government. While many in the international community, and inside Iran itself, see Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to discard a nuclear deal negotiated with Iran under President Barack Obama as a crisis, some Iranian hard-liners see it as an opportunity.\n\nThe hard-liners, including leaders of the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, never liked the nuclear deal in the first place, and see its potential demise as a rationale for stepping up Iran\u2019s work on its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.\n\nTehran\u2019s hard-line faction also knows two things: Attacking a Saudi oil facility might, in addition to halting any diplomatic dance with Washington in its tracks, also scare European and Asian leaders into providing some economic relief from American sanctions.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t prove that Iran was responsible for the attacks, of course, merely that its hard-liners probably aren\u2019t unhappy to see fires blazing at Saudi facilities.\n\nHouthi forces in Yemen have similar interest in escalating tensions. The Houthis, with Iran\u2019s full backing, are fighting a kind of proxy war with Saudi Arabia, which is trying to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government.\n\nThe Houthis have ample reasons of their own to hit Saudi facilities, which they have been doing with increased frequency, as a reprisal for brutal Saudi airstrikes. But the Houthis also have reason to worry about an outbreak of diplomacy. They could be left hung out to dry in any diplomatic process that eases tensions among Iran, the U.S. and America\u2019s friends in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Houthis also surely know that support for Saudi Arabia is wearing thin in Congress, where agitation over the Saudi government\u2019s role in the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and other human-rights abuses isn\u2019t subsiding. Lawmakers from both parties over the weekend warned the Trump administration not to get dragged into Saudi Arabia\u2019s fight with the Houthis and Iran as a result of the weekend strike.\n\nIn sum, the Houthis have plenty of incentive to keep stirring the pot. They also are available as a proxy force for Iranian hard-liners who want the same thing.\n\nMeantime, there is another Iranian proxy force, the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, with similar motivation to strike out. The PMF holds territory within Iraq and operates there with the implicit acquiescence of the Iraqi government, and with the active assistance of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. Israel is sufficiently worried about the PMF as an outpost for Iranian hard-liners that it apparently has struck the group\u2019s facilities with airstrikes in recent weeks.\n\nThe point is that all of these forces\u2014Iran\u2019s own hard-line factions, the Houthis in Yemen and Iranian allies in Iraq\u2014have an incentive to stop a diplomatic process before it really gets rolling. Any U.S.-Iranian deal would, almost by definition, trade sanctions relief from the U.S. for, among other things, a reduction in Iranian support for radical forces in the region.\n\nSuch a negotiated outcome might seem far-fetched right now. Yet the idea clearly has some appeal to Mr. Trump. Despite a tweet he sent out Sunday, saying suggestions that he was willing to meet with Iranian leaders with no conditions were an example of \u201cfake news,\u201d Mr. Trump said exactly that in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd this summer. Asked whether he had any preconditions for a meeting with Iranian leaders, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cNot as far as I\u2019m concerned. No preconditions.\u201d\n\nAs plenty of Middle East bad actors know, the best way to head off such a diplomatic overture is to kill the idea in its cradle.\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
