Because Allen was a coach at Spurs when Kane was first emerging. He was deputed to help the youngster with his finishing.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t teach instinct, and scoring is instinct,\u201d he says of his assignment. \u201cHarry had that, no doubt. He possessed a real knack of being in the right place at the right time. But he also had the mentality to improve; all I could do was ask the question of him. And he had answers. I have nothing but admiration for him. He worked tirelessly on everything he knew he could improve.\u201d\n\nNot that, even with Kane\u2019s relentless drive, Allen believes his record will fall easily. \u201cIt will be much harder for Harry because of squad rotation,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t happen in our day. Though I remember I got left out of our last league game of that season when David Pleat [then Spurs manager] said I\u2019m going to rest you ahead of the FA Cup final. I was furious. I could have had 52.\u201d That was the thing about Allen: scoring was his raison d\u2019etre. He was going to title his book, with tongue firmly in cheek, Clive Allen: He Only Scores Goals. Because that was the standard assessment of him in his time: he doesn\u2019t head the ball, he doesn\u2019t hold up play, he doesn\u2019t run; all he does is score.\n\n\u201cScoring is the hardest thing to do in the game, yet it was belittled,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019d say if you score one every two games [as he did in his career], that is some contribution. One of the things my dad always said to me was, \u2018score goals and someone will take a chance on you\u2019. Every team needs goals.\u201d\n\nAnd yet he was continually moved on, playing everywhere from Carlisle to Bordeaux, with most of London in between. No more so than right at his start when, as an 18-year-old, Arsenal made him the first million-pound teenager when they signed him from QPR. He was a Gunner for just over a month, never played a game at Highbury, and was moved on to Crystal Palace as a transfer makeweight for Kenny Sansom.\n\n\u201cIt was completely bizarre,\u201d he says of that deal. \u201cPeople who hear about it now can\u2019t comprehend it. If someone paid what would be the equivalent these days of \u00a350 million for a teenage striker, they wouldn\u2019t be moving them on without even playing them.\u201d", "description": "Here\u2019s a pub quiz question:", "authors": ["Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/16/213225717_John-Nguyen-JNVisuals_Clive-Allen-former-footballer-and-now-commentator-with-BT-Sports-Lon-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_5N-0DdehnaXbMclteKo_9BkZ-btKWQOjv00vLJ4gPQ.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
