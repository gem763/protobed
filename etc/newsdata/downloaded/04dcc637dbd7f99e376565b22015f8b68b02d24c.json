The new article also focuses on the PlayStation 5\u2019s SSD \u2013 which it\u2019ll use instead of a traditional hard drive \u2013 and support for 4K Blu-ray discs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor unexplained reasons Sony chose not to support 4K Blu-rays with the PS4 Pro, even though the Xbox One X does, but the PlayStation 5 will definitely be able to play them.\n\nThat means that games will also be able to use 100GB Blu-ray discs, although installation will be mandatory \u2013 so it\u2019s really just for storage.\n\nPlayStation 5 system architect Mark Cerny spent the most time talking about the console\u2019s SSD (solid-state drive) which should greatly improve loading times on next gen games, although he failed to say how big the SSD would be.\n\nInstead he talked about how it would help to improve the user interface, so that you have a much more dynamic UI where you can see what\u2019s going on in a game, including online activities, without having to start it up.\n\nThe way the SSD works will also make it easy to install only certain segments of a game, such as its multiplayer or single-player, and chop and change them as you wish.\n\nA new render of what the PS5 dev kit supposedly looks like (pic: LetsGoDigital)\n\nThere wasn\u2019t any new detail on the PlayStation 5\u2019s processors though, just confirmation that the CPU is based on AMD\u2019s Ryzen line and the GPU is based on the Navi family of chips.\n\nSony also refused to be drawn on what the console looked liked, with the 3D renders by LetsGoDigital, of a leaked patent for the dev kit, being the current best guess.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting quote in the article though comes from Marco Thrush, president of Bluepoint Games \u2013 the developer behind the Shadow Of The Colossus remake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The SSD has me really excited,\u2019 said Thrush. \u2018You don\u2019t need to do gameplay hacks anymore to artificially slow players down \u2013 lock them behind doors, anything like that. Back in the cartridge days, games used to load instantly; we\u2019re kind of going back to what consoles used to be.\u2019\n\nWhat exactly Bluepoint are working on at the moment is a mystery, as they mentioned a major new remake some time ago and have never said what it is. In the Wired article they refer to it as \u2018a big one\u2019 but there\u2019s still no clue what game they\u2019re talking about, with fan guesses ranging from Demon\u2019s Souls to Metal Gear Solid.\n\nBluepoint\u2019s presence at such an important PlayStation 5 event suggests that whatever it is, it may well end up being a launch title\u2026\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Leaked PS5 dev kit images were real, but what does the PlayStation 5 look like?\n\nMORE: PlayStation 5 name and Christmas 2020 release date confirmed\n\nMORE: Sony planning to acquire more game developers for PlayStation 5", "description": "The details on Sony\u2019s next gen console continue to trickle out, with more on the new UI, SSD usage, and possibly a new Bluepoint remake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gettyimages-454463424_1570554496.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
