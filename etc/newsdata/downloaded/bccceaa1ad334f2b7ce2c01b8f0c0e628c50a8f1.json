Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, progressive genetic condition that primarily affects the lungs and digestive track, causing thick mucus to develop, which can lead to life-threatening infections, inflammation and lung and respiratory issues. CF impacts approximately 27,000 people in the United States, according to the FDA.\n\nRelated:\u200b The Lessons I\u2019ve Learned Living With a Terminal Illness\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which prevents the production of CFTR proteins and inhibits how much fluid and salt moves in and out of your cells, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. As a result, mucus builds up in the lungs and blocks airways and traps bacteria, causing infection. Mucus that collects in the pancreas prevents key nutrients from being absorbed.\n\nTrikafta targets CFTR proteins affected by gene mutations to help them function more efficiently in the body. Unlike other available drugs that target more limited gene mutations, Trikafta can be used by patients who have at least one F508del mutation in their genes. This is the most common mutation (out of 2,000 known CFTR mutations) seen in up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\nTrikafta, which was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, was fast-tracked by the FDA and reviewed and approved in about three months, the FDA said. Vertex submitted two clinical trials that showed Trikafta improved lung function more effectively than a non-active placebo or other, more limited available CFTR-targeting drugs. One of the trials also showed an improvement in sweat production and body mass index.\n\nRelated:\u200b What the Movie 'Five Feet Apart' Means to Me as a Chronically Ill Teen\n\nIn general, the FDA decided Trikafta was relatively safe. The most common side effects included rashes, flu symptoms, headaches, upper respiratory tract infections, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nasal congestion, mucus in the nasal cavity and sinus infections. Trikafta may increase elevated liver function, so the FDA said patients need to take the drug with others that reduce these liver enzymes.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s landmark approval [makes] a novel treatment available to most cystic fibrosis patients, including adolescents, who previously had no options and giving others in the cystic fibrosis community access to an additional effective therapy,\u201d said acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D., in a press release, adding:\n\nIn the past few years, we have seen remarkable breakthroughs in therapies to treat cystic fibrosis and improve patients\u2019 quality of life, yet many subgroups of cystic fibrosis patients did not have approved treatment options. That\u2019s why we used all available programs, including Priority Review, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and orphan drug designation, to help advance today\u2019s approval in the most efficient manner possible, while also adhering to our high standards.\n\nRelated:\u200b The Cost of Awareness in 'Five Feet Apart'\n\nThe approval of the triple-combination modulator represents a truly transformational milestone in the fight against #cysticfibrosis. We could not be more excited about this pivotal moment in the history of CF. https://t.co/OEVnfRIaKc \u2014 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (@CF_Foundation) October 21, 2019\n\nTrikafta has been hailed as an \u201cexciting\u201d \u201cmiracle\u201d drug by the cystic fibrosis community, including Dr. Joan DeCelie-Germana, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center at Northwell Health, whose treatment center participated in clinical trials of Trikafta.\n\n\u201cPatients had an improvement in lung function and less illness [and] they will enjoy more days without antibiotics and better quality of life,\u201d DeCelie-Germana told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s inspirational. I couldn\u2019t have even thought of this 30 years ago. It\u2019s not a cure, but it\u2019s the closest thing we have.\u201d\n\nAccording to ABC News, Vertex will make Trikafta available within two weeks \u201cthrough speciality pharmacies.\u201d It will carry an average annual cost of $311,000, which Vertex representatives told ABC is likely to be \u201creimbursed by private insurers and Medicaid/Medicare.\u201d\n\nRead more stories like this on The Mighty:\n\n'Five Feet Apart' Director Justin Baldoni Shares Messages From Cystic Fibrosis Advocates\n\nThe Problem With Trying to Make Illness 'Relatable' for Healthy People\n\nInfluencers Delete 'Five Feet Apart' Ads After Backlash From Cystic Fibrosis Community", "description": "The FDA approved a new triple-combination drug therapy, brand name Trikafta (elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor), for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.", "authors": ["Renee Fabian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W9s0Mf1.3FPu1OPgjE4ARQ--~B/aD0yMTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_mighty_beauty_225/49c27803a2e73351f0dff3c0fc824dd4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
