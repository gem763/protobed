In March she became the first female jockey to win a top-flight race at the iconic Cheltenham Festival\n\nIn between competing, Frost joined in the carnival atmosphere of the day, walking amongst the fans and answering any questions the crowd might have.\n\nShe admitted to \"throwing myself in the deep end\" by making the switch from jumps to flat horses but was happy to help the sport develop.\n\n\"It gets massive support from the owners and the trainers as well,\" said Frost. \"Days like this you wouldn't know the difference between a flat meeting and an Arabian meeting.\"\n\n\"Crowds are really coming in because the money is behind it. So the children and everyone can have a class day.\"\n\nFrost was not the only big name to take place in the event, with four-time Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Olivier Peslier also competing in front of the enthusiastic crowd.\n\nPhotos: Why \"Glorious Goodwood\" is so loved Goodwood racecourse offers far-reaching views across the Sussex Downs in the south of England.
