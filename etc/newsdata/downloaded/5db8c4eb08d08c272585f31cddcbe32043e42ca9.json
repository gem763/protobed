Like mutual funds, ETFs are packaged to allow investors access to a group of securities, offering more diversification than you\u2019d get by buying, say, one company\u2019s stock, or bonds from one issuer. But ETFs are different from mutual funds in important ways.\n\nBenefits of ETFs\n\nMore easily-traded: \u201cExchange-traded\u201d means that ETFs change hands on an exchange, like stocks. Most investors don\u2019t have to worry about the mechanics behind trading. What \u201cexchange-traded\u201d means in practice is that you can buy and sell \u2014 and see the price of \u2014 an ETF at any given moment, rather than waiting until the trading day is over for everything to settle, as mutual funds require.\n\nThat also helps make ETFS more transparent than mutual funds. The specific holdings within any ETF are knowable any day, whereas mutual fund holdings are only published every quarter. That\u2019s so that all the participants in the market, from big institutions down to someone trading small amounts from a home computer, can determine the value of the fund at any time, explains J. Garrett Stevens, CEO of Exchange Traded Concepts. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know what\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\nLower tax burden: When an investor sells shares of a mutual fund, he or she is effectively forcing that fund manager to sell securities to honor the redemption request. That may result in capital gains implications for investors, whether or not they\u2019ve sold their shares during the year. That doesn\u2019t happen in ETFs, so there\u2019s no tax burden. (If you\u2019re really interested in the mechanics, this story has some background on ETF infrastructure.)\n\nCheaper: The ETF industry grew up on what\u2019s called \u201cpassive investing.\u201d Instead of relying on money managers who pro-actively buy and sell stocks or bonds according to a strategy they develop \u2014 and may hone over time \u2014 passive managers pre-determine an index for their fund to track. There are some actively-managed ETFs, but they only account for about 2% of the entire fund universe, according to data from CFRA First Bridge.\n\nThe Index tracked by an EDF may be something already known in the market \u2014 say the S&P 500 SPX, +0.91% \u2014 or may be something fund managers create on their own. That strategy could be a broad investing theme, like only \u201cmomentum\u201d stocks, or it could take a more tailored approach like the idea described in this story: investing in Chinese companies, but avoiding those owned by the Chinese government.\n\nEvery so often, usually annually, an ETF manager will review the holdings in the fund and make sure they still match up to the mission set out as the fund\u2019s original objective. But in general, there\u2019s far less buying and selling of the securities that make up a passively-managed fund than an actively-managed one, which helps keep investor fees much lower.\n\nInvestors pay less for ETFs in both the active and passive categories than for mutual funds.\n\nYou should always read the fund documentation before investing to be sure. Some ETFs offer lower teaser fees to start off, with the understanding that the fee may increase in time.\n\nAlso make sure you know the specifics behind the index that the fund tracks. Some funds may have similar-sounding names or themes. Here\u2019s one example:\n\nThree granddaddies of the ETF universe, iShares\u2019 Core S&P 500, IVV, +0.95% , Vanguard\u2019s 500 Index Fund, VOO, +0.93% and the SPY ETF, formally known as SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY, +0.95%, all passively track the benchmark S&P 500 stock index. But there\u2019s another set of funds that takes the same 500 stocks, but assigns them all an equal index weighting, rather than letting stocks with bigger market capitalizations dominate the index. One example of an equal weight ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index comes from Invesco: RSP, +0.89% A tweak like that can sound small but have a sizable impact on returns, so it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re buying into.\n\nAn ETF drawback: retirement plan\n\nOne downside: ETFs are far less available in traditional employer-sponsored retirement plans. Like stocks, ETFs can\u2019t easily be bought in fractions, Stevens notes, which is what needs to happen when small percentages of employee paychecks are making regular, ongoing purchases of a fund.\n\nMore to the point, \u201cmany of the key features of ETFs become far less appealing in a 401(K) plan,\u201d Morningstar\u2019s Ben Johnson says. Most employer-sponsored retirement plans offer access to low-cost indexed mutual funds. What\u2019s more, the tax efficiency mentioned above is moot in a pre-tax investment structure like 401(k)s. Finally, the other advantage of ETFs mentioned here, tradeability, \u201cis not something you want 401(k) participants to be doing,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou want them focused on the long-term.\u201d\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nHere\u2019s why ETFs can\u2019t bring down the financial system, iShares says\n\nWhat is factor investing?\n\nThree fund managers may soon control nearly half of all corporate voting power, researchers warn", "description": "Exchange-traded funds are a great tool for investors, but there are some basics to understand about their benefits, like lower costs, and a few drawbacks.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS995_laptop_ZG_20191009144945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
