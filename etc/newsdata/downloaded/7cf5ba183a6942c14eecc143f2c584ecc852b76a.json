That\u2019s according to the show\u2019s star Ben Platt, who answered a question from Variety about the \u201cbiggest perk\u201d of working with Paltrow by saying, \u201cWe never have to do many takes because (a) she\u2019s brilliant and she never needs more than a few, and (b) she simply doesn\u2019t have time, so whenever Gwyneth was there, everyone is on their toes and working at their most efficient level.\u201d First of all, congrats to Goop\u2019s empress on still having the chops to get everything done quickly while paying more attention to her wellness empire. Second, it\u2019s funny that Gwyneth insisted on filming everything quickly, because her husband and Politician creator Brad Falchuk also told Elle that Paltrow would show him long chunks of dialogue, and \u201cbe like, \u2018I have a board meeting in two days. Please don\u2019t make me do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, we know both that Paltrow insisted on memorizing as little as possible for The Politician and filming it as quickly as possible. Given that she never bothered to see her own movie Spider-Man: Homecoming and has seemed to have only the vaguest memories of her other Marvel Universe co-stars, we\u2019re desperate to know whether she\u2019s retained any information about the people she interacted with on The Politician. Gwyneth, do you know who Ben Platt is? Did you ever know? For efficiency\u2019s sake, did you just call him Evan Hansen the whole time?", "description": "According to Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow did not budget much time to film more than a few takes for her scenes on The Politican.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-gwyneth-paltrow-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
