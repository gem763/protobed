Ltd.; Yitu Technologies; and Yixin Science and Technology Co. Ltd, according to a Commerce Department notice posted on the Federal Register website.\n\nThe ruling Chinese Communist Party has placed more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in internment camps, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe move, which has been under consideration for months, may appease some Republicans who criticized President Donald Trump of appearing soft on the authoritarian actions of China.\n\nIt also comes as the United States is preparing to host Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday and Friday for high-level trade talks aimed at unraveling tariffs the two sides have imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods over the past year.\n\nIn comments to the media, Trump indicated Monday that he didn\u2019t want a partial deal with China but hinted that trade talks this week could result in something \u201cvery substantial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would much prefer a big deal and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for,\u201d Trump said during a White House event to formally sign a Japanese trade deal. \u201cCan something happen? I guess, maybe, but it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\n\nLiu and other senior Chinese officials will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday for what will be the 13th round of talks.\n\n\u201cThey want to make a deal,\u201d Trump said of Beijing. The U.S. is set to escalate tariffs on roughly $250 billion worth of imports on Oct. 15.\n\nTrump also again denied that he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would stay quiet on the unrest in Hong Kong during the ongoing trade talks with Beijing.\n\n\u201cI think if anything bad happened that would be a very bad thing for the negotiations,\u201d he said, adding that he wants a \u201chumane solution\u201d to the unrest there.", "description": "The Trump administration on Monday blacklisted eight Chinese companies whose products are used in the surveillance of Uighur Muslims in Western China.
