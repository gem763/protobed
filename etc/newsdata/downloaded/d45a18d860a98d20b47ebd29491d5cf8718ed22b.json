The Scots now face a potential quarter-final decider with hosts Japan on the final weekend of the group stage.\n\nLesson one in the manual on how to beat Ireland is to cherish the ball. Scotland must have packed the Japanese version as three mistakes in the first-half led to three tries for their opponents and a spirit-sapping 16-point deficit at the break.\n\nItaly overcome early scare to beat spirited Namibia in Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nScotland like to play fast and loose and the close-cropped surface here suited them, but the weather did not as the clear skies earlier in the day gave way to cloud and light rain. They started as if determined to emulate New Zealand the day before and adopt perpetual motion, but they were behind after five minutes.\n\nScotland had been attacking on halfway, having worked a trace of space on the left, but Duncan Taylor\u2019s pass to Sean Maitland went into touch. One Conor Murray break later followed by Ian Henderson\u2019s rampaging run and Ireland were hammering away at the line where James Ryan eventually made his way over.\n\nFive minutes later, Grant Gilchrist lost possession and Jordan Larmour turned defence into attack. Ireland were awarded a penalty, from which they drove a maul from the line-out. Rory Best somehow twisted his body under pressure from Ryan Wilson to ground the ball just before losing control of it.\n\nScotland struggled to deal with Ireland\u2019s line speed in defence. Their outside-half, Finn Russell, was given no time to consider his options and although Greig Laidlaw kicked a penalty after 21 minutes, another botched Scottish move led to an Irish try. Russell failed to find Tommy Seymour as the wing cut inside and Andrew Conway hacked on from his own half.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nStuart Hogg was always going to win the race for the ball, but as he ushered it over the line for a drop-out, it hit the goalpost and bounced back. Hogg picked it up, with Conway forcing him to concede a five-metre scrum. CJ Stander charged off the back of the pack, Peter O\u2019Mahony maintained momentum with a pick-up before Tadhg Furlong found room between Jonny Gray and Stuart McInally to score.\n\nIt could have been worse for Scotland. Sam Johnson made a try-saving tackle on Larmour after yet another counter-attack from a turnover and Murray, who had dictated play throughout, missed a late penalty from long-range. The one concern for Ireland was injuries, with Bundee Aki failing a head injury assessment and O\u2019Mahony left the field after helping create the third try.\n\nEngland v Tonga: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live! Read more\n\nScotland had come back from almost double the 16-point deficit at Twickenham at the end of the Six Nations, but the circumstances and conditions were considerably different. They nearly went further behind within a minute of the restart after losing the ball again. Conway kicked in and beat Hogg to the touchdown, but only after giving the full-back a shove which was detected by the referee Wayne Barnes.\n\nScotland lost the flanker Hamish Watson just before the break after his right knee buckled as he was being cleared out of a ruck by Ireland\u2019s two props. He was replaced by a hooker, Fraser Brown. Scotland did change course by opting to take play through phases and suck in the defence, but having made it to within 10 metres of the line, John Barclay knocked on and the resulting scrum finished in an Ireland free-kick.\n\nThe excellent Murray delivered the bonus point and snuffed out any prospect of a Scottish revival. First, his weighted kick was dropped by Ryan Wilson and after Larmour had been brought down, the scrum-half detected Conway was in space on the right and duly sent him over.\n\nIreland then took off Jonathan Sexton, who looked as if he had aggravated an old groin injury, along with Murray and slipped into cruise control. Jack Carty kicked a penalty as both teams pondered their different routes to the last eight. Tadhg Beirne was sent to the sin-bin 11 minutes from the end, but still Scotland could not find a way through and finished a distant second.", "description": "A trio of tries from Ireland\u2019s forwards helped Joe Schmidt\u2019s side to a 27-3 win over Scotland in Pool A, before Andrew Conway added a bonus point with a second-half score", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffe5db20fb202a04876d9cfce6a17a45bb373398/0_45_3051_1830/master/3051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5cdd91b5c4004bb0935875a2ec1e175e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
