(Global Firepower appears to have changed its methodology from that of previous lists the 2019, yielding different index numbers.)\n\nThe ranking assesses the diversity of each country\u2019s weapons and pays particular attention to their available manpower. Geography, logistical capacity, available natural resources, and the status of local industry are also considered.\n\nRecognized nuclear powers receive a bonus, but their nuclear stockpiles are not factored into the score. Landlocked countries are not docked for lacking a navy, but countries with navies are penalized if their fleets lack diversity. (Helicopter carriers are included alongside traditional fleet carriers in Global Firepower\u2019s ranking.)\n\nNATO countries get a slight bonus because the alliance theoretically shares resources, but in general, a country\u2019s current political and military leadership was not considered (though financial health and stability are).\n\nThe top power index score is 0.0000, which is \u201crealistically unattainable,\u201d according to Global Firepower. The closer they are to this number, the more powerful their military is.\n\nPer these criteria, these are the 25 most powerful militaries in the world:\n\n25.
