Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nTwo anxieties loom large for EU governments:\n\nthe chaos that many fear a no-deal Brexit would bring\n\nand the amount of EU time and energy eaten up by Brexit\n\nThey have other pressing issues to deal with, such as eurozone integration, the migrant crisis and climate change.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Tony Connelly of Irish broadcaster RTE tweeted that \"all outstanding issues with the exception of VAT are now resolved\", quoting an unnamed EU source in Brussels.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Anti No Deal Brexit protests have been staged in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland\n\nSo, a draft Brexit deal could be signed off at this summit. But there are doubts over whether the PM will get a majority at Westminster to approve it.\n\nA cross-party group of MPs opposed to Brexit was in Brussels on Wednesday, insisting that any deal should be put to a new UK referendum.\n\nPro-Remain MPs argue that in 2016 no such deal to leave both the EU single market and customs union was put to voters.\n\nWhy has Brexit focused so much on Northern Ireland?\n\nBoth the EU and UK pledged to prevent the return of a \"hard\" border in Northern Ireland.\n\nBut when the UK leaves, that border becomes an external border of the EU.\n\nImage copyright Press Association Image caption Could middle ground between the EU and UK positions be found before Thursday's summit?\n\nThe Republic of Ireland has warned all along that any customs checks on the border would jeopardise the 1998 peace deal - the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBut once the UK leaves the EU customs union and single market the risk, as Brussels sees it, is that the porous border could attract smuggling and fraud.\n\nThe EU customs union means:\n\nno customs duties are paid on goods moving between the 28 member states\n\nall apply a common customs tariff for goods imported from outside the EU\n\ngoods legally imported can circulate throughout the EU with no further customs checks\n\nThe single market means the EU is treated as one territory, with no regulatory obstacles to the free movement of goods and services inside the bloc.\n\nThe deal taking shape appears to keep Northern Ireland within a UK customs union, but aligned with EU regulatory standards.\n\nTo avoid land border checks, EU tariffs could be imposed on goods arriving at Northern Ireland ports and Belfast airport from the UK.\n\nRefunds could be claimed for goods which stay in Northern Ireland, and do not enter the EU via the Republic.\n\nIt all means extra costs and paperwork. There will be many sceptics in Northern Ireland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU.\n\nWhy is the 'level playing field' an issue?\n\nThe \"level playing field\" was included in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson's predecessor Theresa May.\n\nIt was a commitment to abide by certain EU rules in exchange for market access. Those rules include environmental standards, workers' rights and services.\n\nBut Mr Johnson insists the UK must be free to sign future trade deals globally without being tied to EU rules.\n\nIn that case, the EU argues, the UK cannot expect any privileged access to the single market.\n\nChief negotiator Michel Barnier has told the UK repeatedly that it cannot \"have its cake and eat it\" or \"cherry pick\" from EU agreements once it has left the bloc.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the issue recently, warning that \"Britain will develop into another competitor on the doorstep of Europe\".\n\nCould UK politics still block or delay Brexit?\n\nYes.\n\nBoris Johnson said he would \"rather be dead in a ditch\" than agree to extend Brexit beyond 31 October.\n\nBut his government is now legally obliged to comply with the Benn Act. It requires the government to request another extension to Article 50 if Parliament has not approved a withdrawal deal by 19 October.\n\nThe postponement of Brexit would be until 31 January.\n\nThe fate of any Brexit deal is uncertain, not only because Theresa May's deal was rejected three times by the House of Commons.\n\nA deal would also require the unanimous approval of EU leaders and a \"Yes\" vote in the European Parliament.\n\nAnd an early UK election is now widely expected, adding to the uncertainty.\n\nWhatever happens in the Brussels negotiations, Brexit remains a hugely divisive issue in the UK.", "description": "An EU summit will focus on last-minute progress towards a Brexit deal - but much uncertainty remains.", "authors": ["Laurence Peter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6546/production/_109262952_f76d942f-7c01-49f2-836a-cacd8ed91c30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
