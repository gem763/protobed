While rescuing the female, water started coming in round the female and rescue team.\n\n\"Both adults were rescued and brought to the shore. They have not required medical attention and safety advice has been given.\"", "description": "Jean Garrett was 30ft away from her husband Brian at the Humberston Fitties, Lincolnshire, when the coastguard arrived", "authors": ["Connor Lynch", "Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Gnp Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755204.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brian-and-Jean-Garrett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
