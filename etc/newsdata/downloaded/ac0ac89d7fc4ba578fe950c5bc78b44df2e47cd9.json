On the professional front, the singer has always stood tall and there is no denying that in her personal life too, Riri is one celebrity who has always taken a stand.\n\nWhether it was her abusive relationship with former boyfriend Chris Brown or her controversial song collaboration with Eminem, Riri continues to be unscathed. She's a bad girl and has no qualms in speaking her mind.\n\nIn her latest interview with Variety, the singer-entrepreneur slammed Trump for his responses to the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings earlier this year. At that time, Trump called the shootings an act of \"cowardice\", Rihanna tweeted that he should have labelled them as \"terrorism\" instead.\n\n\"It is devastating. People are being murdered by war weapons that they legally purchase. This is just not normal. That should never, ever be normal. And the fact that it''s classified as something different because of the colour of their skin? It''s a slap in the face,\" said Rihanna.\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 431 SHARES\n\n\"It''s completely racist. Put an Arab man with that same weapon in that same Walmart and there is no way that Trump would sit there and address it publicly as a mental health problem. The most mentally ill human being in America right now seems to be the president,\" she added.\n\nOn the work front, Rihanna is working on a reggae-inspired or reggae-infused album. \"It's not going to be typical of what you know as reggae. But you're going to feel the elements in all of the tracks,\" she said.", "description": "In her latest interview with Variety, the singer-entrepreneur slammed Trump for his responses to the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings earlier this year.
