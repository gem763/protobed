They said minutes for the meetings should have been properly recorded but are incomplete.\n\nThe BBC could have acted earlier to communicate the likelihood that they would not be able to fund a full licence fee concession for people over 75 from 2020, they said. But it was wrong of the then government to seek \u201cto \u2018bounce\u2019 the BBC into accepting a deal\u201d.\n\nMore generally, the MPs\u2019 report criticises \u201cpoor management, leadership and governance at the BBC\u201d.\n\nIt said the problems surrounding the use of personal service companies \u2013 its arrangements with its freelancers, including presenters \u2013 may have arisen from poor management.\n\n\u201cFuture issues may emerge as a result of the same management and governance approach,\u201d the report said.\n\nOn the gender pay gap, the MPs said \u201cthere is still a long way to go at the BBC\u201d, even though the broadcaster is continuing to take steps to resolve the issues.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Committee chair Damian Collins said the BBC had \u201cput itself\u201d in an \u201cinvidious position\u201d as an \u201cadministrator\u201d of welfare benefits.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt agreed to fund a pensioner benefit that it couldn\u2019t afford and, as a result, false reassurances were given to the over-75s that their free licence fees would be maintained.\n\n\u201cThe BBC and the government must reach an agreement to allow the funding of free licence fees for the over-75s to continue after 2020.\n\n\u201dThe BBC finds itself here as the result of a deal done behind closed doors that allowed no transparency for licence fee payers.\n\n\u201cDetailed minutes which would have shone a light on the crucial decision-making process are absent or incomplete which is a matter of great regret.\u201d\n\nThe report also says that overall finances of the BBC paint a \u201cdisturbing picture\u201d \u2013 with pressure on the corporation\u2019s budgets likely to get worse.\n\nMr Collins said: \u201cWe are seeing clear evidence that the funding model of the BBC will become unsustainable without substantial increases in commercial revenue from BBC Studios and new subscription on demand viewing services like BritBox.\u201d\n\nLicence fee negotiations for 2021 should be \u201cconducted in a wholly different way\u201d, MPs said.\n\nThe report said the \u201cBBC could have acted earlier to communicate the likelihood that they would not be able to fund a full licence fee concession for people over 75 from 2020.\u201d\n\nThe \u201chandling of the announcement has served to erode public confidence in the way that the BBC spends its money\u201d, it said.\n\nPA", "description": "MPs have criticised BBC chief Lord Tony Hall for his handling of negotiations on the TV licence fee for over-75s.
