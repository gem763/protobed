That's unacceptable, and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen.\u201d\n\nDespite Pompeo's objections, lawmakers are scheduled to hear testimony Thursday from Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations. Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is also scheduled to sit for a deposition on Oct. 11.\n\nLater Wednesday, the State Department inspector general is expected to brief congressional staffers on Ukraine-related issues after making a mysterious \u201curgent request\u201d to appear on Capitol Hill.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3e/33/c504f7a444178bd85e22e5810315/191002-pompeo-ap-773.jpg"}
