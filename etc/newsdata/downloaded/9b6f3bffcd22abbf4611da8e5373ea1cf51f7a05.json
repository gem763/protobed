Then Shea Patterson\u2019s pass found its way to Ronnie Bell\u2019s gut as a defender menaced just behind and Harbaugh\u2019s arms went upward in celebration. Then it found its way out of Bell\u2019s gut and onto the end zone floor as Harbaugh\u2019s whole being sagged.\n\nThen a good football player, Bell, had a good football cry on the sideline as No. 16 Michigan lost, 28-21, to No. 7 Penn State, to push Harbaugh to 1-10 at Michigan against top-10 opponents. That\u2019s even after the Wolverines outgained the Nittany Lions 417-283 and clambered back from a 21-0 deficit, and did all that even before 110,669 on a night of the Penn State clothing tradition \u201cWhite Out,\u201d college football\u2019s most notable homage to an antiquated office product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRonnie\u2019s a fierce competitor,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s being pretty hard on himself right now\u201d and, Patterson added, he \u201cmade a lot of great plays that got us into that situation.\u201d\n\nMichigan (5-2) reached that situation even after Penn State (7-0) came out of the tunnel looking like it had regenerated itself dazzlingly after its Saquon Barkley-Trace McSorley days, looking like a multifaceted dream on drives of 66, 64 and 49 yards. Michigan reached that final pass because the Penn State offense slowed after halftime, its yards-per-play fading from a gaudy seven to a right around a somber two, save for one play.\n\nThat play, quarterback Sean Clifford\u2019s post-pattern pass of 53 lollipop yards to star KJ Hamler, who got awfully lonesome out on the prairie with 13:14 left to supply Penn State a 28-14 lead once Clifford\u2019s throw reached Hamler\u2019s gut. That play happened because, Hamler said, \u201cThat was just coverage recognition, basically, just me reading the coverage and picking the right route.\u201d It happened because, Harbaugh said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the right defense and the players didn\u2019t get the call. We didn\u2019t have a post safety.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt happened while, the budding sophomore Clifford said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, the ball hung up there for a very long time. You\u2019re just looking at it and going, \u2018Fall, fall, fall, fall fall.\u2019 \u201d And it happened to epitomize what Penn State Coach James Franklin said about his tete-a-tete against that old chum Don Brown, Michigan\u2019s defensive coordinator with whom Franklin coached at Maryland late last decade: \u201cIt really comes down to explosive plays with his defense. You\u2019ve got to hit explosive plays.\u201d\n\nBecause it happened, and just after the crowd sang \u201cSweet Caroline,\u201d Penn State could withstand Michigan\u2019s nine-play, 75-yard drive that followed and ended with Patterson\u2019s sneak touchdown from the 1 on fourth down.\n\nAnother fourth down near that goal line would come, of course.\n\nAD\n\nIt would come at the curtain of a game in which Michigan, still straining for a tier of the sport it feels it can attain, wound up with 26 first downs to Penn State\u2019s 14. It out-possessed Penn State around 38 minutes to 22. It played with what Harbaugh kept extolling as \u201cgreat character.\u201d It got a more-than-competent show from Patterson, the second-year starter after his transfer from Ole Miss, the picture of battle afterward with eye black streaking across his chin, up his cheeks and onto his temples.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe just kept pushing,\u201d linebacker Khaleke Hudson said.\n\nYet it also would come after a night in which, Franklin stressed, Penn State won \u201cthe field-position battle, the turnover battle (by 0-1), the penalty battle (by 5-8).\u201d It would come as the receiver from Michigan, Hamler, caught two touchdown passes and four others for 108 yards, and as first-year starting quarterback from Cincinnati, Clifford, threw three touchdowns and ran for another. As Franklin\u2019s program extended to 38-9 over the last four seasons and 36-7 over its last 43 games, he said, \u201cWe played really good complementary football. We made big plays when it was needed,\u201d including, of course: \u201cThat stop at the end was obviously critical.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLong, long before that, the \u201cWhite Out\u201d crowd bamboozled Michigan at the get-go, actually helping force that rare football timeout before the first offensive play, with 15:00 remaining in the first quarter. Soon, on Penn State\u2019s second possession, Clifford threw an artwork of a ball up the left sideline to Jahan Dotson for 37-yards, then a 17-yard floater beneath which tight end Pat Freiermuth materialized in the end zone for a 7-0 lead.\n\nAD\n\nMichigan stalled on a fourth down at the Penn State 36-yard line, Penn State\u2019s offensive line presented a hole large enough for a small herd of cattle to pass, and running back Ricky Slade tore through it for 44 yards, to arrange for two crafty Clifford runs, the latter a two-yard touchdown. Penn State cornerback Tariq Castro-Fields intercepted Patterson\u2019s dud of a dying middle screen at the Michigan 37-yard line, and Penn State reached 21-0 on two top-notch passes to Hamler, the second covering 25 yards and landing in Hamler\u2019s arms in the end zone.\n\nCoverage-wise, the big plays owed to \u201ceye violations,\u201d Michigan linebacker Hudson said, citing defenders\u2019 eyes which strayed from proper places. Yet from 21-0, Michigan started reinventing itself, constructing drives of 75 yards in the second quarter, 65 in the third and 75 in the fourth, until it all distilled to the 44-yard trip that wrapped up three yards shy of something long-sought.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s the latest ending that caused Harbaugh to state the need to \u201cput steel in your spine,\u201d and keep going, right after the game he loves so dearly gave him yet another diabolical boot.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Wolverines nearly rally from a 21-point deficit before they are subjected to another cruel ending in a 28-21 loss.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/S7-6ZvNAfVHfIWTb3CZpccIen30=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XZJGYQHS5MI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
