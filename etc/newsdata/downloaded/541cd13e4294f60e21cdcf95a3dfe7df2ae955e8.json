Jane actress been doing press. In addition to her five-alarm Harper\u2019s Bazaar cover story \u2014 for which she posed nude at 56 \u2014 she dished to the New York Times, which previewed the book and its explosive revelations.\n\nAnd make no mistake \u2014 there are a lot of jaw-dropping stories in the book, including a secret miscarriage, marital infidelity, a rape, drug addiction and her account of the drug-induced seizure she suffered partying with her daughter. Here\u2019s what we know so far...\n\nShe lost a baby, six months into her pregnancy, with Ashton Kutcher. Moore\u2019s relationship with Kutcher, 15 years her junior, was tabloid gold. After they started dating in 2003 \u2014 and before they wed in 2005 \u2014 Moore became pregnant with the That \u201870s Show star\u2019s child. However, tragedy came when she was six months along and suffered a miscarriage. Moore revealed that they had a name \u2014 Chaplin Ray \u2014 picked out for the baby girl and everything. Moore had started drinking again after years of sobriety blamed herself for the loss. They later attempted fertility treatments but they were unsuccessful and as a result, her drinking became worse and she started abusing Vicodin.\n\nShe claims Kutcher cheated on her. When Moore and Kutcher split, it was amid reports he hooked up with two women in a hotel hot tub. While her book presumably goes into detail about the end of their marriage, the New York Times notes that as her addiction worsened, she learned that Kutcher had cheated. They separated in 2011 and divorced in 2013. (Kutcher, now married to Mila Kunis, didn\u2019t respond to the paper\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nMoore was raped at 15. The star had a troubling upbringing with Moore being called on to save her mother during her suicide attempt by literally pulling pills out of her mouth. She also revealed that she was a victim of a sexual assault at 15. By 16, Moore had enough of home and moved out. Soon after she fell for married musician Freddy Moore and they were married in 1980.\n\nShe cheated on her first husband. A young bride \u2014 at just 18 \u2014 Moore revealed that she quickly sabotaged the union with her infidelity. They divorced in 1985.\n\nShe claims her marriage to Bruce Willis ended because he didn\u2019t want her to have a career. Moore and Willis were a Hollywood power couple \u2014 and the world obsessed over their uniquely named daughters and their picture-perfect life in Hailey, Idaho. While their separation was a surprise in 1998, it wasn\u2019t to her. She said things quickly fell apart which she attributed in part to the Die Hard actor being ambivalent about her work despite her being one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. She said Willis felt her roles took her away from their family. At one point, she claims he said he was unsure if he wanted to be married. (Willis didn\u2019t comment either, but they are still friends. She attended his vow renewal to his second wife in March.)\n\nShe confirms that she suffered a seizure while partying with her daughter Rumer. After her split from Kutcher, Moore continued to spiral. In 2012, she suffered a drug-induced seizure after smoking synthetic cannabis and inhaling nitrous oxide while partying with Rumer and her daughter\u2019s friends. It made headline news. Moore later sought treatment in rehab and said it included trauma, codependency and substance abuse therapy.\n\nShe\u2019s been sober (again) in her fifties. In the book, she details her addictions. Abuse of alcohol and cocaine in her twenties led her to get sober the first time. (She said that mistreatment of her body went hand-in-hand with binge eating and obsessing over her weight.) However, she started drinking again in her forties, which led to Vicodin abuse \u2014 and dabbling with other things \u2014 like synthetic marijuana. As she headed into her fifties, she got sober \u2014 after the seizure and amid autoimmune and digestive problems which led to her \u201corgans slowly shutting down.\u201d She said in addition to her rehab treatment, she worked a doctor whose specialty was integrative medicine physician to improve her health problems.\n\nWhile she and her three daughters appear close, they\u2019ve had rough patches, including estrangement. Leading up to Moore\u2019s seizure and hospitalization, she had prickly relationships with her two youngest children, Scout and Tallulah, who were upset with what the New York Times called Moore\u2019s \u201chedonistic behavior.\u201d After the seizure, which Rumer witnessed, all three of her daughters started \u201cshunning\u201d her. That had been widely reported at the time \u2014 in 2012 \u2014 but not confirmed. They reconciled two years ago, according to the article.", "description": "There are a lot of jaw-dropping revelations in the book, including a secret miscarriage, marital infidelity, a rape, drug addiction and her account of the drug-induced seizure she suffered partying with her daughter.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KpJFXSxx2ph3KnRrK0AS7A--~B/aD05NDg7dz0xODY2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/cbc01a20-d582-11e9-afef-385490da9eec", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
