Under the process proposed by the resolution, the intelligence committee will take control, leading any public hearings.\n\nThe president and his allies have complained that the inquiry so far has been too secretive and denied Trump any chance to defend himself.\n\nThe White House made clear that the resolution had not changed its opinion; a statement from the press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, called it a \u201cscam\u201d and complained that the Trump administration was being denied \u201cbasic due process rights\u201d.\n\nHouse Republicans are unlikely to support the resolution. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle,\u201d the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, told the Washington Post on Tuesday. \u201cDue process starts from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe House rules committees is expected to consider and possibly amend the impeachment resolution tomorrow afternoon, with a vote on the proposal still set for Thursday.\n\nThe impeachment resolution notes that, at the beginning of public hearings, the chairman and ranking member of the House intelligence committee \u2013 Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Devin Nunes \u2013 can ask witnesses questions for up to 45 minutes each before proceeding to other committee members. (They may also defer to a committee staffer.)\n\nThe resolution also allows for the public release of transcripts from interviews so far, \u201cwith appropriate redactions to protect classified and other sensitive information\u201d.\n\nAccording to the resolution, the House intelligence committee will take the lead on planning public hearings as the inquiry advances.\n\nRelated: Army officer's impeachment testimony is a quandary for Republicans\n\nThe resolution also establishes that Republicans may ask to hear testimony from certain witnesses, but those requests will be declined or approved by Schiff. This procedure is in line with the rules for the minority party during the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIn a statement, House committee leaders said: \u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nPressure on Trump in the impeachment inquiry is mounting rapidly. And when the hearings become public, many Americans will for the first time encounter the damaging accusations against Trump from the witnesses making them. A recent poll found that a majority of people now support the investigation.\n\nTom McCarthy and agencies contributed reporting", "description": "Resolution sets procedures for next phase of investigation, including allowance for public release of interview transcriptsThe resolution says Adam Schiff can ask up to 45 minutes of questions at the beginning of public hearings.
