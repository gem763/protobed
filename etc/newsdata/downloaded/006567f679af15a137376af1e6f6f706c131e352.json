Treacher then later went to look for the tweet, but found it deleted.\n\n\u201cMy family (including Fox News-watchers) sat together and talked about what they think of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s attacks on our heritage. And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry,\u201d the text of the tweet read.\n\nThe test, which was analyzed by Stanford professor Carlos D. Bustamante, found Warren to be between 1/64th and 1/1024th Native American and prompted further criticism from President Trump, who began calling Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d during the 2016 campaign.\n\nFollowing Warren\u2019s announcement, Trump mocked the Massachusetts Senator after the Cherokee Nation criticized Warren\u2019s use of the test as \u201cmaking a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow Cherokee Nation denies her, \u201cDNA test is useless.\u201d Even they don\u2019t want her. Phony!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThough Warren had initially said in March 2018 that she would not undergo a DNA test, she responded to criticism in the aftermath by saying \u201cI believe one way that we try to rebuild confidence [in government] is through transparency.\u201d\n\nIn February, Warren apologized to Bill John Baker, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, for her public advertising of the test. \u201cThe chief and secretary of state appreciate that she has reaffirmed that she is not a Cherokee Nation citizen or a citizen of any tribal nation,\u201d Cherokee Nation spokeswoman Julie Hubbard said in the aftermath.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) deleted from her Twitter and YouTube accounts a now-infamous video announcing the results of her DNA test on Wednesday, one year after its initial unveiling was met with heavy bipartisan criticism.A story titled \u201cHappy Anniversary to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA Test!\u201d", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gn5Yqie0cUjf3EjLlgKcQA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/e1f764b215d5443e566cd4be2ed1418d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
