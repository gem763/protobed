Videos Reveal @CNN's BIAS!' @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?'\n\nOn Tuesday, Project Veritas shared its second video of Poarch.\n\nIt was less explosive than the first , but included his claim that anyone who supports Trump or is even conservative-leaning is not welcome there.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nCary Poarch, the CNN whistleblower, gave in his second part of the interview with Project Veritas on Tuesday\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that he was ready to sue CNN over the whistleblower's claims\n\n'It\u2019s an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,' he said.\n\nHe went on to say that he joined the company as a Democrat and that he was excited to work there but that he has been left devastated by its politically geared handling of the news.\n\nThe satellite uplink technician had worked at CNN for two years turned whistleblower to accuse the network of operating on a deeply-embedded bias against Trump which is led by its Jeff Zucker.\n\nPoarch gave an interview to Project Veritas along with secretly recorded video tapes.\n\nAmong the 'evidence' that he presented are recordings of Zucker's 9am rundown calls with senior producers and editors where he is heard ordering them to focus on impeachment stories above other political ones.\n\nPoarch also recorded multiple media coordinators who described frustration at having to follow Zucker's commands.\n\nInsiders at CNN say its president Jeff Zucker has a 'personal vendetta' against Trump\n\nOne said that people at the network 'hated' having to almost exclusively write about Trump but that they had to follow the boss's orders.\n\nThe secretly recorded tapes are all of media coordinators or floor planners. None of the network's journalists are filmed.\n\nCNN has not yet responded to his claims.\n\n'I hate how everything at the company is now all Trump all the time. Everyone at the company complains about it. They hate covering Trump every day,' Christian Sierra, a media coordinator at the company, is filmed saying.\n\nNick Neville, another 'media coordinator', is filmed saying: 'To a certain extent, CNN created Trump's celebrity. They created this whole, like, not his celebrity but created his candidacy, made him legitimate because they felt like they needed to show everything he did from the beginning.\n\n'Jeff Zucker can't really complain, he kind of put this in action.'\n\nWhen asked why, he said: 'Ratings!'\n\nPoarch secretly recorded media coordinators and other members of staff talking about Zucker's apparent bias\n\nFloor directors and managers complained about the mood inside the office and said the media 'created' the 'monster' that is Trump\n\nOne coordinator was filmed complaining that Zucker wants impeachment to be 'the top story every day'. No journalists were filmed complaining about it\n\nIn another video, he was filmed saying: 'Whats difficult is like we have some conflicting things at play here. Like, there's a lot of people who are out here trying to like just do what they think is best of journalistic integrity and then you get on the 9am call and big boss Jeff Zucker f*****g tells you what to do.\n\n'You have to follow his verdict.'\n\nThe recordings from Zucker's 9am rundown calls, where he discussed the network's plan for the day, are offered without much context.\n\nZucker however is heard repeatedly talking about impeachment and 'moving towards' it.\n\n'I don't care about the MSNBC event, okay? I don't care about them. Let's just stay very focused on impeachment and everything that happens today because look, you're going to be coming on at 3 oclock. Trump is at 2,' he was heard telling one staffer on October 2.\n\nIn another, he complains about Fox News and says they are responsible for 'fake news'.\n\n'I don't care about the MSNBC event, okay? I don't care about them. Let's just stay very focused on impeachment Jeff Zucker on one of his 9am editorial rundown calls\n\n'I think what's going on in America now, is really fundamentally years of fake news, conspiracy nonsense from Fox News that has taken root in this country, I'm dead serious about this.\n\n'The fake conspiracy nonsense that Fox has spread for years is deeply embedded in American society and at the highest levels of the Republican elected officials, and frankly that is destructive to America and I do not think we should be scared to say so,' he said in one call.\n\nIn another, he warned journalists not to be 'friendly' with Senator Lindsey Graham.\n\n'On the Lindsay Graham front, I know there are a lot of people at CNN who are friendly with Lindsay Graham. It's time to knock that off and it's time to call him out.\n\n'I think he's under full-time contract now with Fox News. He's done his last 26 interviews in cable news with Fox.\n\n'It's time to seriously call out what's going on here,' he said.\n\nOthers, including staff who worked overnight on the 2016 election, said the environment in the office the next day was the kind found at a funeral.\n\nMike Brevna, a floor manager, said he saw a woman with her heading her hands, sobbing when he came into work.\n\nAnother media coordinator was filmed taking about Zucker's 'vendetta'. The footage appeared to have been taken in a bar\n\nOne floor manager recalled seeing people 'sob' on election night 2016 when Trump was declared the winner\n\n'It was like we was at a funeral. People were like, in shock. I wouldn't say mourning but they were in shock.'\n\nThe media coordinators also claimed to know which of the network's star hosts 'hated' the president.\n\nThe staffers also complained about Don Lemon who they said was 'blatantly anti-Trump' but who didn't admit it on-air\n\nThey said Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper all disliked him. Nick Neville, the aforementioned media coordinator who calls himself a 'news associate' online, said in one recording that Lemon's undeclared bias affected his broadcast.\n\n'Hannity is like extremely conservative, he lets you know. However, Don Lemon comes on, he makes you think he's objective news... I'm not trying to bash CNN... but he's blatantly opinionated.\n\n'So either disclose where you're coming from, or get someone who is a little bit more objective.\n\n'Don Lemon, I mean love him or hate him, he's blatantly anti-Trump. He's blatantly left. CNN makes it appear as though we have 24 hours of unbiased news. That's not true,' he said.\n\nPoarch said he felt like quitting but instead decided to blow the whistle on the network in the hope that it will return to its former 'greatness'.\n\n'I was about to quit. I wrestled with the decision long and hard. It still scares me. This is exposing most likely the biggest media conglomerate in the world\n\n'But I decided to wear the camera, I didn't see any other option.\n\n'To do something to protect the Republic. Let the cards fall where they may. At least let us have one more fair and free election. I just hope that others in similar positions will take the mantle.\n\n'The Facebook insider inspired me, my goal from me, aside from getting CNN to return to its old greatness, is to inspire the people I've had the same conversation with.'\n\n", "description": "Cary Poarch gave an interview to Project Veritas along with secretly recorded video tapes from inside CNN's Washington bureau which attracted the ire of the president on Monday.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758504-0-image-a-6_1571171628943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
