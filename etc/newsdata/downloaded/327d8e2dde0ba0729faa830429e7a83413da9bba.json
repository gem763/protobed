Jesper Nielsen, at the time an executive board member and head of Danish banking, was fired in June for his part in the management of the product, which overcharged its customers.\n\nDanske said in June that it reported the case to the FSA after conducting an internal investigation. The bank said at the time that it planned to compensate all affected Flexinvest customers.\n\nThe FSA said Friday that although Danske became aware that a very large proportion of its customers could expect a negative net return from the investment, the bank did not inform the customers. \u201cThis is a very serious breach of the consumer protection rules that apply in this area,\u201d the FSA said. The FSA has ordered Danske to conduct new suitability tests of all customers with an investment agreement in Flexinvest Fri. Danske said in June that the case affects about 87,000 customers in Denmark, and it expects to pay out a total of around 400 million Danish kroner ($59 million) in compensation. \u201cAs expected, we have received harsh and justified criticism from the FSA,\u201d said Danske Bank Chief Executive Chris Vogelzang. \u201cWe have taken a number of actions, including actions towards relevant staff members, and all affected customers will of course receive compensation.\u201d Affected customers are expected to receive compensation before the end of the year, Danske said. Danske is also being investigated by Estonia, Denmark, France and the U.S. over allegations that about $230 billion in suspicious funds from Russia and other former Soviet states entered Europe through its tiny branch in Estonia. The bank said in conjunction with the release of its second-quarter results in July that no material developments regarding the money-laundering case took place in the second quarter but that the case continues to have a negative impact in terms of customer satisfaction and outflow among retail customers in Denmark. \u2014Kristin Broughton contributed to this article.
