Manager Dave Martinez and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard came out to check on Suzuki, but after a short visit, he remained in the game for the rest of the half-inning.\n\nBut when Suzuki was due up to bat in the bottom of the sixth, Gerardo Parra pinch-hit in his place, and Yan Gomes entered the game at catcher in the seventh.\n\nThe severity of the injury is still unknown, and Martinez said he didn\u2019t know if Suzuki would require an MRI.\n\nSuzuki missed much of September with an elbow injury but returned just before the postseason began. Then he left Game 5 of the National League Division Series after a pitch hit him in the wrist and ricocheted up into his face and missed the opener of the NLCS.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
