He believed that competition was needed to bring prices down.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a stable pipeline of projects, you\u2019ll see manufacturing follow,\u201d said Winand.\n\nHe said 1 600MW of wind procurement a year until 2030 created \u201csufficient certainty to build an industry that can compete on the global market\u201d.\n\nAnd developing the ability to export \u2013 regionally, across the continent and globally \u2013 meant manufacturers were not wholly reliant on a local wind energy market, added Winand.\n\nIt would also be worthwhile to focus on particular components that could be produced competitively in South Africa, and make those part of the required local procurement standards the independent power producers have to agree to.\n\nThen exports would begin to take place, he said.\n\nJavier Pascual, Nordex Energy\u2019s managing director, also suggested that, in much the same way the local automotive industry operated, South Africa should start assembling components that are currently being manufactured abroad.\n\nThe development of local manufacturing for wind power could also contribute to a just transition from coal, as Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, who gave the opening speech at Windaba, warned that entire towns whose economy revolved around the economy of coal-fired power stations in Mpumalanga were in danger of becoming \u201cghost towns\u201d as the power stations were decommissioned.\n\nBut several experts warned that there were a number of challenges to the development of a southern African wind power sector.\n\nThe lack of transmission infrastructure across the region was one of the biggest issues, said Kudakwashe Ndhlukula, the executive director of the SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.\n\nNdhlukula said that, of the 12 mainland SADC countries, only nine were interconnected through transmission infrastructure. The outliers were Malawi, Angola and Tanzania. While Malawi had been load shedding since 2017, Angola had excess power, and these countries needed to be interconnected, he said.\n\nAside from the lack of infrastructure in certain countries, maintenance of existing infrastructure has \u201cbeen falling behind\u201d, said Ndhlukula, resulting in \u201cchallenges\u201d in transmitting power through the central corridor of Botswana and Zimbabwe, which linked northern Mozambique, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nHowever, Ndhlukula said a regional transmission infrastructure financing facility had been set up to strengthen transmission infrastructure, and a diamond-shaped line to link Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, known as the Zizabona project, was in the offing.\n\nThe SADC Regional Development Fund needed to be operated to finance the infrastructure build, which would require \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d, and the various SADC finance ministers had been appraised of the regional infrastructure financing facility, he said.\n\nRegulation uniformity across the region was also required if power was to move across borders.\n\nIgnacio P\u00e9rez-Arriaga, the director of training at the Florence School of Regulation in Italy, said a number of gaps and weaknesses in regulatory systems had been noted by the UN Economic Commission for Africa.\n\nThese included the lack of a common legal framework needed for operation and ensuring the effectiveness of a regional power pool.\n\nInvestors needed assurance that they could sell power into a regional power pool and beyond the borders of the countries in which their projects were situated.\n\nThis required strong regional institutions that enjoyed political support, said P\u00e9rez-Arriaga.\n\nThis would include a regional regulator and regional system operator to adopt best international practices for planning, allocation of transmission costs and congestion management.\n\n\n\nAfrica was the right place for renewable energy as there was potential population and demand growth, as well as a global push for cleaner energy, said Res4Africa sub-Saharan Africa programme manager Luca Marena, but a \u201ctrustworthy energy strategy is very important\u201d.\n\nRes4Africa studies show that, by 2023, 13 African countries would have economic growth of 6% or more, the continent would house 25% of the global population and Africa would be increasingly urban as 65 million people move to the cities every year.\n\nElectricity was needed to power this economic growth and 263GW of renewable energy solutions would be added across the continent by 2040, representing 69% of all new added capacities.\n\nWhile solar power would be the leading renewable energy technology, wind power would also play a significant part of renewable energy growth.\n\nAll that was needed to unlock the $1.5 trillion (R22.69 trillion) predominantly private-sector investment in generation and grid assets required across the continent was a sound regulatory framework.", "description": "Africa and the SADC region in particular need an integratedapproach as we move towards a clean energy mix to mitigate the worsening climate crisis.", "authors": ["Steve Kretzmann"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/04f866af760b4e24acfcc91dc48eb5d3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
