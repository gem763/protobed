He avoided offering specific solutions.\n\n\u201cThe people of San Francisco are fed up and the people of Los Angeles are fed up, and we\u2019re looking at it, and we will be doing something about it at the appropriate time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhat else he's said: Donald Trump slams LA, San Francisco over homelessness as he heads to California\n\nThe report, issued days after a delegation of Trump officials visited Los Angeles to discuss homelessness, presents a conservative approach to focusing on the problem. More liberal prescriptions favored in the city include a massive and costly plan to build apartments for the homeless.\n\nAn apartment building for the homeless starts to take shape on Los Angeles' Skid Row -- with homeless people camping on the sidewalk in front of it. More\n\nIn the report, \"The State of Homelessness in America,\" even shelters get some of the blame for increasing the number of people who are homeless. The argument: Some people would be able to find their own housing if they were turned away from shelters.\n\n\"While shelters play an extremely important role in bringing some people off the streets, it also brings in people who would otherwise be housed, thus increasing total homelessness,\" the report states.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti blasted the report for treating \"this crisis like fodder for a cable news debate.\"\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for that,\" he said in a statement. \"If the president really cares about solving this crisis, he wouldn\u2019t be talking about criminalization over housing. He\u2019d be making dramatic increases in funding for this country\u2019s housing safety net.\u201d\n\nWhat LA is doing: Los Angeles County seeks action from city on toilets, rats and trash to combat homeless crisis\n\nHomelessness is a national problem, the Trump administration report states, blaming \"two decades of misguided and faulty policies\" that have left more than 500,000 homeless on a single night in the U.S. About 65% find their way into shelters but the rest live in cars, parks or elsewhere out in the open.\n\nThe problem is concentrated on the West Coast and Northeast. About 47% of all unsheltered people in the nation are in California, the report states.\n\nBelongings of the homeless crowd a downtown Los Angeles sidewalk in Skid Row. More\n\nThe key issue behind homelessness, according to the report: Housing costs are too high because of overly restrictive zoning, rent control, energy and water mandates, historic preservation requirements and other measures that hold down new construction.\n\nThey need more than homes: As homeless are suffering, risk of hepatitis, typhus and other diseases is growing\n\nIf such constrictions could be relieved, the ranks of the homeless could fall precipitously, the report predicts. Just by deregulating housing markets in 11 metro areas, overall homelessness would fall 13%, the report claims. In San Francisco, it would plummet 54% and in Los Angeles, 40% \u2013 both cities with sky-high rents.", "description": "Donald Trump hands out a conservative prescription to remedy homelessness, blaming shelters and calling for cities to ban sleeping on streets.", "authors": ["Chris Woodyard", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oBdXXMlLvFvqg0C7w36c5Q--~B/aD0yOTE0O3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/2e8b959fa3a1c57603b0279830ebc78c", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
