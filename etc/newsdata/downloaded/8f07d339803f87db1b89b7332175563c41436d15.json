So while I\u2019m critical of many bad policies in the United States, it\u2019s worth noting that America nonetheless ranks #6 for overall economic liberty according to the Fraser Institute.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s not surprising that America has higher living standards than most other developed nations according to the \u201cactual individual consumption\u201d data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAnd America\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t trivial. We\u2019re more than 46 percent higher than the average for OECD member nations.\n\nThe gap is so large that I\u2019ve wondered how lower-income people in the United States would rank compared to average people in other countries.\n\nWell, the folks at Just Facts have investigated precisely this issue using World Bank data and found some remarkable results.\n\n\u2026after accounting for all income, charity, and non-cash welfare benefits like subsidized housing and Food Stamps\u2014the poorest 20% of Americans consume more goods and services than the national averages for all people in most affluent countries. \u2026In other words, if the U.S. \u201cpoor\u201d were a nation, it would be one of the world\u2019s richest. \u2026The World Bank publishes a comprehensive dataset on consumption that isn\u2019t dependent on the accuracy of household surveys and includes all goods and services, but it only provides the average consumption per person in each nation\u2014not the poorest people in each nation. However, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis published a study that provides exactly that for 2010. Combined with World Bank data for the same year, these datasets show that the poorest 20% of U.S. households have higher average consumption per person than the averages for all people in most nations of the OECD and Europe\u2026 The high consumption of America\u2019s \u201cpoor\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they live better than average people in the nations they outpace, like Spain, Denmark, Japan, Greece, and New Zealand. \u2026Nonetheless, the fact remains that the privilege of living in the U.S. affords poor people with more material resources than the averages for most of the world\u2019s richest nations.\n\nThere are some challenges in putting together this type of comparison, so the folks at Just Facts are very clear in showing their methodology.\n\nThey\u2019ve certainly come up with results that make sense, particularly when compared their results with the OECD AIC numbers.\n\nHere\u2019s one of the charts from the report.\n\nYou can see that the bottom 20 percent of Americans do quite well compared to the average persons in other developed nations.\n\nBy the way, the report from Just Facts also criticizes the New York Times for dishonest analysis of poverty. Since I\u2019ve felt compelled to do the same thing, I can definitely sympathize.\n\nThe bottom line is that free markets and limited government are the best way to help lower-income people enjoy more prosperity.", "description": "My primary job is dealing with misguided public policy in .09/02/2019 3:25:25AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
