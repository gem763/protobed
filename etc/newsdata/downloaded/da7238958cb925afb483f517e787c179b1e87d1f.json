And look in the White House. If they\u2019re calling me a racist, look in the White House.\n\n\u201cWhen you vote for Donald Trump, you are supporting institutionalized racism,\" he said. Later, Jordan, who is African American, added that he intended to send a message to both black and white voters.\n\nJordan is not the only religious leader to express political views in the era of Trump. And some have used their platforms to speak in favor of the president. Robert Jeffress, the senior pastor at the prominent Texas megachurch First Baptist Dallas, has become a staunch supporter of the president and frequently appears on Fox News, Texas Monthly reported. He once called evangelical Christians who do not support Trump \u201cspineless morons.\"\n\nThe president enjoys high approval ratings from white evangelicals, and these voters have stood by him despite numerous controversies throughout his first term.\n\nHowever, some in Birmingham thought Jordan\u2019s message went too far.\n\n[Alabama\u2019s Republican governor apologizes for wearing blackface in college, refuses to resign]\n\nAs WTVM interviewed Jordan, a couple of bystanders argued with the pastor, including Daxton Kirk, a white Trump supporter who filmed the confrontation on his phone. He told WTVM that \u201cyou should not be able to come into a building and feel like you are hated\" and the outlet reported he had complained to the city council.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Jordan has used the church\u2019s signage to speak out. In 2018, after a suburban megachurch planned to open a satellite in Birmingham to combat crime, Jordan erected a sign that read \u201cBlack folks need to stay out of white churches.\u201d The sign sparked a social media outrage and earned a rebuke from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin (D).\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service requires that a church, charity or other 501(c)(3) organization \"does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.\u201d\n\nSign or no sign, polling indicates that black Americans consider Trump racist, and black voters have not historically supported him.\n\n[Does Trump\u2019s racially divisive campaign strategy carry a hidden message for black voters?]\n\nA July 30 Quinnipiac poll found that 80 percent of black voters say Trump is racist, compared with 11 percent who do not.\n\nIn 2016, 88 percent of black voters chose the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump, according to the Pew Research Center. Black women, in particular, are considered one of the most solid bases in the Democratic Party. Exit polling showed that 94 percent of black women cast a vote for Clinton in 2016 and 4 percent chose Trump, CNN reported.\n\nAnd while Trump overwhelmingly won Alabama in the 2016 election with about 63 percent of the vote, Jefferson County, where Birmingham is located, was an island of blue in a sea of red counties as it broke for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nRead more:\n\nDaily News Quiz: A slowly thinning Democratic field\n\nThey lost in the Year of the Woman.
