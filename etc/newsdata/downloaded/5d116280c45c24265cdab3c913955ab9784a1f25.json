He was paid $45 for his 10 minutes of work. \"I made a circle with a smile for a mouth on yellow paper, because it was sunshiny and bright,\" the late graphic designer from Worcester, Massachusetts later told the Associated Press. The company slapped the simple design on posters and buttons for employees, and it was an instant hit \u2014 but it didn't just stay within the office.\n\nNeither Ball, nor the insurance company, trademarked the logo \u2014 it was a French journalist named Franklin Loufrani who first registered the mark, dubbed it \"Smiley,\" and formed a business around it by licensing it to companies like Levi's and Mars candy. Today, The Smiley Company is run by Loufrani's son, Nicolas, and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue a year by charging brands like Zara and Fendi a fee to put the recognizable grin on apparel and other merchandise. Ball, on the other hand, only collected his payment of $45, which is worth about $375 in today's dollars. \"Smiley\" isn't the only iconic logo with humble origins: Nike cofounder Phil Knight paid $35 for the \"Swoosh\" design.\n\nA Nike logo in Beijing, China TPG | Getty Images\n\nIn 1971, Knight needed a logo for a new shoe his company was introducing, so he called up Carolyn Davidson, a graphic design student he'd met while teaching at Portland State University. He gave her one stipulation: The logo had to be \"something that evokes a sense of motion,\" Knight recalls in his memoir \"Shoe Dog.\" \"Two weeks later she came back with a portfolio of rough sketches,\" Knight writes. \"They were all variations on a single theme, and the theme seemed to be \u2026 fat lightning bolts? Chubby check marks? Morbidly obese squiqqles?\" \"None spoke to me,\" he adds. \"I singled out a few that held out some promise and asked her to work with those.\" Davidson returned a few weeks later with more variations. Knight settled on one that his team particularly liked \u2014 it looked like \"a wing\" or \"a whoosh of air,\" he says \u2014 but he still didn't love it. \"You guys like it more than I do,\" he remembers telling his team. \"But we're out of time. It'll have to do.\" Davidson's $35 design eventually grew on Knight \u2014 and helped transform the small shoe company into a multi-billion dollar sports brand.
