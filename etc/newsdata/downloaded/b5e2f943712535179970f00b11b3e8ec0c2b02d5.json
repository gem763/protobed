Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire had initially refused to share the complaint with Congress.\n\nPresident Trump has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a \"hoax\" and a \"witch-hunt\", and angrily tweeted as the complaint was publicly released.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR. STICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019 Report\n\nWhat does the complaint say?\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint accuses Mr Trump of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election\".\n\nThe now unclassified document says: \"This interference includes, among other things pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president's main domestic political rivals.\"\n\nThe complaint characterises the president's conduct as a \"serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law\".\n\nThe alleged violation concerns President Trump asking his Ukrainian counterpart on 25 July this year to \"do me a favour\" by investigating unfounded allegations against Mr Biden - who was then leading the polls to become Mr Trump's Democratic opponent in 2020.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: \"It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call\"\n\nAlthough Mr Trump did not explicitly give voice to a quid pro quo, he raised the issue of Mr Biden immediately after stressing to the Ukrainian leader that \"the United States has been very very good to Ukraine\", and \"I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily\".\n\nThe whistleblower says in the complaint that they had learned from several sources that senior White House officials had intervened to \"lock down\" all records of the call, particularly an official word-for-word transcript that is customarily produced by the White House Situation Room.\n\n\"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower describes the system as a \"stand-alone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action\".\n\n\"According to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs.\n\nThe whistleblower adds that officials said it was \"'not the first time' under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive - rather than national security sensitive - information.\"\n\nThe complaint makes clear that the whistleblower was \"not a direct witness\" to most of the events described, but that found their colleagues accounts to be credible \"because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another\".", "description": "Attempts were made to \"lock down\" information about the phone call to Ukraine's leader, report says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pd16f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
