I was able to grow as a fighter, as a professional. I had great battles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very thankful for the seven years I spent there. Those years completely changed my life. They made me who I am today: John \u2018Hands of Stone\u2019 Lineker. I\u2019m an aggressive fighter. Most opponents fear my hands. It was a great and satisfying life experience.\u201d\n\nLineker\u2019s time in the UFC wasn\u2019t without issue. While the heavy hitter offered up plenty of highlight-reel moments during his time in the cage, making it to the fight \u2013 especially on weight \u2013 wasn\u2019t always a guarantee.\n\nAfter he withdrew from a fight at this past June\u2019s UFC on ESPN+ 12 event just days out, the promotion decided to cut ties with the bantamweight contender, despite his penchant for exciting contests.\n\nONE Championship immediately jumped on the chance to add Lineker to their growing roster.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to have signed up with ONE,\u201d Lineker said. \u201cThey keep growing. It\u2019s the top organization in Asia. They\u2019re coming on strong. I\u2019m happy with my new home at ONE. I\u2019m looking forward to putting in the work.\n\n\u201cONE values fighters for their actual abilities. They don\u2019t encourage trashtalking. It\u2019s great to feel valued like that. I\u2019m very happy and looking forward to starting things out on the right foot.\u201d\n\nLineker (31-9) makes his promotional debut later this month, taking on Muin Gafurov (16-2) at \u201cONE Championship 101: Dawn of Valor,\u201d which takes place Oct. 25 at Istora Senayan in Jakarta.\n\nWhile Linker is a man known for finishing opponents, he has picked up 12 wins by decision. Gafurov has never needed judges to register a victory, owning eight wins by knockout and eight by submission.\n\n\u201cMuin Gafurov is a great fighter,\u201d Lineker said. \u201cHe\u2019s very strong and versatile. When he doesn\u2019t feel good standing, he takes the fight to the mat, and if he\u2019s having problems on the mat, he keeps it standing. He\u2019s very complete. I\u2019m working hard on my takedown defense so I can work my striking. I visualize a knockout victory again. It\u2019s what I do in every fight. This one won\u2019t be different.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on a nice win streak right now. He\u2019s very skilled. Everything is place for me to have a great debut in the promotion.\u201d\n\nLineker is now training full-time at the legendary American Top Team in Florida, and he has full believe that his time in the gym is going to be reflected when he steps in to the ONE cage for the first time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing all my training in the U.S. now,\u201d Lineker explained. \u201cI have great coaches. I\u2019ve been working on my boxing with Mikey Rod. My wrestling coach is Steve Mocco. Anderson Franca handles my muay Thai. He also coaches Edson Barboza and Marlon Moraes. \u2018Conan\u2019 Silveira is our head coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m training everywhere. I\u2019m feeling very complete. Without a doubt, I\u2019ll be very ready \u2013 physically and mentally. The fans can expect a renewed John Lineker, with even more experience, and greater focus. \u201d\n\nONE Championship\u2019s next event takes place this weekend with \u201cONE Championship 100: Century,\u201d which features two full fight cards from Tokyo that air in the U.S. late Saturday night and early Sunday morning.", "description": "The \"Hands of Stone\" are cocked and ready once again.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Christian Stein", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Ben Fowlkes"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/john-lineker-ufc-224-2.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
