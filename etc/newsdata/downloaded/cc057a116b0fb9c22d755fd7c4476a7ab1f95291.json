The lawsuit which led to that decision was filed by a group called Students for Fair Admissions. SFFA hired an expert who looked closely at Harvard\u2019s process and discovered something curious. While Asian students score the highest of any group on academics and extra-curricular activities, they score consistently lower than other groups on Harvard\u2019s personality score.\n\nThe lead attorney who worked on the lawsuit, Adam K. Mortara, was invited to speak about the decision at Harvard last week. He argued that the judge had made a series of errors in the case and that Harvard is running a de facto quota system:\n\nDuring his speech, Mortara alleged that Harvard runs a \u201cthinly disguised quota system\u201d; the Supreme Court has ruled that racial quotas in admissions processes are illegal. He pointed to past statistics for admissions rates by race, arguing that they showed \u201cremarkable stability\u201d and did not change drastically until SFFA sued Harvard. At that point, Mortara argued, the number of admits increased. More than 25 percent of admitted students to the Class of 2023 were Asian American. In comparison, in the Class of 2018 \u2014 the last class admitted before SFFA sued Harvard in late 2014 \u2014 19.7 percent of admitted students were Asian American. \u201cStability over 10 years and a remarkable increase by nearly 30 percent in the number of Asian Americans on campus after they got sued \u2014 what does that prove? It proves they have control,\u201d Mortara said.\n\nLater in the same speech, Mortara pointed to the discrepancy in personality scores and mocked the idea that black and Hispanic students were \u201cmore personally appealing.\u201d It was at this point that a dozen students shouted back their agreement with that idea:\n\nMortara also challenged Burroughs\u2019 tacit acceptance of the discrepancy in personal ratings as insufficient evidence of discrimination. \u201cNo one \u2014 not Judge Burroughs, not Harvard \u2014 has ever explained how it is that African Americans and Hispanics just have much better objective personal qualities than white and Asian applicants,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never done it.\u201d \u201cI guess there\u2019s just something more personally appealing about African American and Hispanic applicants,\u201d Mortara quipped. In response, at least a dozen students in the crowd voiced their agreement, shouting, \u201cThere is!\u201d\n\nNo doubt the students were not saying this in earnest. Nevertheless, their outburst suggests racial discrimination isn\u2019t always taken seriously by Harvard students, at least not so long as they believe it\u2019s benefitting the right groups. To clarify what the lawsuit alleged, here\u2019s a brief summary of the findings regarding Asian personality scores from a NY Times piece:\n\nHarvard evaluated applicants on the extent to which they possessed the following traits: likability, helpfulness, courage, kindness, positive personality, people like to be around them, the person is widely respected. Asian-Americans, who had the highest scores in both the academic and extracurricular ratings, lagged far behind all other racial groups in the degree to which they received high ratings on the personality score. \u201cAsian-American applicants receive a 2 or better on the personal score more than 20% of the time only in the top academic index decile. By contrast, white applicants receive a 2 or better on the personal score more than 20% of the time in the top six deciles,\u201d wrote Mr. Arcidiacono. \u201cHispanics receive such personal scores more than 20% of the time in the top seven deciles, and African Americans receive such scores more than 20% of the time in the top eight deciles.\u201d\u2026 Mr. Arcidiacono found that an otherwise identical applicant bearing an Asian-American male identity with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 32 percent chance of admission if he were white, a 77 percent chance of admission if he were Hispanic, and a 95 percent chance of admission if he were black.\n\nIn her decision, Judge Allison D. Burroughs concluded that there was evidence of a negative relationship between being Asian and personality scores (Harvard didn\u2019t dispute it) but went on to say that that may not be the result of racial bias. Her evidence that it was not? Harvard\u2019s staff denied it:\n\nHarvard s witnesses credibly testified that they did not use race in assigning personal ratings (or any of the profile ratings) and did not observe any improper discrimination in the admissions process. The uniformity of these observations is persuasive given the collective manner in which admissions decisions are made, with all members of the Admissions Committee participating in all decisions and having real-time visibility into the process for each applicant. Any causal relationship between Asian American identity and the personal rating must, therefore, have been sufficiently subtle to go unnoticed by numerous considerate, diligent, and intelligent admissions officers who were immersed in the admissions process.\n\nThe idea that there can\u2019t be racism if everyone denies it seems to cut against the entire grain of the left\u2019s intersectional viewpoint but Judge Burroughs appears to be an old-school liberal who still believes the goal of diversity is creating a color-bling society. In her conclusion she wrote:\n\nThe students who are admitted to Harvard and choose to attend will live and learn surrounded by all sorts of people, with all sorts of experiences, beliefs and talents. They will have the opportunity to know and understand one another beyond race, as whole individuals with unique histories and experiences. It is this, at Harvard and elsewhere that will move us, one day, to the point where we see that race is a fact, but not the defining fact and not the fact that tells us what is important, but we are not yet.\n\nThe case has already been appealed and will likely wind up at the Supreme Court where several of the Justices will likely be less willing to wink at Harvard\u2019s system of discrimination.", "description": "\"I guess there's just something more personally appealing about African American and Hispanic applicants.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harvard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
