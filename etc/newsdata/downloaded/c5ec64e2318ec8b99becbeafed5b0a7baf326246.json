A terrible collision with a tractor seemed inevitable, but instead what (or who) he collided with was Ethan (George Rainsford). This turned out to have consequences that were almost as bad as colliding with a tractor.\n\nHaving his coffee spilled by a happy junior doctor on a bike was not an ideal start to Ethan\u2019s shift. He was preoccupied with trying to ignore Effie\u2019s calls and having the guilt of lying to Theo hanging over him, but it was Rash who was really getting on his nerves.\n\nThis was entirely unfounded, as Rash and his sidekick Mason (Victor Oshin) dealt beautifully with a man who suddenly started coughing up blood. Mason discovered that the man had had a gastric band operation and then gone on a long-haul flight soon afterwards, and they swiftly dealt with the ensuing pulmonary embolism. But they got no thanks from Ethan, who was just annoyed that the PE had been missed in the first place. He wasn\u2019t interested in their explanation that they had no reason to suspect anything more sinister than asthma. Ethan tutted and mentioned all the mistakes Rash has been making recently (almost all of which were Mason\u2019s fault) and told him there was no way he could support him for the CT1 position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen Ethan complained that Rash had spent most of the day on the phone to his father and told him, \u2018You have to find a way to move on from your grief.\u2019 And Rash decked him with a total slugger of a punch that was completely unexpected. Mason witnessed all of this and followed Rash outside to put a comforting hand on his shoulder \u2013 but will he back Rash up after failing to speak up for him earlier?\n\nMeanwhile, David (Jason Durr) was surprised to spot his own name \u2013 along with love hearts \u2013 in correspondence between Rosa (Jacey Salles) and her mum. It turned out that Rosa had told her fussy mum that she had a boyfriend and David was the first name that came to mind. \u2018You\u2019re not David!\u2019 she told David. \u2018Not the David!\u2019 No wonder David looked confused. Eventually she told him she\u2019d once been married and had a son, who\u2019d died when he was eight years old. In her grief she\u2019d taken to her bed for three years, during which time her marriage ended. Her mother supported her through all of this and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so protective of Rosa now.\n\nRosa and Ollie bond (Picture: BBC)\n\nRosa and Ollie (Harry Collett) have developed a lovely bond and he talks to her about things he finds uncomfortable talking to David about \u2013 like his constant worry that he may be bipolar like his dad. David realised this, and when Rosa said she was leaving he asked her to stay. \u2018You are a brilliant fake mum,\u2019 he told her. Ollie is moving in with David permanently, and David has promised Rosa that he\u2019ll pose as her boyfriend whenever her mother visits, which should be excellent fun.\n\nRobyn makes a kind offer (Picture: BBC)\n\nDuffy (Cathy Shipton)\u2019s first day as a volunteer in the ED didn\u2019t go well. She was helpful and lovely as always, but it exhausted her so much she had to go home at lunch time. In a heartbreaking scene Charlie (Derek Thompson) told Robyn (Amanda Henderson) that Duffy has given so much to the NHS, but now she needs help herself she keeps being put on waiting lists. Lovely Robyn offered to give him some money so he could take Duffy to a private clinic. He said no, but was really moved by her kindness.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of five novels and the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Duffy's first day as a volunteer arrived.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rash-casualty-10-1d08_1571664805.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
