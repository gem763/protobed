Last quarter, the Mid Cap Growth style ranked eleventh. It gets our Very Unattractive rating, which is based on an aggregation of ratings of nine ETFs and 359 mutual funds in the Mid Cap Growth style as of July 15, 2019. See a recap of our 2Q19 Style Ratings here.\n\nFigure 1 ranks from best to worst the seven Mid Cap Growth ETFs that meet our liquidity standards and Figure 2 shows the five best and worst rated Mid Cap Growth mutual funds. Not all Mid Cap Growth style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 13 to 1727). This variation creates drastically different investment implications and, therefore, ratings.\n\nInvestors seeking exposure to the Mid Cap Growth style should buy one of the Attractive-or-better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2.\n\nOur Robo-Analyst technology[1] empowers our unique ETF and mutual fund rating methodology, which leverages our rigorous analysis of each fund\u2019s holdings.[2] We think advisors and investors focused on prudent investment decisions should include analysis of fund holdings in their research process for ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nETFs with the Best & Worst Ratings\n\n* Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity.\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings\n\nFranklin LibertyQ U.S. Mid Cap Equity ETF (FLQM) and NuShares Nuveen ESG Mid Cap Growth ETF (NUMG) are excluded from Figure 1 because their total net assets (TNA) are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums.\n\nMutual Funds with the Best & Worst Ratings \u2013 Top 5\n\n* Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity.\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings\n\nBarron\u2019s 400 ETF (BFOR) is the top-rated Mid Cap Growth ETF and AMG Managers Cadence Mid Cap Fund (MCMFX) is the top-rated Mid Cap Growth mutual fund. Both earn a Very Attractive rating.\n\nRenaissance IPO ETF (IPO) is the worst rated Mid Cap Growth ETF and Optimum Small Mid Cap Growth Fund (OASGX) is the worst rated Mid Cap Growth mutual fund. IPO earns an Unattractive rating and OASGX earns a Very Unattractive rating.\n\nThe Danger Within\n\nBuying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. Put another way, research on fund holdings is necessary due diligence because a fund\u2019s performance is only as good as its holdings\u2019 performance. Don\u2019t just take our word for it, see what Barron\u2019s says on this matter.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF HOLDINGs = PERFORMANCE OF FUND\n\nAnalyzing each holding within funds is no small task. Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform this diligence with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. More of the biggest names in the financial industry (see At BlackRock (NYSE: ), Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks) are now embracing technology to leverage machines in the investment research process. Technology may be the only solution to the dual mandate for research: cut costs and fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. Investors, clients, advisors and analysts deserve the latest in technology to get the diligence required to make prudent investment decisions.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show the rating landscape of all Mid Cap Growth ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nSeparating the Best ETFs from the Worst Funds\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings\n\nSeparating the Best Mutual Funds from the Worst Funds\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Kyle Guske II covering: BlackRock Inc.
