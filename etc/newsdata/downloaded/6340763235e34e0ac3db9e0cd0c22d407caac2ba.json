It\u2019s also paying a handful of them big money \u2014 $3 million a year for three-year deals, according to Vox \u2014 for making their journalism available to Facebook.\n\nTo that effect, the Menlo Park tech firm is embracing a mix of human and AI-driven approach to curating news in an attempt to fix the problems created by News Feed.\n\nA \u201cdiverse team of journalists\u201d have been tasked with highlighting the biggest news stories of the day, while everything else will be hand-picked by an algorithm depending on your interests.\n\nThe company said as many as eight factors \u2014 facts, diverse voices, original reporting, on-the-record sourcing, timeliness, depth and context, fairness, and local reporting \u2014 will be taken into account when choosing specific stories across a breadth of topics ranging from politics and world affairs to entertainment and science.\n\nFacebook clearly understands the dangers of algorithmic curation for serving personalized news, for it acknowledges that machine learning has its limits. Still, the company also expects algorithmic personalization to drive the majority of Facebook News.\n\nA question of trust\n\nFacebook has made several overtures with news publishers in the past, although none of it have worked well \u2014 neither for the company nor the publishers.\n\nIt started with Instant Articles in 2015, before it changed its mind by shifting to video the following year, and made an algorithmic tweak in early 2018 that reordered its News Feed to show more posts shared by friends and family and less from publishers.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that the last time Facebook experimented with a separate tab for News, it not only led to traffic plummeting on news sites, but also resulted in \u201ca steady rise in engagement on sites that publish fake or sensationalist news,\u201d prompting Facebook to abort the test.\n\nAs much as publishers have been subjected to the constant updates and tweaks in order to keep users glued to Facebook, they\u2019re still seemingly keen to work with it again in part due to the service\u2019s colossal reach, which could translate into a huge audience.\n\nGiven Facebook\u2019s spotty track record with distributing news on its platform, it\u2019s too early to call it dead on arrival. But with the company compensating for high-quality journalism, it will be interesting to see how this trial pans out in the long run.\n\nAt a time the company is facing a question of trust after what\u2019s a string of scandals, its re-entry as a news aggregator should be seen for what it is: another attempt by Facebook to keep users locked into its ecosystem and not depart to its rivals like Snapchat and ByteDance-owned TikTok.\n\nThe only question that remains now is whether people are ready to get their daily news fix from the Big F.\n\nRead next: Hackers give Johannesburg government 3 days to pay over $30K in Bitcoin", "description": "Facebook is rolling out Facebook News to select audiences in the US starting today, carving a dedicated home screen tab out of its digital real estate for users to explore their news interests.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Ffacebook-news-hed.png&signature=c158e2b210cedcf34e79914a8f748c9f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
