I was wandering along a side street in Paris\u2019s 11th Arrondissement, saw these cookies on a counter in the back of Mokonuts, a small restaurant, and walked right in to buy a few. The baker Moko Hirayama has worked on her recipe with so much care and invention that it\u2019s almost difficult to see any family resemblance to cookie's inspiration: the classic American chocolate-chip cookie. Her cookies have chunks of fine chocolate (not store-bought chips), dried cranberries, rye flour and a good measure of poppy seeds, for color, crunch and surprise. Plan ahead: Once the dough is made and formed into balls, it should be refrigerated overnight before baking. Fresh from the oven, the cookies are fragile; they firm as they cool. They\u2019ll keep for about three days at room temperature or they can be frozen for up to two months; in either case, they should be wrapped well.\n\nFeatured in: Elevate Your Chocolate Chip Cookies.", "description": "These are the cookies that stopped me in my tracks I was wandering along a side street in Paris\u2019s 11th Arrondissement, saw these cookies on a counter in the back of Mokonuts, a small restaurant, and walked right in to buy a few The baker Moko Hirayama has worked on her recipe with so much care and invention that it\u2019s almost difficult to see any family resemblance to cookie's inspiration: the classic American chocolate-chip cookie", "authors": ["Dorie Greenspan", "Ali Slagle", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Sarah Digregorio", "Claire Saffitz", "Tejal Rao", "Florence Fabricant", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/magazine/09mag-OnDessert-image1/09mag-OnDessert-image1-articleLarge.jpg"}
