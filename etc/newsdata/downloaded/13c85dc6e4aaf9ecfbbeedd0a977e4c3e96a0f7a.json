He had teased the announcement last week during a United Nations meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"They\u2019ve been trying to get this for many, many decades, and I got it for the Polish people, in honor of the Polish people in the United States and in Poland,\" Trump said.\n\nUnder the waiver program, citizens of participating countries are able to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without obtaining a U.S. visa. Poland has long sought to gain access to the program.\n\nThirty-eight countries are participating in the visa waiver program, including several close U.S. allies like France, Germany, Australia, Sweden and Japan.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham Stephanie GrishamHouse Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents Trump approves Poland's entry to visa waiver program Trump: Democrats wasting time on 'bulls---' with impeachment inquiry MORE said in a statement Friday that the Department of Homeland Security will assess Poland's entry into the visa waiver program now that Trump has given his approval.\n\n\n\n\"The bilateral relationship between the United States and Poland has never been stronger, and this would serve as a remarkable accomplishment for both countries,\" she said.\n\nTrump was previously scheduled to travel to Poland in late August, where the waiver program was expected to be a point of discussion.
