Once the crown jewel of DirecTV\u2019s offerings, the package has become less valuable as more customers cut the cord and ditch traditional cable for cheaper streaming platforms, according to AT&T COO John Stankey, who told the Wall Street Journal the service offers \u201cless profitability\u201d than it once did.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we look at that and say it\u2019s a growth product,\u201d Stankey said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to wake up a year from now and suddenly there\u2019s going to be more people in the United States that want to watch an out-of-market team.\u201d\n\nDirecTV is said to pay an average annual fee of $1.5 billion for exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, but loses more than $500 million each year on the deal, the Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The service has roughly two million paid subscribers.\n\nAn NFL representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Stankey\u2019s remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL executives have experimented with streaming deals in recent years, selling digital rights to \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d to Amazon. NBC News reported last April that the league was considering splitting rights to Sunday Ticket between DirecTV and a streaming platform.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in August that tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon were in early discussions for expanded broadcast partnerships when the league\u2019s current deals expire.\n\n\u201cI do firmly believe that these other platforms are going to be players in future negotiations. And, frankly, they are in current negotiations,\u201d Goodell told Sports Business Journal at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "DirecTV has controlled rights to the service, which allows subscribers to watch nearly every game on the NFL schedule, for more than two decades.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201908/229/0/0/854081161001_6074878931001_6074866468001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
