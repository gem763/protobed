(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nTwenty homeless people were allegedly evicted from a Kentucky Taco Bell after a woman bought them dinner at the restaurant.\n\n\u201cOh hell no Taco Bell. I don\u2019t play that way,\u201d Shannon Mosier Gridley wrote on Facebook Tuesday, following the removal of her guests from the Louisville location.\n\nThat evening, Gridley left Jefferson Community and Technical College, where she is a student, and went to Taco Bell, where she has been a customer for 20 years. On her walk, she saw three homeless people on the street.\n\nSpontaneously, Gridley asked the group if they wanted a hot meal. \u201cI did tell one to put on a shirt,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe walked a bit and then I saw three more homeless people, who joined us.\u201d\n\nThe group walked on and Gridley realized they would soon pass a cluster of people sleeping under a highway overpass. \u201cI couldn\u2019t step over them without an invitation,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Who is awake and wants food?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Mosier Gridley of Kentucky was kicked out of a Taco Bell while treating 20 homeless people to a meal.

That man was with six other homeless people.\n\nAccording to Gridley, the restaurant was practically empty and seven employees were present. \u201cA security guard who works at my college was eating dinner at a table and started hassling one of the women,\u201d she says. \u201cI waved my credit card and said, \u2018Everyone here is a paying customer.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the cashier allegedly told the cooks, \u201cBag all these orders to go.\u201d After Gridley paid $77 for one order of food, a teen girl asked to use the restroom. \u201cThe employee said the bathroom was cleaned and closed for the night,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there was an hour left until closing time.\u201d\n\nThen, a tall, well-dressed man entered Taco Bell. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I see what you\u2019re doing here and I\u2019d like to contribute,\u2019\u201d handing Gridley a $10 bill.\n\nAfter Gridley placed a second order for $11, she says an employee locked the main door and told everyone to leave by the side exit because the restaurant was \u201cunderstaffed.\u2019\u201d\n\nGridley claims she overheard an employee mimic her in a high-pitched voice to the manager. \u201cMeanwhile, all my guests were smiling and introducing themselves to each other,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThere was no issue with their behavior.\u201d\n\nFour members of her group did not get served, although Gridley sacrificed her own meal for them to share.\n\n\u201cA group of the men walked me to my car and we said goodbye,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gridley wrote on Facebook, \u201cI spent over $100 on 48 menu items & was told to leave....I will shout from the rooftops how nasty Taco Bell is to paying customers. I am a 44 year old white, housewife with nothing better to do. I encourage someone with authority to contact me.\u201d\n\nA Taco Bell representative tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cTaco Bell is committed to creating a space that\u2019s welcoming and safe for all people, while maintaining an environment free of discrimination or harassment. The franchise organization that owns and operates this location is looking into the matter and will be proactively re-training its team members on its policies. Knowing that homelessness is an unfortunate issue in this area especially, the franchisee looks forward to connecting with local organizations to see how they can help and work better together in the future.\u201d\n\nGridley says she will feed the homeless again \u2014 but not at Taco Bell. \u201cI\u2019ll take them to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Shannon Mosier Gridley of Kentucky says the Taco Bell employees were \"nasty\" to her homeless guests.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/euxC9yYrZfkAKux4dZ86Rg--~B/aD0yNzkxO3c9NDIxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/2a88f9b0-d66d-11e9-9d7f-95dae9ab78da", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
