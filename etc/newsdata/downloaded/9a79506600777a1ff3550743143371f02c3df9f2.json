The officials' family members would also be restricted from traveling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA State Department spokesperson told The Hill the department is \"committed to promoting accountability for those who commit human rights abuses around the world.\"\n\n\"The United States calls on the People\u2019s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to the PRC to face an uncertain fate,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act allows the secretary of State to restrict visas to people who \u201cwould have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d\n\nThe visa restrictions came in connection with the Department of Commerce's blacklisting of several Chinese companies that use facial recognition technology reportedly to identify Muslim minorities in the country, announced Monday\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing that this administration is following through,\u201d Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia David Stilwell said in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent, it\u2019s deliberate and the goal is to get them to reconsider this terrible policy they have.\u201d\n\nA State Department official also told Bloomberg that allies in Europe and the Muslim world were pushed to impose similar bans.\n\nFollowing Monday's announcement of the blacklisting, China responded through Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, telling the U.S. to \"stop interfering in China's internal affairs.\"\n\nThese restrictions come as U.S.-China relations remain tense while the two countries work to negotiate a trade deal. Talks are scheduled to continue in Washington this week.\n\nOfficials told Bloomberg the blacklisting of companies and visa bans are unrelated to the trade talks, but one State Department official said the U.S. thinks China will not show up to talks unless the U.S. appears serious.\n\nUpdated: 7:48 p.m.", "description": "The Trump administration is imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials\u00a0who are connected to the detention of Muslims in Xinjiang province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chinaflag_070116getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
