Tatel, a Clinton appointee to the bench, said the Oversight Committee\u2019s subpoena for records from Mazars USA, the accounting firm, is valid and enforceable. He rejected the president\u2019s claims that the committee was on an untenable fishing expedition, and that it needed a more firm grant of power by Congress to pursue the information.\n\nThe subpoena concerns allegations Mr. Trump paid hush money to two porn stars during the 2016 campaign. The subpoena was issued in April, well before House Democrats announced they were in the midst of an impeachment inquiry of the president, and the fight is not directly related to that inquiry.\n\nBut the ruling is likely to boost Democrats\u2019 hopes as they prepare to battle the president on a slew of subpoenas and demands for witnesses to testify in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nJudge Tatel and Judge Patricia Millett, an Obama appointee, said the House\u2019s regular investigative powers are strong enough to demand the most private information from the president.\n\n\u201cWe detect no inherent constitutional flaw in laws requiring presidents to publicly disclose certain financial information. And that is enough,\u201d Judge Tatel wrote.\n\nHe said Congress\u2019s assertion that it is considering new laws to govern presidential ethics is enough to justify such a subpoena.\n\nHouse Democrats said the ruling should be a signal to Mr. Trump to drop his blanket resistance to their investigative efforts.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a fundamental and resounding victory for Congressional oversight, our constitutional system of checks and balances, and the rule of law,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the Oversight Committee.\n\nDissenting was Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, who said the court was expanding Congress\u2019s powers to a new point they\u2019d never been before.\n\nShe said if Democrats want to dig so deeply, they need to take the politically tricky step of launching impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cWhen the House chooses to investigate the President for alleged violations of the laws and the Constitution, it must proceed through impeachment, an exceptional and solemn exercise of judicial power established as a separate check on public officials,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPerhaps anticipating future battles, Judge Rao pointed out that in the 1998 pursuit of impeachment against President Clinton, the full House had a floor vote to authorize an inquiry.\n\nMrs. Pelosi has refused so far to take that step to hold a vote this time, instead unilaterally declaring the House is now in an impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Friday she took vindication in the new ruling.\n\n\u201cThe court rejected the administration\u2019s defiance of Congress\u2019s oversight authority,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
