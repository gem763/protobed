Police fired tear gas and baton-charged the crowds, while some demonstrators threw bricks and petrol bombs at police as night fell.\n\nProtesters concealed their faces in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws invoked by the authorities on Friday, which banned face masks. Protesters face a maximum of one year in jail for breaking the mask ban.\n\nPolice made their first arrests under the new rules, detaining scores of people. Officers tied their wrists with cable and unmasked their faces before placing them on buses. Some protesters lay in foetal positions on the ground, their wrists tied behind their backs, after being subdued with pepper spray and batons.\n\n\"The anti-mask law just fuels our anger and more will people come on to the street,\" Lee, a university student wearing a blue mask, said on Sunday, as he marched on Hong Kong island.\n\n\"We are not afraid of the new law, we will continue fighting. We will fight for righteousness. I put on the mask to tell the government that I'm not afraid of tyranny.\"", "description": "The stand-off with the PLA came after rallies attended by tens of thousands of protesters earlier on Sunday ended in violent clashes in several locations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106166867-1570407879593gettyimages-1173906113.jpeg?v=1570407992", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
