It got even shakier after an ill-fated bullpen appearance on Wednesday in Game 5 of the NLDS.\n\nCalled into the game with two outs and a 3-1 lead in the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals, Kershaw got off to a perfect start with a three-pitch strikeout against Adam Eaton. Kershaw came back out for the eighth, when things went very, very wrong.\n\nNationals star Anthony Rendon led the inning off by digging out a slider from below the zone and depositing the pitch in the left-field stands to cut the lead to 3-2.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThis might be the saddest picture of all time. pic.twitter.com/Ogw2YdH5yz \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) October 10, 2019\n\nOne pitch later, Juan Soto went yard to tie the game.\n\nThe southpaw, as you might have expected, was visibly crushed.\n\nThe Dodgers immediately pulled Kershaw after that, but the damage had been done. What was once a 3-0 lead had turned into a whole new ballgame for the 106-win Dodgers.
