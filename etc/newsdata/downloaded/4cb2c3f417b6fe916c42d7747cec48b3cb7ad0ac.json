but no emails were being forwarded to any other address.\n\nGillian immediately contacted Amazon for help after discovering the loss of money and also reported the incident to both Action Fraud and Trading Standards.\n\nAfter she asked for an explanation, Amazon confirmed that her account was accessed by an unauthorised party but she claims it did not initially provide her with much help for returning the television.\n\nHacked: Gillian had a TV delivered to her house - even though she hadn't ordered one\n\nIn fact, she said Amazon UK told her to keep the television \u2013 even though she did not want it and did not want to pay for it.\n\nShe said: 'I have had so much conflicting advice from Amazon customer service - \"keep the item, return the item at your expense and we will refund the shipping\".'\n\nSince the incident, she has had four Amazon account alerts and lock downs including one in Portuguese from Amazon Brazil and four chargeback alerts, which are activated when a customer contacts their bank or credit card company to dispute the charge for an order that they placed or - in this case - didn't place.\n\nLuckily, after contacting her bank, it was sympathetic and returned the funds to her account \u2013 recognising that it looked like a fraudulent transaction.\n\nAs soon as Amazon received the chargeback notice from Gillian's bank, it locked her account and removed the orders from the history of the account.\n\nWhilst Gillian didn't have much joy with Amazon initially, after This is Money contacted the site about the incident, it provided her with a prepaid label to return the television to Amazon USA via UPS as well as a \u00a3100 gift card as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: 'From time to time, customers may receive e-mails appearing to come from Amazon, which are actually false emails, sometimes called \"spoof emails\" or \"phishing emails\".\n\n'These can look similar to real Amazon emails but often direct the recipient to a false website where they might be asked to provide account information such as their e-mail address and password combination.\n\n'The best way to ensure that you do not respond to a false or phishing email is to always go directly to your account on Amazon to review or make any changes to your orders or your account.\n\n'We would ask any customer who believes that they have received a false or phishing email to alert us via our stop-spoofing@amazon.com email address.'\n\nWhilst Amazon suggests it could have been a phishing email that allowed hackers access, Gillian has been given no concrete information about how this hack was made possible and what possible repercussions there may have been for the hacker.\n\nGillian added: 'This whole affair has left me constantly checking my account.'\n\nWhat to do if your Amazon account has been hacked\n\nHave you been scammed?

Email grace.gausden@thisismoney.co.uk\n\nIf you have had your Amazon account hacked, one of the first things you should do is contact the site on 0800 279 7234 to report it.\n\nAnother step you should take is to change your password - preferably making it something completely different.\n\nMake sure to report the incident to your bank so they are aware of any fraudulent transactions but say that you wish to dispute a transaction as opposed to immediately reporting it as fraud.\n\nWhere fraud is alleged, banks can launch investigations which means it may take longer for victims to get their money back.\n\nIf you paid by debit card, ask the bank to take back the money using chargeback rules. There is a limited time frame with chargeback claims so ensure you make them within 120 days of the payments being made.\n\nIf you paid by credit card, ask for a refund under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.\n\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said: 'Amazon suggests this could have been a phishing scam - an example of one of the increasingly sophisticated tactics fraudsters are using to steal sensitive information such as logins and card details for a variety of purposes, including to make fraudulent purchases online.\n\n'If you are a victim of this type of scam, you should change your login details immediately and contact the retailer to dispute this transaction and request a refund.\n\n'If the retailer doesn't help, contact your bank or credit card provider to try and get your money back.'", "description": "Gillian Weston, a retired British pensioner, found a Samsung television waiting for her in her porch earlier this month.
