He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\n\n'His body was mutilated by the blast. the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition. But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification.\n\n'It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.'\n\nThe president confirmed yesterday, Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after fleeing into a dead-end tunnel, killing himself and three children, during an overnight targeted attack.", "description": "Despite knowing US intelligence was closing in on a location for Baghdadi, President Trump still ordered US troops to be withdrawn from the volatile region of northern Syria earlier this month.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/17/20289190-0-image-a-53_1572282685074.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
