Since listing, Uber\u2019s shares have dropped 35.2 per cent while Lyft is down 45 per cent.\n\n\u201cYou have to give these things time but so far if you'd bought at the IPO for Uber and Lyft, you would've lost money,\u201d Mr Mahaney said.\n\nThe analyst suggested the excessive capital in the private markets had stretched valuations too far for the more \"sober\" public market.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly had a lot of money in private markets, more so than you've had in the past. Some people have talked about it as ridiculous capitalism.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do think, and I'm a biased person on this, the public markets are usually a little more sober than the private markets and this certainly seems like evidence of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of competing institutions and interests in the listed universe tended to keep company valuations in check.\n\n\"In the public markets, there's a lot more opinions, you can't just have a few funds dictate price, no fund is big enough to dictate prices in the public [realm] and you also have these wonderful institutions called short sellers which you don\u2019t have in private markets,\" he said.\n\n\"That public market test is almost always more volume tested than a private market price.\"\n\nMr Mahaney suggested companies eyeing a float would heed the lessons of their predecessors and better anticipate market expectations.\n\n\u201cI think we'll see other IPOs in the next six to 12 months that will be widely known but that won't have the same problems as Uber, Lyft or WeWork,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUber, Lyft and WeWork were unusual in the amount of losses they were generating.\u201d\n\nWeWork had other issues aside from valuation: it failed to get investors comfortable with its burgeoning losses, and a business model that involved taking long-term leases and providing short-dated rentals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Mahaney suggested investors had other concerns too.\n\n\u201cWeWork was unusual in the type of under reported management structure with the super voting rights and the wife rights and things like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou were kind of pushing the boundaries there a little bit and the public markets have correctly, corrected it, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nWhile the weak trading of newly floated companies may raise red flags for some investors, Mr Mahaney recalled the initial weakness in Amazon shares as a prime example of an under-achieving stock coming good.\n\n\u201cAmazon certainly underperformed for multiple years. It had a super rally into the dot-com bubble and boom, and a super correction when the dot-com burst,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have a sneaking suspicion that you didn't really get outsized returns out of buying Amazon shares until five years after its IPO.\u201d\n\nThe similarities between the likes of Uber, Lyft and Amazon were equally striking.\n\n\u201cYou had a founder-led company, massive losses, uncertain end-market opportunity. That's the case with Uber, Lyft. We don't really know if these businesses can be profitable and we didn't know that about Amazon at the time of its IPO [either].\u201d", "description": "The private market hype around Uber, Lyft and WeWork has been hit hard by public markets this year, says RBC's Mark Mahaney.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_416%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/767894db26ad90cab224dee0c1874e914c8c991e", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
