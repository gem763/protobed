Saying it's oversold is just, unfortunately, not sufficient, even if it's a well-known brand name, to say that I want to take a real stab at trying to buy.\"\n\nFor Newton, the proof is in the ketchup.\n\n\"I want to see that proof, and unfortunately, it's just not there yet,\" he said. \"We continue to hear negative news and more volume to be on the downside and people ditching it, so I want to avoid and/or wait before I take a step in the water.\"\n\nMichael Binger, president of Gradient Investments, had a similarly dismal outlook on the consumer food giant.\n\n\"The playbook here when they put this merger together is that you lever up, you get a couple of big, strong, activist-type investors and ... Warren Buffett to come in, you cut a lot of costs, you talk about synergies and then you spur some growth in more niche and growth-oriented areas,\" Binger said in the same \"Trading Nation\" interview.\n\n\"Well, they cut costs, they got some synergies, but there has been no growth in their core \u2014 I'm even going to call it commodity \u2014 type of business: ketchup, cheese, mac 'n' cheese, those kinds of things,\" Binger said.\n\nIn addition, he noted, the company has cut its dividend as well as its profit forecasts, leaving investors with these questions that shouldn't go unanswered.\n\nWhat kind of value trap are Kraft Heinz investors facing? When might 3G and Buffett sell out of their positions? How can the company recapture growth? How can Kraft Heinz delever?\n\n\"You sum all these things together [and] it's just a no-growth company,\" Binger said. \"They can't go out and acquire right now because they're levered up so much. I think it is kind of a value trap at this point in time. I'm with Mark; there's no proof that it's not.\"\n\nEven with a price-to-earnings multiple of about 10 times next year's estimates, which is cheap for Kraft Heinz, it could still get cheaper, Binger said.\n\n\"I think it could still fall a couple of bucks,\" the investor said. \"I certainly don't think there's any catalyst to drive it higher from here in the current time period.\"\n\nKraft Heinz is expected to issue its next earnings report on Nov. 7. It will be the second earnings release for CEO Miguel Patricio, formerly of AB InBev, who was tapped to lead the company earlier this year.\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "Kraft Heinz's dismal year-to-date performance will likely continue after a top shareholder revealed a massive sale of its stock, two technical analysts say.", "authors": ["Lizzy Gurdus"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105804655-1553101414726gettyimages-1078774476.jpeg?v=1553101441", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
