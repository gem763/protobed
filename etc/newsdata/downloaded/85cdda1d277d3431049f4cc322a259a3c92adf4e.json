She appeared alongside both artist Rob Roth, who led the interview, and Blondie founder and former co-partner Chris Stein.\n\nHowever, those in the audience have criticised the way the interview was conducted, as they deemed Rob the \u2018worst interviewer ever\u2019 \u2013 with many fans walking out of the tent before the event had finished.\n\n\u2018Fantastic festival, but what the hell was that Debbie Harry debacle?\u2019 one fan questioned on Twitter.\n\n\u2018Walked out with loads of others! Worst ever. Disgrace!!!\u2019\n\n\u2018Amazing to see Debbie Harry at @CheltLitFest but boy, was it poorly done,\u2019 another added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Terrible, disjointed questioning. Such a shame.\u2019\n\n\u2018Debbie Harry interview was appalling,\u2019 another wrote. The interviewer was possibly the worst I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nDebbie was interviewed by Rob Roth, with many fans branding him the \u2018worst interviewer ever\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Lazy and unplanned, no structure and just not in tune with the audience whatsoever. So many people left.\u2019\n\n\u2018Just been to see Debbie Harry @CheltLitFest very disappointing, embarrassing lack of preparation, and poor delivery\u2019 another frustrated fan tweeted.\n\n\u2018Unstructured, uninformative and not very entertaining.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted organisers for the Cheltenham Literature Festival for comment.\n\nRob has since hit back at the flurry of disappointed fans on his Twitter page, with many tweeting him expressing their anger and frustration at the way he handled the interview.\n\n\u2018Dear @RobRuthNYC, I will tell you one thing for sure,\u2019 one fan wrote.\n\n\u2018Your interview of #DebbieHarry @BlondieOfficial tonight at #CheltLitFest was appalling.\n\n\u2018You built zero rapport with the audience, Debbie looked bored as we felt \u2013 it was awkward \u2013 people walked out in pure disappointment.\u2019\n\nThe fan later tweeted the Cheltenham Literature Festival organisers, requesting to have their money back following the event.\n\nRob replied sarcastically: \u2018Thanks! We had fun! Stay punk!\u2019\n\n\u2018As for a refund, stay punk!!\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
