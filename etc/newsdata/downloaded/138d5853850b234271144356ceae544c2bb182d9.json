Gwen Stefani and Erykah Badu are canceled. Despite his relatively strong play in the World Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo has been canceled. Taylor Swift is canceled and Common is canceled and, Wednesday, Antoni Porowski, a Queer Eye fan favorite was also canceled. Needless to say, Kanye West is canceled, too. Significantly, all of these figures are alive, well, and prosperous today\u2026 Statements like this are routine in cancel culture discourse\u2014any particular cancellation, no matter how trivial or narrow it may seem to the casual observer, evidently carries within it the seeds of something much more grave. In a March column, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan also made reference to torture and indoctrination under Mao. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be overdramatic, but the spirit of the struggle session has returned,\u201d she declared. \u201cSocial media is full of swarming political and ideological mobs. In an interesting departure from democratic tradition, they don\u2019t try to win the other side over. They only condemn and attempt to silence. The spirit of the struggle session is all over Twitter.\u201d\u2026 Yet it seems at least possible that tweets are just tweets\u2014that as difficult as criticism in the social media age may be to contend with at times, it bears no meaningful resemblance to genocides, excommunications, executions, assassinations, political imprisonments, and official bans past. Perhaps we should choose instead to understand cancel culture as something much more mundane: ordinary public disfavor voiced by ordinary people across new platforms.\n\nToday, Jesse Singal wrote a lengthy response (11,000 words) to the New Republic piece which makes the convincing argument that Nwanevu has failed to grapple with any of the real issues presented by cancel culture in his haste to dismiss it as much ado about nothing. First, Singal does away with the strawman that being \u201ccanceled\u201d always means losing your job or status:\n\nEvery single article he links to and quotes from acknowledges that there are various gradations of \u2018cancellation\u2019 and rejects the simple idea that the word \u2018cancellation\u2019 and its variants always mean having one\u2019s career or life permanently disrupted. Who is being argued with here? When Nwanevu says \u201cwe\u2019re told urgently,\u201d who is doing this telling? Who is comparing guacamole to Louis CK? This all feels like the equivalent of me telling a friend, \u201cYou know, I heard you say you hate onions, and I also heard you say you hate Hitler \u2014 you\u2019d really put onions on the same plane as Hitler?\u201d My friend would roll his eyes, and justifiably so\u2026\n\nAnd here\u2019s Singal on the idea that being canceled is just \u201cordinary public disfavor\u201d on new platforms.\n\nMobs aren\u2019t new and outrage isn\u2019t new, but what is new is the way a non-public figure can be captured forever at their worst or most misunderstood moment, and have that define them forever. Technology has permanently amplified one of the uglier and more primal and difficult-to-wrangle parts of human nature\u2026 Imagine if \u2014 and please indulge me as I wander off into another completely wild hypothetical \u2014 it were at least possible to conceive of a way of writing and thinking about technologically mediated and amplified forms of outrage and shaming that landed, say, somewhere between \u201cNo reasonable person should be genuinely worried by or interested in any of this\u201d and \u201cMean tweets are literally the Holocaust.\u201d If only!\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal more to Singal\u2019s critique, all of which is worth reading. But I\u2019m going to jump over to another piece that appeared at The Week last Friday. Author Damon Linker makes a point about cancel culture which I think is a fairly good one. He argues that, yes, we\u2019ve always had the impulse toward socially ostracizing people we disagree with. But in the era before the internet, culture changed fairly slowly and so at any given time a large percentage of people around you probably had roughly similar ideas about what was right and what was wrong. What\u2019s different now is that you have a vanguard of woke people who make judgments about right and wrong despite the fact that they are really just a small percentage of the population:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now with \u201ccancel culture\u201d is different. A small number of online progressives have appointed themselves a moral vanguard, upholding and attempting to enforce, through the methods of a digital mob, a form of puritanical egalitarianism that is affirmed only by a few. Any writer, entertainer, or other public personality who diverges from this moral standard by demonstrating insufficient sensitivity and deference to the feelings of members of certain protected classes will find himself canceled. The progressives have thereby skipped the step of broad-based persuasion and jumped right to the end point of attempting to enforce a new public moral norm. It\u2019s this dynamic \u2014 a small minority of ideological activists ganging up on an individual, attempting to compel media companies, book publishers, television shows, movie studios, and corporations into casting the individual into outer darkness \u2014 that has prompted columnist Peggy Noonan and others to liken cancel culture to the totalitarianism of China\u2019s cultural revolution. In many ways, comparing the experience of being (metaphorically) canceled in the 21st-century United States to a social and political upheaval that may have (literally) killed more than a million people is ludicrous and offensive. But it is valid in at least three narrow respects: both attempt to achieve their moral and political ends by way of public bullying, accusation, and humiliation; both demand public expressions of remorse and contrition by those deemed guilty by the mob; and both ultimately aim to force a thoroughgoing revaluation of public values through their strong-arm tactics.\n\nHere I\u2019m going to stick up for Peggy Noonan. It\u2019s true that online cancel culture doesn\u2019t have the body count of the Cultural Revolution so any direct comparison won\u2019t hold up, but I\u2019d suggest that\u2019s at least partly because of the social dynamics Linker is pointing out in his piece. We\u2019re not nearly to that point because cancel culture proponents are still a small percentage of the population, though it may not seem that way on Twitter at times. I think the point Noonan was making is that the two phenomena are coming from the same impulse even if they aren\u2019t comparable in impact:\n\nSo I ask you to entertain an idea that has been on my mind. I don\u2019t want to be overdramatic, but the spirit of the struggle session has returned and is here, in part because of the internet, in part because of the extremity of our politics, in part because more people are lonely. \u201cContention is better than loneliness,\u201d as my people, the Irish, say, and they would know. The air is full of accusation and humiliation. We have seen this spirit most famously on the campuses, where students protest harshly, sometimes violently, views they wish to suppress. Social media is full of swarming political and ideological mobs. In an interesting departure from democratic tradition, they don\u2019t try to win the other side over. They only condemn and attempt to silence.\n\nI think it\u2019s a fair criticism that the impact is what matters most and therefore this isn\u2019t a fair comparison even if there are similarities. That\u2019s what Linker seems to be saying. But it\u2019s a bit hard to take that kind of criticism when so many on the left have engaged in comparisons of Trump (and before him Bush) to Hitler, Republicans to brownshirts, and the present moment to 1930s Germany. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t blink when people suggest we\u2019re \u201closing our democracy\u201d and \u201csliding toward fascism\u201d then the complaint that some in the cancel culture far left are channeling the Cultural Revolution shouldn\u2019t bother you on grounds of historical accuracy.", "description": "\"A small number of online progressives have appointed themselves a moral vanguard...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fascists.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
