(AP) - Alex Morgan will miss the rest of the season for the Orlando Pride because of a patella stress reaction in her right knee.\n\nMorgan was injured while on duty with the U.S. national team, which won the Women\u2019s World Cup in France this summer, the Pride said.\n\nMorgan appeared in six matches for the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team this season, four before the World Cup and two since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously difficult to lose a player of Alex\u2019s caliber due to injury,\u201d Pride general manager Erik Ustruck said in a statement. \u201cHowever, after consulting with the Club\u2019s medical team at Orlando Health and U.S. Soccer, we felt it was in the best interest of Alex\u2019s long-term health to shut her down for the season to focus on the rehabilitation process and take the appropriate time to recover from the lingering knee injury.\u201d\n\nThe Pride have three regular season games remaining. Orlando is 4-15-2 and last in the league standings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alex Morgan will miss the rest of the season for the Orlando Pride because of a patella stress reaction in her right knee.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
