Furthermore, Mabuza said only stage 1 load shedding would be implemented on Friday.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, Eskom issued a notice that load shedding would be escalated from stage 1 to stage 2. The notice said this was as a result of losing additional capacity lost at Medupi power station in Lephalale, Limpopo, Fin24 previously reported.\n\n\"Late last night, we lost Medupi 3, 4 and 5 due to coal and ash handling issues,\" Eskom said in its statement.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, however, Mothae said that unit 4 had come back online.\n\nThe power utility reintroduced load shedding on Wednesday this week due to a shortage of capacity following the failure of a conveyor belt, used to carry 4 000 tons of coal, from Exxaro's Grootgeluk Coal Mine to Medupi.\n\nMabuza has said the conveyor belt is expected to be repaired by next Wednesday.", "description": "Eskom spokesperson, Dikatso Mothae, has confirmed to Fin24 that Stage 1 load shedding will be implemented on Saturday.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8746/bc8908bf5d8640bfa95c7dcfe995bab3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
