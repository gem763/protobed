(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nA blood-oxygen monitor is clipped to the animal\u2019s large pink tongue. An endoscope has been fed down his throat to examine his small intestine. And technician Jayne Hutcheson is swabbing his paws with blue paint for keepsake paw prints.\n\nBeneath the surgical lights, the National Zoo\u2019s giant panda Bei Bei is on his back on the operating table. He has a catheter in his jugular vein held in place with staples, and a blood pressure cuff on one leg.\n\nHis tiny black eyes are open, and bits of dust rise from his thick fur. But he has been anesthetized and does not react to the experts preparing him for his new adventure and, perhaps, the end of an era at the zoo.\n\nBei Bei, the youngest of the zoo\u2019s three giant pandas, is headed to China, probably this fall. And before he goes, veterinarians and technicians Wednesday gave him a thorough checkup at the zoo\u2019s hospital.\n\nOver several hours, as the monitors beeped and technicians took notes, he was X-rayed and scoped. His abdomen was examined with ultrasound and his muscles were prodded by a nutritionist.\n\nBlood, photos and at least one selfie were taken.\n\nNear the end, visiting veterinarian J.D. Foster, from Washington\u2019s Friendship Hospital for Animals, said: \u201cThis looks pretty darn good.\u201d\n\nNational Zoo veterinarian James Steeil replied: \u201cI\u2019ll take pretty darn good.\u201d\n\nThe zoo is entering a time of transition in its almost 50-year experience with giant pandas.\n\nAfter Bei Bei, 4, goes, the zoo will be down to its two adult pandas: Mei Xiang, 21, a female, and Tian Tian, 22, a male.\n\nBy prior agreement with the Chinese, all giant panda cubs born in U.S. zoos must be sent to a breeding program in China once they turn 4. Bei Bei, a subadult, turned 4 in August.\n\nTwo National Zoo cubs already have been shipped to China in recent years. Tai Shan, a male, was moved there in 2010, and Bao Bao, a female, was moved in 2017.\n\nIn addition, the extended 20-year Chinese lease of the two adults will be up Dec. 7, 2020. China owns and leases all giant pandas in U.S. zoos.\n\nThe National Zoo says it has not discussed in detail with China what will happen then.\n\nWould the zoo keep its two adults on a lease extension, and study them as they grow old?\n\nWould China exchange them for a younger breeding pair?\n\nShould the current tension with China continue, would that be a factor?\n\nZoo officials declined to speculate.\n\n\n\nGiant panda Bei Bei undergoes a general physical and wellness exam at the National Zoo. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nNational Zoo chief veterinarian Don Neiffer listens to Bei Bei\u2019s heartbeat during the exam. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nBut Brandie Smith, the deputy director, said Wednesday that the zoo has to decide where it wants to take its giant panda program next.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about where we want our research to go in the future,\u201d she said at the zoo. \u201cA big part of our research was on giant panda reproduction.\u201d\n\nWith the birth of three cubs, \u201cwe cracked the code,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s the end of that era. So what fills in that space?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, we were big on giant panda population management,\u201d she said. \u201cThe National Zoo, we really kind of helped create the breeding plan for the entire global panda population. Again, box checked. . . . So what comes in to fill that space?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the zoo has been waiting to find out whether Mei Xiang might be pregnant or is experiencing a false pregnancy. In the latter case, the panda exhibits all the signs of pregnancy, but no cub is delivered.\n\nMei Xiang, who has had numerous false pregnancies in past years, was artificially inseminated in March and is near the end of her 90- to 185-day gestation period.\n\nAs observers kept a close eye on her in the panda house, Bei Bei was on the table under a red heating blanket to keep him warm during the examinations.\n\nHe\u2019d had some gastrointestinal problems in recent weeks. And he underwent successful surgery in 2016 to remove a clump of food stuck in his bowel.\n\nSo, in addition to his checkup, veterinarians wanted to examine his digestive tract.\n\n\u201cPandas, not just in captive situations but even in the wild, as a species they seem to have a propensity for gastrointestinal disease,\u201d said the zoo\u2019s chief veterinarian, Don Neiffer.\n\n\u201cWith him in particular, actually with all animals, when they go to another institution . . . or another country, there\u2019s usually a pre-shipment examination that occurs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut because he has this history of a gastrointestinal obstruction, and he more recently was a little off because of [a] mucus stool, we really wanted to take the opportunity to just work him up,\u201d Neiffer said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting to find anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\n(The zoo said after the procedures that everything seemed fine.)\n\nAs the veterinarians worked, Hutcheson, the technician, and panda keeper Marty Dearie worked on getting the inked paw prints on pieces of white paper.\n\n\u201cThis is for those of our team who\u2019ve been with him since he was a cub,\u201d said zoo spokeswoman Annalisa Meyer. \u201cThis is like the most perfect memory . . . that you can have.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a panda signature, she said.", "description": "The youngster is readied for his trip to China, as the National Zoo ponders its panda future.", "authors": ["Michael E.
