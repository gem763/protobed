It is a physical reality,' said Christophe-Charles Rousselot, director general of the Fondation Notre-Dame, the charity that is overseeing the gathering of donations to the cathedral told AFP.\n\nReconstruction work underway at Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral. The April fire destroyed the landmark's roof and raised concerns about melted lead in the surrounding area.\n\nAbove all, the process of securing an edifice still at risk of collapse after the fire damage has taken precedence over any reconstruction.\n\nFrench President Emanuel Macron' five-year goal would see the cathedral's reconstruction completed in the spring of 2024, before Paris hosts the Summer Olympic Games that year.\n\n'We will rebuild the cathedral even more beautifully and I want it to be finished within five years,' Macron said on national television on the evening of April 16, 2019 \u2013 one day after the fire destroyed the cathedral.\n\n'And we can do it,' he added.\n\nThere is no consensus, however, on how the cathedral should look after reconstruction. Many experts want a newly rebuilt spire to be exactly like the original, whilst French President Emanuel Macron is arguing for an innovative solution.\n\nBut many see the spire, a late addition to the mediaeval cathedral designed by the 19th-century French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, as an integral part of the building.\n\n'It needs to be rebuilt as it was before,' opined Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of restoring the cathedral, arguing that the sheer power of the spire integrated it with the mediaeval church.\n\nVilleneuve's opinion is backed by the descendants of Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who designed the spire.\n\nThe French public concur, opinion polls indicate.\n\nThe government has also not ruled out the possibility of an international competition for architects to design something new.\n\nIt is only at the end of 2020 that a complete check will allow architects to work out how to restore the cathedral. No reconstruction is expected to start before 2021.\n\nNotre Dame suffered a major fire in April 2019, though Emanuel Macron said that he wants the rebuilding work completed by 2024.\n\nExperts are also intensively researching the precise original architecture of the cathedral, so that when reconstruction begins it is as accurate as possible.\n\n'Before 2010, we only have old-style surveys, plans that have been redrawn on numerous occasions which are very partial and very imprecise,' said Remi Fromont, one of the architects responsible for the site who is working on drawing up accurate plans.\n\nAndrew Tallon, a Belgium-born scholar who died aged 49 in November 2018, carried out hugely valuable laser scans of the interior in 2010 that have proved an even more valuable legacy than he could have imagined.\n\n'We know that we will have shortcomings. Not all the chapels were systematically scanned. There are still areas of doubt,' Fromont said.\n\nPrice tag for the work is also an issue, and it is impossible at this stage to say 'how much this is going to cost, how long this is going to last,' said Michel Aupetit, the archbishop of Paris.\n\nPrivate individuals and, above all, rich French co-operations rushed to pledge hundreds of millions for the cathedral's reconstruction.\n\nThere were concerns whether this funding would ever be realised.\n\nBut France's richest man Bernard Arnault in September signed a formal accord over his pledge for \u00a3180 million ($220 million), as did the Pinault family for their promised \u00a390 million ($110 million).\n\nA signing on another \u00a390 million ($99.2 million) promised by the oil giant Total is expected in October.\n\nThe consortium of fundraising groups behind the drive believes that \u00a3720 million ($881 million) can be raised in total, with over \u00a3554 million ($678 million) now either transferred or pledged.\n\nLovers of the historic masterpiece, be they tourists, architecture buffs or worshippers, may have to wait some time before Notre-Dame becomes theirs again.\n\n'I have felt myself orphaned, it is like being in mourning,' said Michele Chevalier, 70, a regular at Notre-Dame who was at the service when the first evacuation took place.\n\n'I still manage to pray, but it's not the same.'", "description": "Paris's Notre Dame cathedral is facing a number of current and future difficulties in plans to rebuild the French capital's landmark", "authors": ["Dail Mail Online Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19533036-0-image-a-31_1570702413965.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
