Bush. \u201cI cannot see how any responsible investigation would not seek Bolton\u2019s appearance.\u201d\n\nBut he added that the White House would presumably \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight any effort to interview Mr. Bolton. \u201cIf the White House were to fight the House impeachment on executive privilege grounds, Bolton would be the hill on which to die,\u201d Mr. Yoo said. \u201cThe Trump White House could claim not just that the impeachment investigation is illegitimate, which is its current line of defense, but that it is defending the right of future presidents to have an effective White House and to conduct a successful foreign policy.\u201d\u2026\n\nThe president\u2019s defenders dismiss the idea that Mr. Bolton could hurt Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Bolton says,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of the president\u2019s, said on Fox News on Thursday. If the Ukrainians did not know the president had held up their aid when he was pressing them to investigate Democrats, Mr. Graham said, there is no impeachable offense. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a crime unless you have a victim. There is no victim here.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Msn.Com En-Us News Politics Waiting-For-Bolton-A-Capital-Speculates-On-What-He-Will-Say Ar-Aajowjh"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
