O\u2019Brien, President Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, has launched an initiative to right-size the National Security Council. This is not a Night of the Long Knives aimed at scores of potential anti-Trump whistleblowers, as anti-Trump paranoiacs have convinced themselves.\n\nThe goal of this NSC reform effort is to slice Obama-Biden\u2019s Big Government blubber that engulfed even the White House office that, since 1947, has furnished foreign-policy information and options to America\u2019s presidents.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS TURKEY'S INVASION OF SYRIA IS 'NOT OUR PROBLEM'; KURDS 'ARE NOT ANGELS'\n\nSoon after the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco, President John F. Kennedy inaugurated the fabled Situation Room and assigned its operation to the 12-member NSC staff. While President Jimmy Carter juggled an energy crisis, the Iran Hostage Crisis, and Soviet colonialism, he relied on just 35 NSC professionals.\n\nFast forward to Obama-Biden: NSC policy positions had grown to some 230 staffers. As an NSC official told me: \u201cThat number was so high that Congress stepped in and adopted legislation that required the NSC to limit its policy slots to under 200, or the position of NSC chief might be made subject to Senate confirmation.\u201d There were so many people in functional-area roles \u2014 such as coordinating defense, tracking WMDs, and tightening transportation and border security \u2014 that they were stepping on the toes of those in regional-focus posts, such as Asian and Latin American area specialists. Atop this internal duplication, Obama-Biden\u2019s NSC had begun to mirror positions at agencies outside the White House.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s recommendation \u2014 which President Donald Trump approved and assigned O\u2019Brien to implement \u2014 would reduce the NSC\u2019s policy-aide headcount from 178 today to 117, roughly the number who served with NSC chief Condoleezza Rice in the early 2000s, under President G.W. Bush. It seems logical that an NSC as large as it was when the Afghan and Iraq wars blazed should do just fine in the early 2020s, as those and other conflagrations cool down.\n\nThese departing staffers will not be given 10 minutes to clear their desks before being booted onto Pennsylvania Avenue. Au contraire. Through next January, these reductions will occur via attrition, in some cases. In most, professional staffers on loan from other agencies (e.g. the State Department, Pentagon, or CIA) will conclude their White House duties and then redeploy to their home offices, imbued with the knowledge and contacts they cultivated in the West Wing. Such inter-agency cross-pollenization should benefit the American people.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIt just ballooned into a massive bureaucracy over at the White House, under the last administration,\u201d O\u2019Brien told Fox Business Network\u2019s Lou Dobbs on October 10, in his first TV interview since departing State as special envoy for hostage affairs to helm the NSC. \u201cWe want to bring it back to historic levels. We think we can be more efficient, get rid of some of the bloat, and also better serve the president with that sort of a streamlined organization.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s plan to make the NSC great again already has earned the applause of security- and fiscal-affairs experts.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe problem with too many people in the NSC is that the staff starts to operationalize; they start doing things not coordinating and integrating,\u201d says Heritage Foundation foreign policy scholar James Jay Carafano. \u201cThe staff should be small,\u201d adds the 25-year U.S. Army veteran. \u201cIt should focus on the president\u2019s business. It should be primarily political with professional support staff as needed, like on technical issues.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cIn this case less IS more. The cuts are needed, and there will be immediate benefit in efficiency,\u201d predicts my London Center for Policy Research colleague, LCPR president Anthony A. Shaffer. The former Pentagon intelligence officer worked frequently with NSC staffers. He continues, \u201cBy empowering a small number of competent officers you actually increase the odds of important issues being put forth to the president and his key deputies on a timely basis.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cReducing the size of NSC staff to match contemporary national security priorities will help to eliminate duplication and should increase the effectiveness of its advice to the president,\u201d says Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste. \u201cReturning some detailed staff will enable federal agencies to restore some of their own foreign policy capabilities. Since NSC staffing is flexible, it can be reduced further or increased in the future, as needed.\u201d\n\nTo be as transparent as a display-room window, Robert O\u2019Brien has been a friend of mine since college. We met through the Bucks County, Pennsylvania-based Washington Crossing Foundation. Its scholarships eased O\u2019Brien through UCLA, yours truly through Georgetown, and have done likewise for hundreds of incoming college students who aspire to government service and revere the ideals of 1776.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn terms of presenting options to commander in chief Trump, O\u2019Brien has plenty on his to-do list, starting with security on the U.S./Mexico border, Chinese ambitions, North Korean denuclearization, Iranian non-nuclearization, and the immediately and desperately urgent need to contain, if not liquidate, imprisoned (and now escaping!) ISIS murderers in Syria.\n\nIronically, NSC chief Robert O\u2019Brien and his team might get more done with fewer hands on deck.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DEROY MURDOCK", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s quest for limited government has reached the White House Situation Room.", "authors": ["Deroy Murdock"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/OBrien-Trump-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
