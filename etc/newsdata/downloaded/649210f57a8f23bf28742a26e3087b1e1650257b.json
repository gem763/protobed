There is now a myriad of online resources used in UK schools. Particularly notable are some AI-powered platforms, which have been shown to improve exam results, but few studies on how they affect children in the long-term have been done. Are we holding our children back by our hesitation to adapt to these platforms, or are we putting them at risk by exposing them to powerful technologies without rigorous testing?\n\nThe Keys Federation Academy Trust has been rolling out Century Tech, an AI-powered teaching and learning platform, across their four primary schools. Every pupil starts using this online resource from age seven. Teachers use the system to assess students\u2019 abilities, pinpoint misconceptions and gaps in their knowledge, and identify their individual learning style. The Century software uses deep learning \u2013 a type of AI where machines learn by experience and acquire skills with minimal human involvement \u2013 to get to know each pupil so it can tailor content, including micro-lessons, called \u201cnuggets\u201d, to each student\u2019s needs.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to compare end-of-year results but the initial findings are very promising. Sharon Bruton, CEO of the trust, says schools have seen a 30 per cent increase in performance and students became faster at answering questions after using the platform, speeding up from 4.35 to 0.94 seconds. Additionally, the data shows that the more time the pupils spend on the platform, the higher their attainments. The system also helps to stretch higher achievers, as well as keeping absentees up to date.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn one academic year, more than a quarter of a million questions have been answered and automatically marked, saving teachers an average of six hours of work per week. Bruton says it gives the teachers far greater flexibility and helps children adapt to a world where they will need to learn through a variety of different formats.\n\nSally Naylor is a Year 6 class teacher at the trust and her pupils usually spend between 30 and 40 minutes (60 minutes maximum) per day on the Century platform.\n\n\u201cThere has been a huge increase in engagement from the pupils\u201d, she says. \u201cI sometimes use it at the start of a session to give them a short blast [of the topic] or at the end of the lesson to see how much they have learnt and to consolidate their learning. I also give them two nuggets as homework a week. It\u2019s been instrumental in getting the Year 6s ready for their SATs last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tailored to each child, and that really helps in the classroom. The children enjoy going on Century Tech, and it means we have more time for creativity in lessons. It\u2019s an absolutely fantastic tool and reduces the workload for the teacher.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He says: \u201cI like how I improve when I do the nuggets. It seems much easier afterwards, and I can do it with more confidence. It helps me to learn faster.\u201d Fiona Harrison, Charlie\u2019s mother, feels it gives her a much better insight into his progress and what he learns. She says \u201cit\u2019s like having a teaching assistant at home\u201d.\n\nScott Hayden is the digital innovation specialist for the Basingstoke College of Technology. He chose Century for the college because of its approach to teaching and learning and space for collaboration. It\u2019s used across the college, led by the teachers and only for a limited amount of time. Like Burton, he sees the value in an AI system that can \u201dfree\u201d teachers. Hayden says: \u201cIt\u2019s a great diagnostic tool and allows us to have more one-on-ones, to mentor, coach and empathise. It gives our staff more time to develop human skills, which can never be automated.\u201d\n\nKevin Stannard, director of innovation and learning at the Girls\u2019 Day School Trust, is also currently looking into integrating AI, but has a more cautious approach. \u201cThere is great potential for AI to break the log jam that exists around assessments, move towards adaptive testing, streamline admin and cater to different kinds of students,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf done right, it could be fantastically liberating and also help with what is often termed \u2018slow learning\u2019 or learning that is paced to the needs of individual learners and gives room for depth and reflection. But it\u2019s important to look at who is doing the development. Education should not be driven by commercial requirements.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThere is also the danger of deskilling the educational profession and other potential unintended consequences that are difficult to foresee.\u201d\n\nTech has changed the world as we know it \u2013 from the labour market to how we produce, consume and process the exploding amount of information available to us. With more and more work being automated, it\u2019s the human or, as they are often labelled, \u201csoft\u201d skills, such as empathy and creativity, that will become more important.\n\nIt gives our staff more time to develop human skills, which can never be automated\n\nAccording to the global consultancy McKinsey & Company, today\u2019s children will need to excel at social and emotional, technological, and higher cognitive skills to maximise their chances of getting work in the future. Yet schools operate very much like they have done for hundreds of years \u2013 one teacher in front of 30 pupils, imparting and testing knowledge. There is a debate about how education has to change to prepare our children for the world of tomorrow.\n\nRose Luckin, a professor at UCL, believes that not enough is being done to tackle current educational challenges. As a director of EDUCATE, the university\u2019s ed-tech research programme, she works with startups (including Century Tech), educators and academics to develop digital systems that are effective in teaching children, while still meeting ethical standards.\n\n\u201cWe need to side-step the rather unhelpful debate between knowledge and skills and think about it in terms of intelligence and learning,\u201d she says. \u201dThe real potential of AI is when we stop thinking of it as individual technologies. The real power lies in an intelligence infrastructure, combining masses of data, smart algorithms, processing power and memory, analysing students\u2019 actions and interactions with teachers, and when learning outside the classroom.\n\n\u201cThis could help teachers and students better understand how students learn, including their emotional and social intelligence. It\u2019s very holistic. If we get it right, an AI intelligence infrastructure will power all learning interactions with any technology or just with other people. It could also help us to develop a rich understanding of ourselves as an individual, as well as how to pull together with others and interact effectively, make good judgements and make sense out of our physical presence and experience of being in this world.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high and the potential so vast that a recent report by global intelligence platform HolonIQ predicts an explosion of innovation and investment in education, reaching $341bn (\u00a3275bn), by 2025, with China, the US and India taking the lead.\n\nChina is leading the way with AI development. In 2017, it announced their \u201cNext Generation AI\u201d strategy, which includes 1 trillion yuan (\u00a3113bn) investment, with a focus on AI-based STEM teaching to develop the next cohort of AI talent. Singapore is also heavily investing in AI in education and Flanders in Belgium has just signed a contract with Century Tech to integrate their learning platform into all 700 state-funded schools.\n\nThe UK is lagging far behind. In a recent report on the subject, the innovation foundation Nesta could identify only \u00a3112m of private investment since 2006 and only \u00a31m of public investment between 2014 and 2017.\n\nThe fact that AI for schools is largely driven by private companies causes some unease. Carl Honor\u00e9, author of Under Pressure: Putting the Child Back In Childhood and often referred to as the voice of the global Slow Movement, says: \u201cThere is clearly a lot of potential for this technology in education and, done right, it could be a beautiful thing, but we need to do our due diligence first.\n\n\u201cWith the first wave of technology for schools, there were some quite bold corporate messages piggybacking onto it and into the classroom. An online platform is less transparent than a printed curriculum, and that makes it much easier to smuggle in ideological messaging.\n\n\u201cThere is also the danger that it will be tainted by the prejudices of its makers, which have been shown to be reproduced in AI. The classroom should be a safe space, and the grubby hands of commerce and ideology should be kept at bay as much as possible. Education should be a public good, run by and for the public.\u201d\n\nThe classroom should be a safe space, and the grubby hands of commerce and ideology should be kept at bay as much as possible\n\nHis worries were reflected in a YouGov survey, commissioned by Nesta, which found that 78 per cent of parents would be worried about determinism (that an AI system would exercise an undue influence on their children\u2019s opinions and/or life choices), 73 per cent about data and security and privacy, 77 per cent about transparency and another 77 per cent about accountability.\n\nEvery expert and educator interviewed affirmed that software must never replace teachers and recognised the important work teachers did. They all considered them vital, not only to our children\u2019s learning but also teaching them the soft skills they\u2019ll need to thrive in their personal as well as working lives. In fact, for Priya Lakhani, founder and CEO of Century Tech, helping teachers was one of the biggest drivers behind the development of the platform. \u201cI see Century as a \u2018sidekick to the superhero, the teacher\u2019. I wanted to supercharge them to do what they do best, which is interacting with the pupils, teaching the soft skills and furthering their creativity.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no evidence for it, there is a risk that such a platform could be overused, especially in less than ideal circumstances. For example, a school that is under pressure to improve results or inexperienced teachers without the support they need may become over-reliant on the system at the cost of human interaction.\n\nRecent budget cuts have already forced schools to reduce their teaching staff. Could digital platforms accelerate this trend? Although Luckin is generally optimistic, she admits to sometimes seeing it as a dystopia nightmare, where only wealthy children are taught by actual teachers, and everybody else is plugged into screens, supervised by childminders.\n\nA truly intelligent AI would need to understand how engaging with this technology affects children\u2019s development, including when they\u2019re offline. The kind of intelligent infrastructure Luckin refers to would do this, but it\u2019s still some way off. In the meantime, we\u2019re only just beginning to understand how the use of digital technologies affects our brains.\n\nIf the learning for students is always frictionless, we\u2019re setting them up for failure because the real world is full of friction\n\nFor example, will optimally engaging pupils by calibrating the material they see, so that it is neither too easy nor too difficult, make everything else more tedious by comparison? We know that computer games aim to hit that sweet spot between effort and reward hijack our dopamine circuits. Will spending an increasing amount of time on such platforms lower our children\u2019s tolerance for boredom and frustration in general?\n\n\u201cAI promises a seamless, pain-free world without struggle or delay. But if the learning for students is always frictionless, we\u2019re setting them up for failure because the real world is full of friction,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. \u201dWhether it\u2019s human relationships or reading a profound book, so many things in life require us to push through some boredom or awkwardness or uncertainty before reaping the rewards.\u201d\n\nA now frequently cited study shows that the presence of a camera in the classroom causes children\u2019s learning to shift from being intrinsically to extrinsically motivated, meaning that rather than learning because they enjoy it, they learn because they are watched and/or praised. Being monitored by an AI system could have the same effect and negatively affect children at a young age, when they start to develop their sense of self.\n\nInterestingly, many of the people who have shaped our virtual world from Silicon Valley limit their children\u2019s screen time and send them to Steiner schools, where screens are only slowly introduced from age 10 or 11.\n\nFrances Russell, executive director of the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship, says that Steiner schools place as much importance on social and emotional development as academic achievement. \u201cFor us, a strong relationship between the pupil and the teacher is of central importance,\u201d she says. \u201dIn the early years, particularly, we believe that children learn most through hands-on experiences in the real world and only when they have an autonomous relationship with that world, do we introduce the virtual world. In this way, children are more likely to be in control of the technology than be controlled by it.\u201d\n\nThere are also leaders of mainstream schools who remain critical. Doug Lemov, author of Teach Like a Champion and managing director of Uncommon Schools, which runs 54 state-funded schools in the US, says: \u201cWe often rush to bring technology into schools because we see the potential benefits but are less attentive to the costs. A great deal of data is emerging to suggest that technology changes the ways we think \u2013 it fractures our concentration and, in offering constant distraction, literally rewires our brains.\n\n\u201cSchools are one of the last places where we can limit the presence of technology, making it one of the few places where we can cause people to sustain concentration or to listen carefully to one another without distraction. The question isn\u2019t whether technology can add value in schools, but whether it adds more than it takes away and whether it is more valuable than those humble, but deeply profound alternatives, many of which serve as checks upon the way technology is changing our cognitive patterns. And unfortunately once a technology has come in the door and become a part of an environment it\u2019s hard to get it back out.\u201d\n\nLuckin says there is an urgent need for more research, broader debate and the development of an ethical framework for technology in classrooms, as well as how education needs to change to shape the future.\n\nDoes she think we\u2019re asleep at the wheel? \u201cAt the wheel? We\u2019re not even in the car! We haven\u2019t even got up yet. We\u2019re still in bed, asleep with earplugs in and an eye mask on. We need to wake up!\u201d", "description": "In 2018, then education secretary Damian Hinds challenged the tech industry to launch an education revolution for schools to reduce the burden on teachers.
