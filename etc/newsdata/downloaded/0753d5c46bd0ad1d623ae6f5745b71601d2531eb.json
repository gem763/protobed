What can I say about that? I saw Ireland when they played in Denmark and they weren't that bad at all. It's down to how you find the team for your own opinion.\n\n'What is important tomorrow is these little decisions that we make that actually decide games, little intricacies. We know how Ireland will come towards us, so we've got to respond with more power and give our best, as we always do.'\n\nSwitzerland find themselves four points adrift of both Ireland, who drew 0-0 in Georgia at the weekend, and Denmark having played a game fewer, but that is due in large part to their tendency to concede late goals.\n\nThey led the Danes 3-0 with six minutes remaining in Basel in March, but only emerged with a point, and after David McGoldrick snatched a 1-1 draw for the Republic in Dublin with an 85th-minute header last month, Denmark's Yussuf Poulsen repeated the dose to inflict defeat on Saturday.\n\nPetkovic said: 'We have difficulties with late goals, yes, I can concede that. But we've got to look at ways that we can be really solid as a team and really compact and try and avoid these kind of situations, and I think with the team that we've got, we can certainly do that.'\n\nTuesday's game is of great importance in the run in for European Championship qualification\n\nPeter Schmeichel, father of Kasper, was heard dismissing the quality of the Ireland team\n\nSommer admitted his frustration at the costly errors which have blighted a campaign which could effectively leave them relying on the play-offs if they lose to Ireland.\n\nHe said: 'That's always a difficult situation and it's very difficult to analyse that. We're a good team and we knew straight from the start that this qualification was certainly not a walk in the park.\n\n'We've had really good performances in the last games and we have to continue to do so. Conceding goals in the last minutes is something we've obviously got to look at and work at, but at the moment, we have a solid team and I think that we'll be okay.'\n\nArsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka knows the price of failure against Mick McCarthy's men, but he too is confident that Switzerland can get the result they need at the Stade de Geneva.\n\nHe said: 'We always have pressure before any game. This is nothing new to us. We just have to win this game tomorrow, and that's what we're going to be aiming to do.'", "description": "He said: 'Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
