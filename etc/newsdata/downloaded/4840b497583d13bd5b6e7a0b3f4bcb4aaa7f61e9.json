Center Jonathan Davies created it with a brilliant backhand offload.\n\nEarlier in the second half, his younger brother James Davies got sin-binned on his World Cup debut at flanker.\n\nIt was a chaotic match.\n\nThe first half produced seven tries, but only three were given.\n\nReferee Jerome Garces referred five to video review, of which three were ruled out \u2014 two by Wales, one by Fiji.\n\nAnother try, scored by Fiji No. 8 Viliame Mata late in the half, didn't need the TMO because the forward pass to him was so evident.\n\nAdams crossed three times in the first half, but one got chalked off. So was a try by Wales flanker Josh Navidi disallowed.\n\nThe two Fiji first-half tries that counted went to right winger Josua Tuisova and fullback Kini Murimurivalu inside eight minutes, by which time Fiji scrumhalf Frank Lomani had one ruled out by TMO after a forward pass from left winger Semi Radradra.\n\nAdded to that, there were three first-half sinbins: Two for Fiji, after Wales hooker Ken Owens got his early on for dangerously launching Mata over his shoulder.\n\nThe restart saw the TMO used yet again, this time denying Radradra a try in the left corner because of a forward pass from Murimurivalu.\n\nMindful of needing four tries and a bonus point, Fiji stormed forward again and, after Wales flanker James Davies got the game's fourth yellow card, Fiji took a lineout and speared Wales with a huge driving maul for a penalty try.\n\nWales flyhalf Dan Biggar, who converted his side's first-half tries, went off for a head injury assessment during the new half. He also went off for an HIA during the 29-25 win against Australia, and was recently cleared to play this match.\n\nHis replacement, Rhys Patchell, booted over a long penalty to level the match with about 20 minutes remaining.\n\nTen minutes later, the elder Davies launched Adams into the left corner.\n\nTry, Mister Garces?\n\nYes, but only after another TMO confirmed Adams was in bounds.\n\nPatchell's conversion attempt missed.\n\nWhen Williams ran clear, the red-shirted Welsh hordes could finally roar with relief.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
