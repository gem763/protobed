Lois Frankel, Florida Democrat, raised around $107,000 during that same span toward her re-election campaign, meanwhile, according to FEC records.\n\n\u201cIn no uncertain terms, this race is on,\u201d Ms. Loomer said in a fundraising email Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I was shocked when the numbers came in. I knew we would do well against the competition, but I didn\u2019t expect to raise more than a four-term incumbent Democrat.\u201d\n\nMs. Frankel\u2019s campaign is hardly running low on funds, however. Her team reported having more than $1.1 million cash on hand as of Sept. 30, per FEC filings.\n\nNo other candidate running for Ms. Frankel\u2019s congressional seat came close to raising six figures last quarter. The campaigns for Republicans including Michael J. Bluemling, Christian F. Acosta and Aaron Scanlan each raked in roughly $20,000 or less during the same period, according to FEC records.\n\nMs. Loomer, 26, describes herself on her campaign website as a conservative investigative journalist and activist. She achieved notoriety in recent years due to a series of controversial comments and stunts that resulted in her banned from some of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies well before announcing her candidacy in early August.\n\nUber and Lyft each banned Ms. Loomer in 2017 after she loudly complained on social media about Muslims driving for either ride-share service; Twitter punted her from its platform last year after she used her account to attack Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat and one of the first Muslims elected to Congress; and Facebook booted her in May for being in violation of the company\u2019s rules against \u201cdangerous\u201d individuals and organization, resulting in her lawyers to file a federal defamation lawsuit seeking more than $3 billion in punitive damages from the social networking service.\n\nMs. Loomer handcuffed herself to Twitter\u2019s offices in New York after being banned last November, and in January she jumped the fence outside a home belonging to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, to protest her stance on immigration.\n\nMore recently, in March Ms. Loomer heckled reporters covering the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, before accordingly having her own press credentials revoked.\n\nMs. Frankel\u2019s campaign did not immediately return a message requesting comment. Her congressional district, Florida\u2019s 21st, includes Palm Beach and the surrounding area.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
