a 24,867% increase\n\nThe research found that original Cabbage Patch Kids from 1978 are now worth substantially more, with the dolls being sold online for a massive \u00a32,109.88.\n\nThey were initially sold for \u00a320.29, which was still a fair amount of money at the time, giving a huge increase of 10,300 per cent.\n\nAnother iconic toy that is still popular with children today is Barbie and vintage dolls have seen the second highest percentage increase after the Hot Wheels cars.\n\nAn original Barbie that cost the equivalent of \u00a32.43 in 1959 could now set you back \u00a3607.81 \u2013 a 24,867 per cent increase.\n\nOther nostalgic favourites include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures which saw the fourth highest percentage increase.\n\nThe toys, which hit shelves in 1980 for \u00a34.87, could now be bought for \u00a3350 \u2013 a 7,089 percentage increase.\n\nDolls: Cabbage Patch Kids, similar to this, are now worth the most out of all the toys, selling for \u00a32,109.88\n\nTOP TEN TOYS WITH HIGHEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE Rank Toy Original Cost Cost now (%) Increase (\u00a3) Increase Year 1 Hot Wheels \u00a30.48 \u00a3434.36 90625% \u00a3433.88 1968 2 Barbie \u00a32.43 \u00a3607.81 24867% \u00a3605.38 1959 3 Cabbage Patch Kids \u00a320.29 \u00a32,109.88 10300% \u00a32,089.59 1978 4 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Action Figures \u00a34.87 \u00a3350.00 7089% \u00a3345.13 1980 5 Rainbow Brite Doll \u00a35.68 \u00a3385.18 6681% \u00a3379.50 1980 6 Transformer action figures \u00a316.23 \u00a3850.00 5137% \u00a3833.77 1980 7 Vintage care bear dolls \u00a31.62 \u00a381.09 4896% \u00a379.47 1980 8 Monopoly \u00a31.62 \u00a355.99 3350% \u00a354.37 1933 9 Polly pocket \u00a312.17 \u00a3349.99 2775% \u00a3337.82 1980 10 G.I Joe Breaker Action Figure \u00a39.74 \u00a3249.99 2467% \u00a3240.25 1982 Source: Liberty Games\n\nRainbow Brite Dolls, also introduced in 1980, are selling for \u00a3385.18.\n\nThis means the brightly coloured dolls are now worth 6681 per cent more than their original price of \u00a35.68.\n\nTransformer action figures from 1980 came sixth on the list, originally priced at just \u00a316.23, the toys can now be bought online for a staggering \u00a3850 - a 5,137 per cent increase in cost.\n\nVintage Care Bear dolls, that could be bought for \u00a31.62 in 1980, are now available to buy for \u00a381.09 - a mighty increase of 4,896 per cent.\n\nCare Bears, similar to this, that were sold for \u00a31.62 in 1980 are now available online to buy for \u00a381.09\n\nMonopoly board games from 1933 - a game that more than 80 years later is still the cause of many a family argument - are also now worth \u00a355.99.\n\nAs the original sets were initially sold for the equivalent of \u00a31.62, this is a huge increase of 3,350 per cent.\n\nA Polly Pocket from 1980, which could be bought for \u00a312.17 at the time, can now be bought for \u00a3349.99 - an increase of 2,275 per cent.\n\nChana Baram, retail analyst at Mintel, said: 'On average, 57 per cent of toy buyers said that they like to buy toys for their child that they also played with.\n\n'Toys such as Polly Pocket are experiencing a resurgence. Mattel reintroduced Polly Pocket several years ago, but in a much larger size so the dolls were missing their original charm.\n\n'However, it has been reported that the original sized Polly Pockets, which were initially released in 1989, will be available from the summer of 2019 in time for its 30th birthday.'\n\nThe toy that made the list with the lowest return on investment is the 1982 G.I Joe Breaker action figure which could be bought for \u00a39.74 but are now worth \u00a3249.99.\n\nThis is still a huge increase of 2,467 per cent, however.\n\nAn original Monopoly board from 1933, similar to this, can now fetch up to \u00a355.99 online - a 3350% increase\n\nStuart Kerr, of Liberty Games, said: 'This research has really brought on a feeling of nostalgia, with all of these classic toys being worth considerably more these days than when they were originally on sale.\n\n'With some of these toys dating back as far as 1927, certain models or prototypes of these popular toys (some of which may be now discontinued) are worth a lot in the eyes of collectors and fans due to their rarity.\n\n'The toys that have emerged as having the highest return of investment have been global successes, with dolls such as Barbie, or the Cabbage Patch Kids, being adored by children all over the world.'\n\nPolly Pocket has long been a favourite toy and a toy similar to this has increased in value by 2,275% since 1980\n\nWhy do people buy old toys?\n\nThere are many reasons why people decide to buy old or collectible toys. Some people like collecting rare and unusual items, whilst others purchase them so they can sell the items in the future after their value increases.\n\nFor many others, purchasing a toy from a bygone era is for nostalgic reasons - they likely had a similar one as a child and it brings them happy memories.\n\nRichard Beale, a valuer at Warwick and Warwick, an auctioneer of collectables said: 'People usually buy old toys as there is a connection with them and the collectors will have had them as a child.\n\n'There comes a point where people have paid off their mortgage, their children have left home and then they find they have money in their pocket.\n\n'These people will then buy the toys in nice conditions and pay good money for them. It can be a little bit of an obsession to be honest. There is the thrill of the chase.\n\n'If they buy things in nice condition, the collector will keep them and won't get them out the box and play with them. People like to build collections and there will always be something else you need for a collection.'", "description": "Those who still have their old toys stashed away in the attic could be in luck as  they could now be worth much more than they cost new, research has revealed.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
