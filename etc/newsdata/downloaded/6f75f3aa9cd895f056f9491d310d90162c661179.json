Trump's head is superimposed on the body of the film's star, Colin Firth, who goes on to kill the parishioners who are depicted as media entities\n\nThe graphic clip shows Trump shooting and stabbing the parishioners as well as prominent Democrats and media personalities\n\nSanders and an individual close to Don Jr told the Times that they did not see the video in question.\n\n'I was there to speak at a prayer breakfast, where I spoke about unity and bringing the country together,' Sanders told the Times.\n\n'I wasn't aware of any video, nor do I support violence of any kind against anyone.'\n\nDeSantis has yet to comment on the matter.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump's re-election campaign, Tim Murtaugh, said he knew nothing about the video.\n\n'That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,' said Murtaugh.\n\nThe video, which is being circulated on the internet by Trump supporters, is an edited version of the church massacre scene from the 2014 dark comedy film Kingsman: The Secret Service, starring Colin Firth.\n\nIt shows Trump's head superimposed on Firth's body as he walks into 'the church of fake news,' where the congregants represent major American news outlets like NBC, National Public Radio, Huffington Post, Politico, Vox, Vice News, The Hill, BuzzFeed News, and others.\n\nTrump then goes on a killing rampage, using a gun and spear to shoot and stab the parishioners.\n\nThe event at Trump's resort in Miami was attended by former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (left); Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (center); and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr (right)\n\nA spokesperson for Trump's re-election campaign says the campaign had nothing to do with the clip. The Trump National Doral Miami is seen in the above stock image\n\nAmong the victims - aside from 'fake news' - are prominent Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Barack Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and others.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, a Republican who has frequently criticized Trump, is also one of Trump's 'victims.'\n\nOther Trump 'enemies' who are shown as victims include MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, actor Rosie O'Donnell, and financier George Soros.\n\nThe Times reported that one of the people in attendance at the conference recorded the showing with a cell phone.\n\nThat person then asked an intermediary to send the clip to a Times reporter.\n\nAn organizer of the event told the Times that the video was shown as part of a 'meme exhibit.'\n\n'Content was submitted by third parties and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity,' said the organizer, Alex Phillips.\n\n'American Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech.\n\n'This matter is under review.'\n\nIn July 2017, Trump posted a tweet showing himself wrestling an opponent whose head was covered with the CNN logo\n\nSince his successful campaign for president, Trump has rallied his supporters against the news media, particularly outlets that he considers 'fake news.'\n\nIn July 2017, Trump sparked outrage when he tweeted a clip showing him wrestling an opponent representing CNN.\n\nThe video appeared to be a modified version of a 2007 appearance by Trump at World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania 23 promotion, in which Trump 'takes down' WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. In Sunday's video, McMahon's head has been replaced with the CNN logo.\n\nAfter Trump appears to beat on the CNN effigy, a logo, 'FNN Fraud News Network' appears at the bottom of the screen in script similar to that of CNN.", "description": "The disturbing display took place at the Trump National Doral Miami last week, which was the site of a three-day conference held by a pro-Trump organization called American Priority.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/03/19673596-0-image-a-32_1571018593822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
