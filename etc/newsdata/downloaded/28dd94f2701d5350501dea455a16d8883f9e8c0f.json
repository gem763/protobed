The squad has approached the game well with real maturity.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s return means Tuilagi moving back to outside-centre at the expense of Henry Slade, who drops to the bench for the Yokohama clash.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe only other change to the 23 sees Mark Wilson come onto the bench in place of Lewis Ludlam against a New Zealand side who have bolstered their lineout winning capability by moving lock Scott Barrett at flanker for the first time in place of Sam Cane.\n\nEngland starting XV\n\n15 Elliot Daly (Saracens, 37 caps), 14 Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby, 40 caps), 13 Manu Tuilagi (Leicester Tigers, 38 caps), 12 Owen Farrell (Saracens, 77 caps) C, 11 Jonny May (Leicester Tigers, 50 caps), 10 George Ford (Leicester Tigers, 63 caps), 9 Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers, 93 caps), 1 Mako Vunipola (Saracens, 56 caps), 2 Jamie George (Saracens, 43 caps), 3 Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins, 29 caps), 4 Maro Itoje (Saracens, 32 caps), 5 Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints, 79 caps), 6 Tom Curry (Sale Sharks, 17 caps), 7 Sam Underhill (Bath Rugby, 13 caps), 8 Billy Vunipola (Saracens, 49 caps)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nFinishers: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs, 19 caps), 17 Joe Marler (Harlequins, 66 caps), 18 Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers, 93 caps), 19 George Kruis (Saracens, 39 caps), 20 Mark Wilson (Sale Sharks 16 caps), 21 Willi Heinz (Gloucester Rugby, 8 caps), 22 Henry Slade (Exeter Chiefs, 25 caps), 23 Jonathan Joseph (Bath Rugby, 45 caps)\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett; Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge; Richie Mo'unga, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Nepo Laulala, Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Scott Barrett, Ardie Savea, Kieran Read (capt).\n\nReplacements: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Angus Ta'avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Sam Cane, TJ Perenara, Sonny Bill Williams, Jordie Barrett.", "description": "The Red Rose take part in their first World Cup semi-final since 2007 against the All Blacks in Yokohama on Saturday", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712146.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rugby-World-Cup-England-Training.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
