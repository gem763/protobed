Kraus said he intended to fire him, but Dean tendered his resignation before they met.\n\nDean, who was hired by the department in August 2017, may face criminal charges. Kraus said he expects a \u201csubstantial update\u201d on the criminal case no later than Tuesday. Police have also presented a preliminary case to the FBI for possible civil rights violations, he said.\n\n\u201cNone of this information can ease the pain of Atatiana\u2019s family, but I hope it shows the community that we take these incidents seriously,\u201d the police chief said.\n\nOfficials said Dean, who is white, shot Jefferson though a window of her home around 2:30 a.m. Saturday. He and several other officers showed up to the house minutes after a neighbor called the police department\u2019s nonemergency line to express concern over the house\u2019s front door being open and lights being on.\n\nBody camera video released Saturday shows Dean entering the backyard of the house, turning left, suddenly grabbing for his gun and pointing it at the window.\n\n\u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d he can be heard shouting before immediately firing one round through the screen window.\n\nThe officers then entered the house and provided emergency medical care to Jefferson, but police said she died at the scene. There\u2019s no indication the officers identified themselves to Jefferson or knocked on the front door of the house before the shooting, officials said.\n\nJefferson had been playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew moments before she was killed, according to Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney representing the family. Jefferson went to the window when she heard a noise outside and was shot, Merritt said. He said her nephew was in the room at the time and watched her fall to the ground.\n\n(Photo: CBS Chicago) More\n\nDean was served a written administrative complaint the following day, placed on administrative leave and stripped of his badge and firearm, Kraus said Monday.\n\n\u201cHad the officer not resigned, I would have fired him for violations of several policies, including our use of force policy, our deescalation policy and unprofessional conduct,\u201d he said during the news conference.\n\nState licensing paperwork will also reflect that Dean was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the force, Kraus said.\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price said during the news conference Monday that city leadership is moving to bring in a panel of national experts to review the police department.\n\n\u201cJustice is critical here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know we cannot bring back this young woman who was taken all too soon. But this is a pivotal moment for a city that will and can come together.\u201d\n\nPrice condemned the Fort Worth Police Department for releasing still images from body camera footage that showed a firearm the officers found inside Jefferson\u2019s home the night of the shooting.\n\nKraus said the department was following protocol by releasing the images to show what responding officers could have perceived as a threat. But he also said he regretted having released them.", "description": "Police have identified the officer as Aaron Dean, and officials said he may face criminal charges.", "authors": ["Hayley Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F1E0queTF6cIuPQLJYoHlg--~B/aD00MDI7dz00MDE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da4b76620000069055008aa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
