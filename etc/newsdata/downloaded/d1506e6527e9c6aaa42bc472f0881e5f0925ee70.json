The company debuted a trio of new smartphones, including the $699 iPhone 11, the $999 iPhone 11 Pro and the $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max. All three devices appear similar to their predecessors, but Apple has upgraded their respective camera systems to allow for wide-angle photos, while making improvements under the hood that result in a longer battery life and faster performance than before. Apple also rolled out the Watch Series 5, which starts at $399 and features a new always-on display. Even so, the device is able to maintain 18-hour battery life, which is possible due to an OLED display technology that was specially created by Apple. Prior to that, the company unexpectedly announced a new seventh-generation iPad, which is priced at $329 and includes a 10.2-inch display. In addition to new hardware, Apple also revealed launch dates and pricing for its much-anticipated Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade subscription services. Both services cost $4.99 per month, which undercuts competitors like Disney's streaming platform, Disney+, and Google's cloud gaming service, Stadia.
