Their mum, too. Alisson returns for Liverpool on Sunday after suffering a calf injury on the opening day of the season. His older sibling, Muriel, who plays for Fluminense back in Brazil, will be tuning in, nervously, recalling the days when, as boys, they pushed each other to sporting success.\n\nAll the Becker brothers needed then was the car park at their grandma\u2019s house in Novo Hamburgo, on the outskirts of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil. That, and a ball, of course, though often that was put to one side, explains Muriel, at 32 the elder by five years.\n\n\u201cOur grandma\u2019s carpark gate was the first goal we defended. To make things more equal, only he could use the hands to make the saves, but I was allowed to do it only with my body. We also played our own game we used to call \u2018carrion\u2019. The guy without the ball was allowed to kick the other freely, so showboating was not a good idea. There were tough tackles from me, but he couldn\u2019t care less. He responded in the same way, very bravely.\u201d\n\nAlisson is back after being injured in the 4-1 win over Norwich. While Adrian has proved an unexpected and capable deputy, the Brazilian\u2019s return is a boost for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men as they chase an 18th successive Premier League victory, against Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n\nMuriel, for one, can\u2019t wait. He takes pride in his brother\u2019s successes \u2013 his performances the key difference in Liverpool\u2019s fortunes last season as they won the Champions League \u2013 and his role in them. The Fluminense keeper helped to toughen him up as a boy \u2013 and paid the price when his younger brother leapfrogged him at Internacional.", "description": "They are brothers in arms, members of the goalkeeping fraternity, like their father before them.", "authors": ["Caio Carrieri"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213393999-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO6QpIblidqHYceykOFBymPkybjDKrBxT-REfHKMH01Y.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
