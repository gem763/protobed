William G. Kaelin Jr. of Harvard University, Gregg L. Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter J. Ratcliffe at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain and Oxford University won the prize for advances in physiology or medicine.\n\nThe scientists, who worked largely independently, will share the 9 million kronor ($918,000) cash award, said the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\n\nThey \u201crevealed the mechanism for one of life\u2019s most essential adaptive processes,\u201d the Nobel committee said.\n\nCells can encounter lowered oxygen not only from situations like living at high altitudes, but also from things like a wound that interferes with local blood supply. Their response triggers reactions that include producing red blood cells, generating new blood vessels and fine-tuning the immune system.\n\nThe Nobel committee said scientists are focused on developing drugs that can treat diseases by either activating or suppressing the oxygen-sensing machinery. Such manipulation could help in attacking cancer cells, experts said.\n\nAnother payoff is pills to boost production of red blood cells in anemia, which can appear in people with chronic kidney disease. One such drug has been approved in China and Japan and a filing for approval in the U.S. is expected soon, Kaelin said.\n\nStill other potential targets include heart attack and stroke, and a condition of reduced blood flow in the limbs that can lead to amputation, the researchers said.\n\nKaelin, 61, said he was half-asleep when the phone rang Monday morning with the news of his award.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually get phone calls at 5:00 in the morning, so, naturally, my heart started racing and I could see the call was from Stockholm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think at that point I almost had an out-of-body type of experience.\u201d\n\nKaelin is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports AP\u2019s Health and Science department.\n\nRatcliffe, 65, said he learned the news after he was summoned out of a meeting this morning by his secretary, who had \u201ca look of urgency.\u201d\n\nTrained as a kidney specialist, Ratcliffe said his research began when he and colleagues simply wanted to figure out how cells sense oxygen.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a definable problem and just thought we\u2019d find out how it worked,\u201d he said. It was about two years into their research program, which began in 1990, that they realized the discovery had much wider significance, Ratcliffe said.\n\n\u201cWe saw that it wasn\u2019t just cells in the kidney that know how to sense oxygen, but all cells in the body. \u2026 There are hundreds and thousands of processes the body uses to adapt to and regulate its oxygen levels.\u201d\n\nHe said while some promising drugs have been developed, it will be years before it\u2019s clear whether such discoveries are going to change the lives of tens of thousands.\n\nIn Baltimore, Semenza, 63, said he slept through the Nobel committee\u2019s initial phone call. \u201cBy the time I got to the phone it was too late,\u201d he said. He went back to sleep but was able to answer the second call from Stockholm.\n\nHe said kidney cancer may be the first malignancy in which a drug based on the prize-winning work might make chemotherapy more effective, and that he hopes many other cancers will follow.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Medicine, Semenza paid tribute to his biology teacher, Rose Nelson, at Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., for inspiring his pursuit of medicine.\n\n\u201cShe used to say, \u2018Now when you win your Nobel Prize, I don\u2019t want you to forget that you learned that here,'\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my great sadness that she is not still alive to share the moment because I know it would have meant a lot to her. She was my inspiration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the importance of teachers,\u201d he added. \u201cTo make that kind of spark.\u201d\n\nSteven McKnight of the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas noted that the process discovered by the three researchers is widespread in the animal kingdom, found even in the worm. He said the honored work is \u201cof a heroic nature.\u201d\n\nLast year, James Allison of the United States and Tasuku Honjo of Japan won the 2018 Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work in immunotherapy, activating the body\u2019s natural defense system to fight tumors.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement kicked off this year\u2019s Nobel Prizes. The physics prize will be handed out Tuesday, followed by the chemistry prize on Wednesday. This year there is a double-header for the Nobel Literature Prize \u2014 one each for 2018 and 2019 \u2014 which will be awarded Thursday. The Peace Prize will be announced on Friday.\n\nThe 2018 Nobel Literature prize was suspended after a sex abuse scandal rocked the Swedish Academy, the body that awards the literature prizes, so two prizes are being awarded this year.\n\nThe economics prize will be awarded next Monday. Officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, it wasn\u2019t created by Nobel, but by Riksbanken, Sweden\u2019s central bank, in 1968.\n\nThe laureates will receive their awards at elegant ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on the 2019 Nobel Prizes by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes\n\n___\n\nCheng reported from London.
