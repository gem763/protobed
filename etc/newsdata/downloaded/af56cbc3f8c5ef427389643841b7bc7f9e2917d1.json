Lomu scored the most tries in back-to-back World Cups in 1995 and 1999, while Habana burst onto the world stage at the 2007 World Cup in France, leading the tournament with eight tries on the way to the Springboks\u2019 second World Cup title.\n\nIn terms of points, England's Owen Farrell is the favourite to head the charts, followed by South Africa's fly-half Handr\u00e9 Pollard. New Zealand's ploy of using dual playmakers and kickers is reflected by both Richie Mo'unga and Beauden Barrett also favoured to score heavily.\n\nGrant Fox holds the record for the number of points scored in a single World Cup after reaching 126 in the inaugural tournament in 1987. The next best is Jonny Wilkinson from England's World Cup winning campaign in 2003 with 113 points.\n\nDaniel Levitt", "description": "Sevu Reece? Cheslin Kolbe? Owen Farrell?
