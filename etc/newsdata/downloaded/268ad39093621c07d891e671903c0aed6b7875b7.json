They\u2019re Wrong.", "language": "en", "text": "Nancy Pelosi can control the procedures leading up to articles of impeachment as she and her caucus see fit. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLong before Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that House Democrats were undertaking formal impeachment proceedings, Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler characterized his own investigations of the president and his administration as already constituting an impeachment inquiry, as I noted a couple of months ago:\n\nHis position is now clearly that his committee is already \u201cinquiring\u201d into impeachment, and should it decide to adopt articles of impeachment, you could conclude that the \u201cproceedings\u201d began some time ago \u2026\n\n[A]ccording to this interpretation of the situation, there\u2019s no need to \u201claunch\u201d anything, or to put House Democrats on the spot with some vote to begin \u201cproceedings\u201d that are already underway.\n\nHouse Republicans, knowing that House Democrats were divided on the subject of impeachment, immediately began caterwauling that you can\u2019t move toward a possible impeachment without a formal vote to launch an inquiry. However, while House rules explain how the chamber can initiate impeachment proceedings with a vote, the Constitution does not require any vote prior to formal adoption of articles of impeachment. Furthermore, House rules are totally subject to the will of the House majority at any given moment.\n\nThe federal courts are not about to intervene and dispute Nancy Pelosi\u2019s interpretations of these rules, now that she has confirmed Nadler\u2019s judgment that an impeachment inquiry is already underway. And while Republicans accurately note that a vote to begin impeachment proceedings was taken before the Judiciary Committee moved against Nixon and Clinton, legal experts note that has not been the case with other impeachments.\n\nStill, Republicans from sea to shining sea continue to claim a formal vote to begin an inquiry is necessary, and the claim has become part of the White House\u2019s argument that constitutionally sanctioned impeachment proceedings are somehow \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d making its compliance with subpoenas or any other cooperation unnecessary.\n\nAnd while the original GOP motive for insisting on this entirely optional vote may have been to expose Democratic divisions, that\u2019s rather moot now, with all but eight Democratic House members publicly on record favoring impeachment proceedings, supported by a majority of the public and the vast majority of rank-and-file Democrats. Now the claim is intimately associated with the president\u2019s efforts to delegitimize impeachment, and there is no reason to credit its sincerity, as Molly Claflin of Just Security observes:\n\nThere is no indication that the White House would comply with a congressional investigation \u2014 with or without a formal vote. Time and time again we have seen the contempt with which this White House views congressional oversight. (As Trump has said: \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want people testifying.\u201d) The insistence on a vote is likely no more than another delay tactic to give the White House time to come up with another excuse. The list of grievances in the intemperate 8-page letter by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone on Tuesday is further proof, if anyone needed it, that the demand for a vote is a placeholder for other reasons the administration will provide as a basis for further stonewalling the impeachment process.\n\nAs it happens, Pelosi told the editorial board of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution yesterday that a vote to formalize impeachment proceedings could still happen, if and when her caucus deems it necessary and appropriate:\n\nPelosi also rejected Trump\u2019s demand on Friday for a formal House vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, after the president said his administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the probe without a vote.\n\n\u201cIf we want to do it, we\u2019ll do it. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. But we\u2019re certainly not going to do it because of the president,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for a person to ask a foreign government to interfere in our election, and the president is doing it in full view \u2014 and in defiance of what our Founders had in mind.\u201d\n\nPelosi may choose to pursue a formal vote to define the scope of impeachment proceedings \u2014 along with the procedural protections that will be accorded to the president and his allies \u2014 once the Ukraine investigation has taken its course, and other committees investigating the administration recommend (or don\u2019t) other possible grounds for impeachment. Any way you slice it, though, impeachment and its procedures are entirely the creature of the House majority: It can adopt articles of impeachment, if it wishes, without a single hearing. There are no formal consequences for the president, after all, until his Senate trial. Lucky for him, that chamber is controlled by his party. All the complaints about \u201cwitch hunts\u201d and the alleged persecution of this law-abiding, Greatest President Ever can be aired fully in the Senate if the case for his removal gets that far.", "description": "As part of the Trump White House\u2019s campaign to delegitimize impeachment, Republicans keep making the bogus claim that a formal vote is required to begin impeachment proceedings.
