She asked if he would want to take pictures of the gingerbread man in Iraq, according to Sandra Mosley, the woman's sister-in-law and mother of a student in David Emanuel Academy's kindergarten class.\n\n\"He did better than that,\" Mosley recalled of Buggs. \"He wrote a whole story about how the gingerbread man had stolen a camel\u2019s water and how important water was to the region and how hot it was even there. He just went above and beyond.\"\n\n\"Maybe a month or so after all of that he emailed me and asked how the project came out and I told him it was great and that the students really enjoyed the story of the camel,\" she said. \"Then he asked for their names and he had flags flown in Iraq for each of them and he sent those to all the kids.\"\n\nThe act by Buggs was such a big deal that a photo of the students holding their American flags was published in the local newspaper. It also started a pen pal relationship that has lasted for more than a decade.\n\nDavid Emanuel Academy\n\nThe class of 13 students began sending Buggs notes and care packages. Buggs sent the students notes and treats from wherever he was stationed around the world over the years.\n\n\"I remember he would always send Kinder chocolates and that was so exciting,\" said Jenna Mosley, the now-17-year-old daughter of Sandra Mosley.\n\nFor Buggs, the notes and care packages from the students meant even more to him, helping him get through his hardest days in Iraq.\n\n\"They were just probably doing a school project but it meant so much to me,\" Buggs said. \"When you\u2019re sitting in your [bunker] by yourself and you\u2019ve been deployed a few months and the loneliness is there, the letters from home, you get them and it changes your perspective of what you\u2019re dealing with.\"\n\n\"Your mind forgets what\u2019s going on around you and have tunnel vision going through these letters,\" he said.\n\nI will surprise this group of Seniors this morning.
