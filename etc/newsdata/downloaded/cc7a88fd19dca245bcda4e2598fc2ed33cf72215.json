A victory in Prague would have secured a spot for England at the finals with three games to go.\n\nInstead, England squandered a one-goal lead and lost its first match in European or World Cup qualifying since falling to Ukraine in 2009. That loss came with England already qualified for the 2010 World Cup. Its last meaningful defeat in qualifying was against Croatia in 2007.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play well enough, simple as that,\u201d said Southgate.\n\nCaptain Harry Kane gave England the lead in the fifth minute from the penalty spot.\n\nBut Jakub Brabec leveled for the Czechs four minutes later and substitute Zdenek Ondrasek completed the comeback late with his first international goal. He scored with a low right-foot shot from inside the area.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to hit the ball right and put it in the net,\u201d said Ondrasek, who plays for FC Dallas. \u201cI saw tears in the eyes of my father probably for the first time in my life. It\u2019s a great win and great feeling.\u201d\n\nEngland had won all four of its previous games in Group A. It is tied atop the standings with the Czechs on 12 points but has one more game to play. Group strugglers Bulgaria and Montenegro drew 0-0.\n\nTop-ranked Belgium became the first team to qualify for next year\u2019s tournament on Thursday.\n\nThe top two teams of each group advance automatically. The other four qualifiers will come through four tiers of playoffs in March.\n\nPORTUGAL ROLLS ON\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored his 94th goal for Portugal to help the defending European champions brush aside Luxembourg 3-0 in Lisbon.\n\nRonaldo pounced on a bad pass near the area and chipped the goalkeeper in the 65th.\n\nBernardo Silva put Portugal in control from the 16th. With Portugal 2-0 ahead, substitute Goncalo Guedes added a third goal.\n\nUkraine kept its lead of Group B after midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi scored twice in a 2-0 victory over Lithuania.\n\nUnbeaten Ukraine has 16 points. Portugal has 11, ahead of Serbia with seven. Both Portugal and Serbia have one more game to play than Ukraine.\n\nPortugal plays at Ukraine on Monday.\n\nFRANCE ON PACE\n\nWorld champion France and Turkey both took big steps in qualifying with wins which consolidated their Group H lead.\n\nOlivier Giroud scored to help France earn a hard-fought 1-0 win at Iceland, while Turkey needed a 90th-minute goal from Cenk Tosun to push it past Albania 1-0 in Istanbul.\n\nBoth France and Turkey have 18 points. Iceland, the revelation of Euro 2016, is in third place with 12 points and at risk of missing the 2020 edition.\n\nFrance hosts Turkey at Stade de France on Monday.\n\nGiroud converted a penalty in the 66th after a foul earned by Antoine Griezmann. Giroud set up Griezmann by heading down a long ball for his fellow forward, who was then fouled by Iceland\u2019s Ari Freyr Skulason.\n\nFrance midfielder N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 was ruled out of the match reportedly for a hamstring problem.\n\nIt was game No. 200 for Didier Deschamps as player and now coach of France. He played 103 games for France and has directed 97 from the dugout.\n\nSteve Mandanda played in goal for France in place of Hugo Lloris, who is out with a broken elbow.\n\nFIRST WIN\n\nAndorra made history of its own in Group H with a 1-0 win over Moldova, the first time the tiny mountainous nation had avoided defeat in 57 European qualifiers.\n\nMidfielder Marc Vales headed in the Andorran goal in the 63rd after Moldova had been reduced to 10 men.\n\nAndorra, with fewer than 80,000 residents nestled in the Pyrenees between Spain and France, had lost all 56 of its previous games in European qualifying.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It was a night of European soccer to forget for England, and one to remember for Andorra.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/czech_republic_england_euro_2020_soccer_10457_c0-243-3630-2360_s1200x700.jpg?75fe338a1fea224eae6de675032131a657750268", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
