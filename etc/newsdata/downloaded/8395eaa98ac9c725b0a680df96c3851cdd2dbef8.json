Some soiled themselves. Others clung on desperately to those around them, paralyzed by fear.\n\n\u2018I felt like an animal going to the slaughterhouse,\u2019 victim Jennifer Brown Hyde, who was nine-years-old at the time, told CBS for its up-coming 48 Hours special, Live to Tell: The Chowchilla Kidnapping.\n\nSimilarly Larry Park said he sat in the darkness \u2018wondering how it was going to feel to die\u2019.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never been in darkness like that before it was just pitch black like the dark was touching me \u2013 like I was inhaling the darkness,\u2019 he continued.\n\nThe older children among the group sang songs to offer comfort to the youngest and most frightened, opting for renditions of \u2018Boogie Nights\u2019, \u2018Love Will Keep Us Together\u2019 and \u2018If You're Happy and You Know it Clap Your Hands.\u2019\n\nBut the sing-a-longs came to a sobering halt when the vans came to a stop at a rock quarry near Livermore, where the captors forced Ray and the children down into a buried trailer stocked with mattresses, a small amount of food and water, and ventilation fans.\n\n\u2018I felt like an animal going to the slaughterhouse,\u2019 victim Jennifer Brown Hyde, who was nine-years-old at the time, told CBS for its up-coming 48 Hours special, Live to Tell: The Chowchilla Kidnapping\n\nThe kidnappers loaded Ray and the children, all aged between five and 14, into two vans before abandoning the school bus\n\nSimilarly Larry Park said he sat in the darkness \u2018wondering how it was going to feel to die\u2019. \u2018I\u2019ve never been in darkness like that before it was just pitch black like the dark was touching me \u2013 like I was inhaling the darkness,\u2019 he continued.\n\nThe vans came to a stop at a rock quarry near Livermore, where the captors forced Ray and the children down into a buried trailer stocked with mattresses, a small amount of food and water, and ventilation fans\n\nLarge cases of water lined the tomb's interior. The victims had no idea how long they'd be trapped for - or if any of them would ever make it out alive\n\nThe kidnappers made each of the children give their names and hand over a piece of clothing, and then climb down a ladder into the van, buried more than 12-feet below the ground.\n\nWhen the last of the children was inside, Woods and the Schoenfeld brothers began shoveling dirt over the roof, weighing down the hatch-door by placing two 100-pound industrial batteries on top of it.\n\n\u2018I remember it just went dark,\u2019 survivor Michael Marshall, then 14, said. \u2018And then you just hear the material getting thrown on us\u2026we were being buried alive.\u2019\n\nThe children started screaming. One even fainted. And despite trying to comfort the group, Ray himself was reduced to tears, convinced the roof of the truck was going to cave in at any minute.\n\n\u2018[We were] just screaming and crying,\u2019 Park recounted for CBS. \u2018The sides of the van were bowing in\u2026 I knew that I was going to die. I knew it.\u2019\n\nOne of the oldest children among the group, Marshall said the thing that made him cry the most was not being able to say goodbye to his mom, certain that death was awaiting him.\n\n\u2018[I was] remembering the last time that I saw her and wishing I could have told her goodbye,\u2019 Marshall told the network, holding back tears.\n\nThough their victims had no certain way of knowing, the kidnappers had no plans to kill Ray or the children, rather hold them hostage for a ransom fee of $5 million.\n\nBut their plot, which had been 18-months in the making, unraveled when the captors took a nap - leaving the students and bus driver a short window in which to secure their escape.\n\nMarshall bravely announced to the group that he wasn't going to die without putting up a fight.\n\nInspiring the cohort into action, under the instructions of Ray the group stacked the mattresses inside the truck on top of one another and used wooden slats to dislodge a steel plate on the roof of the van that was covering the hatch through which they\u2019d entered.\n\nFighting heat exhaustion, they poured water over their heads and kept pushing until they were able to knock the batteries off of the top of the hatch.\n\nHaving been buried alive for an agonizing 16 hours, Ray and the children finally found themselves back above ground. They walked to the quarry\u2019s guard station near the Shadow Cliffs East Bay National Park where authorities were called.\n\nParents and families of the Dairyland Union School District children and their bus driver who were kidnapped, wait anxiously inside the Chowchilla police station for news on their whereabouts\n\nOne of the eldest children, Mitchell Marshall, bravely announced to the group that he wasn't going to die without putting up a fight\n\nUnder the instructions of Ray the group stacked the mattresses inside the truck on top of one another and used wooden slats to dislodge a steel plate on the roof of the van that was covering the hatch through which they\u2019d entered\n\nThe kidnappers made each of the children give their names and hand over a piece of clothing, and then climb down a ladder into the van, buried more than 12-feet below the ground (pictured: a list made by the kidnappers as the children and Ray entered the buried truck, noting their names and ages)\n\nThe truck was buried more than 12 feet below the ground. The kidnappers used dirt and batteries to secure a hatch door\n\nThe escape took place before the kidnappers had even been able to call in their ransom demands, because the Chowchilla Police Department telephone lines had been overloaded with calls from the media and family members looking for the children.\n\nSoon after arriving at the quarry, Police discovered that the buried truck was registered to the quarry owner\u2019s son, Frederick Woods.\n\nA draft ransom note was also found at the scene, with some of its phrasing seeming to make reference to Hugh Pentecost\u2019s story, \u2018The Day the Children Vanished\u2019, which had been published in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Daring Detectives and was displayed in the Chowchilla public library.\n\nWoods was arrested weeks later after fleeing to Vancouver, British Columbia. The Schoenfeld brothers surrendered to authorities in California after several days in hiding.\n\nAll three men received life sentences after pleading guilty to kidnapping charges. Only Richard Schoenfeld expressed remorse for the crime.\n\nWoods meanwhile was already said to be concocting another scheme, desperately urging one of his friends to turn the Chowchilla kidnappings into a film.\n\nIn a newly discovered letter from 1976, shortly after his arrest, Wood wrote: \u2018I think it would make a damn good movie of the week, if not a feature.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s big \u2013 real big \u2013 and a hot item everyone wants to know about,\u2019 he continued. \u2018If you do make it into a film, all I want is a percent of it.\u2019\n\nRichard and James Schoenfeld, were paroled in 2012 and 2015 respectively, but Woods, now 67, remains behind bars.\n\nWoods (center), now 67, was one of three Bay Area defendants in the case, which would go on to become one of the most notorious and bizarre mass kidnappings in US history (James Schoenfeld is shown left, Richard seen right)\n\nA draft ransom note was found at the scene, with some of its phrasing seeming to make reference to Hugh Pentecost\u2019s story, \u2018The Day the Children Vanished\u2019, which had been published in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Daring Detectives and was displayed in the Chowchilla public library\n\nRichard and James Schoenfeld (left to right), were paroled in 2012 and 2015 respectively, but Woods, now 67, remains behind bars\n\nSurvivors of the kidnapping are seen being lead past reporters to their parents 28 hours after they vanished without a trace (Hyde Brown pictured bottom right)\n\nAfter an agonizing 16 hours of being buried alive, Ray and the children finally found themselves back above ground. They walked to the quarry\u2019s guard station near the Shadow Cliffs East Bay National Park, and were all \u2018in good condition\u2019. The escape took place before the kidnappers had even been able to call in their ransom demands, because the Chowchilla Police Department telephone lines were tied up with media calls and family members looking for their children\n\nRay pictured comforting one of the young girls he helped save when he masterminded the group's escape from the buried truck\n\nYoung victims of the Chowchilla kidnaping huddle together under happier circumstances for celebration honoring them and bus driver Ed Ray on Sunday, August 22, 1976\n\nBill Parker welcomes home his daughter, Barbara Parker, 8, who was taken in the Chowchilla kidnappings\n\nTwo victims photographed by police on arrival at the quarry.

And they don\u2019t fight back. They\u2019re vulnerable. They will mind.\u2019\n\nWoods appeared in a small conference room in San Luis Obispo, California, this week before a panel for what would prove to be his 19th unsuccessful attempt to secure parole.\n\nNew reports show that despite the seriousness of his crimes, Woods has continued to be allowed to make money running a series businesses during his 43 years behind bars. He even launched a lawsuit from prison, suing one of his employees for $1.5 million.\n\nWhile the state of California doesn\u2019t prohibit an inmate from running a business for prison, any such prisoners must obtain permission for the warden of their respective facility \u2013 something Woods never bothered to seek, a prison investigation determined.\n\nThe discoveries were made just a few days before his October 8 hearing. The board decided not to release Woods and set his next parole suitability hearing for 2024, when he will be 72.\n\n\u2018Despite his age, Mr. Woods is still committing criminal behavior,\u2019 the board\u2019s chairman ruled. \u2018He chooses not to follow the rules of this institution\u2019.\n\nHis lawyers say they will be appealing the ruling, claiming that as recently as January this year the prison found no evidence that Woods was still making business dealings from behind bars.\n\nThe descendant of two prominent California families and rumored to be a beneficiary of a $100 million trust fund, for now, Wood shall remain at the California Men\u2019s Colony prison in San Luis Obispo.\n\nIt\u2019s from his cell there that investigators say he has been directing at least three businesses, including the Ambria Acres Christmas tree farm in Creston, the Little Bear Creek gold mine near Lake Tahoe and a used car business in Tehachapi.\n\nOne victim huddles up to a local policewoman, waiting to be reunited with his parents\n\nWoods appeared in a small conference room in San Luis Obispo, California, this week before a panel for what would prove to be his 19th unsuccessful attempt to secure parole.

He even launched a lawsuit from prison, suing one of his employees for $1.5 million\n\nUpon his release, James Schoenfeld (left) offered a reason why the three men from affluent family carried out the plot. As it turned out, despite their parents\u2019 wealth, James and Woods had both run up considerable debts. \u2018We needed multiple victims to get multiple millions, and we picked children because children are precious,\u2019 he said. \u2018They state would be willing to pay ransom for them. And they don\u2019t fight back. They\u2019re vulnerable. They will mind\u2019\n\n'Plan': Woods' heinous scheme was found jotted down on a lose scrap of paper. The kidnappers were never able to call in their ransom demands, because the Chowchilla Police Department telephone lines had been overloaded with calls from the media and family members looking for the children\n\nWoods\u2019 dealings went relatively unnoticed until one of his workers, Michael Bianchi, injured himself at the gold mine and filed a claim against Woods with the state Workers\u2019 Compensation Board in 2016.\n\nThe board found that Woods had been hiring employees and directing each of his business through letters, prison phone and \u2018via cell phone\u2019, calling the discovery \u2018incredible\u2019 and \u2018unique\u2019.\n\nDuring his time behind bars, Woods has also married three different women and even purchased an ocean view mansion for $1.5 million in Nipomo, a short drive from the prison. He sold one of his properties in Martha\u2019s Vineyard for $550,000 at the turn of the year.\n\nWoods' prison record is blemished by a number of disciplinary infractions, including being caught with pornography three times and twice for possession cell phones.\n\nHis trust fund was used in a civil suit in 2016, filed by the victims of the Chowchilla kidnappings. CBS reported that one of the victims described the undisclosed amount as \u2018enough to pay for some serious therapy, but not enough to buy a house.\u2019\n\nThough his Lake Tahoe gold mine never worked out as planned, associates of Woods say his second hand car business is thriving, where he recently sold a vintage Rolls Royce for $100,000.\n\nTwo of the vehicles under the business\u2019 inventory is the two white vans used to transport the terrified 26 school children to their underground grave.\n\nBianchi told CBS that Woods wanted to keep the old vans, believing the kidnappings would become so influence that one day they\u2019d fetch a hefty sum.\n\nThe Christmas tree farm never became profitable, prompting Woods to launch a lawsuit against Bianchi, the site\u2019s manager, for failing to provide the trees with an adequate water supply.\n\nWhile Woods has continued to profit in the 43 years since the Chowchilla kidnappings, his victims have continued to battle with the demons they confronted that day.\n\nAt Woods\u2019 parole hearing in 2012, victims of the kidnapping described the suffering they still felt 39-years-on in a heartfelt let to the board, expressing their desire to ensure Woods is never made a free man (pictured: Victims of the Chowchilla bus kidnapping pictured at a reunion in 2012)\n\nFrank Edward Ray (pictured in September 1976) received a California School Employees Association citation for outstanding community service, for his heroics that fateful day\n\nBefore his death in May 2012, he was visited by a number of the children he helped save. To commemorate his birthday, every February 26 since has been declared Edward Ray Day in Chowchilla\n\nAt Woods\u2019 parole hearing in 2012, victims of the kidnapping described the suffering they still felt 39-years-on in a heartfelt let to the board, expressing their desire to that Woods never be made a free man.\n\n'I wrote that they buried me alive, they stole my childhood and caused me immense emotional pain over the years. It affected my life, my parents\u2019 lives and my children\u2019s lives,\u2019 Hyde Brown later revealed.\n\n'For me, it\u2019s having to deal with hatred and anger toward other human beings, and that\u2019s a struggle that almost 40 years later I still have to deal with,' she added.\n\n'Until recently I slept with a night light. I have anxiety attacks when I\u2019m in a confined space, and it\u2019s a problem living in the South when we have tornado warnings and we have to take cover in storm shelters. \u2026 They took away my ability to be free.'\n\nHyde said the kidnapping also affected her ability to be a mother to two children since she did not have what she considers a normal childhood.\n\n'You don\u2019t go from being buried alive and thinking you\u2019re going to die to having a normal childhood,' she said.\n\n'I\u2019m fortunate I\u2019m not incarcerated or hooked on drugs, which is how some of the kids dealt with it. I\u2019m as OK as a broken person can be.'\n\nHyde said the kidnapping also affected her ability to be a mother to two children since she did not have what she considers a normal childhood\n\nOther victims, such as Larry Park, say they spiraled into a world of addiction when they hit their teenage years, still haunted by chilling nightmares from July 15, 1976\n\nOther victims, such as Larry Park, say they spiraled into a world of addiction when they hit their teenage years, still haunted by chilling nightmares from July 15, 1976.\n\nOnly now, 43 years later, is Park and so many of the other 25 victims finally piecing their lives back together.\n\n\u2018I have nine years sober. My resentment for [Woods and the Schoenfeld brothers]\u2026 was killing me,\u2019 Park admitted to CBS, adding, \u2018One night\u2026 I was laying in bed\u2026 and I said, 'God help me to forgive them.\u2019\n\nIn a bid to move on from the ordeal, Park met face to face with Richard Schoenfeld after he was paroled in 2012, an encounter that changed his life and allowed him to finally be at peace, he said.\n\nFrank Edward Ray received a California School Employees Association citation for outstanding community service for his heroics during the terrifying ordeal.\n\nBefore his death in May 2012, he was visited by a number of the children he helped save.\n\nTo commemorate his birthday, every February 26 since his death has been declared Edward Ray Day in the city of Chowchilla.\n\n48 HOURS: 'Live to Tell: The Chowchilla Kidnapping' will be broadcast Saturday, Oct. 12 (10:00 PM, ET/PT) on CBS.", "description": "On July 15, 1976, a group of 26 children attending summer classes at Dairyland Elementary School were returning from a trip when their bus was hijacked by three armed men.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19600836-0-image-a-141_1570815139848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
