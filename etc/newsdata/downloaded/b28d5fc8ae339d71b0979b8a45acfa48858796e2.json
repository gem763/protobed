Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery, slaughter and floggings.\n\nThe group also caused global revulsion with beheadings of hostages from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHe taunted Western forces with his \u201cbin Laden-style\u201d messages to followers, in one video he is filmed with an AK47 assault rifle by his side.\n\nA former Western intelligence officer previously said: \u201cAl-Baghdadi is a very important figurehead for Islamic State and getting him is a very high priority.\n\n\"His leadership of Daesh has been punctuated with some of the vilest act of violence against human beings by terrorists.\"\n\nThe group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly Shi'ite Muslim areas.\n\nA truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than 324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria, which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nColonel Richard Kemp, former adviser to the Government on terrorism, said earlier this year: \u201cBaghdadi is one of the most evil men in history and inspires his followers in the Middle East and around the world to acts of the most medieval barbarity.\n\n\u201cWe need to get him urgently to stop his poisonous message encouraging global violence, including savage attacks in Britain like we saw at the Manchester Arena in 2017.\u201d\n\nThe hunt for Baghdadi\n\nThe search for the 47- year-old Islamic State leader was described as a \"kill or capture\" mission.\n\nSAS troopers previously joined up with American Special Forces in the search, which also involved MI6, UK listening station GCHQ and the American National Security Agency.\n\nThey focused the manhunt on the most hostile of Iraq\u2019s towns and villages.\n\nAround 30 SAS and Special Boat Service troops were previously involved in the hunt, led from a special forces HQ north of Baghdad.\n\nIraq\u2019s \u201cGolden Division\u201d special forces were also involved, helping to secure areas when search missions are called in.\n\nRAF drones launched from a base in Kuwait, and flown by \u201cReaper squadron\u201d pilots based at RAF Waddington, in Lincolnshire, were being deployed on 12-hour surveillance missions.\n\n(Image: AL-FURQAN MEDIA/AFP via Getty Im)\n\nThe drones were armed with four Hellfire missiles which can be fired remotely once a target is identified.\n\nDrones patrolling Al Anbar and Mosul Provinces were searching for cars being driven by al-Baghdadi\u2019s brother or driver.\n\nA senior source previously said: \u201cNobody wants to allow Baghdadi to spit out hate-filled messages and a lot of people are on the mission to stop him.\n\n\u201cIt is not known where al-Baghdadi is, but every suspicious movement on the ground is being monitored and, even though he is the most careful of the high-value targets, he will make a mistake.\n\n\u201cThey always make a mistake in the end \u2013 and then he will be either trapped or killed.\u201d\n\nHis last message\n\nMost of Baghdadi's speeches were distributed as audio recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful character.\n\nIt was this elusiveness that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance and air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.\n\nOn September 16, Islamic State's media network issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from Baghdadi.\n\nIn the clip, he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group.\n\n\"As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,\" he said.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn the audio message, Baghdadi also said the United States and its proxies had been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the United States had been \"dragged\" into Mali and Niger.\n\nAt the height of its power Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n\nBut the fall in 2017 of Mosul and Raqqa, its strongholds in Iraq and Syria respectively, stripped Baghdadi, an Iraqi, of the trappings of a caliph and turned him into a fugitive thought to be moving along the desert border between Iraq and Syria.\n\nU.S. air strikes killed most of his top lieutenants, and before Islamic State published a video message of Baghdadi in April there had been conflicting reports over whether he was alive.\n\nDespite losing its last significant territory, Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities.\n\nHow is he believed to have died?\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is believed to have been killed in a U.S. military operation in Syria.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Baghdadi was targeted in the overnight raid but was unable to say whether the operation was successful.\n\nThe operation involved helicopters, warplanes and a ground clash in the village of Brisha near the Turkish border.\n\nDramatic footage has emerged appearing to show the raid in which several explosions can be seen and heard.\n\nA huge fireball erupts in the sky followed by a cloud of smoke and several deafening bangs.\n\nThere is then deadly silence.\n\nDay-time video shows a crater in the ground littered with torn, blood-stained clothes.\n\nNewsweek claimed that Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest after realising he had no chance of escape.\n\nHis two wives were also reportedly killed in the firefight, with no injuries to US forces.\n\nTwo Iraqi security sources and two Iranian officials said they had received confirmation from inside Syria that Baghdadi had been killed.\n\nOne of the Iraqi officials said: \"Our sources from inside Syria have confirmed to the Iraqi intelligence team tasked with pursuing Baghdadi that he has been killed alongside his personal bodyguard in Idlib after his hiding place was discovered when he tried to get his family out of Idlib towards the Turkish border.\"\n\nThe Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine people were killed during the two-hour raid, including two women and likely at least one child.\n\nOne house thought to be the main target was badly hit from the air, before fighters descended from helicopters and engaged in ground clashes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's cryptic message\n\nTrump gave an indication that something was afoot on Saturday night when he tweeted without explanation, \"Something very big has just happened!\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley announced late on Saturday that Trump would make a \"major statement\" at 9 a.m. EST (1pm UK time ) on Sunday.\n\nGidley gave no further details.\n\nTrump has faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies.\n\nMany critics of Trump's Syria pullout have expressed worries it would lead the Islamic State militancy to regain strength and pose a threat to U.S. interests.\n\nAn announcement about Baghdadi's death could help blunt those concerns.", "description": "ISIS terror mastermind Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, described as \"one of the most evil men in history\", inspired brutality, fear and spread poisonous messages", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Getty", "Us Department Of State", "Afp Getty Images", "Al-Furqan Media Afp Via Getty Im"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20175150.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
