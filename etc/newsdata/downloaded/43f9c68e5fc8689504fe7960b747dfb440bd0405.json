CHEAP!\n\nAre you looking to ditch your hefty, old DSLR for a slimmer, slicker camera? Then you\u2019re in luck. There are some pretty sweet deals on Fujifilm\u2019s X-T100 series.\n\nAn X-T100 photography kit with a 15-45mm lens is currently retailing for only $499. Oh, it also comes with a 32GB memory card and a camera bag to keep your new toy in. Not bad at all.\n\nHere\u2019s what you get for that money:\n\nA sleek mirrorless camera with 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor\n\nA resolution of 6,000 x 4,000 pixels\n\n4K video shooting capabilities\n\nInterchangeable-lens body\n\nCompact form factor with 121mm x 83mm x 47.4mm\n\nForward-facing articulating screen\n\nIt\u2019s no secret: I absolutely love Fujifilm cameras. There\u2019s something about them. The old-school analog look, the way they feel in your hands, the built-in camera profiles \u2014 they exhume charisma. Of course, none of this would matter if they didn\u2019t take excellent photos, but they absolutely do.\n\nI\u2019ve never used the X-T100, but I reviewed the X-T3 (you can check out some of the pics I took with it here) and I own an X100F (you can check some of the pics I\u2019ve taken with it on my Instagram). Indeed, the latter sports an almost identical sensor as the X-T100. So I\u2019m willing to go out on a limb, and vouch that you won\u2019t be disappointed by the image quality \u2014 especially at that price.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Kevin Mullins, the photographer whose work with the X100F convinced me to get the same model, also had a chance to try out the X-T100 and share some of his impressions on it.\n\nIf you dig it, you can grab $100 off the X-T100 from B&H Photo. Make your choice: Gold, Dark Silver, or Black. (I always go for black.)\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
