So Trudeau played defense most of Monday night, as rivals on the left and right tried to tackle him. It was always going to be hard for him to assert his prime ministerial authority. He could either wrestle with his five noisy opponents or look on passively from a distance. His efforts to do both made him look average, not unstoppable. After initially holding back from the fray, in the second half of the debate Trudeau tried to turn provincial issues \u2014 like Quebec\u2019s Bill 21 on religious headwear in government workplaces and the unpopularity of Ontario Premier Doug Ford \u2014 into national ones. It\u2019s not clear it worked. Trudeau\u2019s strongest moments came in explaining his \u201cambitious but feasible\u201d climate policies. They were attacked relentlessly, and sometimes reasonably, but his opponents didn\u2019t demonstrate their own plans were more workable.\n\nAndrew Scheer passed the prime minister plausibility test\n\nConservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer \u2014 largely unknown internationally \u2014 succeeded on two fronts, which delivers him a points victory rather than a knockout blow against Trudeau. First, Scheer proved he can play a moderate when he wants to \u2014 something that is essential for him to win over suburban voters around Toronto. Canada's Liberals, after all, want voters to lump Scheer together with Donald Trump. But Scheer was able to brush past Trudeau\u2019s efforts to hammer him for his conservative past and present views on social hot-buttons like abortion. Scheer was also aggressive and successful in confronting Trudeau on his ethical and climate contradictions. He set up several exchanges that allowed voters to look at him and think \u201cthere\u2019s my next prime minister.\u201d\n\nScheer can also consider himself lucky that People's Party leader Maxime Bernier was fairly ineffectual in attacking him from the right, given that his moderate pitch left him exposed on that flank. For all that work and good fortune, Scheer did not deliver a knock-out blow: in fact, he was weakest during what should have been his strong suit, the debate section on pocketbook issues. It's still Trudeau\u2019s election to lose.\n\nScheer weaponizes the blackface scandal\n\nScheer brought up Trudeau\u2019s blackface scandal as Exhibit A of his broader case against the prime minister. While the controversy, amazingly, did not come up in the first French-language debate last week, Scheer used the Monday exchange to call Trudeau a phony who\u2019s alienated the voters who believed in him. Remember: For Scheer to prevail Oct. 21 he needs progressives to abandon Trudeau for the NDP and Greens, splitting the vote on the left. So Scheer turned the blackface scandal into an assault. \u201cHe can\u2019t even remember how many times he put blackface on. Because the fact of the matter is he\u2019s always wearing a mask,\u201d Scheer said, alluding to how Trudeau, the self-proclaimed feminist, dumped female Cabinet members who crossed him. \u201cMr. Trudeau, you are a phony, you are a fraud, and you do not deserve to govern this country.\u201d It\u2019s notable that Scheer delivered his toughest shot right off the top; last week in the French debate, pundits concluded he\u2019d had a weak start, when the most viewers are tuned it. Scheer\u2019s poll numbers subsequently sagged in Quebec.\n\nConservative Party leader Andrew Scheer (right) gestures toward Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. | Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP\n\nPopulism is now part of Canadian politics\n\nFor decades, Canadian political parties have embraced multiculturalism, yet on Monday night People's Party leader Maxime Bernier directly bemoaned current immigration levels. He said Canada adds \u201cthe equivalent of one Nova Scotia every three years.\u201d He also winked at pro-Trump Canadians with an early reference to \u201cCanada First.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear how much of a dent he truly made. Bernier\u2019s national poll numbers are atrocious, and, speaking in his second language, English, he wasn\u2019t nearly as polished as the mainstream Conservative, Scheer, whom he\u2019s hoping to challenge. Scheer almost certainly got the better of their exchanges. And he raised real doubts about the authenticity of Bernier\u2019s Canadian populist turn. Sheer alluded to Bernier once having been a Quebec separatist, and to his past as a small-government libertarian in a mainstream Conservative Cabinet before his recent, and sudden, mimicking of Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which Maxime Bernier I\u2019m debating tonight,\u201d Scheer said.\n\nLeft-wingers won the battle of the minor parties.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party leader Elizabeth May landed more solid jabs against Trudeau, from whom they need to steal votes, than Bernier did in targeting Scheer. The debates hold outsize importance for minor parties because they're rare opportunities to get in front of millions of voters on an equal footing as the major parties. On the left, Singh made sure to set himself apart from Trudeau on everything from taxes to indigenous relations. He also went in on the Liberals\u2019 climate record and the Conservatives\u2019 plan simultaneously, telling the voters they \u201cdo not need to choose between Mr. Delay and Mr. Deny.\u201d Having had the worst year of all the minor parties in national opinion polls, Singh had the most room for improvement and he used it.\n\nMay took all other leaders to task on their climate plans \u2014 a Green Party leader would do that \u2014 but she made sure to turn directly to Trudeau to register her disappointment with his climate record, noting that Canada is far from achieving the carbon emission reductions scientists say are necessary to avert the worst warming of the planet. Her main point: Trudeau does not deserve to govern alone in a second term, and the Greens deserve to be the junior partner holding him to account. Her killer line: \u201cVoting for Green MPs is your very best guarantee, Canada, that you don\u2019t get the government you least want.\u201d\n\nScheer did a better job pushing back his fringe threat. In an early exchange on immigration, he dropped one of several allusions to Bernier being a fraud. \u201cYou have changed,\u201d Scheer told the self-styled populist. \u201cNow you are making your policy based on trying to get Likes and Retweets from the darkest parts of Twitter.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e0/82/c0694f524236bd83e77f28a35539/191007-canada-debate-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
