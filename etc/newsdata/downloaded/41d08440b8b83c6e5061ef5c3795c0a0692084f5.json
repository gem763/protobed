The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.75% rose 139.95 points to 8,116.83, a gain of 1.8%.\n\nThe Dow\u2019s rally marks its sharpest point and percentage gain since Aug. 13, according to FactSet data. The Nasdaq notched its best gain since Aug. 13, while S&P 500 performed better than any trading day since Aug. 16.\n\nRead: History says the stock market\u2019s volatile August paves the way for more losses in September\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry, in a statement, said that Beijing and Washington had set a tentative date for \u201cearly October\u201d after a conference call between Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to translated version of the text.\n\nRead: China says trade talks with U.S. to take place in October\n\nU.S. trade officials confirmed the talks and noted that both sides must hold discussions with lower-level officials to lay the groundwork for more serious negotiations to take place next month.\n\nThe communication between China and the U.S. comes after tariffs were raised by both sides over the weekend and another increase is set to take place in the coming weeks. The tariff dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies has proved to be a crucial driver for market sentiment because the trade battle has put pressure on the global economies and threatened to throw the U.S. into a recession.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s why this big bank expects stocks to drop through the end of the year\n\nA new round of Sino-American trade negotiations had been expected in September until President Donald Trump announced an increase to import duties and China declared retaliatory measures.\n\n\u201cPutting to one side the fact that these talks were supposed to be happening this month, and the fact that this has been a familiar pattern for two years now, markets still prefer to take an optimistic view,\u201d wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, in a Thursday research note.\n\nHowever, the analyst said that the recent news on trade developments reflects a familiar playbook in which the market rallies and then falls on reports of stalled progress.\n\n\u201cFor now it appears that markets are looking to the horizon with optimism, then we\u2019ll probably follow a familiar playbook of another President Trump Twitter tantrum, which will send markets lower, before we get more talk of possible talks, which then sees markets rise again, before a rinse and repeat,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. stocks finished solidly higher Thursday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes more than wiping out losses from a day ago, as a survey on business conditions in the Federal Reserve\u2019s key districts showed that economic activity in nonfinancial service sectors was steady or improving even while trade-stricken manufacturing and agriculture were weak.\n\nMajor Asian benchmarks also rallied on the back of easing tensions in Hong Kong, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam saying she would scrap an extradition bill that sparked months of protests and raised worries that those conflicts could eventually hurt the business environment and global financial markets.\n\nLikely helping boost U.S. sentiment was data on the labor market, including payrolls processor Automatic Data Processing Inc.\u2019s ADP, +2.10% estimate that the private sector added 195,000 jobs in August, above the 150,000 consensus expectation, according to Econoday. New applications for unemployment benefits, meanwhile, ticked up to 217,000 during the week ended Aug. 31, near historic lows.\n\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s ADP read really blew the doors off of estimates and will likely set expectations high for tomorrow\u2019s read from the government, especially on the wage front,\u201d Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial Corp., wrote in an email. \u201cWhat investors really need to take away here is that this is yet another loud and clear sign that the economy continues to move along nicely despite pockets of weakness creeping up, and trade tensions mounting.\u201d\n\nEconomists caution, however, that the ADP data hasn\u2019t proven to be a solid guide to the official jobs report.\n\nA final estimate of second-quarter productivity growth confirmed a 2.3% rise, after a 3.1% gain in the first quarter. Unit labor costs, however, were raised to a 2.6% gain from a 2.4% gain.\n\nThe labor readings come ahead of the important nonfarm-payroll report on Friday, which could give the most significant measure to date of the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe U.S. services sector slowed in August, according to the Markit Services Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which fell from 53.0 in July to 50.7 in August, below the \u201cflash\u201d estimate issued two weeks ago. The more closely watched ISM nonmanufacturing index, however, came in at 56.4%, up from the 53.7% reading in July and above the consensus estimate of 54.2% expected by economists polled by MarketWatch.\n\nFactory orders in July rose 1.4%, above the 0.6% increase in June and the 1.2% consensus forecast.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nSlack Technologies Inc. WORK, -3.41%, the workplace-communications company, reported second-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates but forecast a slightly larger-than-expected loss for its current quarter, renewing concerns about its road to profitability and revenue growth. Shares fell 3.4% Thursday.\n\nShares of Ciena Corp. CIEN, -3.83% fell 3.8%, even after the optical networking company reported fiscal third-quarter profit and revenue that rose above expectations, and provided an upbeat full-year outlook.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc.

SIG, +26.88% rallied 26.7% Thursday, after the jewelry retailer reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations while raising its full-year outlook.
