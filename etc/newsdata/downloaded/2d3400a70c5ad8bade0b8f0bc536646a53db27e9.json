But Facebook is also facing a barrage of high-profile controversies, and its reputation has taken a hit in Washington.\n\nZuckerberg will walk a tightrope on Wednesday, defending Libra and Facebook even as he tries to make the challenging case that his company should not be the face of the project.\n\nAccording to his prepared testimony, Zuckerberg will offer a stark defense of the Libra project, touting its ability to offer financial services to people who do not have access to banks, but he will also work to emphasize that he no longer calls the shots and that Facebook is just one partner in a broader project.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to have helped found a 21-member coalition of companies and social impact organizations that have now committed to moving forward with this idea,\u201d Zuckerberg will tell the committee, according to his prepared testimony.\n\n\u201cBut by design, we don\u2019t expect to be leading those efforts going forward,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe Libra Association has been created, has a governance structure in place, and will be driving the project from now on.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg's testimony echoes the line from Facebook executives who have been trying to draw distinctions between their company and the Libra Association, the 21-member group responsible for launching the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201c[Zuckerberg] can\u2019t be the face of it,\u201d David Marcus, the head of Facebook\u2019s new cryptocurrency subsidiary Calibra, told reporters at a dinner in Washington, D.C., last week. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard for him to answer on behalf of the Libra Association.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will, I\u2019m sure, share his own views,\u201d Marcus, who received a grilling before the same committee over the summer, added. \u201cBut he cannot engage or commit to anything on behalf of the association because he doesn\u2019t have the power to do that anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Libra Association formalized its governance structure just last week, with its 21 initial members \u2014 including Spotify, Uber and Lyft \u2014 signing on to a charter in Geneva.\n\nBut the other companies have yet to come before Congress or speak publicly before governments on behalf of the project, which has drawn significant fire from regulators around the world. And the project has faced challenges from the start; Mastercard, Visa and PayPal, three of the association\u2019s most important members, pulled out of the virtual currency earlier this month, leaving the association without some of its top financial players.\n\nThe association says it has received interest in joining from more than 1,500 entities, 180 of which qualify for membership, and that it expects it will ultimately receive support from some banks and other established financial institutions.\n\nBut downplaying Facebook's role will be a hard sell for lawmakers and critics.\n\n\u201cFacebook is going to be hard-pressed to distance itself from a currency that they are launching,\u201d Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University, told The Hill.\n\nDemocrats played hardball to get Zuckerberg to appear. Facebook had originally offered to send the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to testify about Facebook\u2019s involvement in the Libra project.\n\nBut earlier this month, a congressional source told The Hill the committee would not confirm Sandberg's appearance until Zuckerberg agreed to appear before January.\n\nShortly after, the committee announced that Zuckerberg would be testifying. It is unclear if Sandberg will appear as well.\n\nZuckerberg is also testifying with his company under intense scrutiny from Washington, on Libra and a host of other issues. Lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee are set to hammer Zuckerberg over his company\u2019s litany of privacy infractions, failure to stave off election interference efforts on its platforms, and the ongoing allegations that Facebook\u2019s advertising platform can be used to discriminate against minorities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMuch of the focus on Wednesday, though, will be on Libra.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning that a company with a well-documented history of promising one thing to achieve regulatory approval and then behaving differently now wants to enter the cryptocurrency sector,\u201d Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.) said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\u201cThis raises significant customer privacy and even monetary stability concerns,\u201d she said, \u201cand we need to hear how Mr. Zuckerberg plans to address them.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s memo on the hearing names five separate bills that have been floated to regulate or even kill the Libra project. Rep. Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) has introduced the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act to prevent companies like Facebook from becoming financial institutions, and a discussion draft from Rep. Sylvia Garcia Sylvia GarciaAudience laughs when Mueller jokes about member of Congress lying Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment WHIP LIST: The 228 House Democrats backing an impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Texas) would identify the Libra coin as a security, meaning it would be subject to strict oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cI have some concerns about if Facebook should be in this arena at all,\u201d Garcia told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cIf Mr. Zuckerberg wants to be king, he can be king of the social networks, but I don\u2019t want him to have the additional arsenal of financial data on people.\u201d\n\nThe hearing itself is titled \u201cAn Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors,\u201d opening the door for lawmakers to question Facebook over other issues as well, including an update on its settlement with civil rights groups in March over its targeted advertising practices, which previously allowed advertisers to target audiences by racial proxies.\n\nShortly after Facebook settled with the civil rights groups in the spring, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged the company with encouraging and enabling housing discrimination through its targeted advertising practices, despite the changes it has made to its platform to prevent the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have more to do here,\u201d Zuckerberg will tell the committee. \u201cBut we are proud of these recent efforts and the message they send about Facebook\u2019s commitment to civil rights and to protecting our users from potential discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe hearing on Wednesday will mark the first time Zuckerberg has testified publicly on Capitol Hill since he came before the Senate and House in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Those hearings in April 2018 were widely publicized, with congressional offices circulating sound bites and clips of lawmakers laying into Zuckerberg over his company\u2019s privacy violations and manipulative business tactics.\n\nBut the hearings ultimately did not hurt Facebook\u2019s bottom line. Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter ending in June was $16.8 billion, a nearly 30 percent increase from the year before.\n\nLawmakers will be looking to put the CEO back on the hot seat Wednesday.\n\n\u201cDespite Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to distance himself from this project, Facebook remains the founding member of the Libra Association,\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman Bradley (Brad) James ShermanCongress must push for a 'Gold Standard' nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia Critics pounce as Facebook crypto project stumbles This week: Congress returns to chaotic Washington MORE (D-Calif.), one of Zuckerberg\u2019s top antagonists on the committee, said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cTherefore I still expect Zuckerberg to explain how Libra will not be used by drug dealers, human traffickers, tax evaders, and terrorists for illicit financial transactions.\u201d", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faces a tough test Wednesday as he testifies publicly before a House panel on Libra, his company's controversial effort to launch a global cryptocurrency.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_101719getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
