Other than that, I don\u2019t remember having any formal education about money.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t receive any training on how to use money to achieve my goals until I went to grad school and told my adviser I wanted to take classes in arts management and entrepreneurship. (One of the best things that came out of my MFA in theatre was the ability to design and manage a cash-flow budget.) By that point, I\u2019d already decided that I was Interested In Money and began seeking out additional educational resources on my own.\n\nI\u2019d bet a lot of you have similar stories. If you didn\u2019t specifically get a degree in business or finance, your financial education might have come from the internet, the public library, your parents, or, you know, life experiences.\n\nBut many of us don\u2019t get much financial education at all. As USA Today reports:\n\nIn fact, when tested on financial concepts, only 17% of respondents ages 18 to 34 demonstrated basic financial literacy, according to the FINRA Foundation\u2019s 2018 National Financial Capability Study. It could partly be a lack of exposure. Just 29% of those surveyed by FINRA said they\u2019d been offered financial education at a school, college or workplace.\n\nUSA Today lists four important financial topics that aren\u2019t generally taught in schools, including taxes, student loans, credit, and budgeting. Did you learn about any of those in class, or did you have to figure them out on your own?\n\nAnd tell us\u2014what do you wish you had learned about money in school? When do you wish you had learned it, and how do you wish it had been taught?", "description": "When I was in school, one of my homework assignments was to follow the price of a single stock for one week.
