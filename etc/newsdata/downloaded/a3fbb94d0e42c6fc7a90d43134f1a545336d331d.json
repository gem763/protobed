True, the manufacturing sector has been struggling, but it\u2019s about the only weak spot in the economy.\n\nThis is not an economy in obvious need of monetary stimulus, even though it has slowed somewhat over the past year. In fact, the Fed\u2019s policy not only seems unnecessary, but it could also end up backfiring on the economy and spurring dangerous risks down the road.\n\nThe Fed has couched its decision to cut rates by 50 basis points this year as \u201cinsurance\u201d against growing uncertainty in the global economy, such as Brexit, U.S-China trade tensions and a gathering slowdown in Europe and Asia.\n\nBorrowing costs not a concern\n\nBut this approach is unlikely to stimulate much new demand at home. That\u2019s because the cost of borrowing is not a major concern for most businesses right now. Companies may be suffering from uncertainty over trade tensions or an overseas slowdown, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are chomping at the bit for lower interest rates so that they can borrow more.\n\nIf you are a small-business owner worried about the effect of U.S. tariffs on China, a half-point difference in interest rates isn\u2019t going to make much difference. You\u2019re still not going to invest in an area whose profits could be wiped out. The problem for such businesses isn\u2019t the cost of capital; it\u2019s uncertainty.\n\nBy cutting rates, the Fed is also directly cutting the profitability of the vast majority of U.S. banks just when monetary conditions had returned to more normal levels following the 2007-2008 financial crisis. This actually could make them less willing to make loans, resulting in the exact opposite of what is intended by the policy.\n\nOf the nearly 5,000 banks in the United States, most are under $10 billion in asset size. Most of those banks rely on the simple difference between the rate they charge for loans and the rate they pay depositors for 70%-80% of their revenue.\n\nCollapse in spreads\n\nThat spread collapsed after the financial crisis as the Fed cut rates to zero. It started to rebound somewhat during the period when the central bank was raising rates from 2016 through 2018. This not only restored banks\u2019 profitability closer to their historical levels, but the industry was also able to start increasing the rates they paid for their deposits, which of course benefits the consumer.\n\nSo when the Fed changed course and cut rates this year in an environment where it does not necessarily stimulate more credit generation, the banks now have a choice to make \u2014 lower profitability, decrease deposit rates or preserve profitability by turning away some loans.\n\nThis potentially leads to the other risky aspect of cutting rates when monetary policy is already accommodative. When bank profitability is reduced, banks may reach for higher returns through riskier lending and investments. We all saw how that turned out in 2007-2008.\n\nAmmunition running low\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is full of smart people who may eventually be proven right to have decided to get ahead of the game in case the U.S. catches a cold from the rest of the world. But the risk is that they are using up valuable ammunition in trying to fix problems that don\u2019t exist.\n\nWe only have to look across the Atlantic to see how lower interest rates are not always effective in stimulating an economy and can have undesirable effects. Interest rates in Europe have been negative for quite some time, meaning that depositors are paying banks to hold their money.\n\nThe idea was that this would encourage companies to invest and banks to lend money rather than stash it with the central bank. But its unintended effect has been to crimp lending by hurting the already poor financial health of the region\u2019s banks.\n\nThe Fed should take note.\n\nAldis Birkans is chief financial officer at National Bank Holdings, serving clients through Bank Midwest, Community Banks of Colorado and Hillcrest Bank.", "description": "Aldis Birkans, CFO of National Bank Holdings, also says lower rates will crimp lenders\u2019 earnings.", "authors": ["Aldis Birkans"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS427_Powell_ZG_20191001145656.jpg"}
