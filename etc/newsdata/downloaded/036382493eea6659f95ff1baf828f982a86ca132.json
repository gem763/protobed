Why!?\"\n\n\"Why would you go on reality TV?\n\n\"We've tried to protect you from the outside world!\"\n\nLaughing, Woody added that they asked him: \"Can't you just get a job?\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut Woody won over their support when he explained the premise of the show, and that it's \"not like Love Island\".\n\nIn fact, the show is almost the opposite of Love Island, which sees contestants judge one another on their looks initially, as there is no way to do that on The Circle.\n\nWoody's popularity on the show skyrocketed amongst the other players and also the viewers.\n\n(Image: Ian West/PA Wire)\n\n\"I'm absolutely buzzing\", he said.\n\n\"People have approached me and said 'I hope my son's like you'.\n\n\"It's like a weird dream.\"\n\nWoody kept the identity of his famous parents a secret from the other players right until the very end, because he wanted to experience life without being judged by people who have a certain idea of him as a \"famous kid\".\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBecause of this, he empathised with catfish James, who pretended to be single mum Sammie, because \"catfishing is an escape and a way to see things outside of who you are normally\".\n\nWoody also chatted about his reaction to finding out that Judy, who he had been flirting with, was actually Richard Madeley catfishing.\n\nJudy's supposed age was 27, while Richard is 63.\n\n\"There was shock, there was denial\", joked Woody.\n\n\"It was a big moment when I went from 'why are you flirting with someone who is a third older than you?' to 'why are you flirting with someone three times your age!?'\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHe explained: \"Richard Madeley encaptured this woman, I could see her and she had some attitude.\n\n\"He knows how to act and how to move his hips.\n\n\"It really made me chuckle.\"\n\nWoody also confirmed he had no idea Judy was not real, and she was the only catfish he didn't expect at all.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHe said it was strange playing the game alone in his apartment and then finally realising that millions of people were in fact watching, as it's something that goes to the back of your mind during filming.\n\nThe teen previously did not use much social media, as having gained a following in the past, he realised it was \"as wide as an ocean but as deep as a paddling pool\", as he wasn't making meaningful connections with anyone.\n\n\"Social media is great but it's just numbers\", he said.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nDuring his time on the show, Woody said he learnt to cook, read eight books, and practised playing the piano.\n\n\"I feel like a different man!\", he said.\n\nWoody hopes to do more TV work in the future, \"if they'll have me\", but he mostly wants to go back to living his life as a normal 18-year-old teenager.\n\nHe said: \"One day I hope to be in the public eye again, but I would rather go back to just being me first.\"", "description": "Woody has opened up about what his parents said when he told them he was going on The Circle (spoiler alert: they weren't happy)", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Wireimage Pa", "Channel", "Pa", "Ian West Pa Wire", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20643991.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_and-Fatboy-Slim-send-video-message-to-Wood-The-Circle_6433JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
