The post explained, \u201cMorning of the wedding comes around and I'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time I should show up to the reception to start helping. Then Bride messages me asking for a favor.\u201d\n\nBRIDE-TO-BE CLAIMS FRIEND STOLE HER 'DREAM WEDDING DRESS' AFTER SHOWING HER PICTURES OF IT\n\nApparently, the happy couple had forgotten \u201cabout the appetizers and needed someone to pick them up. Can I do this for a bride, on her wedding day? Sure. Oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. Sure.\u201d\n\nAfter the ceremony, instead of hanging out with his friends who were also at the wedding, the poster drove off to pick up the appetizers. \u201cThank God I played as much Tetris as I have,\u201d the story continued, \u201cbecause fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. I text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and I'd see them at the reception.\u201d\n\nApparently, the bride didn\u2019t respond to this message.\n\n\u201cI get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in,\u201d he continued. Instead, he claimed he had to carry all of the appetizers in by himself.\n\nAccording to the post, the reception came and went without anyone offering him any money for the food. After the party, the poster went back to the hotel to hang out with the groom at his invitation. When the poster mentioned picking up some food, \u201cthe bride\u2019s cousin overhears and asks me to buy her food too. Sure. Then she asks the room at large who'd like food. Now I'm buying food for almost the whole after party. Cousin says she'll Venmo me when I get back, and she'll pay for everyone\u2019s stuff. Sure.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nUnfortunately, when the poster got back with the food, he found the cousin who promised to pay passed out. \u201cDrunken guests grab whatever food they see,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe groom walks up to me, burger in hand and says he's actually really tired so he's going to go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. I grab my food, take the elevator to the first-floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. At this point, I'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late-night food run, and am pretty sure that I never really had a best friend to begin with. I feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous.\u201d\n\nCommenters on Reddit generally agreed that the original poster should get paid back and that he shouldn\u2019t feel weird asking for the money.\n\n\u201cText the groom and bride that you have yet to be paid for the apps and food that you were asked to pick-up and were promised to be paid,\u201d one user commented. \u201cDo not take no for an answer. If ignored FB, twitter and other various forms of SNS at one-week intervals.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cText the Groom about when you can expect payment for the appetizers,\u201d another user added. \u201cOnce you're paid, step away from this friendship. And why should you worry about insulting the groom? He wasn't worried about insulting you with his behavior. You can be honest without being cruel. Just because his feelings are hurt doesn't mean you're a jerk.\u201d\n\nSome users, however, wondered if the original poster had an accurate view of his friendship with the groom.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThere definitely is more to this story than he is letting on,\u201d one of the commenters wrote. \u201cHis friend still treated him very poorly, don't get me wrong. But the original poster sounds like he has quite a few issues dealing with his emotions and reactions. Clearly he's not actually as close to this friend as he is portraying. Perhaps his friend has lots of other friends that are closer to him than the original poster is, who probably doesn't really have any other friends.\u201d\n\nAccording to an update from the original poster, he eventually received the money he was owed, but only after reaching out and asking for it.", "description": "After feeling tricked into paying hundreds of dollars and not getting paid back for his friend\u2019s wedding, a slighted usher is wondering how close he really is with the groom.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/greedy-bride.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
