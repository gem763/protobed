Mitt Romney (R-UT) over his repeated criticism of President Donald Trump.\n\nRomney, one of Congress\u2019s most vocal critics of the administration, is taking fire from President Trump and his allies for trashing the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria and the president\u2019s call for Ukraine and China to investigate allegations of corruption against former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nSpeaking to The Hill, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) hit Romney for his repeated attack on the president and suggested his negativity steems from lingering feelings about his loss to President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election.\n\n\u201cBecause one election didn\u2019t turn out the way that Mitt wanted it to turn out\u2026 he\u2019s critical of the president,\u201d said Inhofe, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not pleased with it.\u201d\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-GA) compared Romney to an armchair quarterback, who jeers football players when the going gets tough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully easy to sit in the stands and be critical of the people on the field,\u201d Perdue told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re all quite capable of having a voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his own opinion. I disagree with it strongly,\u201d the Georgia Republican said of his colleague\u2019s frequent attacks on President Trump.\n\nFurther, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), another ally of the administration, said this week that Romney\u2019s critism is \u201cnot helping\u201d President Trump.\n\nDuring a Monday Cabinet meeting, President Trump urged Republicans on Capitol Hill to ratchet up their defense of him with respect to the closed-door impeachment inquiry and called out Romney for playing into the House Deemocrats\u2019 political hands.\n\nThe president argued the Democrats are \u201cvicious\u201d and \u201cstick together,\u201d while they \u201cdon\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst.\u201d\n\nNot only do a handful of Republican senators wish Romney would tapper down his criticism of President Trump, but it appears voters in feel the same way.\n\nAccording to Wednesday\u2019s Rasmussen\u2019s national telephone and online poll, 63 percent of likely Republican voters said the party should be more like President Trump, while 30 percent believe it should be like Romney.\n\nThe survey\u2019s findings come after Romney received mockery after it was revealed that the Utah Republican has a secret Twitter account that he used to defend himself from criticism. When asked by The Atlantic whether the account \u2014 named \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d \u2014 was his, the lawmaker simply replied, \u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d which is French for, \u201cit\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to be called a lurker. I\u2019ve been called a lot of things, but being called a lurker is a new low,\u201d he told Axios of the account.", "description": "A trio of Republican senators expressed displeasure with Sen.
