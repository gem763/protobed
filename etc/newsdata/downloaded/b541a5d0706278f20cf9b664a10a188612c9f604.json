So strong measures are required.\n\nSo much of the pioneering scientific work that has saved millions of lives worldwide was carried out here. So strong measures are required (stock photo)\n\nNHS chief executive Mr Stevens is absolutely right to say that by including the Society of Homeopaths in the official register of professional organisations (such as the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council), we risk extending respectability to the anti-vaccine lobbyists who are spreading the lie that homeopathic remedies can cure or protect against virulent diseases and even stop them from circulating.\n\n'Anything that gives homeopathy a veneer of credibility risks chancers being able to con more people into parting with their hard-earned cash in return for bogus treatments which at best do nothing, and at worse can be potentially dangerous,' Mr Stevens said this week.\n\nI'm aware that many of my colleagues loathe homeopathy on principle because it runs counter to everything they learned in medical school.\n\nThe idea that 'like cures like' and that minute traces of a substance that triggers adverse symptoms can somehow project 'memories' onto water or alcohol molecules and then be used therapeutically is utterly unscientific. But, as a psychiatrist, I am also aware that the human mind is incredibly powerful and we do not fully understand it.\n\nI first observed patient belief in the 'magic' of homeopathy when I was a junior doctor on a morning ward round.\n\nThe elderly patient had been brought in with recurrent stomach pain. Before she could be sent to the operating theatre, her pains subsided \u2014 all thanks, she declared, to her homeopathic tablets.\n\nThe consultant, I'm sorry to say, laughed in her face. 'No reliable evidence that it works at all,' he snapped.\n\nTo me, his attitude seemed counter-productive. If the patient was feeling better \u2014 and no one should ever under-rate the power of the placebo effect \u2014 then that was surely only a good thing. And if nothing else, the theatre would be freed up so another patient would get surgery sooner.\n\n'Keep taking the tablets,' I whispered to her.\n\nIf the patient was feeling better \u2014 and no one should ever under-rate the power of the placebo effect \u2014 then that was surely only a good thing (stock photo)\n\nI've even tried homeopathy myself. When I first started appearing on live TV, I was so stricken with nerves that I took a homeopathic remedy recommended by a friend \u2014 and discovered that it 'worked'.\n\nIntellectually, I knew it wasn't really doing anything, but I noted some physical benefits. My pulse rate slowed and my head cleared. So the little pill became a ritual. I'd swallow one just before the lights in the studio went up, and immediately I was more relaxed. There were no side-effects and no risk of addiction or interactions.\n\nThen, one day, I realised half way through a segment on camera that I'd forgotten to take the pills and yet I was quite calm. I didn't need the tablets again.\n\nWhen the NHS banned GPs from prescribing homeopathic remedies two years ago on the grounds that they were a 'misuse of resources', based on my observation of patients over the years and my own experience, I argued against the move.\n\nIn my view, the cost was low and the potential benefits of a placebo very real for some patients (including me!).\n\nBut when anti-vaccine campaigners start twisting facts to suit their lies about the dangers of vaccination and use erroneous claims about homeopathic treatments to persuade worried parents to seek alternatives, then I find my sympathy for this branch of complementary treatment waning.\n\nI was horrified to read in Saturday's Mail about one particular homeopath, Helen Kimball-Brooke, who runs a clinic in Ealing, West London, while campaigning for a 'vaccine-free world'.\n\nShe uses Twitter to spread poisonous claims that vaccines 'don't prevent illness', are 'hazardous', and a product of 'medical tyranny'.\n\nAnd I was left feeling distinctly queasy by a children's picture book that Ms Kimball-Brooke had edited called Sarah Doesn't Want to Be Vaccinated, about a little girl whose parents think that childhood illnesses such as measles are beneficial, leaving you 'even healthier than you were before'.\n\nAt the very least, such a move will signal to patients that homeopathic remedies and the claims made for them should be treated with caution (stock photo)\n\nWhat horrendous propaganda. It is unthinkable that such a misguided \u2014 and I'm being generous here \u2014 individual should be given any credence at all as she peddles her claptrap.\n\nWhich is why I feel it is far better to withdraw official accreditation from the whole of the Society of Homeopaths than to allow some of its members to exploit and brandish a stamp of official approval while spreading lies and distorting the facts.\n\nAt the very least, such a move will signal to patients that homeopathic remedies and the claims made for them should be treated with caution.\n\nThey do not deserve to be trusted in the same way that conventional treatments prescribed by doctors are \u2014 the quality, safety and efficacy of which have, as far as possible, been assured, and which have been tested in the laboratory and in clinical trials.\n\nHomeopathy has a gentle history and I am sure the vast majority of its practitioners have the safety and well-being of their patients as a priority.\n\nBut we are also seeing a dark side to homeopathy \u2014 one that could leave many children facing an unnecessary illness and even death.\n\nWe must do everything possible to make sure that cannot happen.", "description": "DR MAX PEMBERTON: To a large extent, homeopathy, a tradition that dates back some 220 years, meets this criteria.", "authors": ["Dr Max Pemberton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20305298-0-image-a-42_1572309007571.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
