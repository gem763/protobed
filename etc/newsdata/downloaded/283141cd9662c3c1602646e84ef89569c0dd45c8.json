It is desirable to accept all affected people in shelters,\u201d he said, adding that he would take measures to prevent similar cases.\n\nLocal media said one homeless man had been found dead on Tuesday near a flooded river in another area of the capital. Police suspect he lived near the river and drowned in the floods.\n\nAccording to the government, about 1,100 people sleep rough in Tokyo, accounting for a quarter of Japan\u2019s homeless population.\n\nOn Tuesday, rescue crews were still searching for about 20 people believed to be missing. More than 30,000 people were still in shelters as of late on Monday.\n\nBusiness appeared to be nearly back to normal in central Tokyo, and residents in areas where flood waters had subsided had started cleaning up, but Nagano, Fukushima and other badly affected areas were still inundated.\n\nAbe said there were concerns about the storm having lasting effects in the worst-hit areas and pledged support for residents. He told parliament the government was funding the disaster response from the 500bn yen (\u00a33.6bn) special reserve from the 2019 budget and could arrange additional funding if required.\n\nIn Fukushima, 11 bags containing possibly radioactive soil and debris removed as part of decontamination work after the 2011 nuclear disaster were washed away from two outdoor temporary storage sites and found downstream, the environment ministry said.\n\nThe ministry insisted there was no risk because the waterproof bags were intact and had not leaked, but said officials would take preventive measures in future.\n\nA large number of bags are being held at 760 sites across Fukushima. Their transfer to a longer-term storage facility near the plant is expected to be completed by March 2022.\n\nAgence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Shinzo Abe says pair should have had access to shelter in Tokyo during Typhoon Hagibis", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d530573ea5fabfa93d4cc6ead0ff0684a00a9a34/0_118_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89598be5fa717a09c4b00e33d0f09b7d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
