I love how you put a visual to bucket-filling!\"\n\nAnother said: \"This is so thoughtful and cute! Great job, mummy!\"", "description": "Mum-of-three Shelley's system rewards her children for helping her with tasks and good behaviour", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706818.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shelley-Kozyra.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
