However, an eye infection has forced the grandson of the infamous Italian-American gangster of the same name out of the matchup.\n\nCES MMA 59 takes place Friday at Twin River Casino in Lincoln, R.I. The main card streams live on UFC Fight Pass.\n\nGotti\u2019s father and manager, John Gotti Jr., issued a statement on his son\u2019s withdrawal via a CES press release Tuesday:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s brokenhearted. He had an amazing training camp. We had [UFC veteran] Dante Rivera in this camp with us and he brought in some UFC fighters to train with John. He helped get John in top shape\u2026 Saturday was when he had the problem with the eye. We thought it would be good in two days, but it is a viral infection. It\u2019s a complete different protocol now. The kid is heartbroken. He wants to fight. He put so much energy into this. He\u2019s a warrior. He\u2019d fight with one arm if he could.\u201d\n\nIn his first four pro bouts, Gotti hasn\u2019t been in a second round. He\u2019s won each of his fights by first-round TKO in a combined time of 6:26. In his most recent outing at CES MMA 56 in May, Gotti finished David Espino by slam and punches.\n\nCES 59 will continue on with Dana White\u2019s Contender Series development deal recipient William Knight, as well as DWCS and \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter\u201d veteran Greg Rebello, and longtime CES contender Dinis Paiva Jr.", "description": "Rising prospect John Gotti III will have to wait a little longer to step into the cage for his fifth professional fight.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/john-gotti-iii-ces-mma-53-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
