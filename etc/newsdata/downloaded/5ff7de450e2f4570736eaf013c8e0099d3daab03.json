And it also came out that Trump suggested adding a moat filled with alligators and snakes to his proposed border wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know how to ask this, but are we sure that it's OK to make fun of this guy?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you ever read Of Mice and Men? Remember how Lenny was really \u2018strong?\u2019 What if Trump is really strong? I've got a cousin who is also strong. And he loves alligators too, but we don't make fun of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Trump tweeted 800 times in the past month,\u201d Che continued. \u201cFor context, Chrissy Teigen tweeted 218 times. Now, obviously I feel like the president should be a lot busier than Chrissy Teigen. But if Trump is as strong as I think he is, then... good job, big fella!\u201d\n\nWhen Jost then brought up the story about Trump posting an anti-Joe Biden Nickelback meme on Twitter, Che added off-screen, \u201cSee, he\u2019s strong!\u201d\n\n\u201cI also want to point out that Nickelback is Canadian,\u201d Jost said. \u201cSo Trump was still technically using foreigners to go after Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nSNL Turns Kate McKinnon\u2019s Rudy Giuliani Into the Joker: \u2018I Killed on Hannity!\u2019\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
