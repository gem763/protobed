That\u2019s the way this country works.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that the Chinese company is now blacklisted by the U.S. government, Microsoft (along with chip manufacturer Intel), still profits from Huawei, offering continued support for its laptops.\n\nMicrosoft also continues to sell products from Chinese company Hikvision, which has also been placed on a U.S. blacklist. It has also partnered with Hikvision for a summit on intelligence and security.\n\nThe Senators\u2019 letter warns Microsoft that the threat posed by Huawei is \u201creal and urgent.\u201d\n\nCiting a myriad of Huawei-related scandals, including the transfer of data from the Chinese-built African Union headquarters to servers in Shanghai, theft of advanced robotics technology from T-Mobile in the U.S., theft of intellectual property from Cisco, the apparently deliberate installation of security vulnerabilities in Huawei products, and numerous Huawei employees who are also employed by Chinese intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe evidence, in conjunction with testimony from U.S. government officials and our allies, Britain, Japan, and Australia, makes a compelling case that Huawei servers as an intelligence-gathering apparatus for the Chinese state,\u201d conclude the Senators.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said, \u2018Huawei is the means by which China would get into our networks and our systems, and either attempt to extract information or to corrupt it, to undermine what we\u2019re trying to do'\u201d.\n\nThe Senators write that they \u201csympathize\u201d with Microsoft\u2019s concern that it and other businesses aren\u2019t allowed access to classified evidence on Huawei, and suggest that the intelligence community \u201ccould share more of this intelligence in an appropriate fashion to affected businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would welcome further conversation with Microsoft and other businesses about coordinating such briefings.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
