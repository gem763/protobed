Photo: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\n\nEvery fall, right around the time the temperature starts to dip to the ideal shorts-and-sweater weather, we honor a sublime Harvest Moon \u2014 the last full moon to fall before the autumnal equinox. While it\u2019s an occurrence that always deserves celebration (and one that can bring up strong emotions) this year\u2019s is especially divine: It falls on Friday the 13th.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Isn\u2019t this coincidence more ominous than glorious? Not to be rude, but no. Before the patriarchy stole this day from women and turned it into a sinister day of bad luck and free tattoos, Friday the 13th was considered an ideal time to worship the Goddess. Another ideal time: full moons. Today is especially rare because the full moon coincides with Friday the 13th. The last time a nationwide full moon fell on this day was on October 13, 2000, when Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cCome on Over (All I Want Is You)\u201d was the No. 1 song in the U.S.\n\nAside from stepping outside at 12:33 a.m. ET to gaze at her shining body as she peaks, let us suggest a few other ways to celebrate this divine day, aside from feeling incredibly emotional. (The full moon is in sensitive Pisces \u2014 a mutable water sign associated with empathy, intuition, wisdom, and Melissa Broder \u2014 so yes, you will cry). The next one won\u2019t coincide with Friday the 13th until 2049, according to the Farmers Almanac, and who knows what shape the Earth will be in then.\n\n\u2022 Free bleed\n\n\u2022 Stand in front of a mirror and openly weep\n\n\u2022 Perform a moon ritual\n\n\u2022 Pull out your beeswax candles and selenite, and honor Frigg, the beloved Norse sky goddess associated with love, marriage, and fertility (from whom Friday derives its name!!)\n\n\u2022 Plant your fall crops, e.g. broccoli and beans\n\n\u2022 Address every goat, regardless of color, as Black Philip\n\n\u2022 Dip your feet into your nearest body of water and think longingly about the life you want to lead (were you to not be crushed by student debt, medical bills, your rising cost of living, etc.)\n\n\u2022 Drink red wine out of a chalice\n\n\u2022 Update your list of favorite places to cry publicly\n\n\u2022 Honor the feminine by revisiting the inspiring photos of Gillian Anderson showing off her whale tail and young Susan Sarandon letting her big cans out on a balcony\n\n\u2022 Sing \u201cFuck it I love you\u201d by Lana to the moon\n\n\u2022 Perform the final dance from Suspiria\n\n\ufeff\u2022 Dress in head-to-toe velvet and/or wear a cape, \u00e0 la Billy Porter at the 2019 Oscars\n\n\u2022 Text your ex (just kidding \u2014 using this opportunity to explicitly tell you to NOT do that)\n\n\u2022 Listen to Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cCome on Over (All I Want Is You)\u201d\n\nBless\u2019d be!\n\nStay in touch.
