The results are awkward and stirring in a way that memes often are, and the clip spread like wildfire. Jenner\u2019s riff might now evoke as much of a Pavlovian response as the iPhone\u2019s chilling radar alarm. It\u2019s like she listened to Lady Gaga\u2019s glory note at the climax of \u201cShallow\u201d and said, \u201cHold my beer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now, some news for the \u201cRise and Shine\u201d hive: The Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday that Jenner has applied to trademark the phrase. If accepted, the trademark would apply to cosmetics and various forms of apparel, such as jackets, undergarments and footwear. Just like that, A Meme Is Monetized.\n\nOf course, Jenner, who has clearly inherited her mother\u2019s business acumen, didn\u2019t wait to cash in on her sudden surge in popularity. The official Kylie Jenner store includes a $65 black hoodie with the phrase on its sleeves \u2014 stylized \u201cRiiise + shiiinnee\u201d \u2014 that is already sold out. Another sweatshirt, also sold out, recalls the Microsoft Paint aesthetic and features Jenner\u2019s face in a pink sun and a smattering of music notes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe riff even entered the sportsphere when the Golden State Warriors posted a TikTok of point guard Steph Curry dancing to it \u201cfor the 67th time today.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a KarJenner has made money off a meme. Big sister Kim Kardashian West, for instance, made Kimoji and phone cases out of her famous crying face. But given the hastening speed of online joke cycles (and general exhaustion with this particular family) it\u2019ll be interesting to see how successfully Jenner is able to continue monetizing this one.\n\n\u201cRise and Shine\u201d might overcome those obstacles, given that it even seems to have infiltrated the brains of those in KarJenner-averse circles. Will someone \u2014 Kylie Jenner, maybe \u2014 get this rising star a billboard?\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The 22-year-old billionaire strikes again.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nvlOsjVzXuqDI4cYAjBpAzOOEos=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B6J4ZQW75EI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
