He has since made gun reform a central focus of his tenure.\n\nAlthough the Democrat-led House has passed a version of gun reform legislation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly refused to put a gun reform bill on the floor unless it is first approved by the president.", "description": "Sandy Hook Promise, a gun safety advocacy group, released a powerful new back-to-school ad amid the gun reform debate in Washington.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/promise-ap-er-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
