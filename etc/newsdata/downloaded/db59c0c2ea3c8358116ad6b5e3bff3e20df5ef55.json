Photo: Kino Lorber\n\nIn the opening scenes of Nadav Lapid\u2019s Synonyms, Yoav (Tom Mercier), a young Israeli man who has just arrived in France without a penny to his name, wakes up in the mysteriously empty, spacious building where he\u2019s camped out for the night, goes into the shower, and briefly jerks off. Stepping out of the bathroom, he finds that his clothes have been taken (we never find out by whom) and he runs, naked and frantic, among the building\u2019s many bare rooms looking for them, gradually getting colder, until he seems ready to freeze. It\u2019s a situation that starts off as a joke, then transforms into an anxiety dream, then a dance \u2014 there\u2019s a tight, performative grace to Mercier\u2019s movements \u2014 and then an existential threat\u2014 Yoav winds up back in the bathtub, desperately rubbing his arms and legs trying to get warm \u2014 before landing in the realm of metaphor. The young man has found himself naked and alone and possessionless in a strange new land, at the mercy of the very air around him, unable to hide.\n\nHe\u2019s also, it seems, ripe for reinvention. When the posh French couple that lives upstairs, Emile (Quentin Dolmaire) and Caroline (Louise Chevillotte), discover Yoav, they give him Emile\u2019s clothes. For the young man, who hopes never to see Israel again, and who refuses even to speak Hebrew anymore, it feels like a new beginning, especially since Emile\u2019s clothes make him feel like a dandy, or maybe even royalty. But right from the beginning, there\u2019s a slightly sexual edge to the Parisian duo\u2019s interest in Yoav; Emile notes that he\u2019s uncircumcised. Later, Yoav will find that his body is an endless source of fascination for those around him, including a pornographer who wants to put him in a sexual scenario with an Arab woman.\n\nThroughout, there remains an air of trauma around Yoav. He has stories \u2014 vague ones \u2014 about his life and his disturbing experiences in the Israeli military, and we sense his rage and desire to break free. The idea of death is never far: When he first wakes up and sees Emile and Caroline, he asks, \u201cIs this death?\u201d When they give him a plastic bag, he refers to it as \u201ca bag for cadavers.\u201d Stalking the streets, tensely reciting French words and phrases to himself, his head down in concentration and maybe fear, his thoughts keep turning to violence, repression, cruelty, humiliation. He recalls his admiration as a child for Hector, the legendary warrior of Troy. He then remembers that his parents refused to tell him what happened to Hector; promises of military glory rarely acknowledge the gross murder that is its constant companion. A flash image of a man\u2019s body being dragged \u2014 much as Hector\u2019s was \u2014 from the back of a van at night, along a slick, busy street in Israel, hints at the horrors that crowd the young Yoav\u2019s mind, though we have no idea if this represents a memory, a projection, or a nightmare.\n\nSynonyms is based loosely on Lapid\u2019s own experiences, when, in his early 20s, not long after completing his military service, he fled to France. \u201cAttaching my future to Israel would be a disaster,\u201d he recalled thinking, in a 2014 Bomb Magazine interview. \u201cI wanted my life to revolve around the sky, trees, love, sex, human nature, and not whether or not to have a peace contract with the Palestinians, whether to give them Gaza, and so on \u2026 I felt strangled by this place.\u201d Much like Synonyms\u2019 protagonist, Lapid himself swore not to speak Hebrew, and wandered the streets with a French dictionary. And, much like other exiles before him, he discovered an inconvenient fact: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt myself so Israeli as when I was in Paris,\u201d he says in that same interview.\n\nFor all this raw sense of darkness, Synonyms\u2019 narrative is somewhat elliptical, its tone hovering between bemused and deadpan. Characters sometimes speak in non sequiturs, break into dances, or start fights. Lapid\u2019s framing is achingly precise, except when it\u2019s not; whenever Yoav goes for his head-down walks, the camera drifts feverishly along streets and among feet, assuming his point of view. (When the young man finally looks up, he sees Notre-Dame.)\n\nBut for all the artful obliqueness of Lapid\u2019s approach, the autobiographical background of the story lends it a lived-in honesty; the incidents and interactions of Synonyms feel both symbolic and true. One could compare the picture to Palestinian director Elia Suleiman\u2019s similarly excellent \u2014 though far more absurdist \u2014 It Must Be Heaven, a comedy about exile in which the filmmaker flees Bethlehem for Europe and America, only to discover that the whole world has effectively become Palestine. Something similar happens to Yoav: He takes a French class and recites the French national anthem, with its references to a land being soaked in the blood of the impure; aggression and death and fear and violence are everywhere, for those attuned to them.\n\nWhen Yoav falls in with a group of macho security workers at the Israeli embassy, it might at first seem odd that a guy seeking to start a new life might hang out with people who would remind him of his past. It might also seem odd that he\u2019d become fast friends with Yaron (Uria Hayik), a tough-minded, somewhat delusional colleague who\u2019s the flipside of Yoav. Instead of hiding his identity, Yaron tells everybody he meets that he\u2019s Jewish, and from Israel, right away; he also fantasizes about how he might have stopped various terrorist attacks in France. In one of the film\u2019s most memorable scenes, Yaron slaps a yarmulke on his head in the subway and hums the Israeli national anthem while stomping around, staring directly into passengers\u2019 faces. They turn away from him so quietly and with so little outward puzzlement that I wondered if this was meant to be a bizarre dream sequence, until I realized that this is probably what I\u2019d do too if some random guy on a subway started staring at me and singing \u201cHatikvah.\u201d That\u2019s part of the beauty of this film: It games out very real, very human impulses to their surreal breaking points, only to uncover even greater truths.\n\nYaron might be Yoav\u2019s diametrical opposite, but in truth, the two men represent something fundamental. Yoav is unable to discard his identity, because it\u2019s more than an identity \u2014 it is a self; the very fact that he wants so desperately to shed it means that he cannot. The film is built around this inescapability, both narratively and formally: All its ellipses and repetitions, its shifts in style and tone, its raw fascination with bodies and movement, circle around this sense of cognitive, corporeal entrapment. Our sense of being in the world is life\u2019s most infernal chicken-and-egg question.
