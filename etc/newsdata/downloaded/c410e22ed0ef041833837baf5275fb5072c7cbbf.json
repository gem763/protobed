The World Bank CEO and former European commissioner had been a candidate for United Nations secretary-general in 2016. Georgieva will bring an eye for green investment and gender equality to her new role.\n\nNIGHT OF THE $250,000 SELFIES: Luckily for U.S. President Donald Trump, he got to spend the early evening Wednesday surrounded by rich and generous friends, raising campaign cash in a 20,000-square-foot former members\u2019 club on East 86th Street belonging to John Paulson, a money manager. Guests didn\u2019t use the pool, but would have enjoyed \u201cportraits of the 12 Caesars \u2026 decorated with swags and oxen heads,\u201d according to the New York Times. Wednesday\u2019s dinner and a second event this morning are expected to rake in $8 million for his campaign.\n\nTrump cleared out around 8:30 p.m., after his security closed New York\u2019s Museum Mile along the 5th Avenue side of Central Park to traffic during sunset. It\u2019s a beautiful and peaceful way to enjoy New York for lucky cross-town walkers like Playbook.\n\nHappy Thursday. UNGA is beginning to unwind. After a buzzy pre-game, and intense climate discussions at the start of the week, the energy disappeared yesterday as top leaders jetted out and Trump found himself on the wrong side of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nA message from S&P Global: Today, investors who apply an ESG lens are growing worldwide as they realize the risks of separating ESG from business fundamentals.

Security Council on Wednesday in an effort to preserve the agreement, which has been slowly falling apart since Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from it last year.\n\nYou know things are tough when the most upbeat line that Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, could muster after the meeting was: \u201cFirst of all, the agreement is still in place.\u201d In place, perhaps. Also on life support, definitely.\n\n\u2018Increasingly difficult:\u2019 Noting that the deal hinges on Iran complying with limits on its nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits tied to the lifting of economic sanctions, Mogherini said: \u201cOn both elements, there is full determination to try and preserve the agreement. On both elements there are challenges and there is a will to try and preserve the deal. I will not hide that it is increasingly difficult to do it.\u201d She urged Iran to return to full compliance.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif did not come to the stakeout microphone, but in response to a shouted question, told reporters: \u201cIt was a good meeting.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is still hoping that his diplomatic flurry in New York this week will ultimately lead to a landmark meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. But with Trump distracted by the impeachment frenzy, any immediate breakthrough seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nEAST RIVER OR BLACK SEA? Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lashed out at the U.S. for denying visas to members of the Russian delegation, including at least 10 foreign ministry employees because they are under U.S. sanctions. In an interview with the Russian newspaper Kommersant, published Wednesday, Lavrov said that denying the visas was a violation of U.S. international obligations as the host country, and he recalled that when the U.N. was founded, Joseph Stalin had suggested putting the headquarters in Sochi, the Russian resort city on the Black Sea. \u201cNow, apparently, we will have to raise the question of what to do with the U.N. headquarters,\u201d Lavrov told the newspaper. \u201cSuch rudeness cannot be tolerated.\u201d\n\nANOTHER NUCLEAR TREATY AT RISK? Lavrov, in a speech Wednesday, slammed the U.S. for never ratifying the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Washington in recent months has accused Moscow of violating the treaty, which Russia ratified in 2000, and some U.S. lawmakers have suggested Trump should \u201cun-sign\u201d it. Russia and the U.S. have each pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty \u2014 it officially collapsed last month \u2014 and the U.S. recently tested a new missile that would have been banned by that agreement, further raising fears among experts that the global nuclear nonproliferation architecture is being dismantled.\n\nNeed more solitude? If you need some inner peace while at U.N. HQ, the wooden benches next to the Rose Garden are a good option (the view here), and provide shade during the middle of the day.\n\nIn search of originality: The cliche of the week is that leaders and executives should stop the speeches and bring concrete plans to U.N. discussions. If all the speeches against speeches turned into reality, we might find UNGA 2020 is reduced to an online document hub.\n\nYEMEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT: Today Yemen, Kuwait, Sweden and the U.K. are co-hosting a meeting that will include the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany, examining the conflict in Yemen. The International Crisis Group notes that \u201cthe U.N. has spent much of this year struggling to persuade the Yemeni government and the Houthi movement to implement a December 2018 agreement to demilitarize the port of Hodeida, a crucial conduit for food imports.\u201d\n\nGlimmer of hope: The Houthis have announced a unilateral halt on drone and missile attacks on Saudi territory.\n\nTrump, Ukraine and Impeachment\n\nTHE MEETING OF THE YEAR HAS BECOME A PLATFORM FOR TENSE JOKES: With part of his country occupied by its aggressive neighbor Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky can\u2019t afford to lose rich and powerful friends. Zelensky needs all the money and protection both the United States and European Union countries can provide. So it was no wonder he wanted to keep out of U.S politics, and flatter Trump in his July call and Wednesday New York press conference. While Zelensky said his July call with Trump was \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s worth remembering that given the standards of Ukraine politics, that is not saying much.\n\nThis is a disaster for Zelensky: He can\u2019t afford to aggravate allies like Germany and the EU (which has pumped more than $16 billion into Ukraine in recent years, and delivered a far-reaching free trade deal), and it\u2019s now likely that nothing short of investigating the Biden family will keep him in Trump\u2019s good books.\n\nTrump rented a parallel swamp, POLITICO\u2019s David Herszenhorn writes. Ukraine politics is messy: It comes with corruption, yet it\u2019s a competitive democracy. The country attracts people who want to make a bunch of money burnishing a client\u2019s reputation and/or winning them office, and mixes it with the dangerous added ingredients of messy energy markets and a low-paid, high-skilled tech workforce. Few people who dive into this emerge without mud attached to them.\n\nCaption this: Zelensky\u2019s face when Trump said, \u201cI really hope you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem.\"\n\nHERE\u2019S NATASHA BERTRAND\u2019S LINE-BY-LINE ANALYSIS of the Trump-Zelensky partial phone call transcript.\n\nLeader Watch\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: Al Jazeera has an in-depth visualization of how every country has voted over the years at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nPROVISIONAL LIST OF TODAY\u2019S LEADER SPEECHES: Ethiopia\u2019s President Sahle-Work Zewde is the biggest name in the morning lineup. Zoran Zaev, prime minister of North Macedonia, will make his country\u2019s first appearance under its new name in the afternoon. And the European Council\u2019s Donald Tusk is due to address the General Assembly at around 1 p.m.\n\nPOLAND HITS BACK AT MACRON: Polish President Andrzej Duda hit back at Emmanuel Macron Wednesday after the French president blamed Warsaw for blocking EU climate ambitions. Poland recently led resistance to a proposed commitment of making the EU carbon neutral by 2050, which the Czech Republic, Hungary and Estonia also rejected.\n\n\u201cThere is one country that blocked everything, it\u2019s Poland. My objective over the next few months is to convince the Polish to move,\u201d Macron said. Duda told Polish media on Wednesday that Macron\u2019s statement was \u201cat the least inelegant because it wasn\u2019t true. We organized COP24\u201d \u2014 the U.N.\u2019s annual climate jamboree \u2014 \u201clast year in Katowice ... We consensually approved the Katowice rulebook, the rules that say how to implement the Paris Agreement.\u201d\n\nPolicy Theme of the Day\n\nGOING GLOBAL BY GOING LOCAL: Did you know? Today, fewer than two in five countries have an explicit national strategy for cities and few of them address climate change in the strategies they have, according to a new report by the Coalition for Urban Transitions.\n\nTHE ZERO CARBON CITIES MOVEMENT: The Coalition for Urban Transitions claims \u201cfaster, fairer economic development by investing in zero-carbon cities.\u201d The coalition claims it\u2019s cheaper to invest now (before another billion people are added to the population of the world\u2019s cities over the next 10 years), and that savings of US$24 trillion could be reaped by 2050 if the changes are adopted soon. The already 820 million people who live in coastal zones less than 10 meters above sea level could be the biggest winners.\n\nFor his part, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said, \u201cIt is possible and realistic to realize net-zero urban emissions by 2050. But to get there, we will need the full engagement of city governments combined with national action and support.\u201d The Coalition has collected case studies from Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Rwanda and South Korea.\n\nRead this: Five cities of the future, by POLITICO\u2019s Charlie Duxbury.\n\nLOCAL BUSINESS: The U.N. Global Compact\u2019s Making Global Goals Local Business campaign is a multi-year strategy to drive business to help achieve the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n\nMeeting those goals: A new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation shows that while \u201cprogress on health and development continues unabated,\u201d global inequality remains a \u201cmajor barrier\u201d to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. \u201cVast inequalities within countries \u2026 are masked by averages,\u201d according to the report. \u201cGovernments should prioritize primary health care to deliver a health system that works for the poorest, digital governance to ensure that governments are responsive to their least-empowered citizens, and more support for farmers to help them adapt to climate change\u2019s worst effects.\u201d\n\nWEF UpLink: The World Economic Forum is creating UpLink, \u201ca new digital crowd engagement platform to foster mass participation to meet the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\u201d Collaborators with WEF include Deloitte, Microsoft and Salesforce. The initiative appears to be an extension of the Forum\u2019s TopLink app for delegates to the Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos.\n\nDARK ENOUGH TO SEE THE STARS: Today a bunch of celebrities Playbook isn\u2019t authorized to mention by name will push for $350 billion in annual investment to end extreme poverty, in what organizers call \u201cThe POSSIBLE Dream.\u201d They\u2019re promising a year-long campaign culminating on Sept. 26, 2020 with the \u201clargest cause-related live event broadcast in history across 5 continents.\u201d Think of it as Band Aid for the post-millennial generation, but instead of Queen, you\u2019ll have to live with folks like Chris Martin.\n\nWINDOW INTO THE WORLD OF ACTIVIST THINKING: Jamie Drummond, the co-founder of ONE, wrote to his network of \u201cUNGA-Bubble Busters\u201d to urge a \u201csuper year of activism\u201d in 2020. Those who want to see the U.N.\u2019s global goals achieved need to \u201cmove from a B2B brand between a few corporations and NGOs\u201d to a \u201cwider awareness, action and accountability platform\u201d via a revolution in \u201cfinancing, innovation diffusion and data.\u201d\n\nOne of the most interesting campaigns he is pushing is \u201cMake My Money Matter\u201d to push people to urge their pension providers to \u201creflect their values of equality and sustainability. That\u2019s after all what pensions are for, a sustainable safe future \u2026 Watch this space.\u201d The final \u201cuncomfortable question in the air\u201d this week is \u201cAre you 2030 Goals compliant?\u201d The answer for most organizations, Drummond says, is \u201cno.\u201d\n\nBUSINESS AVENGERS: To Drummond\u2019s point, 17 global giants with $500 billion in revenue and 900,000 employees have created \u201cBusiness Avengers,\u201d a group committed to complying with the U.N.\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (Global Goals) by 2030.

And so with Beyond Carbon Mike [Bloomberg] put down a marker that he is going to spend his personal money to support candidates for public office who are great on climate change and to those who are blocking progress. He's going to work to kick them out of office.\u201d\n\nAre we talking local or presidential races? \u201cWe see tons of examples where these really important decisions about electricity and transportation are decided by everything from a local permitting board or city board to a public utility commission, all the way up to the state legislators who are making really important decisions on whether or not to pass laws on things like 100 percent clean energy standards.\u201d\n\nA message from S&P Global: \u201cA growing number of companies are including sustainability in their corporate strategies and investment decisions.

JOB TITLE OF THE WEEK \u2014 USGHRFLDCLDCSIDS: Fekitamoeloa Katoa \u2018Utoikamanu is the Undersecretary General and High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Development States.\n\nHIGH-CLASS ESCORT SERVICE: Wednesday\u2019s Bloomberg Business Forum was \u2026 an experience. Playbook arrived late to a rabbit warren, accessible only via escort. If you wanted the toilet, you needed to resubmit to another security check. To attend a roundtable \u2014 let\u2019s say, on gender equality \u2014 one needed to ask permission to organizers. If granted, reporters were then taken to a holding area via an extensive tour of stairwells, kitchen corridors and stages being dismantled. Also en route: a staged wall of green artificial flowers (let\u2019s hope it wasn\u2019t single use plastic). Once in the holding area, it became apparent that to join a session, you had to agree to stay the whole session of one hour or more, because leaving the session also required an escort. It wouldn\u2019t do to have rogue journalists floating around the Plaza Hotel. The staff were lovely. The system they managed needs to change.\n\nSO STYLISHLY SUSTAINABLE: With young Swede Greta Thunberg capturing so many headlines this week, Playbook went in search of greenie Swedes to find out what they thought of her. Over champagne cocktails in the street level showroom of the Swedish residence on Park Avenue, reputed to be the last single family home on the avenue, the answer was clear. Swedes, both in government and the global business community, are proud of Thunberg, even if she\u2019s not always proud of them.\n\nSSAB, the largest Swedish steel company, told the crowd about how they are working to make steel with hydrogen rather than coal, which has for 1,000 years been essential to steel making. A pilot plant is set to open in 2020 and they want fossil fuel-free steel to the market in 2026.\n\nSICK OF LA GUARDIA AIRPORT DELAYS?

CULTURE WARS: It\u2019s a case of nearly anything goes in the corridors of U.N. HQ. Just as NGOs are using the streets and hotels around New York as a giant megaphone, national governments are doing the same inside the organization\u2019s modernist buildings. U.N. member states may book floor and wall space to promote pet projects, even pet individuals \u2014 say, one\u2019s king. So, in addition to brochures promoting the United Nations credit union and internal complaints system, so far this week we\u2019ve seen exhibitions from Egypt in the ground floor corridor, Saudis promoting the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, Bahranis praising King Hamad, and China dedicating a hallway to President Xi Jinping.\n\nSPOTTED: Meg Ryan at the Bank of America Goals House nightcap, which highlighted the bank\u2019s partnership with RED, which is working toward the first AIDS-free generation in 30 years by providing HIV positive mothers with essential antiretroviral drugs for keeping them healthy and their babies HIV-free.
