But there were failures for the likes of Trisha Chetty (14) and Mignon du Preez (16), while stand-in captain Sune Luus was restricted to 22.\n\nKapp\u2019s contribution did help SA to at least cross 150, but none of the bottom five recorded double figures.\n\nWith a target of 165, South Africa needed to strike early but they didn\u2019t.\n\nOpeners Punia and Jemimah Rodrigues (55 off 65 balls, 7 fours) put on 83 for the first wicket to knock off half the runs, with the former going on to carry her bat alongside Punam Raut (16) and skipper Mithali Raj (11 not out) in a comfortable Indian win.\n\nNondumiso Shangase (1/39) and Nadine de Klerk (1/29) were the wicket-takers for the visitors.", "description": "Marizanne Kapp\u2019s half-century was not enough to rally the Proteas Women after a poor start as they fell to an eight-wicket loss to India on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8515/3536caf701f249bf84c02e4e9affd399.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
