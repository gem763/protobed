The President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to request for comment Thursday about the whistleblower complaint.\n\nDemocrats say the President was using the U.S. Justice Department to help him as part of a plot to dig up dirt on one of his political opponents to increase his chances of keeping power in the next election. These are extraordinary allegations, unseen since the Richard Nixon era. \u201cIt raises questions about abusing presidential power, and it\u2019s already akin to the 1970s with Nixon much more than the 1990s\u201d with Bill Clinton, says Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. Zelizer notes that Trump is not acting alone, as he suggested that the Ukrainian leader talk to Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe lines between his own personal interests and the boundaries of legit foreign policy are totally blurred,\u201d Zelizer says.\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking to distance Barr from the scandal. \u201cThe President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,\u201d Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.\u201d\n\nAccording to a memorandum of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy, which is at the heart of the whistleblower complaint, Trump asks for a \u201cfavor\u201d\u2014that Zelensky help Barr investigate the origins of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. \u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump said, according to the memo, which was released Wednesday and is not a direct transcript of the call.\n\nHe then also asks Zelensky to work with Barr to investigate Joe Biden\u2014 a potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election\u2014 and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine. \u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department denies that Trump ever followed up with Barr about this conversation, or that Barr ever spoke to Zelensky.\n\nAccording to Kupec, Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky had been referred to Justice Department as a possible violation of campaign finance law. The Justice Department decided that \u201cthere was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted,\u201d Kupec said in a statement, \u201cand that no further action was warranted.\u201d\n\nWhile Barr is a new focal point for concerns over the Administration\u2019s conduct with respect to Ukraine and alleged efforts to influence the election, the Justice Department as a whole continues to be dogged by questions of politicization, as it has throughout the Trump presidency. On Wednesday, under pressure from congressional Democrats, the Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel released an opinion explaining its legal rationale for determining that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint wasn\u2019t a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d and thus the Director of National Intelligence wasn\u2019t bound to turn it over to congressional intelligence committees.", "description": "There are new questions about William Barr's apparent involvement in Trump's alleged efforts to pressure a foreign nation to influence his political opponent", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mFoCmzCrXKyLfgAuZAFk0A--~B/aD0yMjM2O3c9MzM1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/aa2db16c19b7940d376dc2a9acfac054", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
