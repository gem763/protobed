Their argument was that \u201cproviding things like Javelins won\u2019t make the Russians get more aggressive, it\u2019ll actually cause them to back down more,\u201d said the U.S. official who worked on Ukraine issues.\n\nThat view found a sympathetic audience in the upper ranks of the Trump administration, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, according to the U.S. official. However, Trump reserved the final decision for himself. \u201cWhen it came down to it \u2014 and it took longer than we would have liked \u2014 ultimately he\u2019s the one that made the decision to give them those weapons systems,\u201d the official said.\n\nTrump made that decision in December 2017, including the missiles as part of a larger aid package. The official announcement did not specifically mention Javelins and was released just prior to Christmas. \u201cWe wanted to give them the aid, but we didn\u2019t want it to be a big news story,\u201d said the U.S. official who worked on Ukraine issues.\n\nExperts are divided as to how important the Javelins have been to Ukraine, where the war in the eastern Donbass region has been in a stalemate since the implementation of a formal ceasefire in early 2015.\n\nUkrainian soldier armed with a Javelin during a military parade in Kiev, Ukraine.
