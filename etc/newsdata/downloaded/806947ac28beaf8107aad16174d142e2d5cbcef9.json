That accident claimed the lives of 189 people\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) called the document \"concerning\" and said it was asking Boeing for an \"immediate\" explanation for the delay in turning over the documents, which Boeing provided to lawmakers ahead of hearings this month.\n\nBoeing boss Dennis Muilenburg is due to testify. He was recently stripped of the title of chairman of the company, though he remains chief executive.\n\nBoeing said it is cooperating with the investigation of the 737 Max, which has been grounded globally since March following the crashes. The company recently announced a permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services.\n\n\"We will continue to follow the direction of the FAA and other global regulators, as we work to safely return the 737 MAX to service,\" Boeing said.\n\nInvestigators of the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia have focused on the role played by a software system called MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly.\n\nInquiries have shown the software - and the failure of sensors - contributed to pilots not being able to control the aircraft.\n\nBoeing has blamed the crashes on erroneous data fed into the system. It has said it is revising the plane's software to improve safeguards.\n\nBut reviews have criticised Boeing and the FAA for inadequate oversight of the risks associated with the new software system.\n\nBoeing reportedly uncovered the messages, which date to 2016, \"some months ago\". The pilot no longer works for the company.\n\nIn response to the pilot's message, the other Boeing employee wrote: \"It wasn't (sic) a lie, no one told us that was the case\".\n\nShares in the company dropped more than 5% on Friday following the reports.", "description": "A pilot allegedly wrote that he had \"unknowingly\" lied to regulators during tests of the 737 Max.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/50D0/production/_109288602_boeing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
