Despite the satellite service\u2019s struggles, as consumers drop their TV connections, it still contributes a sizable volume of cash flow and customer accounts to its parent.\n\nAT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion. The company\u2019s shrinking satellite business is under a microscope after activist investor Elliott Management Corp. disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T last week and released a report pushing for strategic changes. Elliott has told investors that AT&T should unload DirecTV, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.\n\nThere could be regulatory hurdles to any deal with Dish, which has about 12 million subscribers. When Dish\u2019s predecessor EchoStar Communications Corp. and DirecTV\u2019s former owner Hughes Electronics Corp. tried to merge in 2001, regulators ultimately blocked it on antitrust grounds, worried that many rural Americans would be left with only a single option to get their television service. More recently, Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen held talks to combine with DirecTV in 2014, but lost out to AT&T.\n\nOn the idea of merging the two satellite providers, AT&T finance chief John Stephens said, \u201cFrom a regulatory perspective, it hasn\u2019t been successful and I don\u2019t know that there is any change in that regulatory perspective.\u201d He added, speaking last week at an investor conference, \u201cI understand the industrial logic, but quite frankly it\u2019s been tried and has been rejected.\u201d\n\nJettisoning DirecTV would be an about-face for Mr. Stephenson, who billed the acquisition of the company as a bold move to diversify beyond the wireless phone business and tap into a growing media industry. The deal made AT&T the largest distributor of pay TV channels, ahead of Comcast Corp. DirecTV is now part of an entertainment and consumer wireline unit that made up 27% of AT&T\u2019s $173.3 billion revenue in 2018.\n\nAT&T executives have argued that DirecTV\u2019s millions of subscribers, combined with fiber-optic TV customers and cellphone users, give the telecom giant the scale it needs to compete with the likes of Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in entertainment and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google in advertising.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is it the right move for AT&T to part ways with the satellite service DirecTV? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Stephenson deepened AT&T\u2019s bet on media with the purchase last year of Time Warner Inc., after prevailing in an antitrust battle. He refused to divest itself of DirecTV when the Justice Department suggested that as a condition of approving the deal. The government lost the case.\n\nFor Mr. Stephenson, who has led AT&T for 12 years, parting ways with DirecTV would be an acknowledgment that a major cornerstone of his diversification strategy hasn\u2019t gone as planned. It also adds pressure for AT&T to deliver on the promise of the Time Warner deal. Mr. Stephenson has signaled he is prepared to step down as CEO as soon as next year, the Journal reported last week.\n\nThis month, Mr. Stephenson elevated his longtime lieutenant John Stankey to become chief operating officer, a move that sparked Elliott\u2019s decision to go public with its grievances about AT&T\u2019s yearslong empire-building strategy. Mr. Stankey was put in charge of DirecTV after AT&T acquired it and later moved to head up WarnerMedia, the renamed Time Warner unit inside AT&T. He is widely viewed as the heir apparent for the CEO job. But Elliott viewed his recent promotion to COO as hasty, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nAT&T had 26 million U.S. pay-TV customers after it bought DirecTV, but subscribers have declined at a brisk pace as cord-cutting drives them to other entertainment options. Its pay-TV business, which includes satellite TV, fiber-optic video service and online channels, ended the second quarter with fewer than 23 million customers. Mr. Stephens warned earlier this month at an investor conference that it will lose more customers in the third quarter.\n\nIn its letter to AT&T\u2019s board, Elliott said AT&T\u2019s DirecTV acquisition has come with \u201cdamaging results.\u201d The hedge fund criticized AT&T\u2019s glitch-filled launch of the DirecTV Now streaming service and questioned whether the numerous executive departures at DirecTV compounded AT&T\u2019s integration challenges. Elliott noted that poor results at DirecTV \u201cand general concern about the company\u2019s ability to execute\u201d were obscuring stronger results at AT&T\u2019s core telecom businesses.\n\nOne reason AT&T may ultimately decide to keep DirecTV aboard is AT&T\u2019s towering net debt load, which stood at more than $160 billion earlier this year. The cash generated by the pay-TV giant has helped pay down that debt and fueled other investments in the rest of the company.\n\nAny spinoff of DirecTV would be unlikely until mid-2020 at the earliest, five years after the deal closed, to make it a tax-efficient transaction for AT&T, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nDish, which is also struggling in the pay-TV business, would be a logical partner for DirecTV. People close to Dish say there are obvious synergies that would come from combining both the national satellite-TV operators, including stronger leverage in programming negotiations, a single control center and shared customer-support operations. Dish also sees value in the cash that the satellite-TV business generates, which could help fund its diversification into wireless, the people said.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at an investor conference in New York, Dish\u2019s Mr. Ergen said the question remains whether such a union would pass regulatory muster. \u201cWe look at everything,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is \u201ca unique time in Washington D.C.,\u201d said AT&T\u2019s Mr. Stephens, the CFO. Federal agencies earlier this year said they would approve the merger of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. , the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, but the deal is now being challenged by a coalition of state attorneys general. That merger also involves Dish, which stands to gain divested cellular assets if the T-Mobile-Sprint union survives the state challenge.\n\nDirecTV\u2019s domestic and international operations operate as separate units. Last year, AT&T explored taking DirecTV\u2019s Latin American unit public but shelved the initial public offering amid tepid interest from investors.\n\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com and Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "description": "AT&T is exploring parting with its DirecTV unit, people familiar with the matter said, a move that would mark a mark a sharp course correction in strategy for the phone giant.", "authors": ["Shalini Ramachandran", "Drew Fitzgerald", "Shalini.Ramachandran Wsj.Com", "Andrew.Fitzgerald Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108472/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
