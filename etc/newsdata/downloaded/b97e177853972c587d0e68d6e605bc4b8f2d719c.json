Management believes that this measure is important to many of the Corporation\u2019s shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders. The Corporation\u2019s method of calculating Operating Earnings may differ from other corporations and accordingly may not be comparable to measures used by other corporations.\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nFTG accomplished many goals in Q3 2019 that continue to improve the Corporation and position it for the future, including:\n\nBooked $34M in new orders in the quarter including over $8M in orders related to the simulator market\n\nAchieved sales of $28M, a 12% increase over Q3 2018\n\nAchieved trailing twelve month EBITDA of $15.3M\n\nAchieved net income of $1.8M and diluted earnings per share of $0.07 in Q3 2019, a $1.1M or 176% increase over Q3 2018\n\nOn July 15, 2019, FTG successfully closed the acquisition of Colonial Circuits Inc., in Fredericksburg, Virginia\n\nAchieved sales from Colonial of approximately $1.2M in the second half of Q3, and $0.1M EBITDA contribution from this period\n\nBegan the certification process for the Colonial facility to the Aerospace AS9100 certification with completion planned for early 2020, opening up significant new market opportunities for that site\n\nWorked with key suppliers to achieve material cost savings for the Colonial site, in line with costs at other existing FTG sites.\n\nReduced net debt to $0 at quarter end\n\nFor FTG, overall sales increased by $3.0M or 11.8% from $25.0M in Q3 2018 to $28.0M in Q3 2019. Both the Circuits and Aerospace segments contributed to the growth. Colonial Circuits contributed $1.2M in growth, for the Circuits segment. The Canadian dollar was 1 cent weaker in Q3 2019 compared to the same quarter last year. Year-to-date 2019 sales increased by $4.2M or 5.1%. Year-to-date 2018 included a $5M one-time adjustment with respect to the C919 development contract. Excluding this, the growth was $9.2M or 11.3%.\n\nThe Circuits Segment sales in Q3 2019 were $18.3M, up $1.9M or 11.8% versus Q3 2018. The growth came from Circuits Toronto, as well as the Colonial acquisition. For the year-to-date, sales were $52.8M compared to $46.7M in the same period last year.\n\nFor the Aerospace segment, sales in Q3 2019 were $9.6M compared to $8.6M in Q3 of last year. Aerospace Toronto and Tianjin were up whereas Aerospace Chatsworth was down slightly compared to the same quarter last year. On a year-to-date basis, sales were down $1.9M but excluding the one-time adjustment on the C919 development program, sales were up $3.1M or 8.9%.\n\nGross margins of $7.9M in Q3 2019 were up $2.0M compared to Q3 2018. The increase is due to higher sales, improved operating performance, and a small contribution from the Colonial Circuits acquisition. For the year-to-date, gross margins were $24.4M, up $6.4M or 35.5%. Year-to-date gross margins are 28.5% compared to 22.1% last year. The one-time $5M revenue adjustment on the C919 program last year was at very low margins. Operating performance in 2019 was improved across the Corporation.\n\nEarnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for FTG in Q3 2019 was $4.1M compared to $2.6M in Q3 2018. Trailing twelve month EBITDA is $15.3M. The Colonial Circuits acquisition contributed $0.1M of EBITDA in Q3 2019.\n\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA(2) to the net earnings for the trailing 12 months as at August 30, 2019.\n\nQ3 2019\n\nTrailing 12 Months Net earnings 1,783,000 6,709,000 Add: Interest 69,000 335,000 Income taxes/ITC 873,000 3,319,000 Depreciation/Amortization/Stock Comp 1,340,000 4,939,000 EBITDA $ 4,065,000 $ 15,302,000\n\n(2) EBITDA is not a measure recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d). Management believes that this measure is important to many of the Corporation\u2019s shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders. The Corporation\u2019s method of calculating EBITDA may differ from other corporations and accordingly may not be comparable to measures used by other corporations.\n\nNet profit after tax at FTG in Q3 2019 was $1.8M compared to a net profit of $0.6M in Q3 2018. Higher margins, were partially offset by higher R&D and SG&A costs and higher foreign exchange losses. For the year-to-date, net profit was $5.5M compared to $1.6M for the same period last year.\n\nThe Circuits segment net earnings before corporate and interest and other costs was $3.3M in Q3 2019 compared to $3.0M in Q3 2018.\n\nThe Aerospace net earnings before corporate and interest and other costs in Q3 2019 was $0.1M versus ($0.7M) in Q3 2018.\n\nAs at August 30, 2019, the Corporation\u2019s net working capital was $31.3M, an increase of $2.6M over year-end 2018. Colonial added approximately $1.0M in working capital on closing.\n\nCash flow in Q3 2019 was $6.0M compared to $0.5M in Q3 last year, after investments in capital equipment and deferred development. In Q3 2019, $3.8M was paid for the acquisition of Colonial Circuits, net of cash acquired. For the year-to-date period, cash flow was $6.4M compared to $3.7M last year.\n\nNet debt to EBITDA was 0:1 for the trailing 12 month period, as the net debt at the end of Q3 2019 was $nil.\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, Jamie Crichton was hired as Chief Financial Officer of FTG. Jamie brings significant experience in the Aerospace and Defense industry in a variety of senior finance positions in both private and public companies.\n\nAlso subsequent to quarter end, FTG was the subject of a cyberattack that impacted FTG\u2019s systems across North America. This had a negative impact on operations at FTG\u2019s North American sites in September. Each site was impacted differently with reduced operations ranging from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the impact to the site\u2019s infrastructure. Overall lost production is estimated at about 10% of quarterly sales but efforts are underway to mitigate this impact by quarter end. FTG is working with experts to determine the methodology used in the attack and steps to be taken to reduce the chances, and impact, of future attacks. Accelerated investments in network/system is planned in the coming months to address the findings.\n\nThe Corporation will host a live conference call on Thursday, October 10, 2019 at 8:30 am (EDT) to discuss the results of Q3 2019.\n\nAnyone wishing to participate in the call should dial 647-427-2311 or 1-866-521-4909 and the conference ID is 8979843.
