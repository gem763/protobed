I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as a Syrian human rights group said up to 100,000 civilians have been displaced by fighting since Turkey launched its offensive with shelling and airstrikes against Kurdish strong points and cities on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLarge convoys of civilian cars were still heading south towards the cities of Hasekah and Tel Temir in a bid to flee the fighting on Thursday morning.\n\nTurkey, which says it wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border, said it had seized all its designated objective for the first day and that the operation continued to go as planned.\n\n\"Our heroic commandos taking part in Operation Peace Spring are continuing to advance east of the Euphrates (river),\" the Defence Ministry wrote on Twitter. \"The designated targets were seized,\" it said in a later statement.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said they had repulsed a Turkish attack on the city of Tel Abyad and said claims Turkey had made any advance east the the Euphrates were false.\n\nA spokesman for the National Army, a Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group, said its fighters were moving towards both cities in support of the Turkish army, but denied SDF reports of heavy clashes near Tel Abyad.\n\nWitnesses said there was shelling around Ras al Ain, also known as Sani Kani, the border town that appears to be a key Turkish objective for the campaign.\n\nThe SDF also said they have come under attack by Islamic State sleeper cell taking advantage of the Turkish offensive.\n\nFive Isil fighters were killed in a failed attack on security forces in the village of Tweimiyeh, near the Turkish border, on Thursday morning, the group said.\n\n\u201cDaesh sleep cells this Thursday morning tried to take over al Twimiyah villages to hit security and cause chaos by targeting one of our military points,\u201d the SDF said in a statement.\n\n\u201cA number of them were killed and the rest were captured.\u201d\n\nThe reported attack came as Kurdish authorities accused Turkey of a \u201cclear attempt\u201d to help Isil prisoners escape by shelling a prison holding militants of more than 60 nationalities.\n\nShelling on Wednesday night targeted part of the Chirkin prison in the city of Qamishli, Kurdish-led authorities said in a statement.
