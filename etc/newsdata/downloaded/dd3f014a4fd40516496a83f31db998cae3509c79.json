While the health implications are unclear, here are a few ways you can avoid microplastics if you\u2019d like to minimise how much you\u2019re exposed to.\n\nHow To Reduce 'Water Waste' In Your Diet Water is becoming an increasing scarce resource. Meanwhile, a small chocolate bar requires 21 litres of water to produce. A glass of wine requires 41 litres and a single serve of potato crisps 23 litres. When you add it all up, that's a lot of H2O! It's time we all attempted to reduce water use in our diets. Here are some tips.

Sherri Mason, a chemist who has studied plastic in drinking water, tells Consumer Reports that you\u2019ll be ingesting plastic either way, but there\u2019s generally less in tap water.\n\nFor the same reason, any food or beverage packaged in plastic will likely transfer some plastic to your food, so you may wish to use glass or metal containers for food instead of plastic ones.\n\nKnow which foods have the most microplastics\n\nThis is an area of active study, so answers here might change in the future. But so far we know that shellfish contain lots of microplastics (since they eat them in the ocean, and we often eat them whole). Fish and land animals can have microplastics in their guts, too, but we usually don\u2019t eat that part of them.\n\nThe amount of microplastic you\u2019ll ingest is still small from any one source, but for now it seems likely that plant-based foods, and foods that are not wrapped or packaged in plastic, will expose you to the least microplastics.\n\nVacuum your house\n\nThe dust in your house is a collection of microscopic debris, which means it probably contains plenty of microplastics. One study estimated that our food picks up more microplastics from the air and dust in our house than the amount that was originally in the food. A good vacuum and possibly an air filter could reduce the microplastics that make their way into your food and air.", "description": "Microscopic bits of plastic are everywhere.
