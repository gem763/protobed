Then it\u2019s off to the Senate for a trial and, potentially, conviction. Neat and tidy \u2014 and, certainly, useful when considering the process-based complaints being made by President Trump\u2019s allies. Grand juries don\u2019t operate in public or involve input from attorneys for the accused, one line of argument goes, so why should the House investigation?\n\nAs with everything in Washington, though, it's not that simple.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFew people are as well-versed in the process of investigating a president than former White House counsel John W. Dean. Dean served President Richard Nixon until 1973, when he decided to instead aid investigators in the Watergate scandal. In detailed public testimony, Dean revealed his involvement in Nixon\u2019s efforts to undermine his political opponents and the investigation into his activities. But Dean\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t start that way.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that the prior modern impeachment proceedings have all been initiated in private and in closed proceedings, unlike they\u2019re claiming they should be now,\u201d Dean told The Washington Post this week. \u201cThe Nixon proceeding was done \u2014 the stuff that really counted was all done in a grand jury. Before the Senate Watergate Committee and public hearings, they had closed hearings. They had executive session hearings.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own testimony, I spent, I don\u2019t know, maybe six, eight, 10 weeks with Sam [Dash] going over it in private,\u201d Dean said, referring to the chief counsel for the Senate committee investigating Watergate, chaired by then-Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.). \u201cThere, only Sam Ervin and Sam Dash were the only ones that \u2014 I was unwilling to do the norm because I said, listen, if you get this out and in circulation, they will be dragging bushes everywhere. It will all disappear. I said I just am not willing to do it. So we did it on that arrangement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis, of course, is a key reason grand jury proceedings and criminal investigations are similarly kept under wraps, or, to use another salient example, Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nOver the course of the conversation with Dean, though, the gaps in the criminal investigation analogy to impeachment became increasingly apparent. For one thing, the Senate trial isn\u2019t really what we would think of as a trial. As Dean pointed out, it\u2019s more like a bench trial, with the Senate acting as both judge and jury \u2014 in a process where it can also make up new rules as it goes along.\n\nThere are guidelines for how things should progress in the Senate. Dean pointed to a 1986 memo detailing procedures for impeachment trials in the Senate, written in part by the then-Senate parliamentarian Robert Dove. But the memo also \u201cshows that the Senate drafts its own rules as it goes along, typically, and there\u2019s a lot of flexibility,\u201d Dean said. That\u2019s important to consider when assessing the current process complaints. If the House votes to impeach Trump, the process and trial are then in the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s hands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe analogy to the criminal process is useful, particularly at this early stage, Dean said, but it \u201cbarely\u201d applies as a guide to what to expect because of the flexibility the Senate has.\n\n\u201cA criminal trial is so highly structured, and not following the procedure for a criminal trial is cause for a mistrial. And that can result in either dismissal or a retrial,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas impeachment, that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nThat also means that objections to process based on expectations from criminal trials are often unfounded. Consider \u201cdue process,\u201d a complaint central to Republican objections to the current inquiry. The impeachment clause in the Constitution doesn't include any due process stipulations; in fact, due process in the criminal system wasn't added until amendments to the Constitution were ratified. (This might flummox Republicans who insist upon constitutional originalism, Dean pointed out.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not because impeachment was an abstract concept to the drafters of the Constitution. Shortly before the Constitutional Convention began in 1787, the British governor general of India, Warren Hastings, had been arrested and brought to Parliament to face the legislative proceeding of impeachment. Hastings was cleared eight years later.\n\nIn Dean\u2019s estimation, the existing House inquiry is perhaps too open.\n\n\u201cIt helps the targets\u201d to have public awareness of the evidence being gathered, he said. \u201cThat was one of the articles of impeachment for Nixon, who was pumping the head of the criminal division, Henry Peterson, about what the grand jury was doing. And then he was turning around and feeding that grand jury information to [his aides H.R.] Haldeman and [John] Ehrlichman so they could deal with it. And that became part of one of the abuses of process for him. There is a reason to do these things in closed sessions.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe hearings that have been conducted by the House have included a number of Republicans, including staunch Trump allies like Reps. Lee Zeldin (N.Y.) and Devin Nunes (Calif.). As Republicans publicly complain about a lack of access, Dean argued that it was extremely unlikely that Trump\u2019s team was in the dark.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just confident that Trump has a back channel to the Republicans who are on one of those committees,\u201d Dean said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a back channel into that. He knows exactly \u2014 they\u2019re making copious notes, and they\u2019re coming out, and somebody is telling the White House counsel or somebody in the White House exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThe implication of such a back channel? That Trump and his allies could, if desired, work to bury or undermine incriminating information.\n\nAD\n\nProbably the most important thing to remember about the impeachment process is that it is fundamentally political. The complaints from Trump and his allies are heavily about securing political support. Some House Democrats are similarly trying to move public opinion with leaks about what\u2019s being discussed behind closed doors.\n\nDean made clear the importance of politics in the impeachment fight. He described being in Washington during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say how many people, Republicans who had no idea where I was coming from \u2014 I wasn\u2019t coming from anyplace in particular \u2014 who said, \u2018This is get-even for Nixon,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nIntrigue worthy of \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "In an interview, former White House counsel John Dean explained how the inquiry is and isn't like a criminal probe.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/A16RQlVnk-9OY4JDZBCH1E1Y82c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QR4AYR5RBEZNFESMYHSKJL67E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
