Those agreements are a key feature of U.S. financial markets, and their cost a key barometer of whether short-term markets are functioning well.\n\nWhile the rise in repo rates was attributed to seasonal cash flow issues and other more technical factors, the episode was reminiscent of the market strains that prefigured the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nStill, with policymakers meeting this week, it cast an untimely light on the Fed's sometimes rocky transition to a new system for managing interest rates and on debate over the appropriate size of its $3.8 trillion balance sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nSIGNIFICANT DIVISIONS\n\nThe Fed was already working through significant divisions about whether a reduction in borrowing costs is needed, though policymakers are expected on Wednesday to cut the key overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time this year.\n\nThe Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour later.\n\nA rate cut on Wednesday would lower the Fed's target policy rate to a range of between 1.75% and 2.00% and dovetail with moves by central banks around the world to ease monetary policy to offset the impact of a U.S.-China trade war and other risks to the global economy.\n\nFrom world bond markets to Trump, however, the more consequential reaction may come in response to how the Fed describes its latest policy decision, the expectations it sets for possible rate cuts later this year and in 2020, and, in light of market developments, whether the central bank shifts gears and begins to again expand its asset holdings or changes it tools for managing rates.\n\nThe Fed has discussed, for example, setting up a standing \"repo\" offering of its own to avoid the sort of stress that emerged on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts also said this may prompt the Fed to begin expanding its balance sheet to make sure there are adequate reserves in the system to avoid the sort of liquidity shortages that appeared this week.\n\n\u201cThe Fed absolutely lost control over the fed funds rate,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities, noting that the 2.3% effective rate reflected Tuesday\u2019s blow-up in the repo market, and adding that the New York Fed\u2019s measures since then, including its liquidity injection Wednesday, have probably brought the rate back into line.\n\n\"This is one of the signs that they should reverse course on the balance sheet,\" and begin to increase it, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities. \"They recognize that they have a bit of a problem.\"\n\nThe Fed may also make another adjustment in the gap between its target rate and the interest it pays banks on excess reserves, a tool it uses to encourage or discourage banks from holding cash at the central bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLEX ISSUES\n\nThe Fed has allowed the size of its balance sheet to decrease as part of its effort to unwind the policies put in place to fight the 2007-2009 recession.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Stress in U.S. money markets loomed over a Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday with new data showing that the central bank's target interest rate had drifted outside the level set by the central bank for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
