REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe document that describes the July conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been widely characterized as a transcript \u2014 by the White House, the Trump campaign, Democrats and Republicans.\n\nNot quite.\n\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Telephone Conversation\u201d \u2014 or \u201cmemcon\u201d \u2014 released Wednesday is not a transcript, by definition. It resembles a verbatim account of the presidential conversation, yet memcons are not always word-for-word. Former White House and U.S. security officials tell The Washington Post the documents are meant to be as close to verbatim as possible. But they end up passing through several revisions by nonpartisan career staff and political appointees which, in the case of Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Zelensky, has triggered fears of misconduct.\n\nWhite House conversations have not been audio-recorded since the mid-1970s, when former president Richard Nixon scandalized the practice, said Laurence Pfeiffer, a former senior director of the White House Situation Room during the Obama administration.\n\nMemcons are instead created by a team of notetakers, initially, who contemporaneously record, by hand and on computers, what the president and his guests say. The notetakers are duty officers \u2014 nonpartisan career staff with military or national security experience \u2014 whose job it is to monitor the Situation Room around the clock.\n\n\u201cThese are very hard-working, talented people on whom we put a heck of a responsibility to do this job,\u201d said Pfeiffer, who worked in the White House from 2011 to 2013. \u201cWe considered this one of our most important jobs.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Pfeiffer said, the process has been apolitical; the rough transcripts have been edited only for clarity and accuracy.\n\nBut former White House staffers said that the Trump administration, in a departure from prior presidencies, has been more willing to edit the telephone conversation memos to remove errors or insensitive remarks Trump has made, apparently in an effort to avoid political heat or embarrassment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rely on whatever transcript is released,\u201d one former staffer said, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cEven if it\u2019s unredacted; those transcripts are heavily edited by political leadership at NSC. I\u2019ve seen substance deleted from these call \u2018transcripts\u2019 to delete either superfluous details or more substance.\u201d\n\nThe Whit House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite concerns about the possibility of doctoring of transcripts, former officials who handled these kinds of foreign leader calls said the substance of Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Zelensky seems to be well-covered in the rough transcript released Wednesday.\n\nThe memcon released Wednesday outlines what was meant to be a congratulatory call from Trump to Zelensky on the Ukrainian leader\u2019s presidential election victory. The conversation, according to the memo, then became political, with Trump asking Zelensky to work with the U.S. Attorney General to investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden. That revelation, the subject of an intelligence whistleblower report, led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce Tuesday the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nTraditionally, during presidential phone calls with world leaders two or three notetakers listen in on the president\u2019s calls from inside the Situation Room, transcribing as accurately as possible what is being said.\n\nThough the calls are not audio-recorded, per se, a voice-recognition software is now used to help produce a baseline record of the call \u2014 almost like dictation \u2014 to get as close to verbatim as possible. A White House official said the Trump-Zelensky July 25 call was the product of this system.\n\n\u201cIt spits out something like a transcript,\u201d one former NSC staffer explained.\n\nPfeiffer said the software does not record or process the president\u2019s voice. It processes the voice of a staffer who repeats what they heard on the call. The software then produces a rough transcript.\n\nAt the same time, he said, other officials listening in on the call, whether in the Oval Office or another meeting room, are furiously scribbling their own notes, as close to word for word as their shorthand allows. Those listening in could be the president\u2019s chief of staff, the national security adviser or a member of the NSC staff in charge of that region, as well as State and Defense Department officials.\n\nAfter the call, the notetakers compare their notes and consolidate a recollection of the conversation into one document, former officials said. Then it is passed to senior NSC staff and other experts who listened, compare it with their own notes and memories and also correct proper names and other errors the software made.\n\nFor the Ukraine president call, the head of the NSC\u2019s director for Russia and Ukraine would have signed off on the edited version. The final version is approved by senior NSC staff.\n\nDespite concern the memo was edited, former officials said, a sanitized version would not have included Trump\u2019s complaints about his former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine being \u201cbad news\u201d and a vague suggestion that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nBut it did stand out, they said. Trump is not known for speaking in clear, declarative sentences, as the memo conveyed; his conversational style is often punctuated by rambling clauses that stray from his original point.\n\nPfeiffer said during his time in the Obama White House, it wasn\u2019t unusual for officials to smooth out language so that the foreign leader sounded \u201cmore stately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kind of think that happened on this transcript, because it reads really nice,\u201d Pfeiffer said.\n\nFormer Obama administration officials said during their time in the White House, these memos were not doctored for political purposes or to push a partisan agenda. Pfeiffer said the notetakers\u2019 raw transcripts were preserved during his tenure, to protect the president against mischaracterizations of a conversation by a foreign leader.\n\nWhite House officials, Pfeiffer said, were always aware that the government on the other line could be transcribing their own record of the call.\n\n\u201cThe subtext of all of that is, it would be awfully foolish of the U.S. president and staff to seriously doctor a document,\u201d Pfeiffer said.\n\nAnne Gearan contributed to this report.", "description": "A \u201cMemorandum of Telephone Conversation\u201d \u2014 or \u201cmemcon\u201d \u2014 resembles a verbatim account of the presidential conversation.
