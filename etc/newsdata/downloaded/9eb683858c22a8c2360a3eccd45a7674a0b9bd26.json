And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.\u201d\n\nGreta Thunberg\u2019s new Twitter bio. Photograph: Twitter\n\nOne contributor to the president\u2019s favourite TV network was roundly criticised \u2013 and caused Fox News to issue an apology \u2013 after he responded to Thunberg\u2019s speech by calling her \u201ca mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left\u201d.\n\nTrump was more subtle. In a tweet, he seemed to belittle the 16-year-old\u2019s condemnation of world leaders for inaction on climate change.\n\n\u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cSo nice to see!\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Thunberg chose to respond indirectly, embracing the title by adding it to her Twitter profile.\n\nIt now reads: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nHer profile had read: \u201c16 year old climate activist with Asperger\u2019s\u201d.\n\nThunberg has previously spoken out about her Asperger\u2019s syndrome diagnosis after she was criticized over the condition, saying it makes her \u201cdifferent\u201d, but that she considers it a \u201csuperpower\u201d.", "description": "Thunberg seems to troll Trump with new bio that reads: \u2018A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\u2019", "authors": ["Joan E Greve"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9905615a4841eb5810bdb405a0457974b5b769/0_15_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3aaa30d8c262c0f2a0318aa92b7b9317", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
