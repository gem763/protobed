He could not be sent to Taiwan because the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong has no extradition agreement with self-ruled Taiwan.\n\n\u201cI am willing, for my impulsive actions and things I did wrong, to surrender myself, to return to Taiwan to plead guilty and stand trial,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the days leading up to his release, Hong Kong and Taiwan feuded over his case after Lam said Chan had offered to return voluntarily to Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan objected to allowing him the freedom to travel and instead offered to send a team to escort him back, but Hong Kong\u2019s government refused, saying Taiwanese officers could not enforce the law in Hong Kong.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council said Wednesday that allowing a murder suspect to fly on his own would ignore the safety of other passengers and that Hong Kong\u2019s approach makes Hong Kong \u201ca criminal paradise where murderers can walk around.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong authorities are set to formally withdraw an unpopular extradition bill that sparked months of chaotic protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT819_chan10_ZG_20191022234630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
