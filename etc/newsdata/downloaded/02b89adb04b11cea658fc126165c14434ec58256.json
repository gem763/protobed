It was due to visit Mangonui, in the North Island, but the stop was cancelled by the ministry of culture and heritage after complaints from indigenous figures.\n\nAnahera Herbert-Graves, the head of Northland\u2019s Ng\u0101ti Kahu iwi, or tribe, told RNZ: \u201cHe [Cook] was a barbarian. Wherever he went, like most people of the time of imperial expansion, there were murders, there were abductions, there were rapes, and just a lot of bad outcomes for the indigenous people.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t discover anything down here, and we object to Tuia 250 using euphemisms like \u2018encounters\u2019 and \u2018meetings\u2019 to disguise what were actually invasions.\u201d\n\nIn Gisborne, nearly 800km from Mangonui down the east coast and the starting point for the flotilla\u2019s months-long voyage, iwi said they would refuse to hold p\u014dwhiri, or welcoming ceremonies, for those ships linked to colonisation.\n\nAmohaere Houkamau, at the Rongowhakaata Trust said a service would be held for the \u201cnine t\u012bpuna [ancestors] who were shot or injured during the events of October 1769\u201d and suggested \u201cdescendants of the colonialists\u201d were better placed to welcome the ships.\n\nWhen commemorating Captain Cook, we should remember the advice he ignored | Paul Daley Read more\n\nTamsin Evans, the ministry for culture and heritage\u2019s deputy chief executive, said the government had heeded iwi concerns, and the flotilla would stop only at communities \u201cwhere a welcome is clear\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know there are groups of people that have strong feelings. Tuia 250 is a commemoration in which we can have honest conversations about our history,\u201d she said.\n\nTensions have been rising for more than a year before the planned celebrations. In Gisborne, the council decided to remove a statue of Cook after it was repeatedly vandalised.\n\nCook and the crew of the Endeavour landed in Gisborne\u2019s Poverty Bay in 1769 and the first significant meetings of Europeans and M\u0101ori took place nearby. The name Poverty Bay has in itself caused controversy \u2013 its original name was T\u016branganui-a-Kiwa before being renamed by Cook.\n\nIn March, the Cook Islands considered changing its name to respect its indigenous heritage, with Avaiki Nui an early frontrunner. The name \u201cmust have a taste of our Christian faith, and a big say on our M\u0101ori heritage. And it must instil a sense of pride in our people, and unite our people,\u201d Danny Mataroa, chair of the name change committee, told RNZ Pacific.\n\nLast year, indigenous campaigner Tina Ngata criticised the upcoming events. \u201c[Cook] was a murderer, he was an invader [and] he was a vanguard for British imperial expansion.\n\n\u201cIf you read through his own journals and the journals of the crew members, it was not uncommon for him to shoot at us, to steal from us, for abductions to happen, and in fact whole communities were wiped out through sexually transmitted diseases.\u201d\n\nHerbert-Graves said the ministry had not consulted the iwi before placing Mangonui on the Tuia 250 itinerary.\n\nTamsin Evans, the ministry\u2019s deputy chief executive, said talks had been with a single iwi representative at the Doubtless Bay Promotions Trust and hoped most people still wanted to take part.\n\n\u201cWe always knew that Tuia would cause some mixed responses. We fully appreciate the mamae [hurt] that exists very strongly still in some communities. Our job is to open the books, let\u2019s look at all the history, and let\u2019s start to talk about this.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, a traditional double-hulled sailing canoe arrived in Tauranga from Tahiti after a trip lasting nearly four weeks. Traditional navigation methods were used to guide the Fa\u2019afaite to the North Island in honour of navigator Tupaia, who mediated between M\u0101ori communities and the crew of the Endeavour.\n\nBernadette Cavanagh at the culture ministry said: \u201cThe Tuia 250 national commemoration highlights the stories of Tupaia which have often been overshadowed in our history by the feats of James Cook.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand village complains to ministry of culture and heritage over planned visit by a replica of the Endeavour", "authors": ["Graham Russell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20bb5985e4da37876f8a2611256ccd3f2147caeb/0_163_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fbfd159db7560af0f80cb4c00c614db8", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
