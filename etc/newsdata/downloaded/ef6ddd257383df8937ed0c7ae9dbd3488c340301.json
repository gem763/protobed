Through an attorney, the alumnus said the school did not thoroughly investigate the abuse when it occurred and suggested that Maret conduct a comprehensive review, according to the report.\n\nThe probe was conducted by the law firm Crowell & Moring, which released a 60-page report late Thursday. The review spans more than three decades and details allegations against eight faculty members. Allegations against four of the teachers met a \u201csufficiently high standard of credibility and severity,\u201d the report said. Investigators found allegations against the remaining four faculty members \u201ccredible,\u201d but they could not substantiate them or the accusations were not severe.\n\nThe allegations include sexual intercourse, inappropriate touching with students and grooming vulnerable children for sex. Many of the teachers are suspected of having multiple victims. None of the teachers has been employed by Maret in the past decade. At least one has died and another reportedly works for a nearby school district.\n\nSchool leaders could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday night.\n\n\u201cMaret has taken significant steps in the last decade to address faculty misconduct and to protect its students,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThis investigation is another step in confronting these issues by taking an independent and far-reaching look at the School\u2019s past, through reports made to the School or to us by affected students who volunteered their stories and perspectives.\u201d\n\nInvestigators interviewed more than 50 people to compile the report and focused on allegations of members of the faculty sexually abusing students. The report found that some allegations were reported to school leaders when they occurred. In some instances, the school did not take any action. In other cases, the report found that the school addressed the allegations with faculty.\n\nMarjo Talbott, Maret\u2019s head of school, and Ian Cameron, the president of the board of trustees, sent the report in an email to school families and faculty Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that releasing this report cannot erase the past,\u201d the email read. \u201cWe do, however, hope that by acknowledging this history, sharing this report, and expressing our sincere apology, it will be possible to advance the process of healing that is so thoroughly deserved by those in our community who have been harmed.\u201d", "description": "The internal report found credible accusations that four teachers abused students between 1975 and 2008.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
