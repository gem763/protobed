She said the accusations are coming from her divorce from \u201can abusive husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me.

Hill has since said the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating how the photo was obtained and published by RedState.\n\n\u201cIntimate photos of me and another individual were published by Republican operatives on the internet without my consent,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHill, who has been considered a rising star in the party, serves as vice chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nUpdated at 7:23 p.m.", "description": "The House Ethics Committee\u00a0announced Wednesday it has launched an investigation into allegations that freshman Rep.
