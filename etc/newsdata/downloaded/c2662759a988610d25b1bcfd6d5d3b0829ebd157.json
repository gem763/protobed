(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA Senate panel on Tuesday took a first step toward reimbursing the District for costs incurred as a result of President Trump\u2019s Fourth of July celebration, his inauguration and other events in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAt the request of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), an appropriations subcommittee advanced a bill that would pay the District $6 million to replenish a fund used to provide security at large public events, such as rallies and state funerals.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s overhauled Fourth of July event this summer, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) warned the president that the District fund, known as the Emergency Planning and Security Fund, would run a deficit when the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cThe White House budgets have clearly shortchanged the District of Columbia,\u201d Van Hollen said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve essentially contracted out a lot of demands on the government of the District of Columbia without providing a budget that compensates the District of Columbia for it.\u201d\n\nThe money is additional to the $12 million appropriation paid to the District to ensure that local taxpayers are not left footing the bill for federal security needs.\n\nThe total amount of $18 million is part of a larger package of bills Senate appropriators must pass and reconcile with bills recently passed by the House.\n\nLawmakers do not expect to complete their work before the end of the fiscal year, and this week they plan to vote on a continuing resolution to extend the deadline, further delaying the payment to the District.\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District\u2019s nonvoting representative in Congress, wrote to House leaders in July asking that the $6 million be included in the next continuing resolution, but it is unclear whether her request will be heeded.\n\nThe city absorbed higher security costs for the Fourth of July celebration this summer after the president redesigned it as a \u201cSalute to America,\u201d including a speech by Trump at the Lincoln Memorial, a second fireworks display, a flyover by military aircraft and a display of armored vehicles on the Mall. The president\u2019s appearance increased security costs and required the city to change logistical plans that had been in place since 2001.\n\nChris Rodriguez, director of the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, has said that the estimated costs for the Fourth of July were six times as much as in past years\n\nThe District was left with a $6 million deficit after incurring $1.7 million in expenses for the Fourth of July celebration and police costs for demonstrations through the following weekend, and $7.3 million in expenses from Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, Bowser has said.\n\nTrump administration officials have said District officials planned to use money left in the emergency fund to cover inauguration costs and did not request additional money. Bowser\u2019s office denies this.\n\nVan Hollen said the Fourth of July event was initially designed as a tribute to Trump instead of the nation, and he accused the president of turning an annual celebration that was previously free of politics into a de facto campaign rally.\n\nHowever, he said, despite the politics, \u201cthe people of the District of Columbia shouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill for the entire country, and that\u2019s why we have bipartisan support for this language.\u201d\n\nThe funding request comes as D.C. officials prepare to make the case this week for their biggest priority \u2014 making the District the 51st state \u2014 before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.\n\nTo rally support for statehood, Bowser on Monday led a parade, complete with American flags mocked up to feature 51 white stars, at a cost of $31,206. The money came from $1 million the D.C. Council set aside to promote the statehood campaign.\n\nPeter Jamison contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The city was left with a $6 million deficit after paying for events to benefit the nation.", "authors": ["Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
