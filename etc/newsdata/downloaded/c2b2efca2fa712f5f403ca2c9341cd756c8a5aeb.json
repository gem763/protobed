USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Chris Long retired from the NFL in May, but he\u2019s not done talking about social injustice, player protests, and the role leagues wield in pushing for real change.\n\nLong, who had been critical of the NFL through much of his career for the way it handled players who protested social inequality during the pre-game playing of the national anthem, said he remains \u201cvery skeptical\u201d of the league in light of a partnership the NFL announced in August with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation to curate entertainment for the league\u2019s tentpole events. As part of the partnership, the league and Roc Nation have vowed to funnel resources back into communities in need.\n\n\"I'm very skeptical of that partnership and I'm also just generally skeptical of the league and how they handle that stuff because they have been pretty sloppy,\u201d Long told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday in an interview. \u201cAgain, they're a business and the only good thing the NFL has going for it from that standpoint is, right now, the league that was occupying a moral high ground (NBA), relatively speaking, is looking kind of suspect.\n\n\u201cI think in general I'm very skeptical of anything the (NFL) does from that standpoint. I think it's a player responsibility to push them on that stuff and there's a thin line between working with them and working for them on stuff. I think we just all have to remember that.\"\n\nLong, who played in the league 11 seasons with the Rams, Patriots and Eagles, became one of the most outspoken players in the league late in his career, joining his teammates to champion causes various causes. Long donated his entire 2017 base salary to charities that support educational equality.\n\nNow, with the protests sparked by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick now being carried on by only two NFL players, it\u2019s another league that is facing criticism.\n\nThe NBA is stuck in a controversy after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a message in support of protesters in Hong Kong. The league has significant business invested in the Chinese market, and multiple Chinese sponsors have pulled their support over the tweet.\n\n\u201cI think the NFL, the onus began to fall on them when the Kaepernick thing came up,\u201d Long said. \u201cIf you're not going to employ somebody for speaking out on that stuff, then people are going to want you to rectify that situation. Number one, give them a job. Number two, most of your players came from neighborhoods where this stuff affects them. So I think there is some responsibility there.\n\n\"At the same time, I'm not naive in thinking the NFL can solve the world's problems. It's just like the NBA: every global crisis isn't the NBA's problem, but when you do business with China, you can't expect people not to look at you. Especially with the standard we've set for expectations of corporations and major sports.\u201d\n\nThe NBA issue became more complicated, as players and executives have tiptoed around commenting on the matter.\n\nLakers star LeBron James was the latest and most recent player to be criticized for comments he made Monday in which he said Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand\u201d before posting his tweet. James later clarified that he was addressing the \u201cconsideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet\u201d but not Morey\u2019s actual message about solidarity with Hong Kong.\n\n\"I don't think it's unfair to ask (LeBron) his opinion at all,\u201d Long said. \u201cI think he set a precedent where he is going to weigh in on issues, and I know that this issue isn't central to his community, but I know LeBron's a smart guy. He's not going to be surprised that people want to know his opinion on that.\n\n\"Now, there's been a lot of back and forth on what he meant the other day. I do understand from a standpoint of as players are over there, they have to feel safe. If you're getting on a flight and you're landing in China and you have no idea that Morey's going to tweet that, that's an issue. But at the same time, Morey has every right to speak out just as players do. And we fought for players' rights to speak on issues that are important to them.\u201d\n\nLong, though, said he can see both sides of the matter.\n\n\u201cWe can't then get super mad at Morey,\u201d Long continued. \u201cI understand the component of safety, the fact that he wasn't going to China, but the Rockets are like the Yankees in China. I think if no player should have to talk about social issues, but if you're going to, and I'm not talking about LeBron, I'm talking about in general, I don't think: \u2018I'm not educated enough on the subject' is enough. A day later, two days later, I think just \u2018No comment.\u2019 If that's essentially the comment you're making, just say, \u2018No comment.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLong has transitioned to a career in media, but he remains active in the Chris Long Foundation, which lists its causes as clean water, military, and youth in need. He\u2019s active in the Waterboys organization that aims to provide clean, accessible water to communities in need. And he continues to support all athletes in fighting for actual change in their communities.\n\n\u201cIt's funny, we're going through it China right now and the NBA and some people are saying, \u2018Well, you can't focus on everything that doesn't affect your community because you'd have a hard time choosing,\u2019 \u201d Long said. \u201cBut I think one of the key things that we need to urge players to do in the NFL and people in America in general is to worry less about what's going on in your own community and take issues and other communities on as your own problems, because that's the only way forward.\u201d\n\nLong is also working with Crown Royal as part of its Water Break campaign that advocates taking a water break from alcohol consumption to stay hydrated.\n\n\"I have seen people that are 'that fan,' and they've had too much to drink,\" Long said. \"I don't just love Crown the product, I love the fact that they're taking it upon themselves to educate fans on mixing in a water, take that water break with every cocktail.\"\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "Chris Long is still focused on social activism as he remains a vocal critic of the NFL.
