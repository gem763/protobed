One man was fatally shot Sept. 29, and two others were wounded in separate attacks Saturday night and Sunday afternoon. Sunday night, police said a man in one car fired on another car as the vehicles sped erratically up Sixth Street NW. No one was struck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary to have these kinds of things happen,\u201d said Alex Marriott, the chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for the area in Northwest Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe neighborhood, and it\u2019s been a safe neighborhood for a very long time.\u201d\n\nMarriott said residents are worried the area might \u201crevert back to the days when this kind of activity was a lot more common.\u201d\n\nAuthorities are upping police patrols but as of Monday had not made any arrests or determined what sparked the shootings. \u201cThere are too many illegal weapons on our streets, and too many people willing to pull the trigger,\u201d said Cmdr. Stuart Emerman, who runs the 3rd District station that encompasses Shaw.\n\nEmergency community meetings are scheduled for 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Shaw Watha T. Daniel Library and for 6 p.m. Thursday at the United House of Prayer. A third meeting is tentatively set for Oct. 21.\n\n[Man fatally shot near Shaw Metro station]\n\nThe Shaw neighborhood has been among one of the District\u2019s most quickly gentrifying areas and is transforming with newly renovated rowhouses and apartment buildings. The recent shootings have occurred near some of the area\u2019s gathering places \u2014 the Shaw-Howard University Metro station and the Giant Food store at 8th and P streets.\n\nThe incidents have some residents recalling the summer of 2015, when a community activist was killed by a stray bullet at a Memorial Day cookout and a financial analyst was killed when he was caught in a gun battle outside the Shaw Metro station.\n\n[From 2015: Shootings in Shaw have residents worried about return to more dangerous times]\n\nMarriott said Monday he believes police \u201care really stepping up their presence, and I think you will see this kind of activity die down.\u201d\n\nAnother advisory neighborhood commissioner in Shaw, Alexander M. Padro, said the situation today is a far cry from the violence years ago, but he said he remains worried about what he calls an uptick of lawlessness that includes the smoking of marijuana outdoors and drinking alcohol and urinating in public.\n\n[Gentrification is pushing people out of Shaw]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope from that to the shootings,\u201d said Padro, who has represented the area for 20 years. \u201cI\u2019m trying to convince [D.C. police] that they need to return to their past practices and put an officer on foot here on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nPadro added, \u201cIt should not be open season for every kind of illegal activity in this neighborhood.\u201d\n\nEmerman, the police commander, said detectives are trying to determine whether the shootings since Sept. 29 are related, given their timing and proximity. He said investigators are exploring many possible angles, such as petty disputes, rival crews or even internal arguments within a single crew.\n\nThe police commander said authorities believe the teenager struck outside the Giant was a bystander and was not targeted.\n\nStatistics from D.C. police show unarmed and armed robberies are up this year in two patrol areas that include the Shaw area, and assaults with guns are roughly even compared with the same period last year. Homicides across the District are up 7 percent this year.\n\nLast week, D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham authorized overtime for officers in three areas of the city hit hard by violent crime, among them the 3rd District, which includes Shaw and Columbia Heights, where last month a gunman armed with a high-powered rifle fired into a courtyard, killing one man and injuring five others.\n\n[Police chief promises overtime to add more police patrols as homicides rise]\n\nIn the latest shooting in Shaw, a teenage girl was shot in the leg about 2 p.m. Sunday outside the Giant. A police report says she had bent down to tie her show when she heard four or five shots. She tried to get behind a vehicle but collapsed from a wound to the right knee.\n\nA D.C. police officer put a tourniquet on her leg, and she was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive. Police said they were looking for a boy about 14 years old armed with a black handgun.\n\nThat shooting occurred hours after police said a 19-year-old man was shot in the legs near 7th and R streets NW, near Rhode Island Avenue and about three blocks north of the Giant. A police report says callers to 911 reported hearing rapid shots about 11 p.m. Saturday. Police said another victim was struck by flying debris and three vehicles were damaged by bullets.\n\nThe fatal shooting occurred the night of Sept. 29, when police said Tahlil Byrd, 19, was struck by bullets in the 600 block of S Street NW, two blocks from where the 19-year-old was wounded. Byrd died at a hospital.\n\nRead more:\n\nLawyer found guilty of defrauding Virginia legislator, autism group\n\nD.C. man acquitted in toddler\u2019s death after defense argues the boy\u2019s sister may have harmed him\n\n\u2018Banana Kush\u2019 and \u2018Peanut Butter\u2019: Police, marshals bust suspected marijuana, vaping operation in Foggy Bottom\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A teenage girl was wounded Sunday afternoon near a grocery store, the third shooting in a week.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
