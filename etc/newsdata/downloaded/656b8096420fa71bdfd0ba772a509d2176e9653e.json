Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has very reluctantly acknowledged two traits that he \u201cadmires\u201d about President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile speaking at a youth forum at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday, the 2020 presidential candidate was asked by a student, in the interest of smoothing political divisiveness, to name one \u201cgenuine thing\u201d that he admires about the president.\n\nMiming being punched in the gut, Sanders was not exactly enthusiastic about answering the question. \u201cHis hair, I\u2019m really impressed by the color of his hair,\u201d he quipped at first.\n\nHe continued by telling the student he probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy with his actual answer.\n\nSanders acknowledged his respect for several of his Republican colleagues in the Senate, explaining it\u2019s not odd for them to sit down to lunch together, and that they don\u2019t \u201chate each other\u201d \u2015 despite holding differing views.\n\nHowever, he decried Trump as a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe and religious bigot, saying that he would do anything he could to tackle that type of behavior.\n\nHe was greeted by a round of applause, but the moderator pressed him to name just one \u201csingle thing\u201d that he could say that he admires.\n\n\u201cHe gets up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning to tweet. So I\u2019m impressed by people who get up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d Sanders replied.\n\nWatch a clip of the event from the Des Moines Register below:", "description": "It was a struggle, but the 2020 presidential candidate eventually managed to find one positive thing to say about the president.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d881b682300009b05d4ae36.jpeg?cache=qexvhqsund&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
