AAP\n\nMr Albanese first moved in June to have Mr Setka expelled from the party, arguing he was an unsavoury character who had brought the party and the union movement into disrepute.\n\nThis push increased when Mr Setka was subsequently convicted of harassing his wife.\n\nWhen Mr Setka quit, he damned Mr Albanese's leadership and said he was staying on at the union. His focus, he said, was fighting the Morrison government's union-busting Ensuring Integrity Bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat bill was fast-tracked in June by the government after Mr Albanese took on Mr Setka to highlight Labor's links to the CFMEU. The bill became known colloquially as the Setka bill but it is not retrospective.\n\nThe bill will be voted on by the Senate next month. A Senate inquiry into the bill will be handed down Friday and is expected to be split along party lines.\n\nIn the meantime, Centre Alliance Senator Rex Patrick has been negotiating changes with Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter. These include removing the power of the minister to lodge a request to have a union or an official deregistered.\n\nThe bar for deregistration will also be set higher so unions cannot be punished for inadvertent errors or breaches.\n\nSenator Lambie has long threatened to vote for the bill while Mr Setka maintains his role at the union and she reaffirmed this after Mr Setka quit the ALP.\n\nMr Porter said Labor must sever ties with the CFMEU.\n\n\"While John Setka is clearly a problem, the problem is much bigger than John Setka,'' he said.\n\nMr Albanese and hs senior frontbenchers continued to reject these demands.", "description": "Government legislation to allow the deregistration of rogue unions and officials is on track to pass Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/afbccd16876fed4b561b452c23d52e4e180d7085", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
