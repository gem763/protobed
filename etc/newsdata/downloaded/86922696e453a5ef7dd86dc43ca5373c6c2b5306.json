The ultimate source of the political donations, according to the indictment, was an unnamed Russian businessman.\n\nA lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, John Dowd, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cAs the indictment states the alleged activity was done with out the knowledge of the candidates or campaign,\u201d Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney to President Trump, said in a text message.\n\nDarren Samuelsohn contributed reporting.", "description": "Associates had been working with the former New York mayor on a campaign to discredit and former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Paul Dallison", "Vijai Maheshwari"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1155546169-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
