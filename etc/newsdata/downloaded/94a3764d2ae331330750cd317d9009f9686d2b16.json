That news caused former Fox News commentator Bob Beckel to weigh in with a slam on his former employer:\n\nShepard Smith is leaving Fox News. I worked at Fox for six years. Shep was a REAL reporter. I attacked Trump daily. My firing was a setup up by people inside & outside Fox. With Shep gone Fox Is no longer a News network. It\u2019s run by Trump Sadly it will go down with him. \u2014 Robert G Beckel (@RobertGBeckel) October 11, 2019\n\nGreg Gutfeld remembered things differently:\n\nBob, trump had nothing to do with your firing. In fact Fnc blessed you with many second chances. Using Shep\u2019s classy exit to take this dishonest swipe at a bunch of good hardworking people is disappointing. https://t.co/qkKvuhapbC \u2014 GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) October 11, 2019\n\nWell, there it is.\n\nPeople were very worried about him and made their concerns known, not because they wanted him ousted, but because there were legit concerns about his health & wellbeing. \u2014 Lisa B.
