Later, he said that his chief mistake in Watergate was not abuse of power, but rather his failure to conceal evidence. \u201cIf the tapes had been destroyed,\u201d he told the journalist David Frost, \u201cI believe that it is likely that I would not have had to go through the agony of resignation.\u201d Nixon realized that the tapes had bared his true self to the public \u2014 and thus cost him the presidency.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Trump is no stranger to cover-ups. He hides his tax returns and refuses to discuss his businesses. But in the case of the Ukraine phone call, where there is documentation that he asked a foreign leader to interfere in an American election, he insists he has no regrets. His unorthodox conversations, the president insists, are \u201cperfect.\u201d He dares his opponents to find fault with what he presents as his routine conduct of foreign affairs.\n\nNixon\u2019s opponents needed to produce evidence that revealed the real Nixon. The president\u2019s critics today have a greater challenge: to persuade enough voters that the real Mr. Trump \u2014 whom we already know \u2014 is a criminal worth removing from office.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kathryn Olmsted", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Impeachment-Trump-Nixon.Html"], "top_image": ""}
