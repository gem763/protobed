The poachers then moved in with machetes and took the lions' 16 paws and four jaws to be used for magic potions.\n\nDistraught game ranger Bradden said: \u201cMy world has been turned upside down as Jarvis, Bashi, Tawana and Tau were brutally murdered for body parts in what is known as a muti killing.\n\n(Image: Supplied)\n\n\u201cI have worked with this pride of lions for 10 years in a world where they were not exploited for human greed or vanity but in a world that was part of responsible and ethical tourism.\n\n\u201cThese last few days have been the darkest I have ever experienced and finding my lions who were my life in the way that I found them will live and haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cI am convinced these lion parts do not go far but find their way into local muti markets with muti being body parts that are used to make traditional medicines or magic potions.\n\n\u201cThese markets need to be shut down and those who come into game reserves where these magnificent animals are safe and butcher them in such a way need to be severely punished.\n\n\u201cMy heart is breaking for my four boys and girls and I am in a very dark place right now.\"\n\nThe Council\u2019s Environment and Agriculture chief Mr Dana Wannenburg said that it appeared to be an \u201cinside job\u201d with those who broke in knowing the layout and how to gain entry.\n\n(Image: Facebook/Rietvlei Game Reserve)\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have heightened security with police patrolling the main roads in and around the reserve to boost existing security to maintain the safety of the animals such as rhinos.\"\n\nThe Rietvlei Nature Reserve was also home to four of the famed African \u201cBig Five\u201d having healthy populations of rhino, leopard and buffalo and up until this week a pride of lions.\n\nThe South African Police Service said an autopsy confirmed the lions were poisoned before they were butchered with a spokesman saying: \u201cThis horrific crime will not go unpunished.\u201d\n\n(Image: Facebook/Rietvlei Game Reserve)\n\nHead ranger Mr Stevens added: \u201cThe Pride of Rietvlei was made up of rescued lions who could not have been released into the wild as they would be unable to feed properly and survive.\n\n\u201cWe allowed no direct interaction between tourists and our lions and our job was to teach the tourists and children about the harm the \"lion petting\u201d and \u201cwalking with lions\u201d industry does.\n\n\u201cIt is so tragic that our magnificent pride met such a savage and cruel end at the hands of men looking for money.\"\n\nRietvlei Nature Reserve is set in 3800 hectares right on the edge of Pretoria and is home to 2,000 game including hippo, zebra, springbok, cheetah and has incredible bird viewing.\n\nIn April last year Gert Claasen, 48, had three lions butchered for body parts and three more killed and stolen to be butchered later from his reserve in Petrus Steyn in Free State Province.\n\nIn May last year at the Jugomara Predator Park in Limpopo Province distraught owner Justin Fernandes, 32, had three lions and a rare white tiger hacked to bits for their body parts.\n\nAnd in July last year Christa Sayman, 55, lost six lions to poachers who hacked off the heads and paw of four fully grown lions for black magic potions and killed two other lion cubss.\n\nA complete lion skeleton can be bought in South Africa for \u00a31,000 but in Vietnam it is worth \u00a350,000 and the individual claws and teeth of a lion are highly prized and fetch top prices.\n\nA traditional healer from Limpopo who would not give her name said: \u201cThe lion body parts are used to make strong muti which is a witchcraft potion made by healers to cast spells.\n\n\u201cThese can be used to protect a person from illness or cure them or make them strong or virile or even used to scare enemies away or prevent them from being attacked.\"\n\nDr Kelly Marnewick of the Endangered Wildlife Trust keeps a close track on lions mutilated and poached or killed on private breeding farms and sanctuaries throughout South Africa.\n\nShe said: \u201dIt is mostly the claws, heads and teeth of the lions the poachers are after and in 2017 there were 22 captive lions killed and this is something that we are watching closely.\u201d\n\nIt is feared lion bones are now becoming sought after to replace the far rarer tiger bones in demand in South East Asia which are being smuggled out for use in traditional medicines.", "description": "WARNING, DISTRESSING CONTENT: The lions were poisoned before the poachers used machetes to cut off their paws and jaws at the Rietvlei Nature Reserve in Pretoria, South Africa", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt", "Image", "Facebook Rietvlei Game Reserve", "Supplied"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747474.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-JPMUTI7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
