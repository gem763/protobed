I\u2019m not going to fist bump him to wish him all the best in the last leg \u2013 I hope he plays rubbish!\u2019 Price said after the victory.\n\nGerwyn Price refusing Krzysztof Ratajski's offer of a fist bump in that heated final on Friday. Afterwards he said: \"We don't meet eye to eye, he plays his game I play mine. I'm not going to fist bump him to wish him all the best in the last leg \u2013 I hope he plays rubbish!\" pic.twitter.com/lLnBrs6y14 \u2014 Chris Hammer (@ChrisHammer180) October 5, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro.co.uk spoke to Price back in February about his behaviour on stage, with the world number six saying: \u2018I don\u2019t go up on stage to try and prove people wrong, I just go up there to try and be myself. If I win I win, if I lose I lose, I don\u2019t let the good or bad comments get to me, I do my own thing.\u2019\n\nMORE: Phil Taylor continues comeback talk: \u2018I\u2019d love to have another bash at Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson\u2019\n\nMORE: Simon Whitlock slams \u2018stupid\u2019 Premier League contenders idea that \u2018didn\u2019t work at all\u2019", "description": "Gerwyn Price has sent a heartfelt thank you message to his supporters after enduring abuse from the crowd during a painful first round exit from the World Grand Prix.
