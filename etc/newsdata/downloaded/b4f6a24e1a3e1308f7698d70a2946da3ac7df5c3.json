We Israelis love elections so much we\u2019ve had two in the last five months.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s vote didn\u2019t go well for Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, with 12 years in office. After pulling out all the stops to secure 61 or more seats in the Knesset (the 120-seat Israeli parliament) to build a right-wing coalition government, Netanyahu and his Likud Party fell well short.\n\nIn fact, Benny Gantz and the Blue and White Party won 33 seats in the Knesset to Likud\u2019s 31 seats, according to projections, with nearly all the votes counted. Gantz previously served as a highly decorated chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nNETANYAHU APPEALS TO DIRECT RIVAL TO FORM UNITY GOVERNMENT AS PROSPECT OF THIRD ELECTION LOOMS\n\nIsraeli politics are cutthroat and complicated, so there\u2019s no point in going through all the possible permutations of what happens from here.\n\nShort version: the most likely outcome is now a \u201cnational unity government\u201d in which either Gantz serves as prime minister for the first two years and Netanyahu for the second two years of the prime minister\u2019s term of office, or vice versa.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nNetanyahu is in big trouble. He faces an all-important court hearing Oct. 2, and it is very possible he will be formally indicted in three separate corruption cases. Though Netanyahu deserves the presumption of innocence, many Israelis believe government officials should not forge a deal with him because he will need to spend so much of his time on his own legal defense in the months and years ahead.\n\nNetanyahu asked Gantz on Thursday to join him in a unity government. \u201cBenny we have to set up a broad unity government,\u201d Netanyahu said in a tweet that included a video. \u201cThe nation expects us, both of us to act responsibly by working together.\u201d Netanyahu wants to head such a government. But Gantz would want to become prime minister first if such a deal is reached.\n\nGantz also wants to form a \u201cbroad \u2026 national unity government.\u201d Blue and White leaders say they would be happy to form one with Likud, but only if someone other than Netanyahu leads Likud. They don\u2019t want to make a deal with Netanyahu because he\u2019s facing indictments.\n\nAvigdor Liberman\u2019s party appears to have won nine seats in the Knesset. Liberman is the former defense minister and former chief of staff for Netanyahu who is a now a fierce rival of the prime minister. The right-wing secular Yisrael Beiteinu Party that he now heads went from five seats to nine in the Knesset as a result of Tuesday\u2019s election, according to projections. Liberman is widely regarded as the kingmaker whose support is crucial to anyone trying to create a majority coalition. Liberman indicated Thursday that he will recommend Gantz to be the next prime minister, though he, too, supports a national unity government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf all this weren\u2019t complicated enough, neither Blue and White nor Liberman\u2019s party are keen on having religious parties that represent ultra-Orthodox Jews in a coalition government, believing those parties already exert too much control over Israeli social policy and the budget.\n\n\u201cWe cannot and there is no reason to go to third elections,\u201d Netanyahu said, expressing a sentiment no doubt shared by most election-weary Israelis. When Netanyahu fell one vote short of forming a coalition government after elections in April, he called the new elections that were held Tuesday, rather than giving Gantz a chance to form a coalition at that time.\n\nThe next step in the battle to lead Israel will be for President Reuven Rivlin to designate one candidate to try to assemble a coalition government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe designation typically goes to the candidate with the most seats in the Knesset \u2013 in this case Gantz \u2013 but Rivlin could select Netanyahu to try to form a coalition if Rivlin believes the current prime minister has a better chance of succeeding.\n\nNo one knows how this will all turn out. But the struggle is so intense that Netanyahu canceled a planned trip to address the United Nations General Assembly to stay in Israel for the tough bargaining ahead, in an effort to drum up enough support to remain in power.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOEL ROSENBERG", "description": "The most likely outcome of the Israeli election will be a coalition government uniting Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party and Benny Gantz\u2019s Blue and White Party.", "authors": ["Joel Rosenberg", "Joel C.
