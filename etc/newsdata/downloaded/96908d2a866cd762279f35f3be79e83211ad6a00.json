We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller and a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the noteworthy and the exceptional. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists will pick their favorites.\n\nCriminal Broads: \u201cCrime-Obsessed Broads: An Interview With Rachel Monroe\u201d\n\nPhoto: Library of Congress\n\nThis episode of Tori Telfer\u2019s delightful podcast is a little bit like a true-crime Inception as she interviews journalist Rachel Monroe about her new book, Savage Appetites, which itself examines the modern fascination with true crime as a genre through the lens of four women who are obsessed with crime and criminals in wildly disparate ways. I\u2019m a big fan of Monroe\u2019s work, and I really appreciate how thoughtful and frankly unafraid she is to take a hard look at how and why people \u2014 especially women, and especially white women \u2014 consume this sort of media and what it means about us. The topic lends itself to a spirited conversation with Telfer, another whip-smart true-crime fan slash journalist (Telfer wrote Lady Killers: Deadly Women Throughout History) who is equally interested in interrogating the genre and herself along the way. If Savage Appetites isn\u2019t already at the top of your to-be-read pile, it will be by the end of this episode. \u2014Jenni Miller\n\nTrue Crime Chronicles: \u201cStolen Lives in Tarpon Springs\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been bingeing True Crime Chronicles for weeks now. Investigative journalist Jessica Noll (whom you might recognize from another Vault Studio\u2019s podcast, Bardstown, which you definitely should be listening to if you aren\u2019t already) and co-host Will Johnson, tackle both the super local, like the 2013 disappearance of Abby Hernandez from a small town in New Hampshire, to those cases that made it to Dateline, like the murder of 12-year-old Stephanie Crowe. The latest episode falls under the category of the local. On New Year\u2019s Day in 2018, Richard and Laura Ivancic and their son, Nicholas, were found dead in their home in Tarpon Springs, Florida. What tipped off neighbors that something might be wrong? The gravelike hole in front of the house. Without truly spoiling the ending for you, I\u2019ll just tell you this: Laura Ivancic had been trying to locate her daughter, Jamie, for almost a year, with basically no real luck. Also, the person who committed these murders is so bad at crime, it will astonish you. Sturdy reporting and smooth delivery are what make True Crime Chronicles a great podcast. It\u2019s what those of us who love true crime long for \u2014 the right amount of reflection and detail, along with a nose for stories we want to hear, but otherwise might never find. \u2014Chanel Dubofsky\n\nUnravel True Crime: Snowball: \u201cThe Girl With the Dragonfly Tattoo\u201d\n\nOllie Wards was the emcee at his brother Greg\u2019s wedding. But even as he went through the motions during the reception, the New Zealander recalls having a sense of unease about his brother\u2019s charismatic California bride, Lezlie Manukian. There were some things that just didn\u2019t add up, but he kept his suspicions to himself. It turned out that he was right to be concerned. Within a few months, Lezlie had vanished, not only breaking his brother\u2019s heart, but sending his family into financial ruin. In season four of ABC\u2019s Unravel podcast, subtitled Snowball, Ollie tells the story of a case some call \u201cthe female version of Dirty John.\u201d Episode one begins with the story of Greg and Lezlie\u2019s whirlwind romance. Greg had always been infatuated with everything American and immediately fell for Lezlie, whom he met in London. They later married in New Zealand, where Lezlie bought a small restaurant, claiming to finance it with her large trust fund. But nothing was as it seemed, and Lezlie went on the lam. A decade later, Ollie hopes to finally get answers to just who Lezlie really was as he reinvestigates the case. Perhaps, he will even find Lezlie herself. \u2014Lara Bricker\n\nWho Killed Jennifer Short?: \u201cHeartbreaking Discovery\u201d\n\nAs of late, it would seem, there\u2019s been an uptick in podcasts created by local news stations, in the hope of bringing attention to unsolved cases. Who Killed Jennifer Short is an original podcast by FOX8, which serves Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem, and the entire Piedmont Triad of North Carolina.\n\nAfter Michael and Mary Short were murdered in their home in August 2002, police began a search for their 9-year-old daughter, Jennifer, who was missing from their home in Oak Level, Virginia. There are no spoilers here, the title of the podcast tells us everything we need to know \u2014 six weeks after the home invasion, Jennifer\u2019s body was found on a farm 45 minutes away from Oak Level. What happened to Jennifer? How did she get from Virginia to North Carolina? Who\u2019s responsible for her death and the deaths of her parents, and why, 17 years later, does the case remain unsolved?\n\nIn this episode, FOX8 reporter Tess Bargebuhr visits the farm where Jennifer was discovered and speaks with the current owner of the property, who\u2019s anything but creeped out at the idea of living there. The episodes are all brief, about 15 minutes long, and they have that distinctly tender vibe that comes with local news stories, which frankly makes the case itself more tragic and urgent, if it weren\u2019t already. \u2014Chanel Dubofsky", "description": "This week\u2019s best true-crime podcasts include \u201cUnravel,\u201d \u201cCriminal Broads,\u201d \u201cTrue Crime Chronicles,\u201d and \u201cWho Killer Jennifer Short.\u201d", "authors": ["Vulture Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-true-crime-podcasts-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
