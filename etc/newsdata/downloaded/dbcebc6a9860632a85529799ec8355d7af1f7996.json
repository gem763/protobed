Nothing gets everyone in line like an occasional annihilation.\n\nIt certainly appears to be working with the National Basketball Association, which is apologizing and kowtowing to the Chinese government right now after the communist regime took great umbrage with an otherwise tame tweet from an otherwise anonymous general manager.\n\nOver the weekend, Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey \u2014 well known among the most diehard of fans but almost no one else \u2014 dared to weigh in on the ongoing, occasionally violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong,\u201d Morey tweeted to his 200,000 followers.\n\n(Twitter screenshot)\n\nThat was it. And that was enough, apparently. China went crazy. It reportedly pulled sponsorship money from the Houston Rockets (which due to former player Yao Ming is the most popular team in the country), banned media coverage of Morey and ended any cooperation between the Chinese Basketball Association and the franchise.\n\nThe NBA quickly caved. It apologized to China, calling Morey\u2019s statement \u201cregrettable\u201d and noting that it \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d Morey himself walked it all back. Rockets star James Harden added his own \u201csorry\u201d even though he had nothing to do with anything.\n\n\u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China,\u201d Harden said.\n\nJust like that, a league and its employees (players, coaches, executives) who take great pride in expressing their opinions on all measures of political and social discourse got slapped into order.\n\nAll this because an American citizen dared to encourage a pro-democracy movement.\n\nAnd you wonder why China is so powerful.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s hypocritical of the NBA, of course. It\u2019s a bad look. It\u2019s also modern reality.\n\nThe NBA is adamant about one thing: It respects Morey having an opinion and hasn\u2019t suspended or disciplined him or anything like that. It\u2019s a fair point, although having the league itself apologize for a single individual\u2019s comment is a pretty good snuff on the nose.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver told reporters in Tokyo on Monday. \u201cThere have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but, in fact, we have.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear \u2026 Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver continued. \u201c ... The fact we have apologized to fans in China is not inconsistent with supporting someone\u2019s right to have a point of view.\u201d\n\nDaryl Morey created a headache for the NBA with one tweet. (AP)\n\nIn the end, like pretty much every business on Earth, the league wants China\u2019s money. It wants access to its 1.4 billion citizens. It wants to continue to stage preseason games there, sell jerseys there and broadcast its games there. (It\u2019s not uncommon for 20 million to watch the NBA Finals despite the time difference.)\n\nAnd so like pretty much every other American business, it\u2019s willing to have one set of rules for, say, North Carolina, which it delayed staging an All-Star game because of a divisive, so-called \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d and another for China, which routinely imprisons and tortures dissenters, squashes free speech and opposes fair elections.\n\nThis how it works, though, and not just in business. Also silent on the Hong Kong protests, which are now in their 18th week? The United States of America.\n\nThe White House has said nothing on what used to be a bedrock principle of America: promoting democracy around the world. Perhaps it\u2019s because in a June phone call President Donald Trump reportedly told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the U.S. would be quiet on the subject while trade talks continue.\n\nThese days, when the Chinese say jump, America asks, \u201cHow high?\u201d\n\nAnd this is why. The Chinese don\u2019t really care about Daryl Morey. Again, almost no one knows who he is and the Chinese state-run media could easily block whatever attention a single tweet generated.\n\nNo, what they fear is a parade of NBA declarations. More general managers. Teams. Famous figures. Steve Kerr or Gregg Popovich pregame press conferences. And, eventually, perhaps even LeBron James himself, or others like him.\n\nIf the star players start talking about this, tweeting about this, writing things on their shoes about this, well, that\u2019s what can break through the censorship and reach the people. That's what might change minds. Maybe.\n\nSo the Chinese flexed their muscles and got everyone to shut up. The NBA siding with China is just a wonderful extra slice of potential propaganda for them to use.\n\n\u201cWhat is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion?,\u201d wrote Joe Tsai, the Taiwanese-Canadian billionaire who owns the Brooklyn News, on Facebook. \u201cThis freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues.\u201d\n\nIndeed.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities,\u201d Tsai wrote. \u201cSupporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.\u201d\n\nWell, framed like that \u2014 a separatist movement \u2014 rather than a pro-democracy movement will certainly make it a third rail. But that\u2019s China\u2019s way of controlling public opinion.\n\nThere is no open or honest debate. China\u2019s government plans on keeping it that way. So Daryl Morey found himself in the middle of a geopolitical tempest. Then he found his bosses, pretty much like everyone else, weren\u2019t going to take his side, certainly not when there are team jerseys to sell and Pepsi deals to make.\n\nThe NBA is not in Charlotte anymore.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Forget democracy and human rights, the Daryl Morey mess reminds us that the NBA just craves money and another major market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ucath_ryW5forEN3LfpdBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05ODIuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kPKlFrSf.F1F.oXi0MlZIQ--~B/aD0xMDQxO3c9MTM1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/98473a10-e924-11e9-87ff-521c2fd42964", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
