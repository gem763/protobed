I must admit, I was way too young to watch Nightmare on Elm Street, but my friend and I somehow got our paws on it and watched in alone in the basement.\n\nI had nightmares for months, maybe even years, but rather than traumatize me, it sparked a love of scary movies.\n\nDo You Know That CBC Has 6 Shows For Tweens? Check it out.\n\nWhen my son started laughing after jumping out of his seat during one scene, I knew he was hooked.\n\nMy son has always been interested in anything spooky. He loves Halloween, spooky ghost stories and is so eager to be old enough to watch scary movies. Every year I spend the weeks leading up to Halloween trying to find a costume that is scary enough for his love of everything ghoulish, while tame enough to not frighten my younger daughter who loathes anything that might give her nightmares.\n\nWhen he begs to watch the latest scary movie to hit the theatre, I have to say no but I secretly celebrate the fact that I will soon have a partner to watch scary movies with. While my 10-year-old isn\u2019t old enough to watch the true horror movies, there are definitely some that we can share.\n\nWe try to avoid anything with violence. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s old enough to watch anything with murderers or gore, which removes some of the classic horror films like Dawn of the Dead or Friday The 13th. Instead we look for the creepy movies \u2014 ghost stories tend to be a big hit. They give the spook factor without the blood and gore.\n\nYou May Also Find Useful: 5 Steps I Take Before I Watch A Movie With My Kids\n\nOur first scary movie experience took place when my youngest daughter was at a friend\u2019s house. It was just enough scare to start off with. When my son started laughing after jumping out of his seat during one scene, I knew he was hooked.\n\nSince then we are always on the lookout for appropriate scary movies that we can share and we\u2019ve found great options that go beyond Casper The Friendly Ghost.\n\nThe Others\n\nIt's about a family who live in a darkened house, due to the children\u2019s sensitivity to light, waiting for their father to return from the war. Supernatural events start to occur in the home; the children claim to see ghosts and mysteries that can\u2019t be explained begin to occur. There are a couple of jumpy moments and lots of mystery, but it\u2019s pretty tame. My 10-year-old was at a good age to be able to follow along with the story line, which can be a little complex.\n\nGremlins\n\nA young man receives a mysterious creature for Christmas with orders not to get him wet, or feed him after midnight. Breaking these rules leads to chaos. There is some tame gore that takes place in the form of a gremlin in a blender and it\u2019s important to note a scene where there is talk about Santa not being real. This one is great for kids who are a little older, but not yet old enough for those true horror films.\n\nArachnophobia\n\nThe title says it all. It\u2019s the story of a town where people start dropping dead due to poisonous spiders. There are some death scenes in it, but unless your child has a deep fear of spiders it\u2019s pretty harmless.\n\nThe Sixth Sense\n\nThis was the second scary movie my son watched with me. It\u2019s the story of a little boy who sees dead people. It\u2019s a pretty creepy movie that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand, and if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, the ending is amazing. You\u2019ll see blood and wounds on some of the spirits that are wandering, including a scene with wrists that have been cut during a suicide. I might have covered his eyes in one scene that involved a few seconds of hanging bodies.\n\nPoltergeist\n\nAnother ghost story about paranormal activity happening in the home of an average family. Things take a turn when spirits start communicating with them through the television set. The special effects in this one aren't the greatest and a kid used to today\u2019s technology may find it cheesy, but the story makes up for the lack of CGI.\n\nThe Goonies\n\nThis one might be a little more adventure than it is scary, but the antics these kids get up to do lead to some scary things. After finding a treasure map the kids go searching and end up in some dangerous predicaments. You should note that there is a scene containing a dead body with a bullet hole in the head that might be too much for some kids.\n\nJaws\n\nI think everyone needs to watch Jaws at some point even if it\u2019s just to have the pop culture reference. I mean a killer shark with a taste for blood?! You can\u2019t go wrong. Again, it\u2019s an older movie so it\u2019s not going to score special effects points with the kids of today. However, the fear this movie can conjure up about what\u2019s under the water is worth it.\n\nThe Shallows\n\nIt\u2019s a more modern version of Jaws. It\u2019s the story of a young woman who gets stranded just far enough from the shore and is forced to try and escape a great white shark that seems to be stalking her. This movie has blood and some gruesome injuries, but it will keep your kids heart pounding without being too much. Make sure your kids are ready for this type of scare otherwise you may never get them in the water again.\n\nWhile I love sharing these with him, I am counting down the days until he\u2019s old enough to watch the true horror movies with me. In just a few more years Halloween is going to be so much fun.", "description": "Our first scary movie experience took place when our youngest daughter was at a friend\u2019s house.
