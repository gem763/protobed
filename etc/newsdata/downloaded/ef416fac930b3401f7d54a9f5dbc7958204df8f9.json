Announcing its founders\u2019 $103.5 million \u201csecondary sell-down\u201d on June 11, the buy now, pay later sensation noted that \"[Anthony] Eisen, [Nick] Molnar and Mr Hancock have each confirmed that they will not sell any further shares until at least 120 days from today\u201d. On July 2, the company added that \"Anthony and Nick do not intend to sell any further shares during the current financial year,\" but glaringly, didn't mention \"David\".\n\nSo five more sleeps! Come Tuesday, Hancock can expect an unscheduled house call from his stockbroker. Before dawn.\n\nHe is, after all, sitting on 950,000 ordinary Afterpay shares (in his wife Fiona\u2019s name) plus 2.7 million options with a dead-set gorgeous strike price of $2.70 and another 200,000 options exercisable at $1. A tranche of 1.5 million options vested last month, triggering a $20 million FY20 income tax liability payable by April next year. Tolerable enough, given all-up his shareholding would fetch $136.1 million at Wednesday\u2019s closing price. No child of his should ever have to work.\n\nBut the Hancock fortune isn\u2019t banked just yet. And when his voluntary escrow ends next week, can he even trade in Afterpay while remaining a director of the company (he\u2019s set to retire from the board at next month\u2019s AGM)? Not if he\u2019s in possession of material information.\n\nLast week, Afterpay provided to AUSTRAC the interim report of the external auditor AUSTRAC ordered it to appoint back on June 12, having had \u201creasonable grounds to suspect that Afterpay is a reporting entity that has contravened and/or is contravening section 32 and 81 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006\u201d.", "description": "Can the Hancock fortune be banked before AUSTRAC ruins the party?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9201%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_461%2C$y_22/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/251fa6e2b0ee333198ff3fb57696ca6c7d1d2117", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
