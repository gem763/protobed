(Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nSanford, a former South Carolina governor who represented the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District in the House until earlier this year, had been mulling a bid against the president for weeks.\n\nHe joins former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who launched a bid against Trump in April seeking to appeal to traditional Republican voters, and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, who announced last month that he will challenge the president not from the center but from the right and on moral grounds.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign dismissed Sanford\u2019s entry into the race.\n\n\u201cIrrelevant,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.\n\nThe president remains immensely popular among Republican voters: According to a Monmouth University poll released last month, 84 percent of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s job performance. His highest recent approval mark among fellow Republicans was 88 percent in a Fox News poll of registered voters in early August.\n\nThose numbers would suggest that, like other Trump challengers, Sanford has lower odds of actually defeating the president than of successfully criticizing him in a way that could affect the general election.\n\nLimiting government spending was a key focus of Sanford\u2019s time in public office. He has previously said he was motivated to consider a bid against Trump out of concern over the federal debt and deficit.\n\nHe reiterated that point Sunday, telling Fox News host Chris Wallace that \u201cas a party, we\u2019ve lost our way\u201d on fiscal responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe president has called himself the \u2018King of Debt,\u2019 has a familiarity and a comfort level with debt that I think is ultimately leading us in the wrong direction,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nHe said his decision to challenge Trump is based on policy, not personal, reasons. But he took aim at the president\u2019s leadership style, saying the country needs to have a conversation about the \u201cdegree to which institutions and political culture are being damaged by this president.\u201d\n\nAsked by Wallace whether he seriously thinks he has a chance of beating Trump, Sanford responded, \u201cI\u2019m saying, you never know.\u201d\n\nSanford, however, has his own political baggage.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for the 2009 episode during which, as governor, he disappeared for nearly a week before reemerging to hold a tearful news conference at which he revealed an extramarital affair. Sanford\u2019s staff had said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, but he had actually traveled to Argentina to be with his then-girlfriend Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n Chapur, whom he described as his \u201csoul mate.\u201d\n\nSanford had previously served three terms in the House, and, after leaving the governor\u2019s mansion in 2011, he ran for the House again and won, serving from 2013 to 2019. He was a frequent critic of Trump and, in 2018, lost his GOP primary after the president endorsed his opponent, state Sen. Katie Arrington, who lost in the general election to now-Rep. Joe Cunningham (D).\n\nAsked about the 2009 Appalachian Trail episode, Sanford said Sunday that he went on an \u201capology tour\u201d in his home state and ultimately won the support of voters, who elected \u2014 and reelected \u2014 him to Congress.\n\nHe also sought to use the incident to draw a contrast with Trump, arguing that he learned a lesson in humility, empathy and judgment after his mistake.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to the president, when he says there\u2019s not a single thing that he sort of regrets or apologizes for, I profoundly apologize for that,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cAnd I believe in the Christian model of repentance and renewal and a second chance.\u201d\n\nSanford also faces a Republican Party that is making it more difficult for those who want to challenge Trump.\n\nRepublican officials in several states, including South Carolina, are moving to cancel their 2020 presidential primaries \u2014 putting a dent in the ability of Trump\u2019s challengers to rack up delegates ahead of next year\u2019s Republican National Convention.\n\nAnd the Republican National Committee in May voted to eliminate its primary debate committee, a move that lessens the likelihood that Trump and his GOP opponents will face off in a public forum.", "description": "Sanford, a former South Carolina governor who represented the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District in the House until earlier this year, had been mulling a bid against the president for weeks.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/akQCkkz9eGwXMCn4BKA72-QHmew=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VX3WRPWEIII6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
