Photo: NBC NewsWire/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images\n\nBefore his hiatus in January, Steve Schmidt was a fan favorite for many MSNBC viewers. As a lifelong Republican, his screeds on the political and constitutional morass of the Trump era had a special credibility for many MSNBC viewers. As a strategist, Schmidt advised the campaigns of George W. Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and John McCain. He was as famous as a political strategist could be, thanks to Woody Harrelson\u2019s portrayal of him in Game Change.\n\nSchmidt was a charter member of the Never Trumpers and officially renounced his membership in the Republican Party last year, calling it \u201cfully the party of Trump\u201d and saying the GOP had become \u201ccorrupt, indecent, and immoral.\u201d\n\nLast week, Schmidt returned to MSNBC after an eight-month hiatus, which included a stint as an advisor to Howard Schultz\u2019s brief and inglorious flirtation with a third-party run. Intelligencer caught up with Schmidt on the phone this week and asked him about impeachment, the Schultz debacle, and the Democratic field.\n\nA few days ago you said that we\u2019ve entered the \u201cconsequences stage\u201d of the presidency. What are the consequences you foresee?\n\nI think what\u2019s missing from the coverage in the middle of all of the chaos that Trump produces, and the daily drama that emanates from this White House, is the degree to which Trump has been an extremely consequential president. There is an argument to be made that he is the most consequential president since FDR, because he is systematically unraveling, at an extremely fast pace, the U.S.-led global order that was architected by FDR, built by Harry Truman, and maintained from Eisenhower through Obama. And everywhere around the world, all of the countries and all of the groups that we don\u2019t want to see winning on the field of geopolitics \u2014 Iran, Hezbollah, ISIS, Al Qaeda, Russia, Turkey \u2014 are advancing while American interests are retreating.\n\nHe has completely remade the American presidency through his debasements of its traditions. He has pitted the country against each other in a cold civil war and he is the first president purposefully who, with each and every utterance, he seeks to incite and divide as opposed to unifying around core principles. He is attacking and degrading our institutions and the concepts of the rule of law that are necessary for the maintenance of the constitutional republic from within. He is utterly infidelitous to his oath to preserve, protect, and strengthen the Constitution of the United States. That makes him, not a clown and a joke, but a dangerous and profoundly consequential figure. I caveat \u201cconsequential\u201d by saying it\u2019s not a celebratory statement \u2014 it\u2019s one of alarm.\n\nThere are people out there who make the argument that his presidency, so far, is also proof that the framework or system is working. Whether it\u2019s his attempt to roll back health care or even backing down from the G7 at Doral, but from your perspective his presidency is proof it\u2019s cracking. Where is the weakness?\n\nThe Doral example is a singular instance of retreat amongst hundreds of examples of heretofore unacceptable acts of corruption and self-dealing and enrichment in the use of the office. He has thoroughly remade the presidency. He has shattered the systems and the boundaries and the protections that exist within the system around the president and he has made the country weaker and more isolated and assaulted the values that the country at its best stands for.\n\nIs he going to face consequences?\n\nIf you read Federalist 65 and 66 \u2014 what the Founders wrote, what Alexander Hamilton wrote, about the importance of impeachment, which he advocated for \u2014 it was a protection against a president who is described in perfect detail by Hamilton: Someone who abuses the public trust. The standard isn\u2019t criminal, it\u2019s political. It\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors. It\u2019s about abuse of power. So Trump has forced a question. And the question is: Does Donald Trump get to ride above the law? Does he get to do whatever he wants? Can he target, through the power of his office, Americans for persecution for political reasons because of political differences? Or is the co-equal branch of government constitutionally obligated to begin a process to correct the abuse of power that was built into the system by the geniuses who established the American republic?\n\nI think that Nancy Pelosi is exactly correct. She said that Donald Trump had left them no choice but to move forward with the impeachment inquiry. Whether that leads to an impeachment should be done on the facts and the basis of evidence and should accord Trump every due process protection that he\u2019s entitled to.\n\nBut there\u2019s certainly a scenario where Trump could be impeached, acquitted in the Senate, and reelected. And an impeached, acquitted, and then reelected Donald Trump is a Donald Trump without any constraints on him. I think that would be extremely dangerous. I think that one thing that\u2019s missing from all the coverage is the possibility that Donald Trump could be reelected. It\u2019s not talked a great deal about speculatively. You look at the standings right now, he has a historic cash advantage. Republicans have a significant technology advantage. Most Americans have made their minds up and this will be a very narrowly decided election.\n\nAt the same time, just yesterday there was a poll that said for the first time 50 percent of Americans believe in going forward with this impeachment hearing. So there is evidence of sentiment changing.\n\nWhat the polling indicates is growing majority awareness that he crossed a line that he had not yet crossed and that his behavior warrants, if not impeachment, an impeachment inquiry. I think it\u2019s a mistake to interpret that number as fixed, concretized, or that there\u2019s a popular mandate to remove Donald Trump from office. Impeachment we know, even if you believe like I do, that it\u2019s mandated, that it\u2019s duty-required. A very careful examination of the facts, and what we understand to be true here. On the testimony, that none of this has been made public, accounts from behind closed doors, that is insufficient evidence of wrongdoing. All of this will need to play out at the appropriate time and the appropriate moment. The American people are extremely troubled by this behavior and understand this to be an abuse of power, but what it doesn\u2019t mean is that Americans have reached the conclusion that he needs to be removed from office. It doesn\u2019t account for the tremendous division that will accompany this.\n\nWhat did you think of the news of the group of House GOP members storming the secure room?\n\nIt\u2019s a stunt. It\u2019s theatrics. It will be cast as a heroic act and communicated to half of the country who will buy into it. Nobody should underestimate the ability of Trump to articulate his message, his alternate-reality message, to roughly half the country. Matt Gaetz, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, would have not too long ago been regarded as clowns and liars. We live in an era where the politics of the moment and the media coverage, particularly on the far right, incentivizes and rewards the behavior of the craziest, craziest people. They debase the institution that they represent, but it\u2019s par for the course. There are two arguments that are playing out. Republicans are trying to make a process argument. Nobody is saying that what Trump did was right. There is considerable tension on Republicans, whether it\u2019s on Doral, whether it\u2019s on this, not knowing what the next person is going to disclose and say from a firsthand-information account from a diplomat. So they\u2019re making a process argument. \u201cThis process is unfair,\u201d right? Trying to say that this is about revenge. This is about trying to undo an election.\n\nPart of the problem for Democrats in this is you had a substantial number of people within the party, within Congress, talking about impeaching Trump before he was inaugurated. At the end of the day, whether you like him or not, whether you thought he would do things that wound up getting him impeached, he hadn\u2019t yet done them before he was inaugurated. So there\u2019s substantial evidence of political malice toward him that could be exploited during this process argument. At the same time, Democrats are going to have to offset this with a truth-based, fact-based, reality-based approach which focuses on the oath, which focuses on this system. Members of Congress take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies, foreign and domestic. So there\u2019s this really important debate taking place right now between not just two parties, but between reality and alternate reality. We used to have strong partisan differences in the country, but not two realities. The force of Trump\u2019s lying has ruptured the space-time continuum. We now exist in binary universes.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes it scarier. It\u2019s not necessarily Trump or GOP leadership living in that alternate reality. Voters are dealing with the same set of facts that their elected officials are dealing with. It\u2019s all laid bare. We\u2019re all working off the same information.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the country\u2019s politics at some level are defined by the animus of two warring tribes. People who see their fellow Americans as the enemy, who are dogmatic, who hate each other. People are left to affiliate with the side that they think will protect them from the side they worry will help them the most. Voting in America for a substantial part of the population is no longer about affirming a belief in the future, it\u2019s an act of aggression. It\u2019s an action taken to choose someone to punish their enemies. And that more than anything is how Trump has redefined American politics. Not even the pretense of unity.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen to the GOP?\n\nMy perspective is that the Republican Party is profoundly corrupted by Donald Trump and it has been corrupted by a tolerance for all and any type of amoral and immoral behavior. Tolerance for astounding levels of corruption and exposure of hypocrisy from the religious far-right leaders like Falwell, to everybody who screamed and shouted about some perfidious act that Obama or the Clintons allegedly committed. Trump has remade the Republican Party into an isolationist, grievance-driven, resentment-driven political party. The party looks like what it might have looked like if George Wallace had captured its nomination and become president. But nobody should underestimate Trump\u2019s capacity to destroy the Democratic Party as an institution. I think one of the most important things that is least discussed is that, how would you give consideration to the magnitude of the institutional failure of the Democratic Party should the party nominate someone who is defeated by Trump in the general election? And winning the popular vote doesn\u2019t count. The rules are the rules. And this election will be decided by the Electoral College. What are the consequences, and how do you assess the magnitude of the institutional failure if Trump and Trumpism is validated? If the majority of the country, or an electoral majority of the country, says four more years of him versus the alternative. It raises a substantial question about this moment of time and what\u2019s required. What has the first order of precedence? Is it to establish purity around an ideological agenda? Or is it to assemble the broadest possible political coalition around the broadest points of agreement and connection that unite people together who disagree on many issues for the purposes of repudiating Trump or Trumpism?\n\nI did want to go back and ask you about an argument that is made a lot, that Trump\u2019s judicial appointments make everything else about him worth it. As someone who worked on George W. Bush\u2019s court appointments, what do you make of that argument?\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling argument for people who are passionate about the federal judiciary. And so the conventional wisdom was that Hillary Clinton would be elected, that you would have 12 years of two Democratic administrations appointing justices \u2014 and the belief amongst conservatives and Republicans was that the judiciary would be remade. Instead what\u2019s happened really, in our partnership of convenience between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, is that the judiciary has been remade substantially through a conservative lens. So there\u2019s deep satisfaction among conservatives like that and there\u2019s no doubt that many conservatives fully recognize that their alliance with Trump is a devil\u2019s bargain. But they view Trump despite all of his odiousness as a better alternative than, say, Elizabeth Warren. The imposition of what they see as the AOC\u2013Sanders agenda. My personal belief is that Trump has every intention \u2014 and nobody should underestimate his ability to effectively directly communicate to his base \u2014 to portray the Democratic Party as a socialist party that believes in open borders, is soft on crime, is tolerant of open-air drug markets and homelessness, and will paint an apocalyptic caricature of the Democratic Party.\n\nFor example, he\u2019s made it clear that he intends to brand the party as a socialist party. Proposals like Medicare for All help him accomplish that. I think in America, a sociopath will beat a socialist seven days a week and twice on Sunday. The primaries are unique and the loudest, most dogmatic voices who we hear from the most in politics typically don\u2019t represent any majorities. But the idea that the Democratic nominee is going to carry into a general election against Trump? The position that anyone who has private health insurance is going to have it taken away and dumped into a pool is an extraordinarily unpopular position. I think some of the Democrats on the stage understand that. Not all of them do.\n\nWhat have you been up to during your months away from the spotlight?\n\nI advised somebody for the first months of the year who was thinking about running for president and in the end decided not to. And so you\u2019re unable to be on TV as a political commentator while you\u2019re doing something like that. That\u2019s ended so I\u2019m delighted to be back on MSNBC. I laugh, when you\u2019re not appearing on television it\u2019s like you\u2019ve been in a deep coma. Life goes on, there\u2019s the kids, activities, and everything else.\n\nSince we\u2019re talking about broad appeal, and you\u2019re saying that a socialist can\u2019t win: The alternative you\u2019ve proposed is a billionaire coffee CEO. Is that really the better option?\n\nHoward Schultz was not a candidate and he\u2019s not going to be a candidate. I advised somebody who was thinking of being a candidate in the end decided not to be a candidate. The choice that will exist for the American people, going back to what we were talking about, is a binary choice. There\u2019s going to be a Democratic nominee and there\u2019s going to be Trump. My point is, that\u2019s the most consequential election this country will face since the election of 1864 when really the issue was whether we were going to accept a slave state on North American soil and divide the country. This is the affirmation of Trump and Trumpism, which would result from his reelection and would be a profound event after four years of lawlessness and chaos. So the political question in this moment of time is to what degree is that important? Is this just another election or is this an election that requires an appeal to the broadest possible coalition of Americans who believe in the genius of the American system of government? No republic in history has ever endured. We\u2019re the oldest one. Going back to what Benjamin Franklin said after the Constitutional Convention to a passerby on the streets of Philadelphia about what had been wrought inside. He said, \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d\n\nTrump asked the Ukrainian president for political purposes and advantage to attack his political opponents and investigate them \u2014 and if you can do that to Joe Biden, you can do that to anybody. That\u2019s as un-American an action and as contrary to the constitutional requirements of the office as have ever played out.\n\nWhat did you learn from your time advising Howard Schultz?\n\nMy perspective has always been that Donald Trump is a symptom, is the prima facie evidence, of the brokenness of the American political system. A healthy political system doesn\u2019t produce Donald Trump as head of state. It\u2019s evidence of profound failure and disconnect. It was an interesting opportunity to be able to observe and study the American electorate and theorize about the possibility of a disruptive act and an opportunity for me to sit back and observe the political process as opposed to participating in it day by day and think about this moment in time.\n\nWhen you look at the structure of the argument that Admiral Bill McRaven advanced about Trump, where he talked about the American republic is under attack from within, that\u2019s not a statement of paranoia, that\u2019s a statement based on the facts of Trump\u2019s degrading the institutions and systems that have been built up over 200-plus years \u2014 but he talked about the values and the importance of the systems and framed the danger that Trump presents in an argument that thus far we have not heard from the Democratic contenders, save occasionally from Biden. I understand the passion by which people have for various issues. There are Republicans who have great passion to privatize the Social Security system and the VA, both very unpopular issues with the broad voting general-election electorate. Just like there\u2019s people on the progressive left who favor issues with great passion. I think that\u2019s good. Diversity of opinion and thought is what makes this all work. Is it a package of policies that should be at the heart of the argument against Trump? Or should it be the very values that are at the heart of Republic? I think that choice, about how to engage the electorate against Trump, is a profound one.\n\nWho in the field right now has the best shot at beating Trump?\n\nI think it\u2019s impossible to tell. There\u2019s a handful of top-tier candidates that the nominee is likely to emerge from: Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg. And maybe you put Klobuchar, Harris, and Booker outside that top tier. The candidate that is able to beat Trump is the candidate who is going to be able to best and most surgically and precisely define the stakes, define what this moment in time is, define the choice, speak to the aspirations of the country, and offer something better. I would submit that if Kamala Harris is hectoring Senator Warren on the stage to demand that Donald Trump be thrown off of Twitter, that falls well short of the mark required to be able to articulate something better. A debate about stupid things benefits Donald Trump.\n\nBut isn\u2019t Biden really the only one who, at this point or a month ago, is running against Trump? Everyone else is running against each other or whoever is the perceived front-runner. They haven\u2019t had a chance to make those arguments.\n\nYou made my spine shiver. Because it reminds me of the Republican primary when Christie is running against Rubio and Rubio against whoever. No one made an argument against Trump or Trumpism. If Donald Trump is going to be on the ballot \u2014 and he is \u2014 I would think that amongst the most important things that would play out over the primary process is who can make the most effective argument that has resonance amongst the broadest possible parts of the electorate against Trump and Trumpism. There may be an honest difference of opinion where someone says Trump and Trumpism isn\u2019t the defining issue in the 2020 election, health-care policy is, or tax policy is, or something else is. I don\u2019t believe that. I believe that as a predicate to be able to defeat Donald Trump, you have to have a sustained indictment of Trumpism and the ability to offer something better.\n\nDo you think Biden\u2019s messaging on that is on point?\n\nIt has been on point at times. But my larger point here is a lot of the coverage here is, \u201cDonald Trump is on defense.\u201d Donald Trump has more money on hand than any presidential candidate ever and disparity between him and his opponents is bigger than ever recorded. Republicans have a huge technology gap and a huge head start. An overwhelming majority of the country has already made up their minds about who they\u2019re going to vote for. There\u2019s an extremely small percentage of persuadable voters. So what should be the basis of the persuasion? It\u2019s an important and open strategic question. The reaction to Doral is about the on-the-face issue, but rarely is there an articulation of the deeper meaning.\n\nSo the candidates need to be focusing on their anti-Trump messages right now?\n\nThey should focus on whatever they think their messages should be. I\u2019m not advising any candidates. What I\u2019m saying is that, as I have observed the race, there has been an absence of articulation about the nature of Trump and Trumpism and why it\u2019s bad and how and why we can do better in a way that people can understand.", "description": "Former GOP operative and current MSNBC pundit Steve Schmidt is nervous: \u201cI think in America a sociopath will beat a socialist seven days a week.\u201d", "authors": ["James D.
