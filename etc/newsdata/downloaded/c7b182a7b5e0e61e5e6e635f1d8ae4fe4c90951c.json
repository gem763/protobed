Reeker, is acting assistant secretary in charge of European and Eurasian Affairs. He oversaw officials who interacted directly with Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani on Ukraine matters, at a time when Ukraine was being pressed to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and unproven theories about Democratic collusion with Ukrainians in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Reeker, who is answering questions behind closed doors, should be able to provide investigators with additional details about at least one aspect of the unfolding story: the ouster this spring of Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career foreign service officer, as the ambassador to Ukraine. According to one person familiar with his account, although he did not interact directly with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Reeker was aware of the lawyer\u2019s role in pushing out Ms. Yovanovitch. He went to some lengths to defend her from what he and others considered a smear campaign.\n\nBut it is unclear how much he knew about what others have called demands by Mr. Trump that the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce an investigation of the Biden family before Mr. Trump would agree to meet Mr. Zelensky or to release $391 million in military aid. Those discussions mainly involved two other State Department officials who had Mr. Trump\u2019s trust.", "description": "Philip Reeker is expected to offer additional details on the unexpected ouster of the ambassador to Ukraine.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Sharon Lafraniere"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/us/politics/27dc-impeach-print/merlin_162303825_aae655a2-e957-427c-97bb-beaf5620fb6a-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
