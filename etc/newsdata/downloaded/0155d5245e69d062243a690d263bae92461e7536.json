Extra vigilance is especially required when arriving or leaving the home.\n\nInstall reserve batteries for fences and gates too\n\nEnsure electric fencing and gates still work during load shedding by installing \u2013 and maintaining \u2013 batteries, Colman said.\n\nSuch batteries typically last between 6 hours and 8 hours when electricity supply goes down.\n\n\u201c[But] load shedding dramatically decreases a battery\u2019s lifespan, so it is incredibly important that these are tested or replaced.\n\nShe added homeowners should also ensure that their homes are locked up and adequately secured, in order to reduce the risk of a burglary during load shedding.\n\nSave Emergency contact information\n\nPeople should save emergency contact information on their phones and also keep a paper copy safe and accessible, Steyn said.\n\nThe list should include numbers for emergency services such as the fire department, police, and medical services.\n\n\u201cAlso, include contact information of friends and family along with insurance information.\u201d\n\nCharge electronic devices\n\nAlways keep cell phones, laptops, and tablets fully charged in case of an unscheduled blackout, Steyn said\n\n\u201cIt's also a good idea to have an emergency phone charger close by, this comes in handy during extended power outages.\n\n\u201cRemember to use devices sparingly during outages so that you don't drain the battery completely before the power returns.\u201d\n\nHave gas for cooking and lighting\n\nA small LP gas bottle and lamp gives good quality lighting for a large area and can also be used for cooking and boiling water, Steyn said.\n\nHe also suggests keeping hot water in a thermal flask so that you can make hot drinks.\n\nHave frozen bottled water\n\nKeeping emergency water stored is easy when frozen, Steyn said. And a frozen bottle of water helps to keep food cold, and prevents it from spoiling, for longer.\n\nUnplug all cables\n\nColman said it\u2019s always a good idea to unplug appliances, or any electronic devices, when the electricity goes out.\n\nThese appliances, which include cell phones and computer equipment, can be damaged when the power comes back on due to a spike in electricity flow, she said.\n\nSteyn said residents should consider any electrical connection as live during a power outage as power can return at any time.\n\nInstall surge protection\n\nElectric surges are one of the biggest causes of damage to equipment during a power outage, Steyn said.\n\nInstalling a surge protection device can help minimise some damage.\n\n\u201cHave a surge protection device fitted to your electrical distribution board or alternatively at the power outlet to the electronic device,\u201d he said.\n\nBack up data\n\nMake it a priority to save data offsite, in case of a hard drive crash or unforeseen electrical fault, Steyn said.\n\nOnline \"cloud-based\" backups are very convenient and are mostly automated, which means that you have one less thing to worry about, he said.\n\nOnly use generators outside\n\nWhile people may purchase generators, it is critical that these are never used inside the home or in an enclosed area, Coleman said.\n\n\u201cGenerators produce carbon monoxide, which can be fatal if inhaled and is highly flammable,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of this article was first published in February 13, 2019.", "description": "Business Insider asked two experts how South Africans can keep their homes safe during loadshedding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3957/1cf85cfb449441dc9d80ca45c565be4a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
