Jim Banks Seeks Retraction and Correction from NPR for Fake News", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) has sent a letter to National Public Radio (NPR) asking for a retraction and correction for its \u201cdisingenuous\u201d article claiming that the lawmaker had provided false information in an interview with the taxpayer-funded media outlet about the Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an October 2 interview with All Things Considered host Michel Martin, Banks called out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for leading what Banks described as a \u201cpolitical impeachment.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the interview article NPR posted on its website, Martin added commentary criticizing Banks\u2019 remarks.\n\n\u201cWe feel we must note that Congressman Banks did not accurately describe The New York Times reporting about Congressman Schiff and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe Times quoted a spokesman for Congressman Schiff who said Schiff never saw any part of the complaint or knew precisely what the whistleblower would deliver.\u201d\n\nAnd as Breitbart News reported, the Washington Post called out Schiff for his dishonesty:\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s \u201cFact Checker\u201d column hit House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) with four Pinocchios Friday for falsely claiming that his panel had \u201cnot spoken directly\u201d with the partisan CIA officer behind a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about President Donald Trump.\n\nThen NPR sent out its public editor, Elizabeth Jensen, to not only accuse Banks of inaccurate remarks, but promote the idea that the news outlet should use only pre-taped interviews instead of live ones so that it could edit them before they were aired.\n\nBanks addressed his letter seeking a retraction and correction to Edith Chapin, vice president and executive editor of NPR, and cc\u2019d all Republicans in the House and the Senate:\n\nIn fact, it is Mrs. Jensen\u2019s article that spreads misinformation. The premise of the article, that I mischaracterized Adam Schiff\u2019s relationship with the whistleblower, is false. I request that NPR publish an article correcting her \u201ccorrection.\u201d After a rambling introduction that takes well over half of the article and repeatedly alludes to \u201cerrors\u201d and \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the October 2 interview, Mrs. Jensen finally presents her account of my supposed lie. Apparently, I am guilty of \u201cincorrectly asserting that Schiff had \u201clied\u201d about his role in the whistleblower complaint.\u201d Mrs. Jensen then adds \u201c(I\u2019m not going to repeat the entire incorrect statement.)\u201d, as if my claims were so vulgar and salacious as to be unworthy of reprint. If she had included my full remarks, well-informed readers would see that everything I said about Adam Schiff is true. And demonstrably so. I stated the following three facts, which are taken directly from the interview transcript, and which Mrs. Jensen claims are false: \u201cAdam Schiff knew about the whistleblower. The whistleblower came to Chairman Schiff and to the intelligence committee even though he lied about it and said that he\u2019d never spoken directly to the whistleblower. We now know that he was part of orchestrating the whistleblower account to begin with.\u201d\n\nBanks points out in the letter that on the same day of the NPR interview, the New York Times ran a story \u201cdetailing how the whistleblower spoke with a House Intelligence Committee aide about the Trump-Zelensky phone call before the whistleblower filed an official complaint.\u201d\n\nHe also said Schiff made the same false claim in an interview on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cDuring a September 17, interview on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 Adam Schiff stated, \u2018We have not directly spoken with the whistleblower.\u2019 This, as the New York Times report proved, is untrue,\u201d Banks wrote.\n\n\u201cSo, Chairman Schiff, like Mrs. Jensen, did, in fact, \u2018lie about it,\u2019\u201d Banks wrote.\n\nBanks then nailed down the final true statement he made in the interview:\n\nRegarding my final claim, the New York Times story reports that Chairman Schiff\u2019s aide counseled the whistleblower to find legal representation and then file a formal complaint with an inspector general. In accordance with the staffer\u2019s advice, the whistle-blower hired attorneys Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, and submitted a complaint to Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Additionally, on September 10, 2019 Chairman Schiff sent a public letter to acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, calling for him to turn over a then little-known whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee. According to the New York Times report, Maguire\u2019s staff was \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the aggressive, public campaign, as such negotiations are typically conducted privately. The Chairman\u2019s unusual decision was clearly motivated by his firsthand knowledge of the whistleblowers\u2019 grievance. So, Chairman Schiff did play a clear role in \u201corchestrating the whistleblower account.\u201d\n\nBanks also called out NPR for claiming it interviews more Democrats than Republicans because members of the GOP won\u2019t agree to be interviewed.\n\n\u201cBut she never asks why they might hesitate to appear on NPR. The lack of self-awareness is astounding,\u201d Banks wrote. \u201cRepublicans have come to expect the biased, deceptive, and self-serving behavior embodied by Mrs. Jensen\u2019s article. Its publication simply served to remind conservatives that NPR will not treat us fairly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin NPR\u2019s newsroom, it seems Mrs. Jensen\u2019s stance towards my interview is a typical one,\u201d Banks wrote. \u201cWhen a listener tweeted \u2018Jim Banks spouting clear lies on NPR and he got no pushback. Why?\u2019 \u2018All things Considered\u2019 host Mary Louise Kelly replied, \u2018Don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever interviewed Jim Banks but when I do, I\u2019ll look forward to pressing him for evidence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will not be interviewing me anytime soon, but luckily Mrs. Kelly can find the \u2018evidence\u2019 she seeks by reading this letter, or the original New York Times report,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBanks concludes his letter by reminding NPR that as a taxpayer-funded media outlet it has \u201ca special responsibility to remain evenhanded\u201d even while acknowledging that all of public broadcasting has a long history of political bias to the left.\n\n\u201cBut, if you retract and issue a correction to Mrs. Jensen\u2019s disingenuous article, NPR will have taken a step towards basic standards of journalistic integrity,\u201d Banks wrote. \u201cAnd if you sincerely do wish to book Republican lawmakers, they may be more likely to accept your request.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Rep.
