His Enemies Won. But Who Can Govern Israel?", "language": "en", "text": "The strangest episode of Israel\u2019s raucous election\u2014the second in six months\u2014flickered by almost unnoticed, one clip among the 30 videos Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted to his YouTube channel in the final two days before Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nLush with images of sleek Israelis surfing off Tel Aviv beaches and sipping coffee and cocktails in a succession of inviting bars and caf\u00e9s, it almost looked like a product of the tourism ministry\u2014 until the part where you see a woman\u2019s toes peek beyond a blanket, reaching out to tease the toes of the man sharing the bed with her, and those manly toes turning away.\n\n\u201cRight-wing voters have to wake up!\u201d the caption blared. \u201cOn Tuesday, you have to go out to vote Likud, and bring family and friends!\u201d\n\nThe Likud is Netanyahu\u2019s party, and the ad was meant as a counter-incentive. Netanyahu\u2019s pitch can be summed up thus: Don\u2019t sleep with your hot girlfriend. Don\u2019t go to the beach. Don\u2019t enjoy Tel Aviv\u2019s great caf\u00e9s. Go out and vote for me!\n\nIf Netanyahu was concerned about voter fatigue, he needn\u2019t have worried.\n\nTurnout was a few points higher than it was in the April 9 vote, despite fresh memories of the night six weeks later in which Netanyahu acknowledged he\u2019d failed to form a coalition government and\u2014instead of returning the mandate to Israel\u2019s President, Reuven Rivlin\u2014dissolved the parliament and sent Israel into second elections.\n\nOn first glance it looks like Israelis returned a second inconclusive verdict, this time with gusto.\n\nThe apparent draw between Netanyahu\u2019s Likud and the main opposition party, Blue and White, led by former army chief of staff Benny Gantz, with each claiming about 33 seats out of the parliament\u2019s 120, seems to indicate that Israelis have no idea what they want.\n\nOn second glance, it is clear that Netanyahu, who has dominated Israeli politics for decades and has served as prime minister for the last ten years, lost\u2014if only because all of his perceived enemies won.\n\nNetanyahu ran his campaign as if he was besieged in a bunker, regularly taking aim at sham nemeses.\n\nHe deemed Avigdor Lieberman, a hardline secular nationalist best known for advocating the death penalty for terrorists, \u201ca leftist.\u201d\n\nLieberman, Netanyahu\u2019s former defense minister, triggered both the elections of 2019, first by resigning in December 2018, and then by refusing in May to join a coalition beholden to the demands of ultra-orthodox Jewish parties.\n\nLieberman\u2019s wager paid off, and he has come close to doubling the number of seats his party holds in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, to a projected eight or nine.\n\nYohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, in Jerusalem, said \u201cLieberman is the ultimate kingmaker. Netanyahu does not have a government without Lieberman. Lieberman can really dictate the makeup, to a certain extent, of the next government.\u201d\n\nOfficial elections results are expected on Sept. 25, after the certification of the ballot counts, which is conducted by hand.\n\nNetanyahu attacked the media from the start to the end of his campaign, complaining, in his 3 a.m. Wednesday not-concession speech delivered before a largely empty hall, that the press had forced him to contend with \"the most difficult, the most biased campaign ever.\"\n\nBut the press got it right this time, forecasting that he would be left without room to maneuver ahead of the Oct. 2 hearing at which his attorney general, who announced his intention to indict Netanyahu on a raft of corruption charges last February, will lay out the evidence against him.\n\nSuch is Netanyahu\u2019s predicament that on Wednesday, he canceled his participation in next week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, one of his favorite events of the year.\n\nGantz vows to pursue peace with the Palestinians, to institute term limits, and, has unrelentingly promised his supporters that he will never join a government including Netanyahu while he remains a criminal suspect.\n\nThis stance seems to rule out a possible government of national unity, in which Blue and White would sit together with the Likud.\n\nThis electoral dead end is leading observers to envisage what was once unthinkable: a unity government in which Likud would be led by someone else.\n\nIn the event the party, hungry to hold on to power, ousts Netanyahu as its leader, \u201ca new chairman of the Likud might be able to form a government with Blue and White, and then we will probably witness an outcome of a rotation of the position of the Prime Minister between Mr. Gantz and whoever the Likud will elect,\u201d Plesner says, predicting that Israel is \u201cabout to enter a period of political uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThroughout his campaign, Netanyahu reserved his most vicious, most uncompromising, and finally most unhinged attacks for Israel\u2019s Arab minority, 20 percent of the population and about 16 percent of the voting public, whose participation in the last vote sunk to an historic low. He accused Arab politicians of supporting terrorism. He accused his opponent, Gantz, a decorated general, of conspiring with Arab leaders to name them ministers.\n\nNetanyahu also accused Gantz of concealing the fact that Iran had hacked his phone, obtaining sleazy photographs proving sexual misbehavior\u2014an accusation that appears to have been invented out of whole cloth.\n\nIn the campaign\u2019s frenzied final week, Netanyahu tried to rush through the Knesset a law allowing his party to hide cameras in Arab polling places\u2014as it did, illegally, in April, causing an uproar. The bill failed. And he became the first head of government to be sanctioned by Facebook for hate speech, when his page sent out messages warning that \u201cArabs want to annihilate us all \u2013 women, children and men.\u201d\n\n\u201c Netanyahu was defeated, he lost, and as far as we can see, there is no feasible way he could form a new coalition. \u201d \u2014 Ehud Olmert\n\nThe Joint List, a majority-Arab party, that ran as several disparate factions in April, mobilized a major get-out-the-vote operation, apparently surging to 13 seats and becoming Israel\u2019s third largest party, after the Likud and Blue and White.\n\nWith an Arab, Joint List chairman Ayman Odeh, who exulted late Tuesday that \u201cincitement didn\u2019t work!\u201d and a \"leftist,\" Avigdor Lieberman, poised to play kingmakers, the election results constitute a Netanyahu nightmare.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu was defeated,\u201d Ehud Olmert, a former prime minister and Likud elder, told The Daily Beast in an interview, \u201che lost, and as far as we can see, there is no feasible way he could form a new coalition.\u201d\n\nBut since it looks \u201cdoubtful that any possible coalition would achieve the support of 61 Knesset members,\u201d Olmert said, \u201cit is likely there will be another round of elections in early 2020.\u201d\n\nFor Israel to once again have a stable government, the only solution Olmert sees is another round of elections \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nBut unlike Netanyahu\u2019s opponents, who have spent the past year admonishing the public about the danger the prime minister poses to Israeli democracy, Olmert is sanguine.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s democratic foundations are very stable,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is no real fear they are being undermined.\u201d Not only that, he said, mentioning the United Kingdom, \u201cthe difficulty of ruling a state is not just an Israeli phenomenon\u2026 These are relatively common phenomena and Israel is no exception.\u201d", "description": "\u201cNetanyahu lost,\u201d says former prime minister Ehud Olmert, who foresees another round of elections in early 2020.", "authors": ["Noga Tarnopolsky"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568853004/190917-noga-israeli-tease_douxna", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
