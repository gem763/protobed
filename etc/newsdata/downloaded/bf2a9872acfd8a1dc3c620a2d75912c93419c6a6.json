Source: Coin360\n\nThe top cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around $8,355, having lost 2% on the day at press time. The majority of the decline took place over a period of just 1 hour earlier today, when the coin slumped from $8,734 to $8,404.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price fluctuations are highly thought-provoking, leaving industry stakeholders much to speculate on. Metrics and predictive indices project Indexica suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s fall is explained by a growing cryptocurrency ecosystem rather than by the coin itself. Zak Selbert, CEO at Indexica, argued:\n\n\u201cNow that Bitcoin is a big kid, anything can make it move, just like anything can make gold or a G-10 currency move. Bitcoin is part of the financial landscape in a very intertwined and mature way.\u201d\n\nBitcoin 24-hour price chart.

Ether\u2019s weekly and monthly gains remain in positive territory, at about 3.91% and 0.83% respectively.\n\nEther 24-hour price chart.

Earlier today, the coin saw an upswing to $0.275, after which it has been reporting a gradual decline over the course of the day.\n\nEarlier today, alluding to the spate of controversies that had beset the project, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued that Ripple\u2019s \u201ctransparency has opened us up to attack.\u201d Garlinghouse said there is a \u201cbunch of misinformation\u201d out there, but claimed that this is in part because Ripple is \u201cten or a hundred times more transparent than anyone in the crypto community.\u201d\n\nXRP 24-hour price chart.

The third winner on the top-20 list is Cosmos (ATOM), which is struggling to remain in the green, having gained modest 0.88% to press time.\n\nTotal market capitalization of all digital currencies is around $224,8 billion at press time.", "description": "Major cryptocurrency markets have seen a sharp drop today, with total market capitalization around $224 billion", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xN2Q0YzgyOWEyNTcyYzBlODA4YTUyNzcwNDBmNWMzYi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
