About 10 days after the assault, she came home from work and decided to tell her parents what had happened.\n\nAt the time, Chanel was just out of college and still living with her parents in Palo Alto. She said she practiced over and over in her room how she would word what happened, without the details that she feared would upset them.\n\nBut when she finally had her parents at the dinner table, all that preparation went out the window and she struggled to tell them about what she had suffered:\n\n\"I said, There's news, don't look at the news, have you seen the news? That Stanford assault guy? They shook their heads; my dad said, Vaguely, a word he often used. \"Remember the party we went to, Tiffany and I, that guy tried to, he was caught. I'm not sure, but I think it was just his fingers, so that's good. I shrugged. I don't remember, so. But it's awful when you read it, so you don't need to, please don't, actually. I couldn't say any more, stood smiling like an insane person.\"\n\nMiller said her father told her he was sorry and asked for details, while her mother was initially motionless.\n\nEventually, her mom too started asking questions about who her assailant was, questions Miller didn't have many answers to at the time.\n\nRead more: Chanel Miller says the positive reaction to her powerful victim impact speech during Brock Turner's trial 'was like feeling the shame dissolve'\n\nHer dad baked her a pie the next day\n\nMiller said the \"intensity\" of the moment silenced her.\n\nMiller recalled:\n\n\"I could not bear what the room had become ... As I stood at the head of the table, unable to fill the silence, I broke. Bent over, my mouth opened in cries of pain, wet gasps. I heard the chair scrape the wood as my mom pushed away from the table, springing up, immediate ... She held on to me tightly, one arm locked firmly around my side, the other hand stroking my hair. Whispering Mommy's not mad, mommy's just scared.\"\n\nMiller said that night she could \"finally soften, exhale\" with the weight of the secret no longer on her shoulders.\n\nThe next morning, she woke up to a touching surprise \u2014 a lemon pie and a note from her father.\n\n\"In the hushed hours of morning while I'd been sleeping, my dad had picked lemons from the backyard, boiled sugar and eggs over the stove, pressed fingertips into crust along the edge, sprinkled powdered sugar on top,\" Miller recalled. \"I brought it to work to share.\"\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673) or visit hotline.rainn.org/online and receive confidential support.", "description": "On Tuesday, Chanel Miller released a memoir detailing the Stanford sexual assault and the aftermath, titled \"Know My Name.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b8f2ff4fc240f9f57175c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
