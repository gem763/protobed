What responsibilities do we have \u2014 as individuals, as members of families, friendship groups, classes, workplaces \u2014 to help others manage their grief? When do we ask \u201cWhy did this happen?\u201d and when do we ask \u201cWhat can we do now?\u201d \u201cNow Comes the Mystery\u201d doesn\u2019t fully answer any of these questions, but it starts to address them, with great care and humanity. And tears. So, so many tears.\n\nFirst, everyone needs to hear the terrible news that Alaska has died in a car wreck the night before. This announcement prompts Pudge to run for the nearest trash can to puke his guts out, but after his final heave, he brightens at the prospect that Alaska must be alive; this is the sort of over-the-top prank she would pull just to be a goofy, attention-seeking jerk. The Eagle assures Pudge that Alaska is dead: He saw Alaska\u2019s body. Her death was instant, and because she didn\u2019t swerve to avoid the police car that she hit at the scene of a broken-down truck, they assume her intoxication was the cause.\n\nEveryone in the gym is sobbing. Even Kevin and Holly are allowing themselves to be comforted in prayer by Dr. Hyde. Pudge collapses to the floor, sobbing now, too. Same. This is wrenching.\n\nIn the first echo of scenes from previous episodes, the Colonel shoves all of his belongings (including his pristine Do The Right Thing poster, which he rolls, then crumples hastily) into a duffel bag and marches over to the Eagle\u2019s Nest, demanding to be kicked out. It all comes tumbling out in a big rush: The Colonel set the firecrackers to lure the Eagle out of his house the night before, and he let Alaska go because she swore she was okay to drive, and he just can\u2019t bear not being punished for this.\n\nAt the end of this speech, the Colonel loses the last shreds of his composure, and the Eagle envelops him in a very loving, fatherly hug. I\u2019m still in a one-way feud with the Eagle because of his handling of the Weekend Warriors\u2019 parent demands in \u201cWe Are All Going,\u201d but I also can\u2019t imagine a better response to the Colonel\u2019s present distress. The height difference between Timothy Simons and Denny Love is emphasized here for sincere sweetness and a reinforcement of the idea, previously articulated by Alaska\u2019s mother, that big kids need their grown-ups, too.\n\nTakumi, ever the investigator, asks what happened the night before and is furious with Pudge and the Colonel for letting Alaska go: \u201cShe\u2019s so goddamned impulsive, you have to watch her every second, she\u2019s like a 3-year-old!\u201d Hanging in his mind must be the bitter irony from their last conversation, when Alaska loftily declared Takumi far too young to understand the complexities of adult relationships.\n\nCampus-wide grief for Alaska has also been yielding an abundance of kindnesses: Lara checks on Pudge while he plays Mortal Kombat for hours on end. Takumi brings Pudge some food as a reconciliation gesture. He\u2019s sorry he blamed Pudge and the Colonel, but they\u2019d have gotten to this stage of self-recrimination anyway. Takumi sees Lara weeping quietly in her room and sits down to offer a shoulder and hug. Sara lets the Colonel know that Kevin and Longwell\u2019s parents have dropped their complaint against him, so he won\u2019t be expelled after all.\n\nClasses resume, and predictably, everyone is a complete wreck. At least Dr. Hyde has some philosophy that may help the kids work through their grief. The class\u2019s attention will now turn to Alaska\u2019s question: How will we ever get out of this labyrinth of suffering? When she handed in her paper in the previous episode, she said she must have failed the assignment because her question is impossible to answer, but Dr. Hyde believes that the best questions are the ones without definitive answers.\n\nRemember back in \u201cTell Them I Said Something,\u201d when Pudge dithered over his precalc-group-study-date outfit? Now he struggles with his funeral ensemble, and in Alaska\u2019s absence, he goes to Dr. Hyde for tie assistance. Both I and Dr. Hyde concur: This is a strong choice. Hyde has lots of good ties and lets Pudge wear the one he wore to stand outside the cemetery gates at Diego\u2019s funeral. (Diego\u2019s family wouldn\u2019t permit him to attend, layering an extra indignity on top of his grief)\n\nDr. Hyde shares a piece of Buddhist philosophy that draws on the concept of suffering being an outcome of desire: \u201cWhen you stop wishing things won\u2019t fall apart, you\u2019ll stop suffering when they do. Until then, this will hurt, but you will survive, until you don\u2019t.\u201d I am not fully down with this philosophy (largely because I think that perfect detachment is neither desirable nor attainable for most of us), but I appreciate what Dr. Hyde is trying to do here. It\u2019s helpful to have alternate options for thinking through one\u2019s experiences and sadnesses, even if you can\u2019t use it in the moment.\n\nAfter checking off all of his students\u2019 names as they exit the funeral bus, the Eagle remains aboard, not quite able to go into the church just yet. Longwell notices and turns back to check on him. The Eagle is wracked with regret and guilt, saying he was so focused on protecting his students and insisting that they listen to him that he failed to listen to them. He can see now that Alaska was in terrible pain, and his actions made her pain worse. Longwell responds that the entire school made it worse for her, but the Eagle won\u2019t let himself off the hook, pointing out that it\u2019s natural for kids to make those kinds of mistakes, but he should have done better.\n\nLongwell reminds him that \u201cit\u2019s not too late. We could all really use an adult right about now.\u201d As Longwell stands up to exit the bus, I notice that his and the Eagle\u2019s costumes \u2014 navy, light blue, and charcoal gray \u2014 rhyme with each other, as do their hairstyles. Longwell\u2019s is a lightly mussed teen version of the Eagle\u2019s early-period-Captain America-crossed-with-a-Kewpie-doll hair swoop. The suggestion that Longwell could grow up to be a mensch is the single most hopeful idea in the entire episode.\n\nDown at the post-burial luncheon at the American Legion hall, the Colonel is working up a righteous head of steam about what an asshole Alaska\u2019s father is and how, ultimately, he is to blame for all the bad things that have happened this year. The Colonel jumps up, and in an echo of how he behaved toward the Weekend Warriors his first day on campus, attacks Alaska\u2019s dad at the bar, shouting that he is to blame, he was the reason she couldn\u2019t go home. Longwell and Kevin intercede when it looks like the Colonel might take a swing, with Dolores joining in to say you can\u2019t attack a man who just buried his child, and apologizing for the Colonel, but Alaska\u2019s dad de-escalates by agreeing with him. He knows that he lost Alaska years ago by holding her responsible for her mother\u2019s death. He drove his only child away, and didn\u2019t deserve her, and \u201cnow she\u2019s gone, and I can never make it right.\u201d\n\nPudge reflects on his and Alaska\u2019s one perfect evening together and recalls suddenly that the phone was ringing as Alaska kissed him good-bye. Who would have called her that night? Turns out it was Jake, who had called to say that even though they\u2019ve broken up, he\u2019d always think of her on that day, because it\u2019s the anniversary of the day they met. He has no idea why that would make her flip out and run screaming from the phone.\n\nBack at the smoking hole, the boys debate the significance of the call, with Takumi and the Colonel concluding that she must have felt bad about how she treated Jake and was driving up to his college to apologize in person. Pudge can\u2019t accept it, but he doesn\u2019t have an alternate explanation, either, and the argument ends where it began, in their shared grief.\n\nOh, hey, it\u2019s the second Postal Service musical cue of the series! We\u2019re treated to Iron & Wine\u2019s suitably down-tempo acoustic version of \u201cSuch Great Heights\u201d for a montage featuring the Eagle shaving off his mustache and Pudge finally calling his parents back. As ever, the Halters are so sweet and loving, offering anything to help him through this awful time, but just knowing he can call and that they\u2019ll answer is enough to see him through for now.\n\nPudge returns to Alaska\u2019s room to help the Colonel find and remove any contraband she might have left behind, and as they mourn the loss of so much of her Life\u2019s Library, Pudge thinks of The General in His Labyrinth. Flipping to the page where Bol\u00edvar asks \u201cHow will I ever get out of this labyrinth?,\u201d he sees Alaska\u2019s marginalia: \u201cstraight and fast.\u201d Straight and fast is how she drove into the crash. What if her death wasn\u2019t an accident at all?\n\nFamous Last Words\n\n\u2022 If Pudge and the Colonel dig a literary grave for the most damaged titles in Alaska\u2019s Life Library, I hope it will match the excellence of The Ultimate Book Return staged by Taystee and Poussey in Orange Is the New Black\n\n\u2022 Poetry Alert! Did you, like me, think that the passage Dr. Hyde read aloud at Alaska\u2019s funeral was beautiful but not know what it was? I did a minor Google and learned that it was an excerpt from Wallace Stevens\u2019s \u201cCy Est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste. Ursule, et Les Unze Mille Vierges,\u201d which is, like Alaska herself, elusive and open to interpretation. I can also heartily recommend the full poem by W.H. Auden that Alaska quoted to Pudge in \u201cThe Nourishment Is Palatable,\u201d \u201cI Walked Out One Evening.\u201d One doesn\u2019t always expect to have one\u2019s curiosity about modernist poetry piqued when sitting down to watch TV, but this medium is vast and contains multitudes.\n\n\u2022 Musical Cue of the Episode goes to Kat Cunning\u2019s cover of \u201cOrange Sky\u201d for the gentle aptness of the refrain \u201cMy salvation lies in your love.\u201d", "description": "How will we ever get out of this labyrinth of suffering?
