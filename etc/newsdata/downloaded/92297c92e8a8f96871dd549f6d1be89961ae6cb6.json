But there\u2019s no espionage here, in the mountains of Asia\u2019s other hermit kingdom, Bhutan. Colorful prayer flags drape the forest path and a waterfall flows near this sacred Bhutanese monastery, where one of the holiest figures in Buddhism was said to have arrived in the country more than a thousand years ago.\n\nThough the name evokes a secret cinematic lair, the roots of the Tiger\u2019s Nest are more folkloric. According to legend, in the 700s, a Tibetan missionary known as the Second Buddha mounted the back of a tigress and flew up to this remote mountaintop in the Eastern Himalayas, where he is said to have taken up residence in one of the cliff\u2019s caves for three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours of meditation. After, he spread Buddhism to the Bhutanese. The country continues to celebrate his legacy today with an annual festival in his honor.\n\nOfficially called the Taktsang Palphug Monastery, the four connecting temples of the Tiger\u2019s Nest were built in 1692, tacked onto the rock face in homage to the holy leader. Today it\u2019s believed to be one of the highest temples in the world. When the original complex partially burned down in a fire in 1998, killing one monk and damaging valuable artwork, it took seven years for the government to renovate the Tiger\u2019s Nest back to its ancient glory.", "description": "On a cliff at 10,000 feet hangs the monastery dubbed the Tiger\u2019s Nest, with its roots in the Second Buddha\u2019s legend and sheer drops on the way up.", "authors": ["Nina Strochlic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492458776/articles/2013/11/07/the-tiger-s-nest-may-make-you-start-planning-a-trip-to-bhutan/131106-strochlic-tigers-nest_ilk86y", "published_at": "2013-11-07"}
