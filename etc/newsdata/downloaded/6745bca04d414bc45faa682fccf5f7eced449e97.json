The pair began dating in 2001, which, for reference, was the year Evans starred in (and was best known for) Not Another Teen Movie, and about six seasons into Biel\u2019s tenure on 7th Heaven. If the cultural context isn\u2019t enough to transport you to the land before smart phones, here\u2019s a reminder of what it looked like:\n\nView photos SGranitz/Getty Images More\n\nWhy We Loved Them: From the sounds of it, Jessica and Chris were that super cute, super active (and frankly super annoying) couple who are always trying new things and gushing over their \u201cperson\u201d in ultra-curated Instagram posts. Like, they went skydiving \u2014 for VALENTINE\u2019S DAY. Nothing says \u201cI love you\u201d like a life-threatening plunge into the cloudy abyss \u2026 When they weren\u2019t adventuring, the couple was busy co-starring in poorly received films \u2014 thriller Cellular in 2004 and romantic drama London the following year.\n\nRELATED: TBT: Joaquin Phoenix and Liv Tyler Kept Their Relationship a Secret on the Set of Their 1997 Film\n\nWhen They Peaked: In a 2005 interview with Cosmopolitan, Biel opened up about what Evans was like as a boyfriend, revealing that he surprised her on her 21st birthday by scattering rose petals on her bed. Biel made herself sound like a lovely partner as well, explaining that she loved to take photos of Chris and his dog and also enjoyed cooking for him (the human \u201chim\u201d). \u201cIt's old-fashioned and fun, and I feel kind of homemaker-y and great doing it,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nView photos Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images More\n\nThe Breakup: By 2006, Chrissica (Jiss?) was no longer. Neither actor is particularly fond of discussing their love lives publicly, so we don\u2019t have a ton of clues as to what went wrong between the couple. I mean, just one year prior Biel had said that she and Evans \u201calways talk about\u201d marriage \u2014 the trail is cold.\n\nView photos Jean-Paul Aussenard/Getty Images More", "description": "Take a look back at the relationship between actors Jessica Biel and Chris Evans.", "authors": ["Isabel Jones"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/16G_XCeP17MO_8j6eXdnvw--~B/aD0zMDUyO3c9MjI4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/2cd3de746a680e09b32d4bfc66037eb5", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
