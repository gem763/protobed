It\u2019s an incredibly easy way to take the nightmare of tabs you\u2019ve been saving in your browser window and condense them all into a single, easy-to-scan web page. I use this extension constantly, and it has helped me turn my overflowing tab problem into a more manageable mess.\n\nHere\u2019s one secret I\u2019ve picked up during my time as a OneTab aficionado: It\u2019s not enough to turn your many tabs into a single, navigable page. You need to make sure you\u2019re backing up that page (or its contents), because one crash, glitch, or other browser boo-boo, and you\u2019ll have lost everything you\u2019ve been saving. It has happened to me before \u2014 rarely, I should note \u2014 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a bit crazier about backups now.\n\nMy OneTab extension got all messed up and corrupted and I lost thousands of tabs I\u2019d saved over the past year and I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t... I don\u2019t know, back it up somehow? \u2014 Yael Grauer (@yaelwrites) August 29, 2019\n\nTo back up your OneTab-saved sites, you have a few options. The first and easiest method is to simply share your list of saved sites as a web page, and then save that web page anywhere on your PC. As an added bonus, this makes all the links easily clickable and they won\u2019t disappear from the list when you click them (as you\u2019ve surely noticed if you\u2019ve ever clicked a link directly a on OneTab page).\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nYou can also use OneTab\u2019s \u201cExport / Import URLs\u201d feature to dump a text file of all of your saved URLs. You won\u2019t be able to click on them very easily, but you can import them into any OneTab instance you want\u2014whether that\u2019s on your computer, because something mucked up and you lost all your URLs, or a different computer entirely.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried either option and you end up losing all your saved websites as a result of a crash or other issue, you might still be able to restore your missing list of sites by digging deep into your Chrome databases.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee this will work, and you\u2019ll probably need to grab or fire up a file-recovery tool like Recuva as soon as it happens, but it\u2019s worth investigating in case of a catastrophe.\n\nMy advice? Use OneTab to clean up a busy browser, but don\u2019t neglect bookmarks. Your browser can crash, but your bookmarks should (hopefully) survive any issues. They\u2019ll always be there for you, forever, whenever you need them.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to organise \u2014 even automatically, if you\u2019re feeling lazy \u2014 and they\u2019re a much better long-term archival solution than even the mighty OneTab, as helpful as that extension is.", "description": "I love OneTab, and you should, too.
