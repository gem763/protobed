It may even feel as hot as 110 F away from the coast.\n\nSeveral record highs were tied or broken across the south on Thursday. In Vero Beach, Florida, which had been at risk from impacts from Dorian earlier in the week, the high temperature of 97 broke the old Sept. 5 record of 96 set back in 1996. New Orleans tied its record of 97; the last time the city hit 97 on Sept. 5 was in 2000.\n\nThose along the Southeast coast left without power in the wake of Dorian will need to take extra precautions, such as drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated and taking frequent breaks in the shade during strenuous activity.\n\nWhile Sunday will still be hot, the arrival of some spotty showers and thunderstorms can help to keep temperatures a couple of degrees lower from eastern North Carolina to the panhandle of Florida.\n\nTemperatures will remain on the higher side into the beginning of next week, but more widespread showers and thunderstorms will knock temperatures down by a couple degrees in most locations.\n\n\"Temperatures should fall below 100 degrees in most areas by Sunday and Monday,\" added Adamson, \"but it will still likely be above normal for early September, with widespread mid-90s.\"\n\nDownload the free AccuWeather app to keep track of temperature trends in your area.
