The initial reaction from companies, he said later, was why should we help people we\u2019re firing?\n\nThe aptly named Mr. Challenger, who died Aug. 30 at age 93, struggled for years to persuade companies it was good business to be nice to people heading involuntarily out the door. It was good for their image among other people they wanted to keep or attract, he argued. It also could help prevent lawsuits from aggrieved former employees. Eventually, he persuaded some big companies, including McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Motorola Inc., to try his services.\n\nOutplacement services, provided by scores of firms, have become standard at most large companies. Challenger Gray, now run by one of his sons, John Challenger, has more than 300 employees in 27 offices across the U.S. and says it helps over 10,000 people a year find jobs.\n\nHis goal was to have his counselors on the spot to meet people immediately after they learned of their dismissals. The idea was to prevent them from doing something stupid, like bad-mouthing themselves or their former employers. \u201cThere\u2019s a great tendency to destroy your market in that first week,\u201d he told Nation\u2019s Business in 1992.\n\nHe encouraged the newly unemployed to write reports about their work histories and attitudes toward life. Giving them this homework \u201ckeeps them out of the marketplace for about 10 days,\u201d allowing them to cool off, he said. It also was a way of bolstering their self-confidence by reminding them of their past successes.\n\nHe was willing to take on tough cases. \u201cWe have never turned down a client, no matter what the problem,\u201d he said in the 1992 interview. \u201cWe get a couple of dozen alcoholics every year, and one or two embezzlers. We don\u2019t pick and choose.\u201d\n\nHis approach came partly from his own experience. When business was slow in the early days, Mr. Challenger interviewed for jobs that he didn\u2019t plan to accept, merely \u201cto see what worked and what didn\u2019t work.\u201d He said he was offered a job about half the time.\n\nJames Edgar Challenger was born Dec. 6, 1925, and grew up in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Ill. His father was a radiologist. HIs mother had immigrated from Norway as a child.\n\nThe younger Mr. Challenger served in the Army Air Corps in the U.S. during World War II. After the war, he studied economics at Harvard University and graduated in 1947. While still studying at Harvard, he launched an advertising agency in New York. Under family pressure, he abandoned that venture and enrolled at Northwestern University, where he earned a law degree in 1951.\n\nHe and Ruth \u201cTimmey\u201d Gordon Rozier both worked on the 1952 presidential campaign of Adlai Stevenson. They married in June of that year.\n\nMr. Challenger joined a Chicago law firm. While he was on an extended vacation with his wife in Europe, the law firm dismissed him. \u201cIn one way or another,\u201d he told Nation\u2019s Business, \u201cI\u2019m sure I told the senior partner I was smarter than he was.\u201d\n\nHe later ran a small manufacturer of gas-fired heating equipment. His only qualification for the job, he said later, was that the owner liked him. Eventually, he decided he wanted to lead his own business.\n\nChallenger Gray couldn\u2019t please all of its clients. In 2009, The Wall Street Journal quoted Sonia Service, a former PepsiCo Inc. employee, as saying Challenger Gray sent letters to prospective employers, without her approval, that included typos. During a practice lunch interview, she said, a job-searching coach chided her for ordering cranberry juice. The coach said that choice could be interpreted as a sign of a urinary-tract infection.\n\nMr. Challenger defended his firm\u2019s practices and added: \u201cWe understand that clients get angry; angry at their former employer, angry at us, angry at the prospective employers that don\u2019t seem to be calling back.\u201d Worrying about beverage choices might seem silly, he added, but the message was to think about interviewers\u2019 perceptions: \u201cOrdering ice tea, water or coffee doesn\u2019t stand out. Ordering cranberry juice might.\u201d\n\nMr. Challenger was known for his lavish Christmas parties, featuring banjo bands, celebrity guests and what his family described as his dangerous punch. His many collections\u2014including baseball cards, Toby jugs and antique advertising signs\u2014filled the basement of his home in Winnetka, Ill.\n\nHis wife died in 2008. Mr. Challenger is survived by five children and 23 grandchildren.\n\nHe was always happy to talk about job hunting. One of the worst things to say in a job interview, he told Business Week in 1983, was: \u201cMy last boss was a jerk.\u201d That remark is likely to \u201ccreate the impression that you can\u2019t get along with people,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to James R.
