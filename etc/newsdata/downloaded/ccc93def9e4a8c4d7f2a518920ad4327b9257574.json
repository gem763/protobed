Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) along with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) penned a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The letter was in response to a report by BuzzFeed News and ProPublica that uncovered the company\u2019s use of contractors to deliver its packages, with a focus on the poor treatment and conditions those workers face in addition to the lack of adequate workplace protection and benefits. Since these companies are not owned by Amazon, the company can deny all responsibility.\n\nIn its response letter, Amazon claims that it regularly audits its contractors for labor safety violations and provides contract employees a \u201csecure network\u201d for raising complaints. \u201cAs a result of information received through the reporting network, we have terminated contracts with DSPs,\u201d Amazon wrote. However, it did not disclose the names of any of the over 800 delivery providers it hires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed by Amazon\u2019s evasive response\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed by Amazon\u2019s evasive response,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cAmazon\u2019s claims that it regularly audits and sanctions delivery service providers ring hollow given the troubling facts laid out in these reports. At a minimum, Amazon is falling far short of its responsibility to ensure its contractors are following labor laws and safety regulations.\u201d\n\nAmazon also refused to directly respond to questions the senators posed alleging that the company has worked to block the creation of a union. In its response letter, Amazon wrote that it \u201crespects its employees\u2019 right, and those of our delivery providers, to choose to join or not join a labor union.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, lawmakers and labor activists have taken aim at Amazon over its labor practices. Last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) introduced a bill that scared Amazon into paying its employees $15 an hour, called the \u201cSTOP BEZOS Act,\u201d and reports have surfaced alleging the company has failed to pay its workers overtime. The company has also engaged in aggressive anti-union tactics over the years, particularly with regard to warehouse workers, and has faced protests worldwide over working conditions.\n\n\u201cAmazon chooses to hide behind its delivery partners and a mandated veil of secrecy to protect itself from a disastrous record and true accountability,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cAmazon\u2019s time would be better spent working to provide specific answers to the questions we asked and addressing the troubling issues we raised.\u201d", "description": "In September, Sen.
