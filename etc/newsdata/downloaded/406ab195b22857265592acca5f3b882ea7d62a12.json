In July 2017, Finance Minister Bill Morneau issued a package of proposals regarding the taxation of private corporations. The package outraged business owners and professionals across the country and left the government reeling and seeking damage control. Many of the proposals were abandoned, while others were substantially revised.\n\nThe most radical measure was a proposed overhaul of the taxation of passive investment income earned by private corporations. As I wrote in the Financial Post at the time, this proposal extended well beyond any legitimate policy concerns and was confiscatory: a business owner in the top personal rate bracket would have faced a combined personal-corporate tax rate of 73 per cent on investment income earned by a private corporation.\n\nUnder fierce opposition, the government finally abandoned its proposal. Instead, it introduced a new measure to limit a private corporation\u2019s access to the preferential tax rate on business income if the corporation\u2019s passive investment income exceeded prescribed limits.\n\nA private corporation enjoys a preferential federal-provincial tax rate of about 12 per cent on the first $500,000 of qualifying annual business income (the general federal-provincial tax rate on business income is about 27 per cent). Under the new rule, the preferential rate begins to be phased out once a corporation\u2019s annual investment income exceeds $50,000 \u2014 equivalent to a return of five per cent on a passive investment portfolio of $1 million.\n\nThis type of limitation is sensible from a tax policy perspective. The purpose of the preferential rate is to assist small businesses in accumulating capital for business expansion. A private corporation with a large investment portfolio is unlikely to require this assistance. Even without the special rate a corporation with significant passive investments still benefits from a tax rate of 27 per cent on business income rather than the owner\u2019s personal marginal tax rate, which will often exceed 50 per cent.\n\nAt the time this measure was announced, along with a related rule that applies to the payment of dividends, the government stated that less than three per cent of private corporations would be impacted while more than 90 per cent of the tax revenue from the measure would come from private corporations whose owners were in the top personal bracket.\n\nScheer proposes to repeal these rules, at an annual federal tax cost of about $600 million. But there is limited tax policy rationale supporting his proposal. Little if any of the tax savings resulting from a repeal would accrue to the benefit of typical small businesses. Plumbers, welders and florists do not own private corporations with millions of dollars of passive investments: wealthy Canadians do.\n\nThe Liberals\u2019 original 2017 proposals seriously overreached and Scheer\u2019s outrage would be appropriate if the Liberals had not backed down. But they did and his proposal to go back to the pre-2017 rules is misplaced.\n\nThere were other proposals, both tax and non-tax, in the Conservative leader\u2019s announcement. For example, an expert panel would be appointed to undertake a thorough review of taxation in Canada, with a view to simplification, fairness and international competitiveness. This type of exercise is long overdue. The last comprehensive review of Canadian tax rules dates back to the 1960s (the Carter Commission). Scheer also proposes that federal regulations be reduced by 25 per cent over the next four years, and that a 2-for-1 rule be introduced: before imposing a new regulation, the federal government would have to scrap two existing regulations. This proposal really would assist small business: the smaller the business, the harder it is to comply with Canada\u2019s sclerotic regulatory regime.\n\nAndrew Scheer exaggerates when he says that Justin Trudeau labelled Canada\u2019s small business owners as \u201ctax cheats,\u201d and is lacking in candour when he suggests that the passive income measure is targeted at small businesses. For his part, in 2017 Trudeau did accuse rich Canadians of avoiding tax at the expense of the middle class\u00ad and he has continued his attack on wealthy Canadians in the Liberal platform released on Sunday. The rhetoric from both major parties is divisive but shows no signs of abating.\n\nAllan Lanthier is a retired senior partner of a major international accounting firm and a former co-chair of the Joint Taxation Committee of the Canadian Bar Association and CPA Canada.", "description": "Opinion: Little of the tax savings resulting from a repeal would accrue to the benefit of typical small businesses \u2014 but it's a different story for the wealthy", "authors": ["Allan Lanthier", "Special To Financial Post"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/scheer-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
