Otherwise, their parents must home-school them or move out of the state.\n\nThe measles outbreak that prompted the new law is actually easing. On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared an end to the measles outbreak in New York City, its epicentre.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

California, where nonmedical exemptions were ended in 2015, gave parents with nonmedical exemptions extra time to comply and allowed districts to exempt disabled children.\n\nThe New York law allows no such exceptions.\n\nThe anti-vaccination community in New York has filed several lawsuits seeking to block the legislation, but none have succeeded so far.\n\nThe law is already encouraging parents on the fence about vaccination to immunise their children and is sending a message to public and private schools that the days of selective vaccination are over. But for parents who remain deeply sceptical, more steps will be needed, say doctors who study vaccine refusal.\n\nDr Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, pointed out that unease about vaccines is not just a fringe issue.\n\nA 2011 study, for example, found that roughly a quarter of all American parents had serious concerns about vaccines, and 30 per cent worried that vaccines may cause learning disabilities, such as autism.\n\nEliminating nonmedical exemptions is a partial solution, Dr Salmon said, adding that more research funding was needed to study the safety of vaccines and to counteract the anti-vaccine lobby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big hammer that isn\u2019t getting at the big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cParents have concerns that aren\u2019t being addressed.\u201d\n\nIn the state\u2019s Mennonite and Amish communities, where some schools had high religious exemption rates, health officials reported progress after meetings about the vaccination requirements.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But she also said that because her efforts had been focused only on preventing measles, there was much more education to do about vaccines to protect against other diseases.\n\nSome parents who do not want to vaccinate their children are turning to home schooling. Under state law, home-schooled children may meet in cooperative learning groups for up to three hours a day.\n\nKristina Staykova said she was shutting down her fashion business as she tries to figure out how to home-school her children, including a 4-year-old with autism. Her 5-year-old daughter has already been told not to return to Public School 6 on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.\n\nShe recently went to a home-schooling conference in Melville, New York, where there were about 300 parents, most of whom, like her, believed that their children had been injured by vaccines, she said.\n\nPart of the challenge facing health officials across the country, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, is that steps should have been taken years ago to reduce nonmedical exemptions before they became more common and opposition spread.\n\nStill, only a tiny fraction of New York children had religious exemptions: about 0.8 per cent of all schoolchildren statewide in 2017-18, the last school year for which data was available.\n\nFor Ms Vance-Pauls, Tuesday was the end of the line. With school starting on Wednesday, she made an appointment with a doctor on Tuesday for each of her children to get one shot apiece and appointments over the coming weeks for the rest of the required shots.\n\nHer family did not have the option to home-school or move, so she felt she had no other choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m praying to God that my twins are now 9 and can handle what Jack couldn\u2019t handle when he was a baby,\u201d Ms Vance-Pauls said, referring to her autistic son. \u201cI feel like there is nowhere for us to run.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Jacquelynn Vance-Pauls, a real estate lawyer in upstate New York, has a 14-year-old son with autism who was recently kicked out of his private special needs school.
