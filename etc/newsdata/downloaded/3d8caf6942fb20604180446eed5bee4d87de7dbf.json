I do not want to put my family and I at risk and enter an environment that is clearly not fit.\n\n'The holiday is based on an all-inclusive package but we do not want to eat drink swim or use any of the facilities as we consider it to be a severe health risk.'\n\nAfter seeing all of the claims against the hotel, Barbara contacted Tui to express her concerns and say that she wanted to change to stay in alternative accommodation.\n\nHowever, the advisor she spoke to said this would incur a 70 per cent price hike and also said that Tui was not aware of any illness outbreak.\n\nBarbara advised them that her husband had been in hospital in January of this year and she did not want him exposed to an unhealthy environment.\n\nTui said they would get back to her with more information within a week but Barbara didn't hear any more until This is Money contacted the holiday firm.\n\nA TUI UK spokesperson: 'We are sorry to hear about the concerns Mrs Marriott has ahead of her family holiday to Lanzarote.\n\n'All of our hotels are regularly audited in relation to health and safety, including hygiene, and the hotel have increased their hygiene protocols on top of their already stringent measures. We will be contacting the customer directly to discuss their holiday in greater detail and to resolve any issues.'\n\nSince This is Money contacted Tui, Barbara was able to rearrange her stay to another hotel in Lanzarote at no extra cost.\n\nBut they had to fly from Newcastle instead of Manchester, with much later flight times that have necessitated overnight accommodation on their return.\n\nBarbara added: 'It would have been nice if they had come to a compromise and let us keep the original flight and just change hotel.'\n\nThe Marriott family are not the only ones to have experienced such issues. Recent reviews on TripAdvisor seem to corroborate their fears.\n\nOne review said signs were put up reporting there were cases of gastroenteritis at the resort\n\nIll: Another reviewer said that a sickness bug 'was spreading like wild fire' around the hotel\n\nUnhappy: This guest complained of 'terrible hygiene standards' at the hotel after getting sick\n\nThis is Money has also reported on a couple who flew on an all inclusive break with Tui to get married but returned not sure if they were even legally wed.\n\nJatinder Paul, Senior Associate Solicitor in Irwin Mitchell's International Serious Injury Team, said: 'Where customers become aware of repeated illness at a hotel before they get there, they should contact their tour operator as soon as possible to flag this and ask to be moved to a different hotel, resort or destination, if possible.\n\n'Depending on tour operator, this is sometimes enough. On occasion, a tour operator may refuse and ask you to pay for cancellation or amended booking. If this happens, you should contact ABTA as soon as possible who will intervene (sometimes they will commence a mediation to resolve an issue).\n\n'Consumers should also try to book their holiday using a credit card because if you are unsuccessful in liaising with the tour operator in getting your holiday moved, you could potentially cancel and claim the cost of this back from your credit card company but you should speak to your credit card company first.\n\n'It is established law that a tour operator has a duty of care to a package holiday consumer to send them to a hotel/holiday which is fit for purpose and will not make them ill.\n\n'For those who do fall ill, ultimately our advice is that they should contact a specialist lawyer with knowledge of these types of claims such as Irwin Mitchell, as this is a highly specialised area of law.'", "description": "Barbara Marriott, 56, was due to fly to the Playa Flamingo Beach Resort in Lanzarote at the end of August with her husband and daughter.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
