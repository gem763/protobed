Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had five minutes to question Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg today and she did her best to create a gotcha moment but ultimately just came off like a snotty socialist looking to silence other people\u2019s speech. We\u2019ll get back to AOC in a moment but first some backstory. Earlier this month, Zuckerberg gave a speech at Georgetown University in which he said he had considered banning political ads from Facebook but decided to err on the side of free speech:\n\n\u201cFrom a business perspective the controversy is not worth the very small part of the business that they make up.\u201d Zuckerberg said that there are issues with political ads no matter how Facebook handles the matter. \u201cI believe that when its not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression,\u201d Zuckerberg said. One problem with banning political ads is that it is not clear where Facebook would have to draw the line, Zuckerberg said. \u201cThere are many more ads about issues than there ads about elections. Do we ban ads about healthcare, immigration or women\u2019s empowerment?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to ban those, does it really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except for the candidates themselves?\u201d\n\nThat all sounds pretty nuanced and rational but even before Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, he was being accused of making a backroom deal with President Trump to allow disingenuous ads to remain on the site. Elizabeth Warren got that ball just over two weeks ago. Here\u2019s how Vox described her unsupported allegations:\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren accused Facebook on Monday of emboldening Donald Trump, even suggesting that the social media company\u2019s leadership struck some deal with Trump behind closed doors that explains why he is allowed to promote misleading ads on its platform. The ascendant Democratic candidate laid out her argument in a series of tweets on Monday without supplying any concrete evidence for her claim that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had bent to Trump\u2019s wishes after the pair met in Washington two weeks ago. Warren\u2019s implication came as Zuckerberg and Warren are increasingly sniping at one another, both in public and in leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting earlier this summer, during which Zuckerberg referred to a potential Warren presidency as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to his company.\n\nSo to sum up, Zuckerberg warned that, as president, Elizabeth Warren would be a threat to the existence of Facebook (which is true). Warren responded about a week later by suggesting Zuckerberg had made a backroom deal with Trump (which isn\u2019t true). Zuckerberg clarified that the ad policy, which hasn\u2019t changed, is to allow for maximum free expression. Rather than having Facebook make judgments about individual ads or simply removing all political ads, others are free to judge the truth of those ads.\n\nNow we get back to AOC who wants to mine this well-worn territory for all it\u2019s worth.\n\n\u201cYou announced recently that the official policy of Facebook now allows politicians to pay to spread disinformation in 2020 elections and in the future,\u201d AOC claimed. She continued, \u201cSo I just want to know how far I can push this in the next year. Under your policy, using census data as well, could I pay to target predominantly black zip codes and advertise them the incorrect election date?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, congresswoman, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Zuckerberg replied. He explained that threats of imminent violence or attempts at voter suppression would be removed from the site. AOC then came up with another hypothetical. Here\u2019s the transcript from Vox:\n\nOcasio-Cortez: Would I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal? I mean, if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game. Zuckerberg: Congresswoman, I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head, I think probably. Ocasio-Cortez: You don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do that. Zuckerberg: I think probably. Ocasio-Cortez: Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements? Zuckerberg: Well, Congresswoman, I think lying is bad, and I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie in it, that would be bad. That\u2019s different from it being \u2026 in our position, the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied.\n\nShe\u2019s doing her best to make this sound outrageous and complex but it really isn\u2019t very difficult to understand. \u201cIn most cases in a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nSo for instance, if some congresswoman wants to compare American border detention facilities to Nazi concentration camps on social media, she can do that. The result will be a lot of people who are experts telling her she shouldn\u2019t make that comparison. But the point is, Facebook (or Twitter) is not going to remove her speech even if it\u2019s incendiary and misleading.\n\nSpeaking of false claims, near the end of this clip AOC asks this leading question: \u201cIn your ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures, some of who advance the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a joke, did you discuss so-called media bias against conservatives?\u201d According to Townhall\u2019s Guy Benson who was at one of those dinners, no such discussion took place.\n\nCan confirm: White supremacy was not joked about, made light of, espoused, or even mentioned at the \u201cfar right\u201d / Zuckerberg dinner party I attended. What a performance she put on. https://t.co/zqKqh7YqtE \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 23, 2019\n\nShould Twitter remove all copies of this video of AOC on the grounds that it contains false statements? I would say no, but I wonder if AOC sees how this policy she\u2019s suggesting could quickly be turned against her?", "description": "\"I believe that people should be able to see for themselves...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AOC-Zuckerberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
