I mean, a lot of people didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, so you cannot blame them.\u201d\n\nRoger Federer strolls past David Goffin to reach US Open last eight Read more\n\nThe 16-time major champion, who has made no secret of his goal to overtake Roger Federer (20) and Rafael Nadal (18) atop the all-time leaderboard, had appeared to turn a corner after an uncharacteristically listless opening set when he broke Wawrinka\u2019s serve to open the second. But the dialled-in Swiss, who won 84% of his first-serve points on the night and was not broken again before or after, ruthlessly forced the issue against his under-strength opponent, forcing Djokovic into one unforced error after another by drawing out the same brand of punishing baseline exchanges the world No 1 typically dines on.\n\nWawrinka broke back in the seventh game of the second and broke again in the 11th, both on misfires by the top-ranked Serbian, then held in the 12th to stake a commanding two-sets-to-none lead. By then Djokovic looked finished.\n\n\u201cFor sure I could see some little things that he was in trouble,\u201d said the 34-year-old Wawrinka, a three-time grand slam champion who missed large chunks of two seasons and dropped to No 263 in the world rankings after undergoing a pair of surgeries on his left knee in August 2017. \u201cBut I was most likely, most of the time, focused on myself because I know how well he can fight. I know how well he can come back. Doesn\u2019t matter how he\u2019s feeling on the court, and that\u2019s what I was focusing on.\u201d\n\nA shirtless Djokovic sat in his chair before the third set as a trainer fastidiously massaged his shoulder, the crowd buzzing in anticipation of a fightback from a champion who is customarily at his best when flailing out of an emergency. But after making his fifth double fault of the night after three straight forehand errors in the third game to go love-40 down, the three-time US Open winner approached the net for the shocking denouement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never the way you want to finish a match,\u201d Wawrinka said. \u201cI am really sorry for Novak, he\u2019s an amazing friend.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Djokovic, who had not lost before the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows since he was a teenager, entered Sunday\u2019s blockbuster nightcap with a 19-5 lead in the head-to-head series between the pair, but Wawrinka had taken three of the most recent seven including their last meeting in the 2016 US Open final.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThe first traces of the Serbian\u2019s wounded shoulder had come during Wednesday\u2019s tricky second-round win over Argentina\u2019s Juan Ignacio Londero, but the issue appeared to have passed by Friday when he breezed past Denis Kudla in three elementary sets.\n\n\u201cThe pain was constant for weeks now,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cSome days higher, some days with less intensity and obviously taking different stuff to kill the pain instantly. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is frustrating. Very frustrating. Obviously not the first, not the last player to get injured and to withdraw from one of the biggest events in sport. But obviously I just came off the court, so of course it hurts.\u201d\n\nWawrinka advanced to a Tuesday quarter-final with fifth-seeded Daniil Medvedev, who came from behind to see off German qualifier Dominik Koepfer earlier Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing amazing tennis, making final after final, winning Cincinnati, winning here a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting match to play against him. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d", "description": "The Serbian\u2019s title defence came to a halt when he retired from his fourth-round match against Stan Wawrinka due to a shoulder injury", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8944f1961592ada36482d574fcebef8e465c2574/0_41_4561_2737/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9b2d794be81ef0714bc4e63d56d9663"}
