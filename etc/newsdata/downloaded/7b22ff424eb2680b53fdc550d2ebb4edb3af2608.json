Even though they were chasing us, the students kept coming and fighting with police.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a shootout and we fought back with rocks and arrows. The police shot at the Papuans. There were about 16 to 20 people who died directly on the street that I saw.\u201d\n\nPapua police spokesperson Ahmad Mustofa Kamal told the Guardian this account was not true. Indonesia\u2019s chief of police said earlier in the week that just four indigenous Papuans had been killed in the Wamena unrest.\n\nYet one witness account from inside the Wamena general hospital suggests there were more, and that many of the dead were children.\n\nThe witness, Thomas*, said he saw several victims being brought to the hospital on Monday, including two migrant women hit by rocks, and a young Papuan student who had been shot in the back. The bullet had ripped through the side of his stomach.\n\n\u201cHe was yelling \u2018I feel like I\u2019m dying\u2019,\u201d Thomas told the Guardian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Indonesian riot police at a university in Jayapura on Monday.

Some Papuans have also retrieved victims and bodies directly from the street. Because of this, the real death toll is unknown, but could be as high as 41.\n\nThe Guardian has been provided with a list of 65 names of Papuans said to be at Wamena hospital suffering gunshot wounds and \u201cinjuries from sharp weapons\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe military and police presence at the entrance of the hospital makes it difficult for families to access their relatives,\u201d a source in Wamena, who did not want to be identified, said. \u201cFamilies have tried to force their way in to take those injured back home, so they can treat them at home, but this has not been allowed.\u201d\n\nAs word slowly filters out from Wamena, witnesses have also contested the official version of how the riot started.\n\nStudents have claimed the protest was sparked by a racist comment by a teacher at the local high school.\n\nIndonesian police claim this is \u201cfake news\u201d and that pro-independence figures dressed up in school uniforms to provoke trouble. But interviews with a teacher from the high school where the incident allegedly occurred, and with students involved, suggest students joined of their own volition.\n\nIt was on Saturday 22 September that a migrant teacher allegedly called a Papuan high school student a \u201cmonkey\u201d \u2013 the same racist insult that last month sparked mass riots across Indonesia after a similar incident occurred in the Javanese city of Surabaya.\n\nBy Sunday, the claims had been widely shared by students on their phones as they planned Monday\u2019s demonstration, ultimately motivating some 5,000 students to the streets.\n\nOne teacher from the school, Michael Alua, said the teachers had attempted to make peace, but neither side would concede, with the teacher denying that word was ever said, and the students insisting it was.\n\n\u201cThe settlers [migrants] are guarding their houses with machetes and the Papuans are traumatised. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning the students were so incensed they demanded the teacher be reported to the police.\n\n\u201cThey call us monkeys, but we are not monkeys,\u201d said Lukas, when asked why he got involved.\n\nIn the days since the deadly violence, there has been a strong army presence on the streets of Wamena, and shops, schools and gas stations have been closed. Meanwhile, thousands of migrants have fled, some boarding military flights to Jayapura, while indigenous Papuans have returned to villages on the outskirts of town.\n\nAfter the riot, thousands sought refuge in churches and in police and military buildings, as parts of the town were torched and covered in towering plumes of smoke. The regent\u2019s office was burned to the ground. Houses, shops, cars and the market were also set on fire.\n\nAustralia refuses to rule out handing over Sydney lawyer who advocates for West Papuans to Indonesia Read more\n\nAt least four sources told the Guardian that \u201cmigrants\u201d (non-indigenous Papuans), who dominate economic life in Wamena, are now walking the streets carrying machetes and iron sticks.\n\nOne source told the Guardian that \u201cpeople in Wamena are afraid to go out\u201d. The source said the shutdown of the internet and other modes of communication had exacerbated people\u2019s fears of further violence and fuelled \u201cugly rumours\u201d circulating the city.\n\n\u201cThe settlers [migrants] are guarding their houses with machetes in their hands, and the Papuans are traumatised, and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of migrants are fleeing the city, they want to be evacuated and they are being facilitated by the government, but Papuans are also terrified. They are thinking, \u2018if the government is so quick to help settlers leave, what is being planned after that?\u2019 There is currently that uncertainty.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Evacuees at a military base in Wamena, Papua, wait to board a military aircraft and escape the city\u2019s unrest.
