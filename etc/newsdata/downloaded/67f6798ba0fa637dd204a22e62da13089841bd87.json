She just entertained the hell out of me, texting me.\n\nAny of the rumours true, Chrissy?

I didn\u2019t know that I wanted someone funny until I was actually with someone funny.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do you not know if you want the hilarity that is Chrissy in your life?\n\nJohn and Chrissy met on set of the singer\u2019s 2007 music video for his single Stereo where she was cast as a bikini model.\n\nThis must have been the point the TV personality started thinking John was a modelizer.\n\nThey began seeing each other whenever John was in town (Miami) to perform.\n\nAt that point, Chrissy was a model struggling to find jobs.\n\n\u2018I had no credit cards, I didn\u2019t have a bank account, and it just didn\u2019t occur to me to ask my dad for money,\u2019 the mum-of-two said. \u2018I knew exactly how it was with tax to get a McDouble and fries.\u2019\n\nBut did you know how much a Chicken Legend was, Chrissy? Sorry, not sorry.\n\nThe couple got married in 2013 and have also welcomed the adorable Luna Simone, 3, and son Miles Theodore, 17 months, into their lives.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
