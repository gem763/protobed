He died instantly from neck and chest injuries.\n\nThe teenager was handed the sentence after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Rice on Thursday.\n\nThe YoBike hire bike was put in Mr Rice's path, causing him to crash (Picture: PA) More\n\nThe court heard that the motorbike Mr Rice had been riding on April 5 had been stolen a day earlier.\n\nAdam Vaitilingam QC said Mr Rice had drawn attention to himself by riding around the Hartcliffe area of Bristol in a \u201cprovocative way\u201d, with some members of a crowd of young people outside a pub suggesting that someone should block the road to stop him \u2013 with one going forward on a bicycle to face him.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nUK motorcycle theft hotspots mapped out and it's pretty bad\n\nWatch: Motorbike passenger wearing a swimsuit suffers nasty burns after skidding off bike\n\nThe teenager, then 15, grabbed hold of the YoBike and dragged it into the road into Mr Rice\u2019s path, who was pulling a wheelie at the time.\n\nKeeping reporting restrictions in place banning the identification of the teen, Judge Peter Blair QC, the Recorder of Bristol, said: \u201cYour decision to drag a bicycle, on its side, off the pavement so as to cause an obstruction, was an unlawful and dangerous thing to do.\n\nThe teen put the YoBike into Mr Rice's path as he was accelerating and pulling a wheelie (Picture: PA) More\n\nHe went on: \u201cIn my view, when you took the decision to do that dangerous thing, you were doing it so as to impress the older teenagers around you.\n\n\u201cHowever, any reasonable person would have inevitably realised that doing so risked causing the motorcyclist some bodily harm. It was a reckless act.\u201d\n\nThe judge said it would have been possible for Mr Rice to have stopped to avoid the bike but he was accelerating and pulling a \u201cwheelie\u201d at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was not the impact of the motorcycle with the bicycle which led to the fatality,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cInstead it was his panicked reaction to what was in front of him in the road which led to him applying the front brake lever while the front wheel was still in the air.\n\n\u201cTragically, that led to him going over the handlebars of the motorcycle when it touched down and he was killed in an instant when he collided with a parked van.\u201d\n\nAndrew Langdon QC, representing the boy, said he was \u201chorrified by the unintended consequences of his act\u201d.\n\nSpeaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector James Riccio, of Avon and Somerset Police, paid tribute to the \u201ccourage and dignity\u201d shown by Mr Rice\u2019s family through the case.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that to Michael\u2019s family and the wider community this sentence may seem lenient,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now looking to consider making a formal appeal to have the sentence reviewed.\u201d", "description": "The teen, who cannot be named, put the hire bike in the path of motorcyclist Michael Rice in Bristol, causing him to crash.", "authors": ["Ellen Manning"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MqAr7JE2kvlHEaSfkRDNIg--~B/aD03NjY7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8c4c5700-ecc0-11e9-a7bf-0f3073086360", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
