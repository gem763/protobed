To plug his leaky administration and campaign, Trump has gone to great lengths, purging pollsters, letting his staffers know he considers people who talk to the press \u201ctraitors and cowards,\u201d and requiring million-dollar donors to put their phones in a lockbox before meeting with him.\n\nBut one effort from the spring of 2018 appears to have backfired with enough kick to threaten his presidency. According to reports from Politico and the Wall Street Journal, the administration altered the protocol for a secret national security server, dumping potentially embarrassing conversations with other world leaders in a depository meant for highly classified information. The changes were made after the leaks of conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico, in which Trump told Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that an Obama-administration refugee agreement was \u201cdisgusting and \u201chorrible, and told then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto he was considering sending troops to Mexico to take care of \u201ctough hombres\u201d involved in drug trafficking. Per Politico:\n\nThe changes included a new log of who accessed specific documents in the [National Security Council\u2019s] system \u2014known as NICE or \u201cNSC Intelligence Collaboration Environment\u201d\u2014and was designed in part to prevent leaks of records of the president\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders and to find out the suspected leaker if transcripts did get disclosed, one of the former officials said. Prior to the upgrade, officials could only see who had uploaded or downloaded material to the system but usually not who accessed which documents.\n\n\u2026 If hiding politically embarrassing material, rather than protecting national security secrets, was the motivation, experts and former officials said, it would be an abuse of the codeword system. While not necessarily an illegal act, it does run counter to an executive order signed by President Obama in 2009 that says information can\u2019t be classified to \u201cconceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error\u201d or \u201cprevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency,\u201d they said.\n\nThe administration\u2019s changes to the system risk \u201cundermining a whole host of important national security activities,\u201d April Doss, a former attorney at the National Security Agency, told Politico. The majority of officials who require access can longer see Trump\u2019s transcripts under the new protocol \u2014 all to limit the release of information that could humiliate the president.\n\nGranted, some of the phone calls that have reportedly been dumped into NICE are pretty embarrassing. CNN and the New York Times have reported that transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman are in there, and according to one former NSC official who spoke with Politico, the call to the Russian president was \u201cpretty much what you would expect \u2014 you can take the first part of the Zelensky call with all of the over the top effusive praise and basically copy and paste onto pretty much any head of state call with Trump, whether it was Emmanuel Macron or Vladimir Putin.\u201d The official added: \u201cThey were certainly the type of thing that you would not want in public because they were just really embarrassing from the standpoint of just national pride.\u201d\n\nThough it may be too late, there is one anti-leak solution the president hasn\u2019t tried: running a tight ship. If the record-breaking level of turnover within the administration subsided, there would be less disgruntled ex-staffers willing to let information loose.", "description": "The administration\u2019s decision to bury Trump\u2019s embarrassing calls to Vladimir Putin, Zeleznky, and MbS in a top-secret server have put the president in hot water, helping to lead to his impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/30/trump_leaks.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
