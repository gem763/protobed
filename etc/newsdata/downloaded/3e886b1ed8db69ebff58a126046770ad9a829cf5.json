(Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\nPresident encouraged poor police behavior, lack of oversight\n\nI have been a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police for half a century. I led police in two cities for more than over 25 years. In retirement, I have continued to study, lecture and write about the needs of police in a free society.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s address to my colleagues in Chicago at their annual meeting Monday is forcing me to speak out.\n\nWhat would I expect from a presidential address? What is it that an emerging police leader needs to hear? Leaders help others grow and achieve their goals, they generously listen and build coalitions of support. Trump exhibited none of those qualities during his speech, and his words didn't encourage the police leaders in the room to exhibit them either.\n\nAs president, he should have reinforced the values that made, and continue to make, our nation great: those in our Bill of Rights, our long tradition of fairness and restraint, and a commitment that government is to serve those most vulnerable among us.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nI wanted to hear support for the practices that are known to improve police when they falter. When a local or state police agency has a pattern of civil rights violations, the federal government has a responsibility to step in. Trump made it clear that federal oversight will no longer be exercised, incorrectly stating that intervention hinders police. That lack of oversight will give bad police leeway and put many American citizens at risk.\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses the International Association of Chiefs of Police convention on Oct. 28, 2019 in Chicago. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe most effective strategy by far in cleaning up a lawless police agency has been oversight by a federal judge.\n\nPerhaps the president did not understand that most of the men and women he was addressing were our nation\u2019s top police leaders. Others were police leaders from foreign countries.\n\nThe president also told a story about a Chicago police officer he met when he was on the campaign trail. He called the officer \u201ca powerful, strong-looking guy.\u201d Trump said he asked the officer what it would take to clean up this city. The officer said that he and a few of his buddies could clean up Chicago in a day. Really? How would they do that, exactly? But more important, what is he implying by telling this story? He's undermining Chicago's police chief, something he did directly and indirectly throughout his speech after the chief refused to attend the event.\n\nTrump's Chicago story encourages cops to eliminate the rules controlling their behavior. Trump implied that urban crime control was easy if only the chief would undo the restrains so officers could have more freely crack down on the streets. I wonder what poor people, homeless people suffering addictions, and people of color who live in neighborhoods frequently targeted by police would think of this story from the president?\n\nIf comments like that were made in a department that I had headed, I would have asked whoever made them to leave. Trump's words were irresponsible, his instructions make the job of leading police more difficult and the attitude he encouraged puts citizens at risk.\n\nCOLUMN: At detention facilities, legal rights 'in name only'\n\nWhen I became a leader, I realized the job of policing a free society was extremely difficult, complex and demanded my best thinking and behavior. I once had a mayor\u2019s aide tell me to push out a number of newly arrived Cuban immigrants. I refused.\n\nI can tell you that \u201cgetting tough\u201d on the street as Trump implied has never solved any of our difficult urban police problems. What works is collaboration, fairness, responsibility and democratic values.\n\nI expected my president to reinforce what our nation\u2019s leaders were doing, not undermine them.\n\nAs an experienced police leader, I have to say that Trump didn\u2019t help our nation\u2019s police leaders improve. What he said brought the profession of policing down. A leader's job is to raise others up. Policing isn\u2019t just about enforcing the law, it is also about modeling our nation\u2019s values.\n\nTrump announced that he would create a presidential commission on law enforcement. I hope it involves diverse voices.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t help our nation\u2019s police leaders. Instead, he chose to pander.\n\nWe deserve better.\n\nDavid Couper; Blue Mounds, Wis.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/community-calls/2019/10/29/trump-address-cops-irresponsible-dangerous-reader-view/2501786001/", "description": "President encouraged poor police behavior, lack of oversight", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published P.M.
