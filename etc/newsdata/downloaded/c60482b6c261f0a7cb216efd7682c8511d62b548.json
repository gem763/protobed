But while \u201clodging at higher-end accommodations\u201d might be within government rates and \u201callowable,\u201d it might not be \u201cadvisable,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cEven when USAF aircrews follow all directives and guidance, we must still be considerate of perceptions of not being good stewards of taxpayer funds that might be created through the appearance of aircrew staying at such locations,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe lodging \u2014 and millions of dollars in refueling stops at Glasgow Prestwick Airport just 23 miles from the Trump resort \u2014 triggered an investigation by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year to determine if taxpayer funds were being used to aid both the airport and Trump\u2019s resort.\n\nCrew members stayed at Turnberry during at least two refueling trips between the U.S. and the Mideast, Politico reported. A representative of the Trump Organization told The New York Times that military personnel stayed a few times.\n\nTotal payments for refueling by the Department of Defense to the commercial airport owned by the Scottish government could total as much $21 million by the time the contract ends, The Scotsman reported. The Pentagon provides Prestwick\u2019s biggest revenue stream, though the fuel could have been obtained at an American \u2014 or allied \u2014 military base. Both Prestwick and Trump\u2019s Turnberry have struggled financially.\n\nThe Department of Defense has so far ignored requests by the House committee for documents concerning the stays \u2014 and the Prestwick contract, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cThe airport closest to the Trump Turnberry golf course ... has been viewed as integral to the golf course\u2019s financial success, yet it too has lost millions of dollars every year since its purchase by the Scottish government in 2013,\u201d committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a letter in June to the acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. \u201cGiven the president\u2019s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions.\u201d\n\nThe Scotsman newspaper has reported that the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency has already negotiated another contract beginning in October with Prestwick extending to 2024 for 12.4 million gallons of fuel, 3 million more than the current contract, which is about to expire.\n\nPrestwick held discussions in 2017 about \u201cpotential partnership opportunities\u201d with Trump Turnberry, according to documents obtained by The Scotsman\u2019s Sunday newspaper. Prestwick is currently up for sale.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee also now plans to investigate Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s stay at Trump\u2019s Irish golf resort during an official visit to Ireland last week, even though the resort was 180 miles away \u2014 on the other side of the island nation \u2014 from planned meetings in Dublin.", "description": "\"We must ... be considerate of perceptions of not being good stewards of taxpayer funds,\" said an Air Force statement.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d75c5c4230000c703512823.jpeg?cache=dpanh8to3t&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
