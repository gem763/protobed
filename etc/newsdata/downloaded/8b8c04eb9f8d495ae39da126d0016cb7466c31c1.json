They insisted the soaking at Kowloon Mosque was an accident, according to the community representatives.\n\nNot everyone was convinced.\n\nKowloon mosque sprayed with blue dye from police water cannons during march in Tsim Sha Tsui\n\n\u201cI really believe it wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d an 18-year-old student called Saqib from Delia Memorial School (Hip Wo) told Young Post. \u201cI have seen some of the footage, and there weren\u2019t many protesters near the mosque. Even if there were people,\u201d he said, the police shouldn\u2019t use water cannon without first seeing if there\u2019s a need.\n\nThe water cannon\u2019s blue dye is intended to make it easier to catch frontline protesters after a crowd disperses. Officers did not immediately offer an apology in a statement issued later that evening on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI accept the apology, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should forget about the matter,\u201d said Saqib. \u201cI think it\u2019s not part of the police\u2019s job to spray water everywhere,\u201d as the cannon might potentially injure innocent people.\n\nJimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front in stable condition after Mong Kok attack\n\nFor several days before the weekend, ethnic \u00adminority groups in Hong Kong were on edge, as fears grew of possible reprisals after protest leader Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit was attacked for a second time by men said to be of South Asian \u00addescent.\n\nSaqib said he hadn\u2019t been treated differently since the attack on the convenor of Civil Human Rights Front, and that he was proud of Hong Kong people for being understanding.\n\nAlysha Bibi, an 18-year-old student at Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Siu Ming Catholic Secondary School, said that although the mosque incident was disappointing, she didn\u2019t hold a grudge.\n\nSecondary students rally at HKU to condemn anti-mask law and alleged police abuse of power\n\n\u201cThey did apologise and I think that is what matters,\u201d Alysha told Young Post. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes and if they are willing to take up their responsibilities and apologise for their behaviour, that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nShe added that she was happy to see volunteers from her community handing out water bottles and talking to protesters outside Chungking Mansions on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIn these difficult times, people from different walks of life are making a concerted effort to help society,\u201d Alysha said.", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader and police force apologised to the local Islamic community for spraying the entrance to the city\u2019s biggest mosque with blue solution from a water cannon on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/90a4affc-f3d5-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires193509.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
