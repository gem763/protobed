REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\n\nBut new developments have raised the possibility of fresh challenges for U.S. companies in Russia.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday announced it would impose fresh sanctions on Russia after Washington determined Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain. Russia on Thursday condemned the new round of sanctions as illegal and said it had begun working on retaliatory measures.\n\nA senior U.S. State Department official said on Thursday the sanctions on Russia will target exports of national security-related goods including sectors such as specialized oil and gas technology and some electronics and sensors.\n\nIn April, the United States imposed sanctions on 24 Russian oligarchs and government officials and 12 Russian companies.\n\nRussia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products.\n\nPublicly listed U.S. companies generated more than $90 billion in revenue from Russia in 2017, according to the Thomson Reuters Country of Risk model, which estimates companies\u2019 financial exposure to different countries. Among the industries with the greatest exposure to Russia are food and beverages, technology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nHere are some of the U.S. companies that maintain significant operations in Russia.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nCisco Systems Inc\u2019s (CSCO.O) product revenue in Russia grew 20 percent in 2017, ahead of Cisco\u2019s technology product revenue growth in the other so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, China and India.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) had double-digit revenue growth in Russia, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said on an earnings conference call in May.\n\nDuring Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) earnings call last October, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood noted that market conditions had improved in \u201ckey markets like Brazil and Russia.\u201d\n\nBut following U.S. sanctions, two of Microsoft\u2019s official distributors in Russia curbed sales of Microsoft software to more than 200 Russian companies, Reuters reported in January.\n\nCONSUMER BRANDS\n\nIn Mondelez International Inc\u2019s (MDLZ.O) quarterly earnings call in January, Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said the company had become the leading chocolate maker in Russia.\n\nPepsiCo reported that in 2017, its Russian operations generated net revenue of $3.23 billion, which made up 5.1 percent of the company\u2019s total net revenue.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s categorizes Russia as a high-growth market and has opened new locations there in the past two years, according to its annual financial report.\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM.N) has been among foreign companies with exposure to Russia\u2019s tobacco market. The company\u2019s sales exposure to Russia is 7 percent, according to a note from Goldman Sachs.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has identified Russia as a strong market for regional consumer brands, and the company is seeking to extend its reach there through products such as contact lenses, executives have said.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is among the top five companies for branded generic drugs in Russia, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Yoor, said in January.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, weaker sales growth in Russia led to lower sales in Abbott\u2019s established pharmaceuticals business than analysts expected.\n\nAEROSPACE, INDUSTRIALS\n\nBoeing Co (BA.N) named Russia as one of its largest growth markets at an industry conference in March. But in its annual report, the company noted pricing pressures from government-funded competitors in Russia, China and Japan and said it would defend itself from the \u201cunfair subsidization of competitors.\u201d\n\nRussia may stop supplying titanium to Boeing as part of its response to U.S. sanctions, a parliament member said, according to a report by RIA news agency.\n\nAlso in the industrials space, industrial manufacturing and engineering company Colfax Corp (CFX.N) has an 8 percent sales exposure to Russia, according to the Goldman Sachs note.\n\nAUTOMAKERS\n\nFord Motor Co (F.N) doubled down on Russia even as its big U.S. rival, General Motors Co (GM.N), pulled out in 2015. The automaker\u2019s sales from its joint venture with Russia-based Sollers PAO (SVAV.MM) grew in 2017.\n\nFord now has a 3.1 percent market share in Russia, according to the company\u2019s annual financial report. In October, the company said its Russian results \u201ccontinued to improve, approaching breakeven.\u201d", "description": "Although the United States and Russia have imposed economic sanctions on each other since 2014, several large U.S. corporations, including PepsiCo Inc and McDonald's Corp , still count Russia as a growth market.", "authors": ["April Joyner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180809&t=2&i=1291960191&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE781Q6", "published_at": "2018-08-09"}
