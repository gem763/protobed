'I was told that he had lost confidence in her. Period,' he said.\n\nYovanovitch was abruptly recalled in May after Trump allies leveled unsubstantiated charges of disloyalty and other allegations against her.\n\n'I was aware that Mr. Giuliani was involved in Ukraine issues. My knowledge, particularly in the April-May-June time frame, even into July, was focused on his campaign, basically, against our ambassador to Ukraine,' Sullivan said.\n\nRevelation: 'I was aware that Mr. Giuliani was involved in Ukraine issues,' John Sullivan, currently the deputy Secretary of State told senators during a confirmation hearing for his nomination to be ambassador to Moscow\n\nRole: Rudy Giuliani's role in Ukraine relations is at the center of the impeachment probe.\n\nTrump nominated Sullivan, 59, for the position in Russia in August. He will replace Jon Huntsman, a former Utah governor, who resigned after two years in the post.\n\nThe veteran diplomat is expected to be easily confirmed, but his hearing was largely about Ukraine, not Russia, as Democrats took advantage of a rare chance to question an administration official publicly about the events that helped lead to an impeachment investigation of the Republican president.\n\nSullivan said he had told Yovanovitch she had done well as ambassador but said during the hearing that he had not pushed for a State Department statement of support for her.\n\nThe dismissal has been a focus in the Democratic-led House of Representatives' inquiry into whether Trump should be impeached for pressing his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate unsubstantiated corruption charges against Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nCongressional investigators are trying to determine whether Trump offered Zelenskiy a 'quid pro quo,' exchanging or withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. security assistance as Ukraine combats Russian aggression, according to whether Ukraine helped damage a Trump political rival.\n\nSullivan also seemed to break from Trump as he was questioned about whether it was 'ever appropriate' for a president to use the power of his office to seek investigations of domestic political opponents.\n\n'I don't think that would be in accord with our values,' Sullivan said.\n\nHowever, under questioning from Republicans, Sullivan noted that it is not illegal for a president to remove an ambassador. He said it would have been illegal for Trump to remove Yovanovitch from the foreign service, but he had not done so.\n\nWitnesses have testified in the House impeachment probe that Giuliani conducted a 'shadow' foreign policy in dealings with Ukraine.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing. He and his supporters dismiss the impeachment probe as a Democratic effort to overturn the Republican president's 2016 election victory. They have argued the Trump was merely concerned about long-standing corruption in Ukraine.\n\nOusted: Donald Trump fired Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine after public and private urging from Rudy Giuliani and other figures close to the administration including his son Don Jr.\n\nSome Republicans made that point at the Senate hearing on Wednesday.\n\nSenator Jim Risch, the committee's chairman, said, 'The fact that it's been so long-standing in Ukraine is what makes it so difficult to change and eradicate now.'\n\nMeanwhile in Congress, a separate diplomat testified that a Republican former congressman turned lobbyist repeatedly pushed for the dismissal Yovanovitch.\n\nCatherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, Ukraine specialists at the State Department, became the latest current and former U.S. officials called as witnesses in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry against the Republican president in the House of Representatives.\n\nCroft, who testified for roughly five hours after being subpoenaed, said she was a member of the National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House from July 2017 to July 2018.\n\n'During my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired. He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros,' Croft said in her opening statement to lawmakers, posted online by the Washington Post.\n\n'It was not clear to me at the time - or now - at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,' Croft said.\n\nSoros is a wealthy financier often assailed by conservatives and known for his support of liberal causes. Barack Obama was Trump's Democratic predecessor.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, a former U.S. vice president, and his son Hunter, who had served as a director for Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe testimony revealed a previously unknown role in the Ukraine controversy for Livingston, who played a prominent role in the Republican-led drive to impeach Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\n\nLivingston was yet another well-connected Republican advocating against Yovanovitch, including Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., Giuliani and former Republican congressman Pete Sessions.\n\nLobbying disclosure filings with the Justice Department show Livingston's firm represented two Ukrainian clients in Washington. They are former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who mounted an unsuccessful run for president this year in the election won by Zelenskiy in a landslide in April, and an association of Ukrainian metal producers.\n\nThe filings revealed a connection between Livingston's firm and Giuliani, showing that Republican former congressman Bob McEwen of Ohio, working as a consultant to the Livingston Group, introduced Tymoshenko to Trump's lawyer last December.\n\nThe filings show that Livingston called Croft in May 2018, and contacted Anderson in November and December 2018.\n\nLivingston, from Louisiana, was once one of the most powerful Republicans in Washington and had been in line to become House speaker.\n\nBut he quit in 1998, saying he could not lead the effort to impeach Clinton for lying about a sexual relationship with an intern because he himself had engaged in an extramarital affair.\n\nImpeachment number one: Robert Livingston, then speaker-elect of the House, stepped down from Congress in the middle of the unfolding Bill Clinton impeachment when his own infidelity was revealed\n\nPower: Robert Livingston, seen with Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader last month, is now one of Washington's most powerful lobbyists. Who he was working for when he pushed to oust a career diplomat is uknown\n\nThe affair emerged after Larry Flynt of Hustler offered a reward for information on Republicans' extra-marital affairs.\n\nHis firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCroft said she told Fiona Hill, Trump's former top Russia adviser, and George Kent, a senior State Department Ukraine expert, about Livingston's efforts concerning Yovanovitch but was 'not aware of any action that was taken in response.'\n\nAnderson, in his opening statement seen by Reuters, also mentioned Giuliani's actions. Before Zelenskiy's inauguration in May, Anderson said 'my colleagues and I saw a tweet by Rudolph Giuliani' alleging that Ukraine's incoming leader 'was surrounded by enemies of President Trump.' Anderson said he sought to counter that 'negative narrative.'\n\nIn her own testimony this month, Yovanovitch said she did not know Giuliani's motives for attacking her and that she believed she was ousted based on 'unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.'\n\nTrump's nominee to become U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, testified in his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that he knew earlier this year about Giuliani's involvement in the campaign to oust Yovanovitch.\n\nAsked by Democratic Senator Bob Menendez whether it is 'ever appropriate' for a president to use the power of his office to seek investigations of domestic political opponents, Sullivan replied, 'I don't think that would be in accord with our values.'\n\nGiuliani has admitted sending to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a packet of information in March including a document describing a discredited theory promoted by Trump allies that Yovanovitch was installed in her post in Kiev by Soros and that unless she was removed, Soros 'has as much, or more power over Yovanovitch as the president and the Secretary of State.'\n\nAfter hearing Croft testify, Democratic congressman Gerald Connolly said he was shocked to hear of Livingston's role, adding, 'We would love to know what possessed him to recommend the firing of an honorable career foreign service ambassador who was doing a good job in protecting U.S. interests and trying to promote democracy in Ukraine.' Another House Democrat, Peter Welch, called Livingston's actions 'disgraceful.'\n\nThe July telephone call is at the heart of the congressional inquiry into whether Trump misused the power of his office for personal political gain and, if so, whether that rises to the level of 'high crimes and misdemeanors' that merit impeachment and removal from office under the Constitution.\n\nIf the Democratic-led House approves formal charges against Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would then hold a trial on whether to remove him from office.\n\nTrump made his request to Zelenskiy for an investigation into the Bidens after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by Congress to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to Trump's requests. The aid was later provided.\n\nAnderson, who began his testimony in the afternoon, and Croft described Trump's negative view toward Ukraine even as other State Department and White House officials underscored Kiev's importance to U.S. national security in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nIn November 2018, Anderson said, Russia escalated the conflict when its forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels heading to a Ukrainian port.\n\n'While my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,' Anderson said.\n\nHe said Kurt Volker, at the time the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, drafted a tweet condemning Russia's actions, which he posted to his account.\n\nSeparately, the House Rules Committee opened a debate on legislation laying out procedures for the next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Republicans, who have accused Democrats of trampling on Trump's rights and keeping the process too secret, sought to win greater powers to subpoena witnesses and documents and to further open up proceedings of the Intelligence Committee, which plays a key role in the probe.\n\nTrump has urged Republicans to fight the impeachment effort.\n\n'This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax,' he tweeted on Wednesday, exhorting Republicans to 'go with Substance and close it out!'", "description": "John Sullivan, currently deputy Secretary of State, said he was aware of Giuliani's campaign against Marie Yovanovitch, who Trump fired, and said he did not know why she was removed from her job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20397722-0-image-a-2_1572471065157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
