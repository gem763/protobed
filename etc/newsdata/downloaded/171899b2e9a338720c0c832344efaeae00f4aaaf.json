I subbed to him originally because I liked how he dealt with the media and other groups (including the ADL) telling lies about him,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother added: \u201c The way that @pewdiepie brings up how he\u2019s \u2018donating\u2019 $50k to the Anti Defamation League @ADL makes it look totally sus and look like he\u2019s facing blackmail from the ADL\u201d.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Kjellberg defended his contribution on Twitter, stating that he wants to move on.\n\n\u201cMisrepresenting headlines of me has led me down a path of twists with MSM [mainstream media] for years now. Previously it hasn\u2019t bothered me much. I know who I am.\n\n\u201cBut, after the Christ Church travesty a few months ago, my own clash with MSM was manipulated as a tool for destruction.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI\u2019m not okay with this situation any longer and I\u2019ve felt responsibility to make changes.\n\n\u201cMaking a donation to ADL doesn\u2019t make sense to everyone, especially since they\u2019ve outright spoken against me. I wanted to show publicly that I can move past it and move on. I think that it\u2019s important, this just isn\u2019t my fight anymore.\u201d\n\nThe YouTuber sparked controversy in 2017 after he paid two men to hold up a sign in a video that read \u201cDeath to all Jews\u201d, which he claimed to do to prove \u201chow crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online\u201d.\n\nKjellberg later apologised for the video, saying: \u201cI am sorry for the words I used as I know they offended people. I do strongly believe that you can joke about anything, but I also believe that there is a right way and not the best way to joke about things.\"", "description": "YouTuber PewDiePie has defended his decision to make a $50,000 (\u00a340,000) donation to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/10/screenshot-2019-09-12-at-10.15.18.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
