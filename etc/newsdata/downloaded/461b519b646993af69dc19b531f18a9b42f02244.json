She died in her sleep at her home in Greensboro, North Carolina, according to the Charlotte Observer.\n\n\"We are heartbroken to share that Kay left us unexpectedly this morning,\" her family said in a statement to the newspaper.\n\nBefore running for the U.S. Senate, Hagan worked in the banking industry and served in the North Carolina state Senate.\n\nHagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole in the 2008 election, in which Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama won the Southern state in a reversal of years of losses there by Democrats. Dole, a former Cabinet secretary, is the wife of former U.S. senator and 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole.\n\nHagan served on several Senate committees, including the Armed Services Committee. Her father and brother had both been in the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn 2010, she joined other Democrats in voting for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which became Obama's signature domestic legislation.\n\nThe same year, Hagan became one of only five Democrats in the Senate to vote against a bill to allow immigrants who entered the United States as children without authorization to legally remain in the country. The bill, known as the DREAM Act, was defeated.\n\nHagan narrowly lost to Thom Tillis, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, in the 2014 election.\n\nTillis, in a statement on Twitter, said he and his wife, Susan, were \"absolutely heartbroken by Senator Kay Hagan's sudden passing.\"\n\nObama in a statement called Hagan a \"terrific\" public servant \"eager to find common ground, willing to rise above the partisan fray, and always focused on making progress for the people she served.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender for the party's nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, said in a statement he saw Hagan and her husband, Chip, during a stop in Durham, North Carolina, on Sunday. He called Hagan a crucial ally in the Obama administration's battle to pass the Affordable Care Act.
