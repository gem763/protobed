USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Tonight, the Nation\u2019s Capital will party like it\u2019s 1933.\n\nThe Washington Nationals completed a dominating sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals with a 7-4 victory that wrapped up the National League Championship Series \u2013 and set the stage for the first World Series in Washington, D.C., since the original Senators lost to the New York Giants 86 years ago.\n\nThe Nationals hit rookie starter Dakota Hudson with seven runs in the first inning to give the sellout crowd of 43,976 an anticipation of celebration throughout the game. But the Cardinals cut the lead to three runs in the fifth and had the bases loaded in the top of the eighth before closer Daniel Hudson wiggled his way out of a jam by getting pinch-hitter Matt Carpenter to ground out to end the inning.\n\nThe inability of the St. Louis hitters to generate any offense was the story of this NLCS. Corbin\u2019s four earned runs in Game 4 were the first ones Nationals starting pitchers allowed in the series. The Cardinals could muster just 16 hits in 123 at-bats over the four games, for a collective .130 average. And they never had a lead at any point in the entire series.\n\nThe Washington Nationals celebrate after clinching the pennant.

Everybody has a hand in this,\u201d Max Scherzer said prophetically after Game 3. \u201cYou can give starting pitchers credit, but it\u2019s also been the offense, defense, baserunning. We\u2019re clicking and firing on all cylinders and that\u2019s what makes it so much fun.\u201d\n\nMan of the moment\n\nHe didn\u2019t quite pitch to the standard of the first three Nationals starters, but left-hander Patrick Corbin did show a similar streak of dominance \u2013 striking out the side in the top of the first inning and fanning seven of the first nine hitters to come to the plate.\n\nEntering the game with a 7.56 ERA in the postseason, Corbin settled back into his familiar starting role after a relief appearance in Game 2. After cruising through the first three innings, recorded strikeouts eight and nine before Yadier Molina plated the Cardinals\u2019 first run with a solo homer in the fourth. Although he gave up three runs in the fifth, Corbin came back to fan Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna \u2013 both on his trademark slider \u2013 to end the threat.\n\nHitters are batting .164 with 166 strikeouts on 312 at-bats ending on Corbin\u2019s slider this season (includes regular season and playoffs) https://t.co/eP3NILIHSP \u2014 Neil Greenberg (@ngreenberg) October 16, 2019\n\nCorbin\u2019s final line: five innings, four runs, four hits, three walks and 12 strikeouts.\n\nTurning point\n\nThe Nats made an immediate statement in Game 4, blasting rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson for seven runs on six hits in the bottom of the first inning.\n\nAnthony Rendon drove in the first run with a sacrifice fly and Juan Soto added an RBI double to get things started. The Nationals also benefited from a pair of defensive misplays: second baseman Kolten Wong dropped a throw on a potential force play and a trio of Cardinals \u2013 Wong, right fielder Jose Martinez and first baseman Paul Goldschmidt \u2013 allowed a shallow popup off the bat of Victor Robles to drop in between them that allowed another run to score.\n\nThat one inning typified the Nationals\u2019 complete dominance in the series \u2026 and also the Cardinals\u2019 relative ineptitude. Even thought St. Louis did cut the lead to three, their anemic offense never gave any indication they could fully recover from such a huge early deficit.\n\nFATEFUL 1ST: Cardinals unravel, Nats score 7 in 1st inning\n\nBRONX ZOO: Astros outfielder calls out Yankee fans\n\nManager\u2019s special\n\nKnowing the reward was nearly a week\u2019s worth of rest if his team could complete the sweep, Nationals manager Dave Martinez was aggressive in going to his bullpen in the sixth inning with Corbin showing signs of fatigue.\n\nMartinez pulled Corbin after 94 pitches and turned the game over to hard-throwing right-hander Tanner Rainey for a 1-2-3 sixth inning.\n\nIn the seventh he called on left-hander Sean Doolittle, who retired five consecutive batters before allowing a two-out single. So with four outs remaining, Martinez brought out closer Daniel Hudson to extinguish any threat in the eighth and get the final three outs in the ninth.\n\nNeeding a mulligan\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 No. 3 and 4 hitters, Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna, both hit .412 with an OPS over 1.300 in the division series. However, it was a completely different story against the Nationals in the NLCS.\n\nGoldschmidt struck out four times in Game 3 and each of his first three times up in Game 4. He finished the series with one single and nine strikeouts in 16 at-bats.\n\nOzuna wasn\u2019t much better. After striking out his first three trips to the plate against Corbin, he singled in the eighth to finish the series 3-for-16.\n\nCombined they hit a meager .125 with one extra-base hit in four games. With such as devastating lack of production from the heart of the order, the Cardinals never had a lead in the entire series.\n\nState of the Nationals\n\nFollowing their sweep, the Nationals will have a little extra time to rest before traveling to either Houston or New York for Game 1 of the World Series next Tuesday.\n\nNats manager Dave Martinez will have the luxury of giving his four starting pitchers \u2013 who were so dominant in sweeping the Cardinals \u2013 even more rest than they were accustomed to having in the regular season.\n\nMost likely that means Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg will start Games 1 and 2 on the road with Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez in some order for Games 3 and 4 as the World Series returns to Washington for the first time since 1933.", "description": "The Nationals swept the Cardinals to reach the World Series for the first time in franchise history.
