They, however, also expect heat in Texas could lead to more air-conditioning demand and attendant gas-fired power generation.\n\nSaid Myers in an outlook posted on Wednesday:\n\n\u201cCurrent heat in Texas that will expand into the Southeast in the mid-range is bolstering spot markets and contributing to the recent rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe warmer-than-normal weather in early September won\u2019t curb injections significantly at this point in the season. But it should prevent an otherwise quicker rise to very large, 100+ bcf builds seen in May and June.\u201d\n\nDominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute in New York, is predicting a build of 86 bcf for last week.\n\nA 81-to-86 bcf build will be about 15%-22% above the 70-bcf injection seen a year ago, during the week ended Aug. 30, 2018. The comparative five-year (2014-2018) average for injections during the period is even lower, at 66 bcf.\n\nNatGas Prices Up Two Weeks In A Row\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s settlement, the benchmark on New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s Henry Hub rose 8.7 cents, or 3.7%, to $2.45 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu).\n\nNatGas 60-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nThree straight days of rally from Monday have given the October contract a week-to-date gain of nearly 7%, after last week\u2019s 6% gain.\n\nFor now, there is little risk of the benchmark gas contract losing the key $2 per mmBtu support, given its 45-cent buffer.\n\nMarket Moves From \u2018Neutral\u2019 To \u2018Strong Buy\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Investing.com\u2019s \u201cNeutral\u201d call on natural gas from two weeks ago has been replaced with a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d On the site\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook, the top-end resistance for October gas has also been upgraded to $2.605 from $2.297.\n\nChirichella said:\n\n\u201cThe technical traders have moved back into the game on the buy side after a positive technical breakout to the upside signaling the possibility that prices could work their way toward the $2.80/mmbtu level for the spot contract.\u201d\n\nHe said the driver for the market\u2019s improved performance was the projection for further warming in major portions of the U.S. over the next several weeks.\n\nChirichella attributed the coming warmth across the Central and Eastern U.S., and especially in the South, to delayed effects from Hurricane Dorian that lashed Florida in the weekend.\n\nLast week, the weather was near normal with 76 cooling degree days (CDDs) versus a 30-year average of 74 CDDs for the period.\n\nCDDs measure the number of degrees a day's average temperature is above 65 Fahrenheit (18 Celsius) and are used to estimate demand to cool homes and businesses.\n\nGas production in the Lower 48 U.S. states, meanwhile, averaged a near record 92.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) last week, according to data provider Refinitiv.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Natural Gas Futures.
