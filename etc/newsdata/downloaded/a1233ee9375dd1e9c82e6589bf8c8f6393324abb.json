However, the rule was poorly written, the very politicians who originally championed it have acknowledged, and the temporary reprieve was accidentally made permanent on some wells.\n\nAs a result, some of the biggest oil companies in the world, including Chevron, Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil and others, have avoided paying at least $18 billion in royalties on oil and gas drilled since 1996, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. The companies, which hold government leases to drill in the Gulf, continue to extract oil and gas from those wells while not being required to pay royalties, a right the industry has gone to court to defend.\n\nRoughly 22% of oil production from federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico was royalty-free in 2018 because of the loophole, the Interior Department said.\n\nThe National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore industry, defended the arrangement. \u201cThere was no mistake in the law,\u201d said Nicolette Nye, vice president at the association. If not for the law, she said, \u201cwe likely would not be producing U.S. oil offshore in record amounts today.\u201d\n\nBut the program\u2019s original architect said he was surprised by the outcome. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t our intent,\u201d said J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana who had pushed for the original reprieve on royalties. \u201cThere should have been a provision that said it didn\u2019t apply above a certain threshold\u201d for oil prices, he said.\n\nThe loophole continues to cut into federal coffers. Royalties from offshore oil and gas are a significant source of revenue, bringing in almost $90 billion from 2006 through 2018, according to the agency.\n\nFrank Rusco, a director of the GAO\u2019s Natural Resources and Environment team and the report\u2019s author, said the findings are an extreme example of the Department of Interior failing to ensure that American taxpayers received a fair market value for the oil and gas extracted from public property.\n\n\u201cThese leases sold 20 years ago might keep producing for decades. The amount of forgone royalties is going to continue to increase,\u201d Rusco said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong case for Interior to review how it collects revenues on oil and gas.\u201d\n\nThe Interior Department said it \u201ctakes seriously\u201d its responsibility to ensure that the American public receives a fair value for public resources. Still, some parts of the report \u201cdo not paint a representative picture\u201d of the agency\u2019s efforts, Casey Hammond, acting assistant secretary for land and minerals, said in the agency\u2019s response, which was also released Thursday.\n\nDepartment data shows that Chevron holds the most royalty-free leases in the Gulf, followed by Anadarko (now a part of Occidental Petroleum), Norway\u2019s Equinor and Shell. Exxon Mobil, BP and CNOOC, China\u2019s state-run offshore oil and gas company, also own royalty-free leases, the data shows.\n\nChevron declined to comment. Shell, Occidental, BP, Exxon and Equinor referred queries to the oil industry group, the American Petroleum Institute. Calls to CNOOC\u2019s Houston offices went unanswered.\n\nBen Marter, a spokesman for the API, said companies \u201ctook Congress at its word,\u201d and any attempts to revisit the issue would be \u201cengaging in a dangerous game of bait-and-switch.\u201d\n\nThe report of the windfall to oil companies comes as the Trump administration has moved to further reduce the cost of offshore drilling for the industry, proposing to significantly weaken safety rules put in place after the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. President Donald Trump also earlier pushed to expand new offshore oil and gas drilling, though that plan was put on hold after being challenged in court.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is facing heightened scrutiny on several fronts. The United Nations has warned that oil and gas production must decline substantially in the coming years if humanity is to avoid the worst effects of climate change worldwide, including more severe flooding, droughts and sea level rise. And Exxon Mobil this week is fighting charges in a New York City courtroom that the company lied to shareholders about the costs and consequences of global warming.", "description": "The U.S. government has lost billions of dollars of oil and gas revenue to fossil-fuel companies because of a loophole in a decades-old law, a federal watchdog agency said Thursday, offering the first detailed accounting of the consequences of a misstep by lawmakers that is expected to continue costing", "authors": ["Hiroko Tabuchi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
