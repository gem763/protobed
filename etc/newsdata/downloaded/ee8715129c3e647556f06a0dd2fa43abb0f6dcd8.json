Not even a four-legged one.\n\n\u201cOur \u2018K-9\u2019, as they call it,\u201d he said, \u201cI call it a dog. A beautiful dog \u2013 a talented dog \u2013 was injured and brought back.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers who helped capture Baghdadi will no doubt be the subject of intense public interest going forward \u2013 and, if history holds, so will the dogs they used as their first line of defence.\n\nAfter the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, the identity of the dog who aided a team of Navy SEALs when they pushed into the terrorist leader\u2019s compound, a Belgian Malinois named Cairo, became the subject of rampant curiosity.\n\nOn Sunday, neither the White House nor the Pentagon would respond to request for details about the animals used in the pursuit of Baghdadi.\n\nRon Aiello, a retired marine and president of the nonprofit US War Dogs Association, said in an interview that the dogs were probably one of two breeds: a German shepherd or a Belgian Malinois, two of the most common breeds deployed during similar military operations because of their strength and ability to sniff out explosives.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re leading the patrol,\u201d Mr Aiello said, \u201cthey want a dog that is not only an explosive detection dog but on command can be aggressive. On a mission like this you want a dog that can be aggressive when necessary.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But Mr Aiello said that the right breeds were still more effective than humans or bomb-sniffing technology.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t replicate what they can do,\u201d said Mr Aiello, who in 1966 was part of one of the first marine scout dog teams to be deployed to Vietnam. \u201cThey save lives every day over there leading patrols.\u201d\n\nMr Trump would not be the first commander-in-chief to be impressed by the heroic actions of a dog who helped military operatives capture a terrorist leader.\n\nA story by The New Yorker published a few months after the bin Laden raid described a fascinated Barack Obama, asking to meet Cairo.\n\n\u201cThere was a dog?\u201d the former US president said during a meeting on the bin Laden operation, when he learned that Cairo was nearby.\n\nMr Obama, distracted from his briefing, said: \u201cI want to meet that dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to meet the dog, Mr President,\u201d the squadron commander joked, \u201cI advise you to bring treats.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Mr Obama met Cairo, who stayed muzzled.\n\nMr Trump did not go into detail on Sunday about the soldiers who carried out the raid.\n\nMark Esper, the defence secretary, said during an appearance on CNN that US soldiers had been injured during the operation, a statement that conflicted with the president\u2019s claim that only a dog had been injured.\n\n\u201cWe had two minor casualties, two minor injuries, to our soldiers,\u201d Mr Esper said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already returned to duty.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr Trump alternated between his reverence for the dogs used in the raid and using the word \u201cdog\u201d as a slur he has reserved to describe a host of adversaries in subhuman terms.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog,\u201d Mr Trump said of Baghdadi. \u201cHe died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The last moments of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s life were spent being chased down a dark underground tunnel by military dogs.
