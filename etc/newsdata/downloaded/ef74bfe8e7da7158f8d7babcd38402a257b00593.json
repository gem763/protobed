And it\u2019s a combination of neighborhood integrity and craftsmanship that has helped sell almost 70% of the first phase of the seven-building project in the Cobble Hill neighborhood, Ms. Lichy said.\n\n\n\nThis 3,400-square-foot penthouse will have private elevator access. An additional 500 square feet of exterior space is allocated to three private terraces. Quartzite and white oak floors run throughout the four bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom penthouse. All the cabinetry and built-in furniture was custom-made in the Navy Yards, Ms. Lichy said.\n\n\n\nMore: Big-Ticket Condo Buyers Gradually Returning to Manhattan\u2019s Luxury Market\n\nThe apartment\u2019s panoramic views include the Brooklyn waterfront and the city skyline. River Park, developed by Fortis Property Group, is close to the waterfront but also near the interior of the Cobble Hill neighborhood, Ms. Lichy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique place to be situated,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nEach building of the seven-building River Park development is designed by a different architect with the goal of honoring the vernacular of the neighborhood. Cobble Hill is a classically Italian neighborhood, and the building pays homage to that with its bocce courts.\n\n\n\nAnd 5 River Park specifically, designed by Douglas Romines, comprises 25 residences. The building itself features hand-laid brick \u201cto mirror the look of the surrounding townhouses,\u201d Ms. Lichy said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Phillips \u2018New Now\u2019 Offers a Mix of Masters and Lesser-Known Artists\n\nOf its 20,000-square-feet of amenities, most are devoted to promote indoor/outdoor living, according to Ms. Lichy, including an in-ground pool with outdoor showers, a private playground and multiple terraces. Inside, there is a fitness center with steam rooms and a sauna, and an acoustically sound music room.\n\n\n\nThe development overtook seven defunct buildings that once belonged to the NYU Langone Long Island Children\u2019s Hospital. While most of the projects will be teardowns, the first phase of the development project, the Polhemus Residences, was an adaptive reuse. The other two buildings of the second phase, 1 River Park and 2 River Park, contain a K through 12 school and an urgent care clinic, respectively.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-103667?width=1280"}
