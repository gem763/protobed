(Gerald Herbert/AP)\n\nAs the consequences from President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw some American troops from Syria became clearer, and as some congressional Republicans continued to be heavily critical of the decision, Trump supporters at a rally said they still support the decision.\n\n\u201cI agree with him,\u201d said Bill Harold, a 67-year-old veteran who said he doesn\u2019t always agree with the president, but he does on the Syria question.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there long enough. We\u2019ve done what we\u2019re supposed to. Now, let the people take over and do their thing,\u201d Harold said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t? Hey. You had your help. We taught you how to fish, you oughta be able to eat.\u201d\n\nHarold wasn\u2019t alone in his sentiments among those who watched Trump rally voters for the Louisiana governor\u2019s race, which will be held Saturday. Their support suggests that while the decision has been unpopular with Republican lawmakers with more traditional, hawkish views on foreign policy, it has been greeted positively by the president\u2019s most ardent supporters \u2014 the ones he is counting on to turn out in droves as part of his reelection strategy. Trump campaigned on a promise to pull troops out of conflicts abroad as part of his nationalist platform and his supporters argue that his Syria decision is consistent with what he said he would do on the campaign trail and since becoming president.\n\n\u201cGoing into the Middle East is one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. It\u2019s like quicksand,\u201d said Trump, who did not mention Syria by name Friday night. \u201cWe are slowly and carefully bringing our great soldiers and warriors back home.\u201d\n\nCritics of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria argue that the president is leaving the Kurds \u2014 longtime U.S. allies crucial to American efforts to combat the Islamic State \u2014 defenseless at the hands of the Turkish military, which launched an offensive against them in northern Syria in the wake of U.S. withdrawal. They also argue that the decision will allow for the regeneration of the Islamic State in the region.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), for example, bent his usual supportive posture to call the decision \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Other usual Trump allies have echoed similar critiques. Some supporters Friday dismissed such criticism of the decision by dismissing the critics themselves.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham is criticizing him? Lindsey Graham \u2014 I think he folds when things get tough,\u201d said Aloner Nicks, 66, from Ville Platte, La.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like about Trump. He is tough. He doesn\u2019t fold. He\u2019s my John Wayne. My Clint Eastwood. My Rocky Balboa.\u201d\n\nOthers separated the effects Trump\u2019s decision would have on American troops from the potential consequences for the region.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he did it. Get our troops out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d said Katy Burgess, a Lake Charles resident. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure I agree with Turkey doing what it\u2019s doing, but I\u2019m glad he pulled our troops out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nTrump has pushed a similar interpretation, arguing that he is prioritizing American interest over others \u2014 an argument he articulated in striking terms for the crowd Friday night.\n\n\u201cI am not president of the world. I am president of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe reject globalism. We embrace patriotism.\u201d\n\nThat line received raucous applause from a crowd gathered to watch Trump stump for two Republican candidates for governor who are hoping to combine for more than 50 percent of the vote here Saturday, thereby forcing a runoff election with incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards.\n\nTrump had kept that crowd waiting about 30 extra minutes late for the rally to start Friday evening, and he told the crowd China had kept him \u2014 a reference to negotiations with Chinese Vice Premier Hiu Le that resulted in the White House agreeing not to proceed with plans to increase tariffs on Chinese goods soon. Even as he explained the delay, Trump made sure to tell the crowd he had elevated domestic priorities over foreign business.\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019m not going to be late for Louisiana, even if it means standing up China,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump spoke for an hour and a half, and didn\u2019t touch on the situation in the Middle East until the end of his remarks. When he did, some attendees were already on their way out, and those remaining showed no signs of opposition to the president\u2019s strategy.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that he\u2019s doing the right thing for our troops. That\u2019s what\u2019s most important to me, doing what\u2019s best for our people,\u201d said Julie Davidson, who has two sons serving in the Marine Corps.\n\nTrump said the decision is not made with only American troops in mind.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of building foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our own country,\u201d His supporters echoed the notion that other countries have benefited from American help while Americans have not.\n\n\u201c[They] haven\u2019t helped us,\u201d Harold said. \u201cIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t have to be quid pro quo, but you didn\u2019t help us.\u201d", "description": "While most Republicans in Congress criticized Trump\u2019s decision, attendees at a rally in Louisiana signal they are with the president.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4eSFLii23lhAJsr9V7tMGDAlc90=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOKGV2HMUAI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
