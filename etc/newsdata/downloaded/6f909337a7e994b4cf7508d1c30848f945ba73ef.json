True to form, he\u2019s repeatedly declared that he\u2019s deserving of the prestigious honor, and has claimed the Nobel committee\u2014a five person panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament\u2014is rigged against him.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things\u2014if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this year.\n\nTrump has now been in office for nearly three years, and still has yet to receive the prize, while former President Barack Obama won it within nine months of taking office. This year\u2019s winner will be announced at 11 a.m. Friday at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, and streamed live on their website at 5 a.m. EST.\n\nTrump has argued that he deserves the prize for his efforts to open communication with North Korea and denuclearize the hermit nation, a commendable goal that has so far been unsuccessful despite multiple summits with the North Korean leader.\n\nWhile he\u2019s insisted \u201cthey probably will never give\u201d the award to him, Trump has been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is rumored to have sent the Nobel Committee a sparkling nomination letter on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cWe have nominated him of course for the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Per-Willy Amundsen, a former right-wing Norweigian Justice Minister told Reuters in February. \u201cIt has been a very difficult situation and the tensions have since lowered and a lot of it is due to Trump\u2019s unconventional diplomatic style.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s dogged pursuit of things with his name on them, the Nobel Peace Prize would provide him with abiding bragging rights. Past winners, however, may not welcome him with open arms. Since entering the White House, the world\u2019s greatest peace-makers have often found discord with the leader of the free world.\n\nMalala Yousafzai\n\nYousafzai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, has been a frequent critic of President Trump\u2019s policies. She first gained international attention after being shot in the head for going to school in her native Pakistan, defying a Taliban ban on girls receiving education. Yousafzai miraculously survived and used her recognition to advocate for women\u2019s rights around the world.\n\nAs a champion for gender equality, Yousafzai was first asked about Trump in reaction to the allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against the president. She told a crowd at the World Economic Forum last year that she was \u201cso disappointed to see that people in high positions talk about women in unequal terms and do not accept them as equals,\u201d adding that \u201cit is just shocking for a second to believe that this is actually happening\u2026 I hope that women stand up and speak out against it.\u201d\n\nYousafzai has also addressed the president\u2019s travel ban on Muslim majority countries, as well as his policies at the Mexican border. \u201cI was deeply hurt,\u201d Yousafzai said of the travel ban in 2017. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a Muslim, and to me it just seemed like directly blaming Muslims, and that is not a solution, that is just making an excuse and hiding from the real problems.\u201d\n\nA year later, she spoke out against the Trump administration\u2019s child-separation policy. \u201cThis is cruel, this is unfair and this is inhumane. I don\u2019t know how anyone could do that,\u201d Yousafzai said during a visit to South America. \u201cI hope that the children can be together with their parents.\u201d\n\nNadia Murad\n\nTrump has actually met the most recent Nobel Peace Prize recipient.\n\nDuring a meeting with survivors of religious persecution at the White House in July, Trump listened to Nadia Murad recall how her family was murdered by ISIS, and how she was taken captive by the group. After her escape, she has tirelessly spread the word about the horrific crimes committed against her people by ISIS.\n\nDespite claiming to have defeated ISIS, Trump appeared to be unfamiliar with Murad\u2019s story, asking her why she was awarded the Nobel Prize that he covets. \u201cThey gave it to you for what reason?\u201d Trump asked Murad. \u201cFor what reason?\u201d she responded, appearing confused. \u201cFor that after all this happen to me, I can\u2014I make it clear to everyone that ISIS raped thousands of Yazidi women.\u201d", "description": "Mandel Ngan/GettyPresident Trump has made no secret of his infatuation with the Nobel Peace Prize.
