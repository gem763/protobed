But the policy change caused some users to abandon the site.\n\nThe new policy went into effect December of 2018, and resulted in the deletion of any content portraying \"real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples.\" Some hoped that the sale of Tumblr to a new company in August would result in the ban's reversal, but the new owners have said they're keeping the ban on NSFW (not safe for work) content in place.\n\nReaction to Tumblr's announcement was swift and critical across social media. More than 665,000 people have signed a Change.org petition to \"make Tumblr rescind their adult content ban.\"\n\nFor many, Tumblr was seen as a safe space used for exploration and self-expression.\n\n\"I frequently got messages from folks who saw my work and said it helped them understand part of themselves better,\" an anonymous Tumblr user told The Washington Post. \"That's primarily what I saw on Tumblr, in my curated bubble: women and LGBT creators exploring sexual concepts that they didn't feel comfortable sharing anywhere else.\"\n\nDozens of new Twitter accounts popped up from former Tumblr users who said they were switching social media sites as a result of the new policy. But while Twitter is mainly a platform for short text blurbs and sharing links, Tumblr emphasizes blogging with a mix of images, videos, GIFs, and creative writing.\n\nOther blogging platforms reported seeing an influx of new users since Tumblr announced its policy change.\n\nHere are some alternatives to Tumblr emerging in light of the ban on adult content:", "description": "Tumblr's ban on NSFW content started last December.
