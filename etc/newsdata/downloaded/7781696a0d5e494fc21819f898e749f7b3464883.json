President Trump is very intimidated by Justin Trudeau because he\u2019s a good looking, smart kid and President Trump is like this orange fat blob,\u201d Scaramucci told ABC.\n\n\u201cAnd so he\u2019s very intimidated by the way the guy looks. And Justin Trudeau has been very, very smart at keeping his distance from President Trump.\u201d\n\nScaramucci attributed Trump\u2019s weeklong obsession with defending his Hurricane Dorian Alabama gaffe \u2015 despite denial from national meteorologists \u2015 to his fragile ego.\n\n\u201cAgain, it\u2019s his inability to ever be wrong about anything or ever to apologize for anything,\u201d said Scaramucci, who recently flipped from staunch Trump defender to all-out enemy. \u201cIt basically has to do with very low self-esteem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean the poor guy has the self-esteem of a small pigeon.\u201d\n\nScaramucci made similar comments in at the Toronto Global Forum last week, praising Trudeau\u2019s \u201cmasterful\u201d tactics in trade negotiations from the background while Trump took center stage.\n\n\u201cBecause when you\u2019re dealing with such a complete narcissist like that, it could have been detrimental and destructive if they didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Scaramucci said in an interview at the conference.\n\nScaramucci is currently fundraising against his former boss in a bid to make Trump a one-term president. He was spotted at a charity event featuring Joe Biden on Long Island\u2019s Southhampton last month. Though he insisted he\u2019s still a \u201cregistered Republican,\u201d he acknowledged he was on the hunt for a new candidate to back because he believed the president had \u201clost his mind.\u201d\n\nTrump has regularly fired back at his former employee, calling him \u201ctotally incapable\u201d of his job and saying nobody had \u201cever heard of this dope until he met me.\u201d", "description": "\"I mean, the poor guy has the self-esteem of a small pigeon,\" the former White House communications director said.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d75d893230000c70351282a.jpeg?cache=mxh9gbi0t1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
