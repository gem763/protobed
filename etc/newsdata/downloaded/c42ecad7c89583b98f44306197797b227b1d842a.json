O/NASIANAP\n\n- Overall naphtha flows to Asia this month stood at 5.4 to 5.5 million tonnes, data from Refinitiv Oil Research Team showed.\n\n- This was higher than July's volume at 5.3 million tonnes. GASOLINE: Asia's gasoline profit margin was at a three-session high of $5 a barrel but the market remains under pressure from ample supplies.\n\n- Singapore's onshore light distillates stocks were marginally higher by 0.1 percent, or 13,000 barrels, to an eight-week high of 11.285 million barrels in the week ended on Wednesday, data from Enterprise Singapore showed. But current inventories are however 13.2 percent lower versus a year ago, the data showed. O/SING1\n\n- U.S. gasoline stockpiles on the other hand were expected to have fallen by 1.5 million barrels last week, a Reuters poll showed. TENDERS: India's Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) bought 20,000 tonnes of gasoline for Sept. 16-18 arrival at Kandla at premiums of about $4 a barrel to Singapore quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis.\n\n- This was down from two purchases BPCL made previously for August arrival at the same port at premiums of about $4.50 a barrel. MOG/TENDA\n\n- The refiner however has offered a prompt 30,000-tonne naphtha cargo for Sept. 18-20 loading from Mumbai through a tender closing on Sept. 6.\n\n- Earlier in the week it sold 30,000 tonnes for Sept. 6-8 loading from the same port to Vitol at no more than $1 a tonne premium to its own price formula on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, the lowest price it has received this year, Reuters data showed. NAP/TENDA\n\n- MRPL on the other hand has sold a 35,000-tonne cargo for Sept. 26-28 loading from New Mangalore to Emirates National Oil Co (ENOC) at premiums of about $12.50 a tonne to Middle East quotes on a FOB basis.\n\n- This was down from an average of close to $15 a tonne premium MRPL had fetched for two August cargoes sold to Trafigura.\n\n- It was also the lowest price MRPL has received since it sold a cargo for June loading.\n\n* CASH DEALS: Two naphtha deals but none on gasoline.\n\nLIGHT DISTILLATES\n\nCASH ($/T)\n\nASIA CLOSE\n\nChange\n\n% Change\n\nPrev Close RIC OSN Naphtha CFR Japan M1\n\n472.00\n\n16.00\n\n456.00 NAF-1H-TYO OSN Naphtha CFR Japan M2\n\n471.00\n\n15.50\n\n455.50 NAF-2H-TYO OSN Naphtha Diff\n\n37.50\n\n0.50 NAF-TYO-DIF Naphtha Netback FOB Sing\n\n50.65\n\n48.88 NAF-SIN Naphtha Diff FOB Sing\n\n100.00\n\n0.10 NAF-SIN-DIF Naphtha-Brent Crack\n\n19.00\n\n14.11\n\n16.65 NAF-SIN-CRK Gasoline 97\n\n69.90\n\n68.05 GL97-SIN Gasoline 95\n\n68.70\n\n66.50 GL95-SIN Gasoline 92\n\n65.40\n\n63.15 GL92-SIN Gasoline crack\n\n4.57 GL92-SIN-CRK\n\nFor a list of derivatives prices, including margins, please double click\n\nthe RICs below.\n\nM1\n\nBRENTSGMc1\n\nNaphtha CFR Japan M1\n\nNACFRJPSWMc1\n\nNaphtha CFR Japan M1/M2\n\nNACFRJPSDMc1\n\nNaphtha CFR Japan M2\n\nNACFRJPSWMc2\n\nNaphtha Japan-Sing Netback M1\n\nNAPTC4SPDMc1\n\nNaphtha Japan-Sing Netback M2\n\nNAPTC4SPDMc2\n\nNaphtha FOB Sing M1\n\nNAFOBSGSWMc1\n\nNaphtha FOB Sing M1/M2\n\nNAFOBSGSDMc1\n\nNaphtha FOB Sing M2\n\nNAFOBSGSWMc2\n\nNaphtha Cracks M1\n\nNACFRJPCKMc1\n\nEast-West Naphtha M1\n\nNAPJPEWMc1\n\nEast-West Naphtha M2\n\nNAPJPEWMc2\n\nNWE Naphtha M1\n\nNAPCNWEAMc1\n\nNWE Naphtha M1/M2\n\nNAPCNWEASMc1\n\nNWE Naphtha M2\n\nNAPCNWEAMc2\n\nCrack NWE Naphtha-Brent M1\n\nNAPCNWEACMc1\n\nCrack NWE Naphtha-Brent M2\n\nNAPCNWEACMc2", "description": "Asia Naphtha/Gasoline-Naphtha nears two-week high; gasoline gains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
