It doesn\u2019t even rank as their best win in program history, according to head coach Shawn Elliott.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGeorgia State has only recorded 20 wins since it moved up to college football\u2019s top level in 2013, but Elliott told reporters beating the Vols wouldn\u2019t rank higher than second on that list.\n\nWhat could possibly top getting your first Power Five win at an SEC team that paid you nearly a million dollars just to show up? To Elliott, a win in the 2017 AutoNation Cure Bowl does.\n\n[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo College Fantasy Football league for free today]\n\n\u201cI just want you to understand, to win that first bowl game in school history is something that\u2019s very, very special,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe hoisted a trophy. We played in the postseason. In my 23 years of coaching, that will probably be the No. 1, it may be top of the list in victories.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting that Georgia State\u2019s 10-point win two years ago against Western Kentucky was a game-changer for the program. It capped the school\u2019s first winning season and it had dropped its previous bowl game, the inaugural AutoNation Cure Bowl in 2015, to San Jose State.\n\nGeorgia State head coach Shawn Elliott (left) thought Saturday's win at Tennessee wasn't the best in the school's brief D-I history.

We don\u2019t get anything for winning this game. Maybe a pat on the back (but in) three weeks people will forget what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that people will forget about this upset, even if Tennessee continues its downward spiral since firing Phillip Fulmer in 2008.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Football coach Shawn Elliott calls Georgia State's win in the 2017 AutoNation Cure Bowl the school's best win in program history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Hhhy5eZuk1Mt43TD7SJ4cQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R_Qm9EKlcaoGMe8Mz_wo5A--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d60f44a0-cce6-11e9-bbfb-7938f13c0090"}
