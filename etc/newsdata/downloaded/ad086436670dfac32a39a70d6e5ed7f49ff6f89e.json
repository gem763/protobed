The stock pared losses of as much as 4.5% seen in Monday\u2019s after-hours session, according to FactSet data, after Alphabet reported earnings per share that fell to $10.12 from $13.06 a year ago and missed the FactSet consensus of $12.28.\n\nWhile profit disappointed, revenue rose 20% to $40.5 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $40.3 billion, and the company said it stepped up quarterly share repurchases by nearly 60% to $5.7 billion.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Opinion: Google joins in Amazon\u2019s spending spree, but to a lesser degree.\n\nOf the 45 analysts surveyed by FactSet, no less than 18 have raised their stock price targets. The average target has increased to $1,460.30, which is about 16% above current levels, from $1,415.54 as of the end of September.\n\nThe average rating remained at the equivalent of buy, as 39 analysts had bullish ratings and just 6 were at the equivalent of neutral. There are no sell ratings.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nAnalysts generally dismissed the earnings miss, with many citing the fact it was the result of one-time factors such as losses on equity investments and the recognition of a French tax settlement.\n\nAnalyst Youssef Squali at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said if you take those items out, Alphabet outperformed expectations. He kept his rating at buy, but raised his price target to $1,500 from $1,400, citing strength in mobile search, YouTube and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and signs of strong consumer and advertiser demand.\n\n\u201cWhile regulatory scrutiny remain a major risk with the potential for more fines [short-term], it is clear to us that it\u2019s had no material impact on [Alphabet\u2019s] business model to date,\u201d Squali wrote in a note to clients. \u201cTech breakthroughs with [machine learning] and [artificial intelligence] should help drive the model further, in our view.\u201d\n\nSee related: Antitrust fears muted, as Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook approach earnings.\n\nKeyBanc Capital analyst Andy Hargreaves lifted his price target to $1,546 from $1,516, while maintaining his overweight rating, as the results \u201cshowed excellent core sites ad revenue and continued strong growth in GCP,\u201d which he believes along with \u201cother significant growth opportunities\u201d suggests the potential for \u201csustained strong revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nStifel Nicolaus\u2019s Scott Devitt was one of the rare analysts who didn\u2019t have a bullish rating, after he downgraded the stock to hold in April on valuation concerns, but he raised his price target to $1,325 from $1,299 and was upbeat about Google\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cThe company continues to deliver 20%+ revenue growth at scale, supported by continued mobile search, YouTube and desktop search monetization,\u201d Devitt wrote in a research note. Cloud and the company\u2019s hardware (Pixel) businesses are supporting high 30% growth on a mid-teens percentage of the revenue base.\u201d\n\nHe said that investments in GCP, hardware and other areas of the business will likely keep weighing on the margin trend over time, \u201cthough at a lesser degree in some quarters, like this one.\u201d\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Class A shares have gained 1.4% over the past three months and rallied 20.5% year to date.
