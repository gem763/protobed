Kick off is set for 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nIt will be a homecoming of sorts for one Panther player: Efe Obada, who was first introduced to the sport that would change his life in the United Kingdom.\n\nBorn in Nigeria, Obada was trafficked from the Netherlands to the U.K. when he was 10 and then abandoned on the streets of London, ESPN reports. He ended up in foster care, bouncing from home to home.\n\nObada didn't pick up a football until his early 20s, let alone play college ball like most NFL draft prospects. When he was 22 and working as a security guard for Grace Foods, a friend invited him to join a practice with the British American football team, the London Warriors.\n\nThe coaching squad was immediately impressed with his speed, especially considering his 6-foot-6-inch frame. One coach, who had been an intern with the Dallas Cowboys, flagged Obada to his former team and recommended they offer him a tryout. After just five games of experience with the Warriors, the Cowboys signed Obada to its practice squad in 2015.\n\nHe was sent from Dallas to the Kansas City Chiefs to the Atlanta Falcons before finally landing in Carolina in 2017.\n\nAfter years on the sidelines, Obada played in his first NFL game last season as a Carolina Panther \u2014 and he seized the opportunity. Playing defensive end, he posted a sack and an interception in his debut game. His performance earned him the game ball from head coach Ron Rivera and the distinction of being named NFC Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nAs ESPN notes, his story is far from complete: Obada needs to prove his ability on the field in order \"to extend his work visa beyond the one year, $570,000 contract he signed with Carolina in January. If he doesn't get re-signed or find another opportunity, he will have to move back to London.\"\n\nThe stakes are high \u2014 but for Obada, it fuels the fire. \"He practices 100 miles per hour,\" Rivera told ESPN.\n\nAs Obada put it: \"I go hard every time.\"\n\nDon't miss: NFL player who saves nearly 90% of his income teaches a money class at Penn called 'Life 101'\n\nLike this story?
