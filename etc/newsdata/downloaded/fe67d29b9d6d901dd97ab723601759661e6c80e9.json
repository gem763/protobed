Former reality stars Ntando and Hlelo Masina share this\n\nCape Town - Former YFM presenters Ntando and Hlelo Masina have been out of the spotlight for some time now and many fans have been wondering what happened to the once famous local duo.\n\n\n\nThe twins are aware about the curiosity that people have about their whereabouts. They say it's the one question they always get, especially when people see them together in public.\n\nThe ex-reality show stars have been keeping a low profile and reveal in their YouTube channel that it has been a personal journey.\n\n\"For me it was just about self-reflection. What is my personal brand, that's what I've been working on,\" says Hlelo.\n\nNtando says she's not been active on social media because she's had nothing to share.\n\n\"I had nothing to say. When I have nothing to say I just don't say anything. That's the long and short of it,\" she explained.\n\nREAD MORE: TBT: Where are these celebrities now?\n\nHlelo says she was going through a transition and didn't want to hear the noise.\n\n\"I didn't want to hear other people's comments and voices.
