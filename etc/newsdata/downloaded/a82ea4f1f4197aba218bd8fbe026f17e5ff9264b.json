The way you\u2019re acting is not how we built it,'\u201d he said.\n\nThese may sound like more outlandish proclamations from Neumann, who has a flair for the dramatic. (Talking to Fast Company earlier this year, he compared WeWork to a rare jewel, asking, \u201cDo you know how long it takes a diamond to be created?\u201d)\n\nBut before WeWork began coming apart at the seams, Neumann had every reason to believe that he could pass power down to his heirs. Though many public shareholders may not realize as much, a growing number of tech founders enjoy the kind of dual-class shares that Neumann had extracted from investors, shares that don\u2019t merely give founders more voting power for a while after their companies go public or even throughout their lifetimes, but whose power can be passed down to their children, too.\n\nWe wrote about this very issue as a kind of hypothetical last month, quoting SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, a longtime legal scholar and law professor, who told an audience last year that nearly half of companies that went public with dual-class shares between 2004 and 2018 gave corporate insiders \u201coutsized voting rights in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nWarned Jackson, \u201cThose companies are asking shareholders to trust management\u2019s business judgment \u2014 not just for five years, or 10 years, or even 50 years. Forever.\u201d Such perpetual dual-class ownership \u201casks them to trust that founder\u2019s kids. And their kids\u2019 kids. And their grandkid\u2019s kids . . . It raises the prospect that control over our public companies, and ultimately of Main Street\u2019s retirement savings, will be forever held by a small, elite group of corporate insiders \u2014 who will pass that power down to their heirs.\u201d\n\nYou might argue that it\u2019s senseless to worry, that the market will speak as it did in WeWork\u2019s case. But not every company has such apparent flaws, and Neumann could have made himself a lot harder to shake than he did. In fact, the broader question the video raises is whether anyone will step in to stop the broader trend, or if public market investors will be living with the consequences down the road instead.\n\nNeumann wasn\u2019t insane to imagine the scenario that he did. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s rational. Giving founders super-voting shares for some period after transitioning onto the public market is something that many people can understand, for a variety of reasons that dual-share advocates have long asserted. Giving founders so much power that their kids call the shots of these publicly traded companies? Now that is crazy.", "description": "WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann didn\u2019t plan for his family\u2019s control of WeWork to end at his death but instead expected to pass that control to future generations of Neumanns, too, says Business Insider.
