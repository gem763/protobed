By tomorrow night they should be able to take a decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Rain going sideways'\n\n\"The decision is not for us, necessarily, because for us it's nice and easy, cosy, in the garage.\n\n\n\n\"But for the people out there around the track it is not nice to be sitting there with rain going sideways.\"\n\n\n\nA blank Saturday would be a huge disappointment to thousands of fanatical supporters at one of the best attended races on the circuit, but other drivers were prepared for the worst.\n\n\n\n\"I've got my speedboat on standby, so I'm ready,\" joked Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\n\n\n\"At the moment it doesn't look very likely. So we'll have a bit more free time on Saturday and it means waking up a little bit earlier on Sunday,\" he added.\n\n\n\nWith the storm expected to move away rapidly, qualifying could take place early on Sunday morning, something that happened in Japan in 2004 and 2010, with the race as scheduled in the afternoon. But Saturday's third free practice session would be lost.\n\n\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc said he hoped the FIA would consult the drivers to decide if conditions were safe but thought it \"would be pretty clear if we can't drive\".\n\n\n\nFrench driver Jules Bianchi crashed in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix after a typhoon. He died of his injuries the following year.\n\n\n\nThe typhoon has also already affected the Rugby World Cup in Japan, with Saturday's England-France and New Zealand-Italy final pool matches cancelled.\n\n\n\nTwo minor support races scheduled for Saturday at Suzuka have already been scrapped as a precaution.\n\n", "description": "Saturday's third practice session and qualifying could be called off for the Japanese Grand Prix as this is when the local area is expected to bear the full brunt of a typhoon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7778/1e84277877ee4668a737b5599ad5521e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
