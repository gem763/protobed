There will also be a special performance of Come From Away from the Tony and Olivier award-winning musical.\n\nGiles Cooper, chairman of the Royal Variety charity, said of this year\u2019s forthcoming show: \u2018The Royal Variety Charity is grateful to all the performers who are giving their time freely to support the charity at our main fundraising event of the year.\n\nRobbie\u2019s The Christmas Present is out next month\n\n\u2018The Royal Variety Performance enables the charity to continue our work supporting those within the entertainment industries throughout the United Kingdom and to maintain our residential and care home, Brinsworth House, in Twickenham.\u2019\n\nRobbie surprised with the announcement of his first festival record, The Christmas Present, earlier this month.\n\nThe album will also feature collaborations with Bryan Adams and, most bizarrely, Tyson Fury on a track called Bad Sharon.\n\nAnd the former Take That star has high hopes for the album, as he recently teased his plans to end Michael Buble owning the Christmas period.\n\nSpeaking to Scott Mills at a recent Q&A, Robbie said: \u2018You\u2019re always looking for a reason to go into the studio.\n\n\u2018And I thought: \u201cWhy don\u2019t I own birthdays like Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder? Or New Year\u2019s Day like\u2026 U2?\u201d Well, it\u2019s a bit depressing, that one, isn\u2019t it? You wouldn\u2019t put that one on for a shindig.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This album was gonna be called Achtung Buble. I fu**ing love Michael, but it must stop. It must end now.\u2019\n\nThe Royal Variety Performance will air on ITV in December.\n\nRobbie Williams - The Christmas Present tracklist Disc 1: Christmas Past 1. Winter Wonderland\n\n2.
