The Federal Reserve, for example, is taking a closer look at how climate change may pose a risk to economic stability.\n\nAD\n\nIn the United States, a $75 tax would cut emissions by nearly 30 percent but would cause on average a 53 percent increase in electricity costs and a 20 percent rise for gasoline at projected 2030 prices, the analysis in the IMF\u2019s Fiscal Monitor found.\n\nBut it would also generate revenue equivalent to 1 percent of gross domestic product, an enormous amount of money that could be redistributed and, if spread equally, would end up being a fiscally progressive policy, rather than one disproportionately targeting the poor.\n\nAD\n\nThe impact of a $75-per-ton tax would also hit countries differently depending on burning or exporting coal, which produces the most carbon emissions per unit of energy generated when it is burned.\n\nIn developing nations such as China, India and South Africa, a $75 carbon tax reduces emissions even more \u2014 by as much as 45 percent \u2014 and generates proportionately more revenue, as high as 3.5 percent of GDP in South Africa\u2019s case, the IMF found.\n\nAD\n\nThe idea of making it expensive to produce greenhouse gas emissions is hardly new, and has been widely embraced by economists despite the immense political difficulties involved in imposing such taxes.\n\n\u201cNo environmental economist should disagree with the main argument of the paper: Carbon pricing is the single most powerful tool we have for reducing CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels, and our current set of policies leaves us nowhere close to meeting our climate goals,\u201d said Marc Hafstead, a climate policy expert with Resources for the Future.\n\nAD\n\nBut several experts said that the IMF stance was important even as they noted that the carbon price may need to be a lot higher, rendering an already gigantic lift even more difficult.\n\nKenneth Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale University who worked on environmental issues during a stint as part of the Obama administration\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said the IMF\u2019s position added to the urgency recent scientific and economic assessments had shown in discussing how to tackle the climate problem.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective this is an exciting change in that they\u2019re thinking more deeply than they had previously,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Gillingham said a $75 per ton carbon tax may actually be too low to hold climate change to 2 degrees, noting that he had expected the figure to be closer to $100 per ton, given the world\u2019s high emissions path.\n\nAD\n\nGernot Wagner, who studies climate policy at New York University, agreed. He co-wrote a paper published Monday arguing that a carbon price should start high and gradually be reduced to take into account the costs of future damage from global warming.\n\n\u201cIf one takes climate risk and uncertainty seriously, the numbers rise much higher still,\u201d Wagner said in an email.\n\nMost economists and policymakers have designed carbon tax policies that start relatively low and ramp up quickly over time. Proponents say it would minimize economic hardship for consumers and companies for their past choices while changing future decisions such as purchases of polluting equipment or automobiles.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning Yale economist William D. Nordhaus has argued that a carbon tax of $300 per ton or even higher might be required.\n\n\u201cTheir estimate is, in my view, if anything on the low side of what is needed\u201d but on the high side compared with policies already being implemented in some countries, Nordhaus said in an email.\n\nMoreover, the latest science suggests the world will sustain massive damage, such as the loss of nearly all coral reefs, even if it holds warming to, or just under, 2 degrees Celsius. To keep warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, the carbon tax would have to be even higher, the IMF\u2019s Mauro noted, though he said he is not sure how high because the group did not do that analysis.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis is so dire, and public/popular determination to attack it is suddenly so strong and unquenchable, that even $75/ton by 2030 seems far too moderate a target,\u201d wrote Charles Komanoff, director of the Carbon Tax Center, in an emailed response to the IMF study.\n\nAD\n\nThe IMF report considers not just economic policy options, but the political feasibility of these proposals as well, including how they might affect different segments of society and how to make them more politically palatable, such as by redirecting the revenue back to the populace through tax cuts or direct dividend payments.\n\nIt shows that in the Group of 20 largest economies, the tax would raise energy costs by an average of 43 percent for electricity and 14 percent for gasoline in the countries considered.\n\nAD\n\nThis reflects the growing recognition that policies that impose financial burdens that fall hardest on a particular segment of society could trigger unintended blowback. France\u2019s tax hike on gasoline and diesel, for example, helped spur the violent \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests this year.\n\nNoah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the IMF joins \u201cthe chorus of organizations, experts and even grass-roots groups of people\u201d calling for more aggressive climate action.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe question is how to spur action, and a group like the IMF has a role to play in making that happen,\u201d he said.\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nAD\n\nWineries were already dealing with a labor shortage.
