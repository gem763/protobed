The kingdom ships more than 7 million bpd to global destinations every day, and for years has served as the supplier of last resort to markets.\n\nSaudi Arabia's ability to quickly restore oil production after the attacks, which hit at the heart of the Saudi energy industry and intensified a decades-long struggle with arch-rival Iran, would demonstrate an important degree of resilience to potentially very damaging shocks, Moody's said last week.\n\nAramco is getting ready for an initial public offering possibly later this year. Aramco has a meeting with analysts scheduled for Wednesday at the company's headquarters in Dhahran, two sources said.", "description": "Saudi Arabia to restore full oil output by next week: source", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8M0LB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
