REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nBefore Netanyahu embarked on a visit to the Black Sea resort Sochi to see Putin, Russia condemned Netanyahu\u2019s announced plan to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, after next Tuesday\u2019s election in Israel.\n\nIn an interview with Israel\u2019s Kan public radio, Netanyahu was questioned about persistent rocket attacks by Palestinian militants in Gaza. His opponents in what opinion polls show to be a close race have accused him of failing to do enough to end the strikes on southern Israel.\n\n\u201cWe will probably be forced - there\u2019ll be no choice - to enter into a campaign, a war, in Gaza,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nHe said, however, that he does not risk soldiers\u2019 and civilians\u2019 lives \u201cjust to get applause\u201d, and he was vague about when any such offensive war might start.\n\nNetanyahu made the remarks two days after sirens warning of rocket fire from Hamas Islamist-run Gaza forced him off the stage at a campaign rally in southern Israel.\n\nIsrael has responded to such attacks by launching air strikes against facilities belonging to Hamas, the dominant armed group that controls the Gaza Strip.\n\nWith opinion surveys showing his right-wing Likud neck and neck with the centrist Blue and White party, Netanyahu\u2019s Russia visit could help him burnish a statesman\u2019s image that he has promoted throughout the campaign.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s election posters have featured him shaking hands with Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally.\n\n\u201cI think Israeli citizens know that if it weren\u2019t for my connections, and meetings every three months (with Putin), we would have clashed a lot,\u201d Netanyahu, referring to the Russian military in Syria and Israeli forces that have been attacking Iranian-linked targets there.\n\n\u201cThe Russian army and the Israeli military and our air force are within touching distance...the big issue is how to succeed in maintaining our freedom of action in such a crowded area,\u201d he said on the radio.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday threatened war in Gaza and then flew to Russia to discuss Israeli freedom of action in Syria with President Vladimir Putin as a frenetic election race neared its end.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429041022&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0UB-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
