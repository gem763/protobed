There is still no tentative release date for Barack Obama's memoir.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nBecoming rich: Michelle Obama (above in November of last year on her book tour) will release Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice on November 19 announced published Penguin Random House\n\n'Featuring an intimate introduction by Mrs. Obama, the Becoming journal includes more than 150 inspiring questions and quotes that resonate with key themes in Mrs. Obama\u2019s memoir and that are designed to help readers reflect on their personal and family history, their goals, challenges, and dreams, what moves them and brings them hope, and what future they imagine for themselves and their community,' said the publisher in a statement.\n\nAn initial print of 500,000 copies has already been ordered by Penguin Random House.\n\nThe journal will also be 'printed cream writing paper, with a grosgrain ribbon and a foil-stamped cover and removable half-jacket.'\n\nObama is hoping that with this journal, readers can find their voice much like she found her own as detailed in Becoming.\n\n'I hope you\u2019ll use this journal to write down your experiences, thoughts, and feelings, in all their imperfections, and without judgment,' writes Obama in the introduction.\n\n'We don\u2019t have to remember everything. But everything we remember has value.'\n\nAnd always one to go high, Obama waited until after the release of Hillary and Chelsea Clinton's new book Gutsy Girls to announce her big news.\n\nBecoming was the bestselling book of 2018 in the United States, moving 3.4 million copies in less than two months according to NPD Bookscan data.\n\nIt also looks likely to repeat that feat again this year, unless Becoming is bested by its companion piece.", "description": "Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice will hit bookshelves on November 19 said Penguin Random House in a press release, almost one year after the Michelle Obama memoir.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404524-0-image-a-25_1570465887120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
