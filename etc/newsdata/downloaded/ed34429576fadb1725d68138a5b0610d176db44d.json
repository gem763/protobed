The couple have two daughters, 4-year-old Delta Bell and 6-year-old Lincoln.\n\n\u201cWe vacation almost exclusively with three other families who all have kids, and certainly at night, I\u2019m super jealous of them because I\u2019m like, fuck yeah I would love to drink something that turned down the volume of everyone in this house,\u201d Shepard explained. \u201cSo I\u2019m a little bit jealous in the evenings.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no jealousy in the mornings, however.\n\n\u201cAt 6:45 when we\u2019re all up, I\u2019m like, Oh I\u2019m crushing right now. I feel great. And they\u2019re miserable. And those voices are three times as loud with a hangover,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cSo I just have to focus on when the win is, which is always the morning.\u201d\n\nThough Bell hasn\u2019t sworn off alcohol, she said the parenting culture of drinking to unwind is simply not part of her daily life.\n\n\u201cThe wine meme is a very funny thing. I suppose I take it as generalized \u2018kids are stressful.\u2019 I personally don\u2019t have wine every day, but my wine is Netflix and cuddling with my husband or our date night,\u201d said Bell, star of the \u201cGood Place.\u201d\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Dax Shepard has been sober for 15 years.\n\n\u201cSo, the wine memes, for me, they\u2019re all-encompassing in the fact that they represent, \u2018Remember that you\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s OK if your kids are stressful and annoying. It\u2019s OK to take time for yourself,\u2019\u201d Bell added. \u201cBut to me, that doesn\u2019t necessarily ever mean alcohol.\u201d\n\nBell said neither she nor her husband feel pressure to drink when others do.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that my husband has done most of his sobriety work, and if you\u2019re really doing the work, you hopefully one day, aren\u2019t triggered by people drinking around you,\u201d she explained. \u201cDax has never been triggered by people drinking around him. In fact, our friends are usually sensitive to it, and they look to me like, \u2018Is it OK if I pour myself a drink?\u2019 And Dax will notice and say, \u2019Oh no listen, I lost my privilege of drinking, but you didn\u2019t lose your privilege. I think you should have a drink.\u2032 So I\u2019m very lucky there.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s openness about difficult topics is something they try to bring to their parenting as well. They parodied the idea of \u201cbrutally honest parenting\u201d in a funny video for their Lightlife campaign called \u201cA Taste of Honesty.\u201d\n\nThough the video may be exaggerated, it has a basis in their real experience.\n\n\u201cMy mother always told me everything,\u201d said Shepard. \u201cShe trusted that I could understand if she explained it to me, and I think I felt respected by that. A trigger for me when I was young was being lied to. I didn\u2019t like feeling lied to.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to his own kids, Shepard said he tries to bring the same spirit of honesty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not afraid of most topics,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow there are a couple, like I don\u2019t know if I need them to be ruminating on the collapse in the environment. Maybe they don\u2019t need to know my political point of view. But I\u2019m not afraid of death or sex. I don\u2019t mind talking about that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nBell echoed this sentiment.\n\n\u201cWe are very very honest in our household,\u201d she said. \u201cI think our parenting style that we agreed upon is things that are kept secretive oddly become shameful or scary. So we tell the truth about everything.", "description": "The celebrity couple opened up about raising kids in the age of wine memes and \"mommy juice.\"", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e0b5520000058074fecfc.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
