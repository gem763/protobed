Anybody that listens to this podcast knows why I cannot go on Dancing with the Stars. And it\u2019s because, and I will say this with a mic in my hand and a smile on face, that Mike Fleiss is a piece of s***. He is the creator of The Bachelor, and he hates women.'\n\nNot a fan: The former Bachelorette told comic Nikki Glaser 'Mike Fleiss is a piece of s***... He hates women.'

I wonder what changed your mind?'\n\nFour former Bachelors have competed on the while only two former Bachelorettes (original Bachelorette Trista Sutter and this year's contender Hannah Brown.)\n\nBristowe is convinced one of the only reasons Fleiss let Brown compete was because of Kaitlyn speaking out.\n\nPointing out the hypocracy, she told Glaser: 'So [Fleiss] lets all the Bachelors go on and the only reason he let Hannah go on this season of Dancing with the Stars is because \u2014 well, I hope I had something to do with it, that I said something \u2014 but because he\u2019s in hot water because there\u2019s some s*** that came out on him abusing his wife. So he\u2019s like, \"Look at me, I love women.\" As long as he\u2019s in power with ABC, I will never get on that show.'\n\nPaving the way: Bristowe is convinced one of the only reasons Fleiss let this past season's Bachelorette Hannah Brown (above with partner Alan Bersten) compete was because of Kaitlyn speaking out\n\nDomestic disturbance?
