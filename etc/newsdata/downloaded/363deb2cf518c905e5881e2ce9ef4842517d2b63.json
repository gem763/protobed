You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFollowing her firing, we spoke with Lubna about her reason for being so quiet on the show, why she couldn\u2019t be bothered to fight for attention and whether there\u2019s any truth to reports about a feud with controversial candidate, Lottie Lion.\n\nHow are you?\n\nI\u2019m okay now that I\u2019ve been fired.\n\nWhy do you think Lord Sugar chose to get rid of you?\n\nI think he fired me because he\u2019s got good instincts and he could tell I wasn\u2019t putting everything I had into the process. I wasn\u2019t the reason for the failure of the task, but I didn\u2019t have the will power to say so and I think that showed.\n\nDid you expect to go when you were brought back into the boardroom?\n\nOne hundred per cent. I expected to go on the first day when I woke up on that task. When I woke up, my watch stopped working and I just knew that my time on The Apprentice was up. I knew if we failed this task, I was going home. It was like destiny \u2013 I could foresee it happening and it happened.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Since then he has set up his own pillow company, attributing his business success to his \u201csharp\u201d, \u201cstreet wise\u201d character.\n\nWere you secretly hoping to be fired?\n\nI wasn\u2019t secretly hoping; I was just really expecting it. It was very, very difficult for me to concentrate in the process, because I\u2019ve got two kids who are two and one. Before The Apprentice, I was looking after them 24/7 on maternity leave, and then all of a sudden being thrown into a house with these extreme personalities and not being able to talk to them was very difficult. They're all I could think about. I just couldn\u2019t concentrate.\n\nYou did seem very quiet \u2013 I thought maybe that was because of the editing, but was it because you wanted to go home?\n\nI felt like some people were attention seekers who just wanted to be in the limelight, and I just couldn\u2019t be bothered to be a part of the drama they were trying to create. I did speak more in the previous episodes, so I would say some of it is the editing. I do feel that, in a way, the show's edited to justify the firing. I was quiet on this task, but I couldn\u2019t be bothered to compete with the strong personalities who wanted attention.\n\nSo were you relieved when Lord Sugar made his decision?\n\nI was extremely relieved because I couldn\u2019t really... I don\u2019t want to say \u201dbe bothered\u201d, but I couldn\u2019t, to be honest. I didn\u2019t want to participate in the drama and overacting. Trying to be in the limelight and the loudest voice is just not me. I\u2019ve worked with professional people all my life and I\u2019ve never needed to behave like that. If I don\u2019t overact in real life, why should I overact just because I\u2019m on TV? That\u2019s how I felt.\n\nWere you too nice for The Apprentice?\n\nI would say I was too nice compared to the people who were completely cutthroat, but at the end of the day, I decided to be myself. I don\u2019t think being a nice person is a bad thing \u2013 a lot of times people would rather work with someone like me than someone who might be strong in the process, but not a nice person off-screen. There were two things I was definitely not going to do in the process, which I\u2019m happy that I stuck by. One is grovel in front of Lord Sugar, and say \u201cPlease save me, keep me in the process.\u201d I did not do that. The second thing \u2013 I wasn\u2019t going to throw anyone under the bus and I\u2019m happy I didn\u2019t do that, either.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you want to grovel?\n\nI\u2019d like to think I know my worth. I've never had the need to grovel in front of anyone. I know that had Lord Sugar got to know me, there\u2019s no one else he would have invested in, but I\u2019m an introvert and it takes me time to open up. I was also so conscious coming into the process being a chartered accountant \u2013 I knew I had to behave professionally and be aware of the image I was giving out. I did hold back and there\u2019s more I could have given, but I don\u2019t regret anything.\n\nYou were lumbered with two of the biggest personalities of this year\u2019s series. First up: Thomas. He was criticised by Marianne for being a dictator as Project Manager. Was that a fair argument?\n\nI would say that he wasn\u2019t a dictator in this task. Lord Sugar did ask him to listen more in the previous episode, and he did. It was the sub-team that didn\u2019t actually listen to his instructions, so he naturally got really annoyed. I must say I do admire his ambition, determination and passion. I don\u2019t really have anything negative to say about him.\n\nHe seems like a nice guy underneath the arrogance.\n\nI think he is a nice guy. Let\u2019s be honest here: he hasn\u2019t been educated because of his background, but he\u2019s done so well in terms of business. He actually had more manners than some of the other contestants who do come from educated backgrounds. I\u2019d say that says a lot about how nice Thomas is. He was a gentlemen when some of the other candidates weren\u2019t.\n\nThen there\u2019s Lottie. Was she frustrating to work with?\n\nI would say that Lottie is a very strong candidate. It\u2019s quite admirable that someone at her age has come into this difficult process. She has great instincts and is confident, articulate and can think on her feet. I think there\u2019s a lot of positive things to say. Obviously, she is 19 and she\u2019s quite feisty. I do think she has a lot to learn in terms of how to treat people, but I\u2019m sure that during this process she will come to realise that at some stage. It\u2019s actually good coming into this process at a younger age, because you\u2019ve got the time to reflect before the rest of your life. It\u2019s quite commendable.\n\nThere have been reports in the press about friction between you and Lottie in the run-up to this year\u2019s series. Is there truth to the rumours?\n\nI would say there is truth to it, however there\u2019s no point me talking about it because it has already been spoken about.\n\nWhich candidate is getting away with the most?\n\nI would say that everyone to some extent is getting away with one thing or the other, but I\u2019m confident that Lord Sugar will be able to see past a lot of their tactics and techniques. He does give people a chance to mend their ways but if they don\u2019t, they will be in the firing line.\n\nIf you had to predict who\u2019ll make it to the final, who would you say?\n\nWho I think can be in the final versus who I want in the final are probably two different things. I would love for Thomas to be there. He's worked so hard and is great to watch.\n\nWho do you reckon could win, then?\n\nThat\u2019s a tough question because everyone in the process is so confident and are good at what they do. Anyone has a chance, really. I\u2019ve gone quite early so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. Some people come out of their shells later on in the process, but I would say that, from what I have seen, Lord Sugar does likes Thomas and sees something in him.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\n\nToo many things. I\u2019m working as a finance manager of the largest retailer in the UK. As well as that, I\u2019ve incorporated my business called Business Decoded, which provides tailored business services to anyone who would like them. I\u2019m also writing my book and I\u2019m juggling being a mother of a two-year-old and a one-year-old.\n\nThe Apprentice continues weekly on BBC One at 9pm", "description": "The latest\u00a0Apprentice\u00a0candidate to be fired by Lord Sugar has been revealed \u2013 and she\u2019s extremely happy about it.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/13/the-apprentice-lubna-farhan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
