(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nAny day now, a federal appeals court could rule on a lawsuit seeking to strike down Obamacare \u2014 a decision sure to inject even more drama into the fraught 2020 election.\n\nLegally, the Trump administration wants the Affordable Care Act wiped out. But politically, it\u2019s a different story.\n\nThe administration plans to seek a stay if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit invalidates all or part of the Affordable Care Act in the coming weeks \u2014 and may even try to delay a potential Supreme Court hearing on the matter until after the November 2020 election, as I reported over the weekend with my colleague Yasmeen Abutaleb.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Eliminating health coverage for around 20 million Americans who receive it through Obamacare isn\u2019t exactly a winning political prospect \u2014 and many in the administration know that. As I reported last month, it was only at the last minute and against the advice of some top officials that President Trump decided to side entirely with the GOP states trying to topple the law, instead of opposing them.\n\n\u201cThere will be a stay \u2014 it\u2019s not like the decision is going to come down and the world is going to change,\u201d a senior administration official told me.\n\nThe administration also hopes to slow the case\u2019s progress to the Supreme Court, two former administration officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss White House strategy. Tommy Binion, vice president of government relations for the Heritage Foundation, told me if the possibility of a Supreme Court decision looms over the election, he thinks Republican messaging about Obamacare \u201cwould be buoyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are offering Medicare-for-all as their vision for health care,\u201d Binion said. \u201cIf it looks like the Supreme Court could strike down the ACA, then Republicans will be offering their vision for health care in this country.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why the administration isn\u2019t eager for a quick Supreme Court hearing: If the justices heard the case as early as next spring, they could potentially hand down a ruling to invalidate all or parts of the ACA smack dab in the middle of Trump\u2019s effort to get reelected. The administration could try to avoid such a scenario by first asking the appeals court for a hearing by the full panel, instead of appealing immediately to the Supreme Court.\n\nPresident Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nLet\u2019s back up a minute. Trump\u2019s Justice Department is siding with 18 Republican states that are arguing all of the ACA is unconstitutional without its penalty for lacking coverage \u2014 the basis the Supreme Court used to uphold the law back in 2012.\n\nLast year, a federal district judge in Texas ruled the entire law is unconstitutional, including its protections for people with preexisting conditions and its expansion of coverage through federally subsidized marketplaces and Medicaid expansion. A three-judge panel for the 5th Circuit is expected to issue an opinion on the case any day \u2014 although there\u2019s no deadline for it to act, and a ruling could hypothetically be delayed until next year.\n\nAs if this case weren\u2019t already complicated enough, there are a number of decisions the appeals court could arrive at. (Check out this Health 202 for a look at the three judges on the panel.) Here are four ways the court could rule:\n\n1. The whole law is unconstitutional.\n\nThe three judges could agree with federal district judge Reed O\u2019Connor that the whole law must fall because Congress zeroed out its financial penalty for lacking health coverage as part of its 2017 tax overhaul.\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. seized upon this penalty as a reason to uphold the ACA in 2012, when he declared it a tax under Congress\u2019s broad powers to impose levies. Now that the penalty is gone, the basis of the ACA\u2019s constitutionality is also gone, so the GOP states are arguing.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, the appeals court would have to rule the rest of the ACA is not \u201cseverable\u201d (to use a legal term) from the mandate and the preexisting condition protections.\n\n2. The mandate, plus the protections for patients with preexisting conditions, are unconstitutional, but the rest of the ACA can stay.\n\nThis is the original position the Trump administration took. It\u2019s long been argued (by the Obama administration and others) that preexisting condition protections must be paired with the mandate. The idea is that requiring insurers to cover patients with expensive medical conditions only works if all consumers \u2014 including the healthy ones \u2014 are required to buy coverage.\n\nBut now there\u2019s essentially no mandate to buy coverage, so it could follow that insurers should no longer be required to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe panel could adopt this reasoning, while allowing the rest of the law to remain in effect by ruling it\u2019s severable from the mandate and the preexisting condition protections.\n\n3. Only the mandate is unconstitutional, but the rest of the ACA can stay.\n\nIf the appeals court ruled this way, it would be a big sigh of relief for Democrats and ACA advocates. Getting rid of the mandate would have little practical effect on the availability of health insurance. The mandate already lacks teeth, since Congress took the penalty away.\n\n4. The lower district court should consider the case again.\n\nThe appeals court could also kick the case back down to O\u2019Connor, who issued the initial ruling striking the whole law. But O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling was only a partial judgment, so he could feasibly revisit the case with the intention of issuing a broader ruling on the case\u2019s merits.\n\nThis outcome would be disappointing to the Democrat-led states defending the law, as it would dramatically lengthen the timeline for the lawsuit to be resolved \u2014 and put it back in the hands of a judge who has already shown a willingness to strike down the whole ACA.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nAHH: Friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) want the presidential contender to slow down after his heart attack and suggest he should speak openly about the experience when he does return to campaigning, our Post colleagues Sean Sullivan and Chelsea Janes report.\n\n\u201cThe comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders\u2019s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can \u2014 or should \u2014 maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign,\u201d they write.\n\nSanders spent Monday recovering at his home in Burlington, Vt. The campaign did not initially disclose that Sanders had a heart attack, saying at first that Sanders had two stents inserted in an artery after chest pains.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the campaign, told our colleagues he texted Sanders\u2019s wife last week to suggested this could be \u201cSanders\u2019s \u2018FDR moment,\u2019 referring to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose battle with polio is sometimes said to have contributed to his empathy for the less fortunate.\u201d\n\nThere was uncertainty following Sanders's hospitalization about the future of the campaign, but recent days he has appeared determined to move forward. The campaign introduced a new policy on curbing money in politics, and separately has used the experience to push further for Medicare-for-all.\n\nMelanie Proctor with a photo of her mother and father, Felix McDermott, whose death in 2018 at the VA medical center in Clarksburg, W.Va., has been ruled a homicide.

Within hours, the veterans\u2019 blood-sugar levels plummeted.

(Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\n\u2014 Pete Buttigieg, Democratic presidential contender and South Bend, Ind., mayor, released a plan to bring down prescription drug costs, his latest in a set of health-care proposals.\n\nThe plan, which is similar to ones advanced by other Democratic presidential candidates and legislation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), would empower the federal government to negotiate drug prices with companies based on a set of criteria, including \u201cthe benefit offered by the drug, the cost of bringing the medicine to the market, the costs of treating the disease the drug addresses, and international prices charged for similar drugs,\u201d Politico\u2019s Sarah Karlin-Smith reports. \u201cPharmaceutical companies that refuse to negotiate or don\u2019t reach an agreement with the government will pay a 65 percent tax on the company\u2019s gross sales of the drug. The tax will increase by 10 percent each quarter the company is out of compliance, until it reaches 95 percent.\u201d\n\nTo pay for the plan, a fee on branded prescription drug companies would be upped about $5 billion a year to at least $8 billion a year, indexed to inflation. And pharmaceutical companies would be penalized if they raise their prices faster than inflation.\n\n\u2014 More Republican lawmakers nationwide are making mental health part of their platforms.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers have proposed 5,372 bills that address \u201cmental health\u201d so far in 2019, which is twice the number from five years ago, according to a Post analysis using Quorum, a database of state and federal legislation, our Post colleague Tim Craig reports.\n\n\u201cThe renewed GOP focus comes as the party, which lost more than 300 state legislative seats last year, has struggled to convince voters it cares about a host of societal challenges, including mass shootings, opioid and methamphetamine abuse, homelessness and surging suicide rates,\u201d he writes.\n\nINDUSTRY RX\n\n(iStock)\n\n\u2014 Doctors are now more likely to be Democrats, after long being known to be mostly members of the Republican Party, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg report.\n\nLast year, two-thirds of political campaign contributions from physicians went to Democrats, and one-third went to Republicans, compared with 1990, when 61 percent of such contributions from physicians went to Republicans and 38 percent to Democrats, according to a WSJ analysis of Center for Responsive Politics data.\n\nIn part because a larger number of women are now doctors \u2014 who are more likely to be Democrats \u2014 and because there are fewer business-owning physicians, the group has had a shift to the left.\n\n\u201cThis phenomenon is changing where physicians choose to live and work, how they treat patients and how they influence the 2020 presidential race. It\u2019s part of a larger turn among white-collar Americans toward the Democratic Party,\u201d Janet and Paul write. \u201cDoctors are clustering in big cities where other Democrats reside, exacerbating a shortage of physicians in rural areas.
