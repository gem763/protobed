Seconds later, a handful of men open doors and seem to be trying to leave.\n\nAn official with the mostly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces says some of the men in the video are security guards seeking to contain the escape and regain control of the prisoners. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to brief the media.\n\nIt was not possible to verify the attempted escape. But chaos and the ongoing assault have raised fears that the Turkish offensive on Kurdish-held northeastern Syria may undermine the security of over two dozen facilities where 10,000 IS militants are held. There are 2,000 foreigners among them.\n\nThe Kurdish officials said Turkish shells fell near another prison facility on Friday and Wednesday in Qamishli, which is only 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the Turkish border.\n\n\u2014 By Sarah El Deeb\n\n___\n\n9:20 p.m.\n\nTurkey\u2019s president says his county \u201cwill not take a step back\u201d from its offensive against Syrian Kurdish militants it sees as a national security threat, defying serious warnings from the United States and other Western nations.\n\nSpeaking on Friday on the third day of the operation, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had given ample time to U.S. President Donald Trump to stop supporting and arming the Kurdish fighters, which form the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces fighting the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey had been threatening an offensive for months, saying it would not allow a de facto state run by the Kurdish forces, which has links to an outlawed group considered a terror organization by Turkey and the United States.\n\nErdogan said Turkey \u201cwill continue this fight\u201d until the Kurdish militants are pushed back 32 kilometers from the Turkish border.\n\nTurkey wants a safe zone to push back the fighters and resettle refugees. Erdogan has for weeks said a joint effort to establish the safe zone with the United States was not satisfactory.\n\n___\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nThe White House is putting Turkey on notice that it could face new \u201cpowerful sanctions\u201d and that the U.S. will \u201cshut down the Turkish economy\u201d if Ankara goes too far in its incursion against the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the White House on Friday the U.S. hopes it will not have to use its new, expanded sanctions authority President Donald Trump has authorized.\n\nTrump has been criticized for pulling back U.S. forces from northern Syria before Turkey\u2019s offensive into Syria against Kurdish forces it sees as terrorists. The U.S. backed the Kurdish forces that fought against Islamic State fighters and has guarded thousands in detention centers.\n\nMnuchin said it\u2019s important that Turkey not allow a \u201csingle\u201d IS fighter to escape.\n\n___\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nTurkish authorities say eight civilians have been killed in a Turkish border town following a mortar attack from Kurdish-held Syria, bringing the civilian death toll in Turkey since the beginning of its cross-border offensive to 17.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office of Mardin Province said in a statement Friday that 35 others were wounded in the border town of Nusaybin.\n\nNusaybin is across the border from Ras al-Ayn, which is part of northeastern Syria controlled by the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG. Turkey launched an offensive against the group, which it says is linked to an outlawed Kurdish insurgency at home, saying it will not allow any territorial area near its border to be run by Kurdish forces.\n\nDozens of mortar shells from YPG territory have landed in Turkey since Wednesday, when the offensive began. More than 100 people have been wounded.\n\n___\n\n7:50 p.m.\n\nThe United Nations says an estimated 100,000 people have been displaced three days into the Turkish military offensive on northeastern Syria, while markets, schools and clinics have been closed.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the U.N. said most of the displaced have stayed with relatives or in host communities, but an increasing number have sought shelter in areas to the south of the military offensive.\n\nThe U.N. says the violence has also put a water station servicing al-Hassakeh city out of commission, denying around 400,000 people of a water source. Repair has not been possible because of ongoing fighting and efforts to negotiate a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d are ongoing, the U.N. said.\n\nOnly one national hospital is still operating.\n\nThe U.N Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria expressed deep concern about the unfolding events.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry says two more soldiers have been killed in Syria, bringing the death toll to four troops in the three days since it began a military offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Friday the soldiers died following a mortar attack on a Turkish base by Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG.\n\nThe base is located near northwestern Afrin province, which was captured from the YPG in Turkey\u2019s 2018 cross-border operation.

The Kurdish Hawar News agency also reported one killed.\n\nThe attack occurred outside a popular falafel area in Qamishli, the main urban center in Kurdish-held areas. The loud explosions were followed by plumes of smoke and fires.\n\nRojava Information Center said vehicles of Kurdish fighters with munitions were parked outside the restaurant, which could explain the multiple explosions.\n\n___\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nTurkey\u2019s vice president says Turkish troops and their allied Syrian opposition forces have advanced up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) deep into Syrian territory.\n\nFuat Oktay told TRT World television in an interview aired Friday that the Turkish forces entered northeast Syria from the Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn regions.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said the estimated 1,000 troops in Syria were not in harm\u2019s way.\n\nVideo images showed five armored personnel carriers moving from the western countryside of Ein Issa in the direction of Tal Abyad on Friday.\n\nA U.S. official said the patrols never stopped but that they avoid areas that have active combat operations.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, the official said the patrols were not in support of operations by the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish forces against Turkey.\n\n\u2014 By Sarah El Deeb.\n\n___\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry says a second soldier has been killed in clashes with Syrian Kurdish fighters during the country\u2019s cross-border operation.\n\nThe ministry said in the statement the soldier was \u201cmartyred\u201d Friday.

MSF said the violence forced the vast majority of the town\u2019s residents to leave, including the medical staff and their family.\n\nMSF said its staff have relocated to provide services in other parts of the region.\n\nMSF said aid groups had to suspend or limit their operations in the crowded al-Hol camp, home to more than 70,000 women and children, as well as Ain Eissa camp.\n\n___\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run news agency says two more civilians have been killed in a mortar attack on a Turkish border town while another person died of wounds from a similar attack a day earlier.\n\nAnadolu Agency said the latest assault targeted the town of Suruc on Friday, while officials said a child in the town of Ceylanpinar died of his wounds late Thursday.
