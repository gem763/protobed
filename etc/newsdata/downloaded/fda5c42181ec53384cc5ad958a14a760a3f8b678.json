Read more\n\nA spokesman for Tusk declined to comment. Ambassadors for the EU27 will meet on Sunday morning to discuss the latest developments.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Johnson told MPs he did not believe the EU would be minded to offer a further extension and that he would not negotiate one.\n\nBut senior EU officials said it was clear during the discussions among the leaders at a summit on Thursday that \u201cthey would grant an extension\u201d. \u201cEven [the French president Emmanuel] Macron in the room didn\u2019t suggest otherwise,\u201d the source said.\n\nA consequence of the delay to the Brexit deal being approved in parliament is that the European parliament\u2019s plans to ratify the withdrawal agreement next week have also been left in doubt.\n\nThe European parliament will only ratify after the Commons has approved the deal. MEPs next sit on the 14 November, making 30 November a potential new Brexit day if the Commons is able to approve the deal by then.\n\nPlay Video 1:29 Tens of thousands march for second Brexit referendum in London \u2013 video\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the coordinator of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said his committee would \u201cconsider the outcome of today\u2019s vote for the Letwin amendment on Monday\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever happens next, the marches outside the parliament show just how important a close EU-UK future relationship is.\u201d\n\nThe Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, tweeted: \u201cThe EU & UK agreed a withdrawal agreement on Thursday that defends Ireland\u2019s interests. The Commons voted today to defer a decision on whether or not to ratify that agreement.\n\n\u201cTo date, no request for an extension has been made by the UK government. Should that happen, president Tusk will consult all 27 heads of state & govt on whether or not we will grant one. Extension can only be granted by unanimity.\u201d\n\nJean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, told the Guardian that Brussels would not \u201cwait and see\u201d but that \u201cif asked\u201d the leaders would \u201csay yes\u201d.\n\nThe Commons voted on Saturday that it would not approve the Brexit deal until all related legislation was passed. MPs were concerned that the legislation would not be passed by 31 October, leaving open the possibility of the UK accidentally crashing out.\n\nThat decision triggered the Benn act under which the prime minister was under a legal obligation to request an extension unless a deal had been approved by midnight, Brussels time, on Saturday.\n\nThe prime minister said he would not negotiate a further delay, and hinted that a request could be rejected in Brussels.\n\nOn Friday, Macron had tried to help Johnson cajole MPs into backing his deal by suggesting he was opposed to a delay. \u201cI am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay,\u201d he had said.\n\nBut EU sources said the private comments of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, better represented the leaders\u2019 position.\n\nShe had told EU leaders that a Brexit extension would be unavoidable if British MPs vote down the new deal. Merkel said leaders had a responsibility not to push the UK out without a deal.", "description": "Officials say delay would be granted beyond 31 October, but EU will not make first move", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70d7d5464605f6d983b2dfc31ba0a72fd94a8beb/655_0_4130_2478/master/4130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75185cb3356a83c7f3c831d47bc74fdb", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
