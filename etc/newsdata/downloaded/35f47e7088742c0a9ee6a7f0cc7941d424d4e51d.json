Technical analysis does not result in absolute predictions about the future, but instead, technical analysis can help investors anticipate what is \u201clikely\u201d to happen to prices over time.Technical Analysts believe that the historical performance of financial markets is an indication of future performance, and it is possible for one to develop effective trading rules using historical prices, indicators, and chart patterns.Developed by J. Welles Wilder, who is best known for his technical indicators \u2013 now considered to be core indicators in technical analysis. Here are just a few Wilder developed: The Relative Strength Index (RSI), The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX), Average True Range (ATR) and the Parabolic SAR (Parabolic stop and reverse).The parabolic SAR attempts to give traders an edge by highlighting the direction an asset is moving, as well as providing entry and exit points. Parabolic SAR refers to a price-and-time-based trading system. Wilder called this the \u201cParabolic Time/Price System.\u201d SAR stands for \u201cStop and Reverse,\u201d which is the actual indicator used in the system.In this live webinar, we shall look at the basics of this two indicator and why the \u201cmarriage\u201d between the Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reversal) and the ADX Oscillator is considered as \u201cpowerful tools\u201d to incorporate into your trading strategy for either the novice or professional trader. We shall also look at some of the drawbacks of the Parabolic SAR.The \u201cADX\u201d Average Directional Movement Index measures how strong a trend is. It is a unique indicator that shows the characteristics of a particular trend. The ADX tells us when there is a trend and also when there is no trend, so we know when to use a trend following strategy and when to use a range trading strategy.Rob is an Australian FX expert and former Westpac senior analyst with over 28 years\u2019 experience in the markets.
