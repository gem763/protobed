The new series continues the infamous webcomic, following the epilogues that creator Andrew Hussie released earlier this year.\n\nOnly a few pages have been uploaded, but we see robot mechanic and king of irony Dirk Strider in his spaceship, where he talks to seer and former-human Rosebot. The last page of the current update includes a prompt for readers to choose what Dirk should do next \u2014 following the original format of Homestuck. Hussie eventually ditched the element of reader input to avoid distracting from the comic\u2019s actual plot, but that interactivity is returning for Homestuck^2.\n\nAccording to the frequently asked questions on the website, this is \u201cactual Homestuck.\u201d The story was outlined by Andrew Hussie himself, though it\u2019s being written by a team of writers, a group that also worked on the epilogues and other spin-offs. The FAQ notes that this is a \u201cfanontinuum,\u201d meaning that it is \u201callowed to expand into spaces governed by fandom desire.\u201d\n\nThe release of Homestuck^2 on Oct. 25 coincides with a sort of \u201cHomestuck holiday;\u201d as the number 1025 holds significance in the original series. Homestuck^2 will be updated monthly, according to the FAQ, or more frequently if certain Patreon goals are met.", "description": "Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon is a sequel to Andrew Hussie\u2019s massively popular webcomic and its epilogues.", "authors": ["Julia Lee", "Owen S.
