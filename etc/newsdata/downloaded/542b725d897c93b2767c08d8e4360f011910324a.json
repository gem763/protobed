The latter is presently tasked with taking ultra-high-resolution images of the lunar surface as the probe orbits around the moon twice\n\nThe images are a boon for the mission, which was struck by disaster in early September when the spacecraft's lander, Vikram, was lost.\n\nVikram crash-landed on the lunar surface after its computer-controlled descent deviated from its intended approach.\n\nResearchers have reported being able to pin-point the location of the crash site, and are working to re-establish contact with the lander.", "description": "The\u00a0Indian Space Research Organisation's lunar probe\u00a0Chandrayaan-2's is studying the moon's topography, its chemical composition and the distribution of its minerals.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19499614-0-image-a-9_1570636119113.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
