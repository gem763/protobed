Facebook also unveiled a logo for Calibra and, well, it looks somewhat similar to the logo of Current, a startup bank. Apparently, Current agreed, so much so that it has filed a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging trademark infringement.\n\nthis is what happens when you only have 1 crayon left pic.twitter.com/2JY5JfesQD \u2014 Current (@current) June 19, 2019\n\nThe suit names four defendants: Facebook, Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary that owns IP related to Calibra, and Character, the design agency that made the Calibra logo. You might be surprised to see a design agency named in the lawsuit \u2014 but Character apparently designed both logos, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe two logos were apparently designed three years apart. Current claims that it started using its logo in August 2016, while Facebook\u2019s logo for Calibra was revealed in June of this year.\n\nAn intellectual property lawyer that CoinDesk spoke with sums up the case well:\n\n\u201cIt is suspicious that the defendant\u2019s logo came out of the same firm that created the plaintiff\u2019s logo,\u201d Howard Shire, a partner in the Intellectual Property Department of Pepper Hamilton LLP, told CoinDesk.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait for more details of the case to come to light (if they ever do) to know about exactly why the two logos are so similar. I guess there\u2019s always the chance that different teams at Character made similar logos three years apart, or that Facebook and Calibra had no idea that its logo was just like Current\u2019s. But the similarity sure does look suspicious.", "description": "This summer, Facebook\u2019s Calibra revealed a logo that looked very similar to the logo of startup bank Current.
