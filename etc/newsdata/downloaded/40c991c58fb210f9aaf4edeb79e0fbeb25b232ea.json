Other tech companies like Twitter and Google's YouTube were running the Trump ad. CNN refused to run it.\n\nThe Trump ad claims that former Vice President Joe Biden \"offered Ukraine $1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son.\" The Biden campaign said the claim should be covered by Facebook's pledge to reject political ads with \"previously debunked content.\" Trump's July phone call asking Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens is central to the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats.\n\n\"Facebook, like all publishers, has to have reasonable editorial standards,\" Goodman said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"What we're seeing here is an exercise of their editorial freedom to feature candidate ads without fact-checking and allow the political process to be the arbiter of truth and falsity in political advertising by the candidates themselves.\"\n\nThe global elections policy chief at Facebook wrote a letter to Biden's campaign, which was originally obtained by The New York Times. The letter said the social network's approach to political ads is \"grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is. ... Thus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers.\"\n\nFacebook will be \"condemned\" either way, Goodman said, even though the company \"doesn't want to be the arbiter and doesn't want to take sides in these political debates.\"\n\n\"Their stated policy, I think, is fair,\" Goodman said, adding Facebook is avoiding refereeing \"truth or falsity, opinion versus fact, candidate versus candidate debates\" by taking a hands-off approach.\n\nFacebook \u2014 which declined to comment after the letter surfaced \u2014 has worked to improve its advertising disclosures after government officials concluded Russians used the platform to influence the 2016 election. In late August, the company tightened its verification process that requires people who want to run ads to prove they are in the U.S., and to confirm their group's identity through a tax identification number or a government ID.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Lauren Feiner contributed reporting.", "description": "Facebook's \"stated policy is fair\" when it comes to political ads, says Lee Goodman, a Republican who led the FEC under Obama.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105135707-GettyImages-944827400.jpg?v=1570720442", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
