(Photo: Facebook)\n\nA bar in Sacramento, Calif. is under fire for implementing a new dress code that some say is discriminatory and unfairly targets African-Americans.\n\nBarwest, a popular bar and restaurant in the city's midtown area, recently posted a new dress code outside of their bar in which sweats, chains, grills, baggy clothes, \u201cgang colors\u201d and solid color t-shirts are banned after 10 p.m.\n\nSome critics believe that the dress code is blatantly racist, and consider it a \"Modern Day 'WHITES ONLY SIGN.'\"\n\nCharlene Bruce, a woman who was eating next door at another establishment, was shocked by the sign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out, who they\u2019re trying not to have come to their establishment,\u201d Bruce told CBS13. \u201cJust say that.\u201d\n\nSonia Lewis, a Sacramento Black Lives Matter leader, said that the sign is disappointing, as the chapter used to hold weekly meetings at Barwest, and spoke with the staff management regarding their service to people of color.\n\n\u201cHow could they be taking steps backward was my first reaction,\u201d Lewis told the station. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m not surprised. It\u2019s very much indicative of the midtown experience.\u201d\n\nAnother local woman, Jolinda Broadway, told CBS13 that she was confused by the dress code.\n\n\u201cGrills are culture-specific,\u201d Broadway said. \u201cGang colors \u2014 what does that mean? I worked in a middle school. Yellow was for one gang, brown was for another, red and blue were taken, so what does that mean?\u201d\n\nHowever, one patron at the restaurant believes it is the owner's right to implement a dress code.\n\n\u201cIf they want to keep a certain vibe and image, they have the right to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if someone wants to wear joggers, they can go somewhere else.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Barwest, as well as the establishment\u2019s owner, Trevor Shults, did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Barwest, a popular bar and restaurant in Sacramento, recently posted a new dress code, in which sweats, chains, grills, baggy clothes, and \"gang colors\" and \"solid color t-shirts\" are banned after 10 p.m.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CKfWxdpM3YKDBZmc6dc38Q--~B/aD0xMTUyO3c9MjA2MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/87df7b80-ceba-11e9-bcfe-f3a9a8f81983"}
