He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/19 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

But the president and his lawyers had hoped to use the power of his office to muzzle current and former diplomats and White House aides, arguing in presidential tweets and a lengthy letter to Democratic lawmakers on 8 October that their subpoenas are invalid and unenforceable.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump cannot permit his administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d wrote Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel.\n\nAnd yet the president has been unable to prevent it.\n\nJust since Mr Trump declared war on the impeachment effort, three current and former senior State Department officials and a former top White House aide have testified for nearly 36 total hours, delivering to lawmakers a consistent narrative of how they were effectively pushed aside by allies of the president operating outside America\u2019s usual foreign policy channels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s partly because this shadow foreign policy that the president was running was so deeply offensive to people in his own administration who took pride in overseeing a professionally run and arguably exemplary policy in support of Ukraine,\u201d said congressman Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official involved in the inquiry.\n\nReferring to the president\u2019s personal lawyer, he added: \u201cAnd then to see the official policy undermined by this clownishly corrupt effort led by Rudy Giuliani on behalf of the president was just more than many people apparently could bear.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who control the Senate view the fast-building case as serious enough to begin preparing for the trial in their chamber that would follow impeachment by the House.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, briefed fellow lawmakers over lunch Wednesday about how a trial would work, expressing his hope of conducting it speedily and completing it by the end of the year, people familiar with his remarks said.\n\nFacing accusations of secrecy from Republicans, congressman Adam B Schiff, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, informed colleagues on Wednesday that he planned to open the inquiry to the public soon.\n\nHe wrote that he planned to release transcripts of all the interviews as the investigation proceeded and pledged to soon hold public hearings \u201cso that the full Congress and the American people can hear their testimony firsthand\u201d.\n\nFor Mr Trump, who is famous for demanding fierce loyalty from those around him, the daily \u2014 or even hourly \u2014 crush of damaging headlines is an infuriating departure from previous successes in controlling disclosures to congress from people in his orbit.\n\nDuring the congressional investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling, the US president blocked a deposition of Donald F McGahn II, his former White House counsel, and dramatically limited testimony from some of his closest aides, including Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, and Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager.\n\nBut this is different. Many administration officials targeted for depositions by Democrats are diplomatic veterans who have expressed anger and frustration about what they described as the hijacking of US foreign policy. They have no particular loyalty to mr Trump nor are they subject to the same presidential powers to block them from testifying.\n\nSo they have turned up at the secure suite of the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill, disappearing behind doors with a red \u201cRESTRICTED AREA\u201d sign to tell their stories.\n\nUnder alternating hour-long question-and-answer sessions by Democratic and Republican staff lawyers, Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, said she had been ousted at Mr Trump\u2019s direction on the basis of \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d.\n\nFiona Hill, a former National Security Council aide, said John Bolton, then the national security adviser, was so alarmed by the activities of Mr Giuliani, Mr Sondland and others that he instructed her to alert White House lawyers.\n\nShe said she reported Mr Sondland to intelligence officials as a possible national security risk as well.\n\nMr McKinley told investigators on Wednesday that State Department officials were discouraging people from testifying and were not supporting diplomats who had received subpoenas and requests to appear before the House, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill expressed frustration this week about the depositions, saying White House lawyers should be present and accusing Democrats of selectively leaking from the testimony. Others were simply baffled by the cooperation of the witnesses.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said congressman Chris Stewart, a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cI can\u2019t wrap my head around why some and why not others.\u201d\n\nMr Trump\u2019s lawyers have had more success in blocking access to emails, text messages, memos and other documents in the government\u2019s possession.\n\nThe administration has rejected Democratic subpoenas or requests for documents at the Office of Management and Budget, the State Department, the Defence Department and the office of vice president Mike Pence.\n\nMr Giuliani has also said he will ignore a subpoena for his records, citing the White House\u2019s stance.\n\nDemocrats have said the refusal to hand over documents will be considered obstruction of congress and may be added to the impeachment charges brought against the president.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The White House\u2019s trenchant declaration to House impeachment investigators last week was unequivocal: no more witnesses or documents for a \u201ctotally compromised kangaroo court\u201d.
