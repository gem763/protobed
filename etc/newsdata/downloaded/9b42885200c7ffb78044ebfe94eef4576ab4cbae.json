His own mother died of breast cancer when he was 14 years old. Pictured: Botros (center) during his middle school graduation with his father (left) and mother (right)\n\nBotros told CBS Philly that his mother had battled breast cancer as long as he could remember before passing away when he was age 14.\n\n'She had cancer pretty much my whole life,' he said. 'On and off, she had beat it and it came back. Beat it and it came back.'\n\nBotros never believed he was at risk.\n\nHe said he wasn't even the first person to notice the discharge coming out of his breast, but rather his girlfriend at the time.\n\n'[She] was doing some laundry...and noticed a little blood on my T-shirt where my breast would be,' Botros wrote in a blog post for The Male Breast Cancer Coalition.\n\n'I was in the shower at the time, so when she came to tell me what she found, I checked my breast. I didn't see anything but, when I was drying off, I pushed on my chest and a little blood came out.'\n\nBotros's girlfriend wanted him to go to the ER, but he compromised and called a family friend who was a pediatrician.\n\nShe suggested he get a mammogram. The test showed nothing but the doctor who saw him ordered a biopsy, he wrote in the blog post.\n\nIn August 2012, he was diagnosed with Stage I ductal carcinoma in situ, which is a cancer found only in the milk ducts.\n\n'I thought it had to be a mistake,' Botros told CBS Philly, referring to when learned the news. '[I was] trying to put the pieces together to see how it was possible that a 26-year--old man could have breast cancer.'\n\nOne out of every eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nBreast cancer occurs in men too, but the incidence rate is less than one percent.\n\nIt is estimated that more than 2,600 men will be diagnosed with the disease in 2019, and about 500 men will die.\n\nBotros, 33 (left and right), underwent a double mastectomy and is currently cancer-free. He says he wants to break the stigma that surrounds male breast cancer, the incidence rate of which is less than one percent\n\nEarlier this year, the FDA called for more men to be included in clinical trials for breast cancer drugs. Pictured: A scan of Botros's breast\n\nRecently, Beyonc\u00e9's father, Matthew Knowles, revealed he was diagnosed with stage 1A breast cancer in July after experiencing the same bloody discharge Botros did.\n\nBreast cancer cases in men are often more advanced by the time they are diagnosed because they don't know they can get the disease.\n\nAnd when they are diagnosed, often when the men are at an older age, doctors tend to treat them similarly to women.\n\nThat's why, in August, the FDA issued a recommendation encouraging male patients to be included in breast cancer clinical trials.\n\nBotros underwent a double mastectomy, which is a surgical procedure that removes both breast, and is currently cancer-free.\n\nHe told CBS Philly that he hopes sharing his story will help remove some of the stigma that surrounds male breast cancer and to encourage other men to get tested if they feel something is wrong with one of their breasts.", "description": "Peter Botros, 33, a chef from New York City, was diagnosed with stage I breast cancer in August 2012.
