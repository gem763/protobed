Within the last few months, Facebook has faced repeated criticism from President Trump over an alleged conservative bias on its platform, a pair of federal antitrust probes and lingering concerns about its ability to prevent bad actors from influencing its platform during the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cI think that there are a number of real issues right now. And you know, earlier this year I actually I wrote an op-ed calling for four areas where I thought the Internet would benefit from the government setting some clear rules and was around, you know, what content is permitted \u2014 permissible \u2014 in elections and ads, some about content in general, privacy and data portability,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe as a company have the greatest responsibility here to make sure that we proactively make sure that there isn't harm or danger happening on our platform.\u201d\n\nAside from providing specific details about Facebook\u2019s efforts to reassure the public, Zuckerberg touched on the state of social media and the tech industry as a whole.\n\nFOX Business breaks down key moments from Perino\u2019s exclusive interview with Zuckerberg.\n\nStocks in this Article FB FACEBOOK INC. $185.85 -4.54 (-2.38%)\n\nOn whether Facebook, other tech giants should be broken up\n\nDemocratic presidential frontrunner, Elizabeth Warren, unveiled a proposal last March that would place limits on major tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet, the parent of Google. Part of her plan would require Facebook to unwind what she called \"anti-competitive\" mergers, such as its past acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nFacebook is also facing pressure from the Trump administration. Company executives confirmed last July that both the FTC and federal Justice Department had opened antitrust probes into its business practices.\n\nZuckerberg has advocated for federal regulation of the tech industry, but he told Perino that he does not believe that breaking up Facebook would solve the industry's underlying problems.\n\n\"I don't think that that's the right answer. You know, I think that there are real issues there. There are issues around protecting elections and what political discourse should be allowed. There's issues around what content should be allowed. There are privacy questions. There's [sic] also questions around, people should also be able to take their data to other apps for, you know, to facilitate innovation and competition,\" he said. \"And, you know, academic research that we can advance society that way. But I basically think each of those problems requires work on our part, but also clearer rules that I think have to come from either the government or some kind of independent self-regulatory situation.\"\n\nOn data privacy\n\nFacebook has made heavy investments to reassure the public and federal regulators about its data privacy practices in the wake of the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a British data firm improperly accessed the personal information of up to 87 million users. Under the terms of Facebook\u2019s $5 billion FTC settlement, Zuckerberg must personally certify compliance with FTC privacy guidelines on a quarterly basis or risk penalties.\n\nZuckerberg reiterated to Perino that Facebook does not sell user data, adding that the company has enacted a \u201crigorous privacy program\u201d at the FTC\u2019s behest.\n\n\u201cI understand that people have a lot of concerns about this. And in the past, we've made mistakes and we need to make sure that we can earn people's trust,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we'll do that by operating at a level of rigor and having a privacy program that sets a new standard for the industry over time.\u201d\n\nOn whether billionaires should exist\n\nWealth inequality has emerged as a major topic of debate in Democratic presidential debates, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, arguing that billionaires should not exist. Zuckerberg has a personal net worth estimated at about $70 billion.\n\n\"I don't think that in some cosmic sense that anyone deserves to have billions of dollars. There are a lot of people who do really good things and kind of help a lot of other people. And you get well compensated for that. But I mean, it's some level that's really a lot of wealth,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's not necessarily that I agree with some of the policy prescriptions that some of these folks are putting forward. I mean, some people think that, OK, well, the issue or the way to deal with this accumulation of wealth is let's just have the government take it all.\"\n\nOn conservative bias in Silicon Valley\n\nTrump is one of several conservative leaders to suggest in recent months that tech firms based in Silicon Valley \u2014 especially social media platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 are inherently biased against conservatives. The president has accused Twitter of \u201cshadow-banning\u201d conservative voices on its platform and warned in 2018 that tech giants \u201cbetter be careful\u201d about their practices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the services themselves \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen a lot of data \u2014 that suggests that there\u2019s a negative impact. In fact, a lot of conservative media does quite well on social media, not just Facebook but the others as well,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut look, I mean, California is an overwhelmingly left-leaning place. If you look at the political donations from the tech companies, 90 percent of them go towards Democrat candidates, so I understand why people would ask the question of: \u2018Are my ideas getting fair shake?'\n\n\u201cAll that I can say on this is: this is something I care deeply about,\" he added. \"I want to make sure we can be a platform for all ideas.\u201d\n\nOn whether Twitter should shut down President Trump\u2019s account\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has publicly called on Twitter to shut down President Trump's account, arguing at a debate this week that the president uses the platform to \"openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nZuckerberg pushed back on the notion that social media platforms should play a role in policing political discourse for public figures.\n\n\u201cMy belief is that \u2014 in a democracy \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news,\" he said. \"I generally believe that as a principle. People should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for. And I don\u2019t that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.\"", "description": "Facebook faces unprecedented bipartisan scrutiny ahead of the 2020 election cycle.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/Mark-Zuckerberg-Reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
