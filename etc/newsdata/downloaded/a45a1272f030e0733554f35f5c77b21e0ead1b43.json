Adding a pop of colour to your lips can elevate your entire look, taking you from casual chic to full on glamour.\n\nBut choosing the right lipstick can be tricky. From the tone of your skin and the colour of your eyes to the shade of your hair and shape of your lips, there are so many variables when deciding the perfect shade.\n\nThat's why Nude by Nature are here to help with their new Satin Liquid Lipstick. Made with 100% natural ingredients like sweet almond oil, shea butter, vitamin E and kakadu plum, the moisture enriched and non-drying formula will have your lips feeling nourished, plump and super hydrated.\n\nNude by Nature's Satin Liquid Lipstick is available in 10 highly-pigmented shades, ensuring you find the perfect fit to flatter your complexion\n\nEven better, the highly-pigmented lippy is long wearing on your lips without the use of any unnecessary chemicals or synthetics like carmine, parabens or silicone.\n\nAnd because Nude by Nature know every woman is unique with her own sense of style, they've created the new range in 10 different shades to ensure you find the perfect fit for you, and frankly, our complexions couldn't be happier about it.\n\nSo where do we even start when choosing our perfect hue? We turn to the beauty gurus, of course.\n\nCreate the perfect look for your complexion with the moisture-enriched Satin Liquid Lipstick, giving you long wearing, full coverage\n\nHere's how our favourite Aussie beauty babes are rocking the new Satin Liquid Lipstick.\n\nFOCUS ON THE OUTER EDGES\n\nEmma Chen has worked with the likes of Sammy Robinson and Elyse Knowles in her time as a makeup artist, and has amassed a huge 244,000 strong Instagram following, so we're pretty confident she knows what she's talking about.\n\nHer hot tip for nailing your lips? It's all in the edges.\n\n'Work your way from the bottom to the outer corners,' says Chen. 'Then once you've added your colour, pop a little more on [the edges]'\n\n'This helps give a little more dimension.'\n\nPlump pout: For lips that look full and luscious, focus on the outer edges of the lip to give more dimension and volume\n\nKNOW YOUR TONE\n\nIt might seem silly, but skin tone and undertone both have a huge role to play when choosing the best lip colour for you. Whether you have a warmer yellow undertone, or a cooler pink undertone, it's enormously important to know the difference.\n\nSo how do you tell? It's all in the veins on your wrist. Blue veins means you have pink undertones, whereas green veins mean more yellow undertones. And if you have both blue and green, you've got neutral undertones - lucky you!\n\nOnce you've identified the tone of your skin, you're ready to choose your colour, and with 10 shades available, the Satin Liquid Lipstick will have the right hue for you!\n\nBeauty blogger, Lisa Smith wears the Satin Liquid Lipstick in a deeper tone to compliment her fair complexion and golden locks\n\nFor olive skin tones, lipsticks in the pink, orange and red shades work best. Those with fairer skin should favour deeper colours, rather than anything too light. And darker skin tones, the deep plum is for you.\n\nUSE YOUR FINGERS\n\nThe Satin Liquid Lipstick comes with its own applicator, which Chen says 'is a dream.' However she does suggest that once you've used the applicator, perfect your look with the fingertips.\n\n'Once I've added a little bit of colour, I just like to use my finger to kind of blur out the edges,' she says. 'This helps to build up the product up a little bit.'\n\nHere's how to do it...\n\nLAYER UP\n\n'A little trick to add a little bit of dimension to the lips, you can actually layer the [Satin Liquid] Lipsticks,' using a colour that is a little lighter on top, says Chen.\n\n'Building up the product in the very centre, this is going to give the lips a little more of a three dimensional finish and make them look really plump and full'.\n\nBeauty and wellness advocate, Keira Rumble, is a fan of the natural Satin Liquid Lipstick for its moisture rich and synthetic free formula\n\nBE BOLD\n\nBeauty blogger and social media queen, Aubri Ibrag, is known for her trademark lips and her 219,000 Instagram followers regularly come to her for beauty tips and advice.\n\nWearing the Satin Liquid Lipstick, she's rocking a full pout proving that sometimes, more is more when it comes to your lip colour.\n\nExperiment, be bold and don't be afraid to go heavy on the satin finish. And because Nude by Nature contains no nasties, you can rest easy knowing you won't be ingesting any synthetic ingredients.\n\nShine factor: Aubri Ibrag layers on the Satin Liquid Lipstick for a satin matte finish effect and ultra high velveting sheen definition\n\nFrom layering your colours and using your fingertips to getting the ultra satin finish and knowing your undertones, our Aussie beauty gurus are rocking the new Satin Liquid Lipstick in so many ways. But ultimately, it all comes down to your colour choice.", "description": "SPONSORED", "authors": ["Alice Piper For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20301614-0-image-a-9_1572301121399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
