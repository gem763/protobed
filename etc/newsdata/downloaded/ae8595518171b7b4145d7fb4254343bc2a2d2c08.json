Overseas investors have sold out of Canadian stocks for five out of eight months this year. This comes as the S&P/TSX Composite Index gained more than 14 per cent, putting it among the best developed equity markets in the world.\n\nAt times of risk \u2014 macro, geopolitics or trade \u2014 investors sell assets from other areas and focus on the safety of U.S. equities\n\n\u201cAt times of risk \u2014 macro, geopolitics or trade \u2014 investors sell assets from other areas and focus on the safety of U.S. equities,\u201d said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. \u201cCanada, being a small weight in many global benchmarks, is easy to ignore and from an equity point of view is thought of as acting closer to emerging markets, given its resource exposure.\u201d\n\nIn addition to global turmoil, investors now have a minority government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to deal with.\n\nCanada has traditionally been seen as a destination for investors looking for a higher risk-reward ratio with energy and mining stocks making up almost a third of the benchmark. But the energy sector has been flailing as foreign companies pull investment from oilsands projects amid a slump in Canadian crude versus the U.S. benchmark due to pipeline bottlenecks.\n\nIncreasingly we are hearing international investors are concerned with the lack of pipelines being built and a widening pricing discount\n\n\u201cSector exposure is also a reason for a lack of foreign investment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIncreasingly we are hearing international investors are concerned with the lack of pipelines being built and a widening pricing discount.\u201d\n\nWith the loss of a majority in parliament, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party will need support from parties such as the New Democrats or the Bloc Quebecois to get legislation through. While Trans Mountain has already been approved by cabinet, both parties have previously expressed opposition to the project and oil pipelines in general.\n\n\u201cIt will be a less popular destination for international funds, for money, for investing,\u201d said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Securities Ltd. \u201cMy gut feel is we will see deficits, we will see less productive spending, less attractive environment to invest funds.\u201d\n\nA rising Canadian dollar hasn\u2019t been enough to tempt foreign investors into stocks. The loonie is the top-performing currency against the U.S. dollar among its global peers this year, rising more than 4 per cent, for those attracted to a sound economy and scorching job market.\n\nHedge funds and other large speculators increased net Canadian dollar longs to 12,961 contracts in the week ended Oct. 15, from 5,313 the previous week, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That was the highest in about a month.\n\nInflows into bonds haven\u2019t been great either. As of August, net foreign capital in the bond market stood at about US$26 billion, compared with US$40 billion last year at the same time and US$61 billion in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe are probably going to continue to see Canadian yields rise along with Treasuries on renewed optimism that global growth concerns will be alleviated,\u201d said Edward Moya, a senior market strategist at Oanda Corp. \u201cThe Canadian dollar is likely to remain supported against the greenback but probably not so much against its other major trading partners.\u201d\n\nResources MIA\n\nThe strong correlation between foreign flows and the \u201cresource-centric\u201d equity performance is waning this year and that was last seen in 2007 before the global financial crisis, according to Martin Roberge, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.\n\n\u201cWhile global economic conditions do not look as dire, growth is weak and our momentum indicators are still declining,\u201d he said in an Oct. 21 report. The firm has an underweight call on Canadian stocks and recommends getting back into the market when foreign flows near or fall into \u201ccontraction territory.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Equities on pace to record lowest overseas inflows in seven years", "authors": ["Divya Balji", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tmx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
