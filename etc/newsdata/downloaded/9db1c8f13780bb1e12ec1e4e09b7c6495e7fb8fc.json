Against the Jaguars, it was a flag by Von Miller, who reached up and struck Minshew in his neck just as he released his pass in a chaotic pocket.\n\nMiller\u2019s foul spoiled his big day in which he collected his 99th and 100th career sacks and drew several holding penalties, one of which wiped a Jaguars touchdown off the board.\n\nThe 15-yard flag on a 1-yard throw on second down gave Jacksonville a first-and-10 at its 41.\n\nFournette topped his previous career high of 181 yards on Oct. 8, 2017, at Pittsburgh, and his big run Sunday was an 81-yarder that set up Jacksonville\u2019s go-ahead score.\n\nThe Broncos finally ended their sack drought, dropping Minshew five times, but suddenly they couldn\u2019t stop the run.\n\nThe result was their first home loss in which they led by 14 or more points since Nov. 19, 2006, when they were beaten by the Chargers 35-27 after jumping out to a 24-7 lead.\n\nJacksonville hadn\u2019t had a 100-yard rusher in 22 games, the second-longest streak in the NFL behind Philadelphia\u2019s 32-game drought.\n\nThe Jaguars also recorded their first takeaway of the season despite missing star cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who was deactivated and missed a game for the first time in his four-year NFL career. He missed practice all week, first with an illness, then a back injury and finally for paternity leave.\n\nDenver led 17-6 and was driving for another score just before halftime when safety Ronnie Harrison intercepted Flacco, who airmailed a pass to Emmanuel Sanders. That set up Lambo\u2019s second field goal, cutting Jacksonville\u2019s deficit to 17-6 at the half.\n\nComing out of the break, the Jaguars employed a heavy front with 308-pounder Cedric Ogbuehi serving as an eligible receiver and extra blocker for Fournette.\n\nThe Jaguars went on a 75-yard, 16-play opening drive that ate up nearly 10\u00bd minutes, which Minshew capped with a 7-yard TD toss to running back Ryquell Armstead after slipping two potential sacks and with Derek Wolfe and Miller bearing down on him.\n\nAfter Denver went three-and-out, Fournette reeled off his 81-yard run, setting up tight end James O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s 18-yard TD grab that put the Jaguars ahead 20-17.\n\nThe Jaguars ate up another seven minutes in going 78 yards in 13 plays to push their lead to 23-17 on Lambo\u2019s 34-yarder with 2:54 left.\n\nRookie tight end Noah Fant scored his first career TD on a 25-yard catch-and-run dumpoff from Flacco, who also hit Sutton for a first-half TD.\n\nINJURIES:\n\nBroncos ILB Josey Jewell aggravated a hamstring injury in the second quarter and was done for the day.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJaguars: Visit the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.\n\nBroncos: Visit the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Leonard Fournette ran for a career-high 225 yards and Josh Lambo kicked a 33-yard field goal as time expired, sending the Jacksonville Jaguars past the winless Denver Broncos 26-24 Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/jaguars_broncos_football_12533_c0-237-5653-3532_s1770x1032.jpg?3e05a68a242dc40b15f176e9799d2eab805581ec", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
