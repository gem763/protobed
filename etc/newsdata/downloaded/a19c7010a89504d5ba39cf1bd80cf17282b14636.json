The parallels are amazing \u2013 and are part of why I decided to spend so much time analyzing 1972 and 2020 as similar patterns of conflict.\n\nThe current New York Times overt shift from smearing President Trump with Russian collusion (which collapsed) to smearing President Trump with allegations of racism were all foreshadowed by the universal elite media hostility to President Nixon a half-century ago. The lockstep hostility of the Times, The Washington Post, and the left-wing TV systems were simply proof that in President Trump they had encountered a leader bent on changing their world and confronting their values.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: TRUMP AND THE FUTURE \u2013 WHAT HISTORY TELLS US ABOUT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT\u2019S FATE\n\nWhite combines his extraordinary analysis of the New York Times-Boston Globe-Washington Post system (and the three networks they shaped) with an explanation of the mutation from what he calls \u201cthe liberal idea\u201d into \u201cthe liberal theology\u201d \u2013 and the \u201cmovement\u201d which grew out of it. (I will deal with the movement in my next column and its devastatingly destructive impact on cities in part four of this series.) This piece focuses on the adversarial news media and its impact on 1972 and on 2020.\n\nThe real opposition to Nixon was not the Democratic Party nor its nominee Senator George McGovern. In White\u2019s analysis, the real opposition to Nixon was the elite news media.\n\nThe elite news media hated Nixon more than any major politician before Trump. Despite the rise of talk radio, Twitter, Facebook, and cable news, nothing in White\u2019s core analysis has changed. He draws a sharp distinction between the lesser news media, many of which were for Nixon, and the elite media \u2013 which was monolithically, bitterly hostile to President Nixon.\n\nWhite emphasizes that it was the culture of the New York literati which defined The New York Times and the three networks. It was a generational change from reporters of facts to advocates of ideology which compounded the bitterness and hostility.\n\nHere is White\u2019s analysis:\n\n\"The power of the press in America is a primordial one. It sets the agenda of public discussion; and this sweeping political power is unrestrained by any law. It determines what people will talk and think about\u2014an authority that in other nations is reserved for tyrants, priests, parties and mandarins. No major act of the American Congress, no foreign adventure, no act of diplomacy, no great social reform can succeed in the United States unless the press prepares the public mind. And when the press seizes a great issue to thrust onto the agenda of talk, it moves action on its own\u2014the cause of the environment, the cause of civil rights, the liquidation of the war in Vietnam, and, as climax, the Watergate affair were all set on the agenda, in first instance, by the press.\u201d\n\nThe power of the left grows from the media. Since Nixon, the media has sought to attack presidents it did not deem worthy. As White explained:\n\n\u201cThese were the adversary press. Its luminaries not only questioned his exercise of power, as all great American journalists have done when examining a President. They questioned his own understanding of America; they questioned not only his actions but the quality of his mind, and his honor as a man. It was a question of who was closest in contact with the mood of the American people\u2014the President or his adversary press? Neither would yield anything of respect to the other\u2014and in Richard Nixon\u2019s first term the traditional bitterness on both sides approached paranoia.\u201d\n\nMuch like President Trump a generation later Nixon was not intimidated and did not flinch from the fight. Nixon understood that his primary adversary was the press \u2013 not his Democratic opponent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is vital to understand that the news media and its academic and Hollywood allies are the defenders and imposers of an alternative culture which hates conservatism and particularly hates effective conservatives.\n\nThe elite media had its final victory over President Nixon in the Watergate scandal, which drove him from office. The elite media tried this with President Trump in the \u201cRussian collusion\u201d lie and failed.\n\nThe Left wants to forget that when the American people weighed the values of President Nixon and the values of The New York Times, Nixon got 61 percent of the vote. The same would happen 12 years later when President Reagan won with 58 percent of the vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDo not be shocked if in the 2020 result, President Trump wins by a margin unimaginable today (no one in September 1971 or September 1983 would have predicted gigantic landslides against the Left).\n\nDo not be shocked if the elite media are proved wrong again.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "The power of the left grows from the media.
