I said 'yeah you're Mickey Rourke'.\n\n\"We had a great night, we hit it off. We then had a second night with him.\n\n\"Then the third night we were in the hotel room hungover. Got a knock on the door. I looked through and it was Mickey Rourke. Sounds like a lie by the way. It's mental.\n\n\"I said to the lads 'it's Mickey'. They said get rid.
