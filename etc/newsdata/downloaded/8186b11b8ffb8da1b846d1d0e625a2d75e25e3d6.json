REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nThe proposed new lawsuit by SK Innovation drew a swift denunciation from LG Chem, which called the action \u201cgroundless\u201d and said it would seek compensation.\n\nThe two companies have been at loggerheads since LG Chem sued SK in the United States in April for alleged theft of trade secrets by hiring former LG Chem employees. SK Innovation denied wrongdoing and the litigation is ongoing.\n\nFiring the latest round, SK Innovation said it was preparing to file lawsuits against LG Chem and LG Chem Michigan Inc through the U.S. International Trade Commission alleging patent breaches.\n\nSK Innovation declined to provide further detail, including specifics of when the case would be filed but said the action was imminent. The company said a substantial amount of LG Chem\u2019s battery products were likely to be affected and a win would prohibit LG Chem from selling those products.\n\n\u201cThese lawsuits are not relevant to LG Chem\u2019s lawsuit against us accusing misappropriation of trade secrets, but they are rightful lawsuits to protect our intellectual property,\u201d said YS Yoon, president of SK Innovation\u2019s battery business, downplaying any suggestion of a tit-for-tat move.\n\nIn reply, LG Chem said the planned lawsuit was \u201cgroundless\u201d, \u201cvery regrettable\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the competitor admits its fault, and promises to prevent the recurrence with a sincere apology, we will agree to dialogue when they are willing to seriously talk about compensation,\u201d LG Chem said in a statement.\n\nSK Innovation stock was up 6.4% at 0510 GMT. LG Chem gained 1.5%, trailing the market's .KS11 1.8% rise.\n\nGOVERNMENT INTERVENTION?\n\nThe South Korean government is nurturing the domestic EV battery sector to make the industry as big an export item for the country as memory chips and display panels.\n\nA source with direct knowledge of the matter said there was concern the lawsuits could weaken local battery makers at a time of heightened global competition. Those worries meant the government may act as mediator to secure a swift resolution, the source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nSK Innovation also said it plans to file a separate U.S. lawsuit against LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), another affiliate of LG Group, claiming unauthorized patent use in EV battery production.\n\nLG Chem makes battery cells in the U.S. state of Michigan, which LG Electronics uses to make finished batteries nearby.\n\nSK Innovation, South Korea\u2019s biggest oil refiner, is a latecomer to an EV battery market led by LG Chem and Samsung SDI Co Ltd (006400.KS) as well as Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp (6752.T). It started mass production in 2012 with customers including Germany\u2019s Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE).", "description": "A feud between two South Korean battery makers escalated on Friday as SK Innovation Co Ltd <096770.KS> said it plans to sue bigger rival LG Chem Ltd <051910.KS> in the United States over alleged patent infringement related to electric vehicles (EV).", "authors": ["Heekyong Yang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424222300&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T027"}
