This is a scam,\u201d he said at an event on trade with Japan.\n\nMr Trump and other administration officials have repeatedly rejected requests for information and testimony in the Democrats\u2019 investigations.\n\nThe state department ignored a subpoena for documents on Friday, and an attorney for two of Mr Giuliani\u2019s associates who work on the Ukraine matter, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, rebuffed another request Monday.", "description": "House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted an impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent Donald Trump\u2019s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations.The", "authors": ["Greg Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cIMTyzdPIBdFOHgxPlGLVA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a0149a4f270f9b6414bf81e819820def", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
