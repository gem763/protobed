But the electorate responded by stripping the Tories of their majority.\n\nLabour strategists are battling to find the best way of burnishing Corbyn\u2019s anti-establishment credentials, as Johnson tries to paint himself as the champion of the people against scheming MPs. They say the slogan \u201cpeople v privilege\u201d, trailed at Labour conference in Brighton, strikes a chord with voters in focus groups.\n\nRudd, who quit the government and resigned the Conservative whip earlier this month in protest at the prime minister\u2019s policies, also told the Evening Standard that she might stand in London as an \u201cindependent Conservative\u201d at the next general election.\n\nAmid bitter complaints about Johnson\u2019s use of words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d over Brexit, and his subsequent refusal to apologise, Rudd said she had been \u201cdisappointed and stunned\u201d when the PM dismissed the fears of female MPs about a possible repeat of the 2016 murder of Jo Cox.\n\nAsked about the Downing Street approach of couching Brexit as a battle between the people and a remain-minded parliament, Rudd said: \u201cThe sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.\u201d\n\nComparing Johnson\u2019s approach to that of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election, Rudd said \u201cthe casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff [was] immoral\u201d, and urged ministers to \u201cconsider their own judgments rather than be desperately loyal\u201d.\n\nRudd is not planning to attend conference; but some of the other 21 rebels who had the whip removed for voting for the Benn Act do plan to attend, including former justice secretary David Gauke.\n\nThe House of Commons voted against granting the government a three-day break so that conference could be held; but Johnson plans to press ahead, leaving one junior \u201cduty minister\u201d for each department behind in London.\n\nHe is expected to deliver his set-piece conference speech as planned on Wednesday, leaving Dominic Raab to stand in for prime minister\u2019s questions back in London.\n\nMeanwhile opposition MPs hoping to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy will spend next week working on a fresh anti no-deal action plan.\n\nIf the prime minister breaks the terms of the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for an extension to Article 50 if he can\u2019t get a Brexit deal, they want to be able to implement a plan \u201cwithin minutes\u201d.\n\nThe legislation, spearheaded by Labour MP Hilary Benn, and backed by Labour and rebel ex-Tories including former chancellor Phillip Hammond, demands that the prime minister ask Brussels for an extension to the Brexit process by 19 October if he has not brokered a new agreement.\n\nHowever, they insist they will not seek to wreck the Tory conference by attempting to take over the order paper, or table new laws and emergency debates.\n\nTimeline Boris Johnson's parliamentary defeats Show Hide In the first vote Johnson faces as prime minister, 21 rebel Tory MPs vote with the opposition to seize control of the order paper to allow a debate on a bill that would block a no-deal Brexit. Against Johnson's wishes, the Commons passes by 329 votes to 300 the second reading of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill proposed by Hilary Benn. Later the same day the Benn bill passes the third and final reading needed to become law, this time by 327 to 299 votes. Johnson responds by attempting to force an early general election. The 298 MPs who support him are short of the two-thirds majority required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, making it a third defeat in a single day for the government. Dominic Grieve's bid to force the government to release documents related to the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal planning and on the decision to prorogue parliament defeats Johnson by 311 to 302. Johnson's second call for an early general election is supported by 293 MPs, still short of the two-thirds majority required. Parliament is prorogued and MPs briefly occupy the chamber after the session is closed. The supreme court rules that Johnson's closure of parliament was unlawful and that MPs must return. In the first vote in the reconvened House of Commons, MPs vote by 306 to 289 against a three-day recess to allow Conservative MPs to attend their party conference.\n\nInstead, they are expected to pepper ministers with a host of urgent questions instead. A source close to the rebels said: \u201cNext week is all about planning scenarios for if Boris Johnson breaks the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the cross-party group meeting to work out what action could be taken in the event Johnson does break the law.\u201d\n\nThey said this could involve legislation but have also not ruled out another confidence vote in the Prime Minister, that could in theory trigger a general election.\n\nMeetings among the group of politicians working to stop no-deal, including Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, the then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington and former chancellor Philip Hammond, representatives of the Liberal Democrats and SNP took place as early as June.", "description": "Conservatives will promise to get Brexit done, launch manifesto-friendly policies and attack Corbyn", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6da22744041eb203154be163498969ab517c104/80_638_4867_2920/master/4867.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16f94614005659bddb337115260af6a4", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
