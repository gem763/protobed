The company\u2019s PNH treatment danicopan is currently in mid-stage testing, while its other drug, ACH-5228, for the same disease is set to begin mid-stage trial in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020, the companies said.", "description": "Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday agreed to buy small biotech Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc in a deal initially valued at $930 million, a move that will help the company retain its dominance in treating rare blood disorders.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
