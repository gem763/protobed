Breakout to all-time highs from bullish continuation chart patterns is the path of least resistance. Similar chart patterns can form on daily, weekly and monthly scale price charts. The underlying dynamics are the same. Though it is important to note that the shorter the time frame the higher the probability of failure. My default time frame for research is weekly scale.
