His deputy, Art Mbanefo, exited soon after. Ravi Singh left in April just four months after joining Barclays, along with David Simpson, a managing director in London also under Mbanefo. Guy Saidenberg, the head of distribution and structuring for markets, exited in May.\n\nOne source familiar with the situation told Business Insider the firm has upped the standard for making external hires.\n\nTwo other people familiar with the situation said Barclays was not replacing some employees. The bank's fixed-income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) trading business is not filling the roles of people who leave, one of the people said. Another source familiar with the matter described a holding pattern for hiring for some back-office roles in the US.\n\nThree of the five sources said the process has been viewed internally as an informal hiring freeze that has been in place for several months.\n\nBarclays is keeping a tight leash on pay, particularly for investment and corporate banking, and has set aside less so far this year for bonuses. That comes as it cuts costs to hit return targets set by CEO Jes Staley. A list of banks have been curbing hiring or cutting jobs as they ride out trade tensions, economic uncertainty, and a souring outlook for interest rates.\n\nThe UK-based bank shed 3,000 jobs company-wide in the second quarter and upped its 2019 cost-cut outlook. Meanwhile, it is navigating uncertainty around Brexit. Still, it has announced some high-profile strategic hires, including people that came on board after Throsby's exit.\n\nA Barclays spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nRead more: Headcount at the world's largest investment banks shrank by 1,500 in the first half of 2019, and equities trading took the brunt of it\n\n'Very, very selective'\n\nTo be sure, the firm continues to advertise for positions online. And it could not be determined precisely how many people have been affected by Barclays' hiring strategy, or how many divisions might be taking that approach.\n\nKristin DeClark and Taylor Wright, the coheads of Barclays' US equity-capital markets, joined the firm from Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley, respectively, according to industry records. DeClark was announced the day after Throsby's exit became public, while Wright was announced in May and came on in August.\n\nAnd Bob Peck, a veteran internet analyst, joined Barclays as the chairman of global internet banking from Credit Suisse. That move was announced before Throsby left, and Peck started in June.\n\nWhen it comes to the back-office roles, Barclays has been shifting some of its US operations and tech employees from New York to a large campus it purchased in 2017 and opened last summer in Whippany, New Jersey. According to a public filing in early July, the chief operation office and functions teams are set to move starting in mid-November.\n\nRead more: Credit Suisse has started an informal hiring freeze \u2014 and it's a sign of just how tough the Wall Street job market is these days\n\nAnalysts have pushed for clarity on hiring. When asked directly during an August call if there was a hiring freeze, Tushar Morzaria, the bank's finance director, said it has been \"very, very selective\" but that a freeze was \"probably not really the right way of doing it.\" Barclays has been \"only really hiring for roles that we really need, given the income environment,\" he said.\n\nThe bank has also been shrinking head count through \"natural forces\" by not hiring to replace, \"which has been quite a successful thing for us,\" and it will \"see where that goes\" in the second half, Morzaria also said on that call.\n\nBarclays had been deploying capital into sales, trading, and underwriting, but by a September 2018 call, Morzaria said: \"We are by and large done with that. We're happy with the level of capital allocated.\"\n\nRead more: A management overhaul at Barclays is rocking employees. Here's what we know about what's going on inside the British investment bank.\n\nManaging-director departures\n\nThere have been a number of high-profile departures from Barclays recently, including five investment bankers from the Americas financial-institutions group (FIG), Business Insider reported in August.\n\nThe group had no plans to replace those departing FIG bankers, though a person with knowledge of the group's plans said at the time that promotions and recent hires may mean it ends 2019 with the same number of managing directors. Sources had said a shrinking bonus pool prompted some of those moves. Through the first half, Barclays cut money set aside for bonuses by 23% from the year prior.\n\nBarclays announced it hired Dan Zimbaldi from Evercore in June as a managing director in FIG mergers and acquisitions, and he starts in September.\n\nSeparately, the New York-based investment-banking managing director Aiden Hallett left in July after getting promoted just months earlier. The bank named 85 new managing directors in late 2018 \u2014 promotions became effective at the beginning of this year.\n\nBarclays has started culling its global-markets team, which spans credit, distribution, equities, and macro, Business Insider and other media outlets reported in May. The bank said it had 85,000 employees globally at the end of 2018.\n\nRead more: Barclays has lost a quintet of FIG bankers over the past month \u2014 and it shows how Jes Staley's bonus cuts may be affecting morale\n\nStriving for a return target\n\nBarclays wants to hit above a 9% return on tangible common equity this year and 10% in 2020, but analysts had noted their own predictions didn't line up. The activist investor Edward Bramson has meanwhile been pressuring the bank to pare back investment banking, though in May failed to nab a board seat.\n\nHiring across Wall Street is typically more common in the first half, though that has changed somewhat in recent years thanks to rising competition and the tightest US labor market in half a century.\n\nIndustry head count across investment banking, equities trading, and FICC continued to fall in the first half of 2019 while revenue slumped, Coalition data tracking the world's biggest banks showed on Thursday.\n\nThe Barclays hiring shift comes as the broader industry grapples with trade tensions and global economic uncertainty, and technology that has reduced demand for higher-touch trading. And banks have added pressure on what they can make from lending after the Federal Reserve started cutting already historically low US interest rates in August.\n\nDeutsche Bank is slashing 18,000 jobs and exiting businesses such as equities trading. Barclays remains \"committed\" to US and European equities, Staley said on a second-quarter earnings call, and picked up some $20 billion in prime-brokerage assets reported to come from Deutsche Bank.\n\nCredit Suisse has an informal hiring freeze in place across parts of its sales, trading, and research unit, Business Insider reported in August. Citigroup is laying off hundreds across equity and fixed-income trading, according to reports in July.\n\nBarclays' shares have fallen 56% in five years while a large banking-sector exchange-traded fund has risen 22%.\n\nRead more: A top Citigroup executive is departing as the bank winds down a secretive $1 billion business amid competition from private equity", "description": "Barclays raised the bar for external hires, and it isn't filling vacancies in what some insiders call an ongoing informal freeze for some divisions.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ungarino", "Dakin Campbell", "Trista Kelley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6fd2222e22af36634059c3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
