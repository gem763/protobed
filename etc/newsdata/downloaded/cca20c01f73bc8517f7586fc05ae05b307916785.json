The bottom line comes in 11% higher than the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\n\n\nResults were driven by improvement in revenues and growth in deposit balances. Also, capital ratios were impressive. However, higher non-interest expenses, along with rise in provision for loan losses, acted as major headwinds. Perhaps, due to these concerns the investors are skeptical about the company\u2019s future performance. Thus, following the earnings release, the stock has declined 4.3%.\n\n\n\nAfter taking into consideration non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $381 million, increasing 2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\n\n\nRevenues Improve, Expenses Rise\n\n\n\nTotal net revenues came in at $1.60 billion, up 6% year over year. Further, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.\n\n\n\nTotal non-interest expenses flared up 4% year over year to $838 million. The upside stemmed from an increase in all components of expenses except insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses.\n\n\n\nCredit Quality: Mixed Bag\n\n\n\nNon-performing loans of $929 million as of Sep 30, 2019 were down 3% from the prior-year quarter end.\n\n\n\nHowever, provision for loan losses increased 13% year over year to $263 million. The rise was mainly due to higher net charge-offs and asset growth.\n\n\n\nStrong Balance Sheet, Capital Ratios Improve\n\n\n\nTotal net finance receivables and loans amounted to $127.33 billion as of Sep 30, 2019, decreasing marginally from the previous quarter. Deposits totaled $119.23 billion, increasing 2.5% sequentially.\n\n\n\nAs of Sep 30, 2019, total capital ratio was 12.8%, improving 12.7% from the prior-year quarter end. Tier I capital ratio was 11.2% as of Sep 30, 2019, up from 11.1% as of Sep 30, 2018.\n\n\n\nShare Repurchases\n\n\n\nDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $300 million.\n\n\n\nOur Take\n\n\n\nSteady growth in revenues and deposits, along with decent loan demand, will support Ally Financial\u2019s profitability. Moreover, steady capital-deployment actions reflect strong balance sheet position. Nevertheless, persistently flaring up expenses and rise in provisions (as witnessed during the quarter) remain major near-term concerns.\n\n\n\nAlly Financial Inc.
