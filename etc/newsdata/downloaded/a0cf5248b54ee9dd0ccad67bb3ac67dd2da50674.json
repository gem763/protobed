Alice Pawley, a professor of engineering education, argued that installing a Chick-fil-A, which she called a \u201csymbol of discrimination,\u201d on campus would create a hostile environment for LGBT students.\n\n\u201cI think inviting vendors to do business on our campus, to make their business from our students, staff and faculty when their values are counter to ours is undercutting our own commitment to our values,\u201d she said. \u201cI can speak to how I think about having on campus a symbol of discrimination against LGBTQ people will affect Purdue\u2019s ability to provide a campus environment where our LGBTQ students can learn fairly compared to their straight peers, as I think it does.\u201d\n\nJohn Gates, Purdue\u2019s vice provost for diversity and inclusion, argued that excluding Chick-fil-A from campus on the basis of the corporation\u2019s relationship with Christianity would be a violation of the university\u2019s diversity principles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a foundational piece for the university,\u201d Gates said in a comment. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept discrimination from anyone on any level. \u2026 Whether we agree with everybody or not, if we\u2019re going to be true an inclusive framework, we can leave nobody behind. So, conservatives and liberals both are included, and people in between. Straight and gay, it doesn\u2019t matter. We are one university, and it\u2019s one university of all people. That actually includes Chick-fil-A.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Faculty members at Purdue University have continued their push against the installation of a Chick-fil-A location on campus despite the administration's firm rejection of their demands in September.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Chick-fil-A-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
