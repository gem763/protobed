'David Marshall's been the No 1 since I came into the job.\n\n'Obviously something might happen to David over the next few months, so you need to have another goalkeeper who has had some minutes on the pitch.\n\nScotland face playing in front of the lowest ever crowd for a competitive match at Hampden\n\n'I want Jon to have the experience of playing for the national team at Hampden. It's important to take that chance.'\n\nSan Marino, themselves thumped 9-0 by Belgium in midweek, are the lowest of FIFA's 210 ranked national teams, yet Clarke is wary of underestimating the team rooted to the bottom of Group I.\n\n'I definitely don't treat San Marino lightly,' he added. 'We're not in a position where we can treat anybody lightly. We're in a position where we have to win a game of football. Sometimes it's hard to win any game of football.\n\n'Yes, it would be nice to be able to give one or two a cap, but I have to look and decide which is the best team to get a result.\n\n'Don't forget, the other night Liam Palmer got his second cap, Mikey Devlin got his first cap, John Fleck got his first cap.'", "description": "As of Saturday afternoon, the Scottish FA was reporting ticket sales of just over 10,000 - a figure that includes those who took up season-ticket packages at the start of the campaign.", "authors": ["Graeme Croser For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19634934-0-image-a-3_1570910441243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
