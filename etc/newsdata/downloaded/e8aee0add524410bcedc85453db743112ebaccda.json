It was challenged in federal court, but a federal appeals court eventually upheld the ban. Chicago banned foie gras in 2006, but the ordinance was repealed two years later.\n\nOther animal-friendly bills are also expected to be approved at Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the New York City council, including a bill prohibiting carriage horses, who work hauling tourists around Central Park, from working in temperatures above 90F (32C), and a ban on the sale, capture or possession of pigeons in the city.", "description": "City council members expected to pass bill which would impose $1,000 fine and up to one year behind bars for selling delicacy", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/435dca6af4b0814f5bb588381dacd31688f4f44d/0_235_5418_3252/master/5418.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae0eaaa561c58e3a9e5b01cc1c82386c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
