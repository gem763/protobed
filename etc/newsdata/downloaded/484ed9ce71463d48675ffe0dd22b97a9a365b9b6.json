He added the Longhorns' final points, sprinting through a huge hole in the middle of the field for a 23-yard TD with 3:03 to play.\n\nFrom there, the Longhorns' defense took charge, intercepting three Austin Kendall passes in the second half, two of them by D'Shawn Jamison in spectacular fashion.\n\nKendall had a 44-yard touchdown pass to Sam James on the game's first possession and ran 1-yard for another score early into the second quarter.\n\nTexas added to its lead in the fourth quarter with a 13-yard scoring run by Devin Duvernay and a lateral to Samuel Cosmi, the Longhorns' All-America left tackle, who rumbled 12 yards for a touchdown in a play for those in the trenches.\n\nRoschon Johnson, the Longhorns' backup-quarterback-turned-running back, racked up a career-high 121 yards on 21 carries in the win. Duvernay hauled in six passes for 86 yards to lead the Longhorns in receiving.\n\nWVU's Evan Staley kicked a 29-yard field goal for the only scoring in the third quarter after missing two attempts in the second quarter, from 36 and 47 yards out.\n\nKendall, who passed for 367 yards and four interceptions, also hit T.J. Simmons for a 19-yard TD and Bryce Wheaton for a 12-yard score in the final minutes, but it was too little, too late.\n\nThe Mountaineers outgained Texas 463-427 but was doomed by its four turnovers. The Longhorns scored 21 of their points after Kendall's interceptions.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Sam Ehlinger passed for 211 yards and two touchdowns and ran for two  additional scores as No. 11 Texas rolled past West Virginia, 42-31, on  Saturday in Big...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
