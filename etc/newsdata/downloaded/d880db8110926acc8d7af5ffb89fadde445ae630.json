Just yesterday we were discussing the case of the Fairfax County, Virginia police officer who was suspended from his duties for detaining an illegal alien at a traffic stop. At the scene of an automobile accident, the cop discovered the driver didn\u2019t have a valid driver\u2019s license. Upon running his name through the DMV, he learned that the driver was an illegal alien with a warrant for failing to appear at a deportation hearing. He notified the ICE agent assigned to the case, who arrived and took the illegal immigrant into custody.\n\nFor this, he was suspended from his law enforcement duties. But the resulting outcry from around the country was apparently more heat than the police chief who suspended him wanted to handle. Only a day later, the cop has been returned to full duty. (Washington Times)\n\nStung by a public outcry, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. announced Wednesday that he had canceled the suspension and restored to duty an officer who had turned an illegal immigrant over to ICE. Chief Roessler said an investigation is still ongoing but he ended the officer\u2019s suspension after a \u201cprocedural policy recommendation\u201d as of Friday. \u201cWe have one of the best police forces in the U.S. and I have confidence that our officer will represent us well throughout his career,\u201d the chief said in a statement.\n\nThe report cites \u201coffers of assistance and support for the officer\u201d that poured in from around the country. While the police chief didn\u2019t mention it, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that their email inbox was filling up quickly and their phone lines were busy. Perhaps that was what it took to help the Chief see the light.\n\nBut this move doesn\u2019t really solve anything, at least as I see it. Chief Roessler isn\u2019t apologizing for what he did, nor is he suggesting a change in policy. At most, all he\u2019s really doing is \u201cforgiving\u201d the officer for his sins and letting him go back to work, confident that he will \u201crepresent us well throughout his career.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019ve already publicly shamed the guy and turned him into a target for the woke brigade. After the \u201cimmigrant-rights activists\u201d went out to publicly praise Chief Roessler for his \u201cbold\u201d decision to suspend the officer for doing his job, they will now no doubt turn their collective anger on the cop and retract all the nice things they said about the Chief. In the end, the Chief comes out looking indecisive and vulnerable to public pressure and bad press reports.\n\nThere are no winners in this story and there won\u2019t be until Virginia and Fairfax County go back to upholding the rule of law. But they clearly have no plans to do so at present, so we can expect to see more of these sorry episodes in the future.", "description": "That was fast", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ICE.jpg"}
