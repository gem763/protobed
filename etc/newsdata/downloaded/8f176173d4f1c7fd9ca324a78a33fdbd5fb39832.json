The least expensive version of the phone starts at $699 \u2013 6.7 percent below last year\u2019s iPhone XR.\n\nApple received some trade war relief when the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said the tariffs that were set to hit $300 billion worth of goods made in China \u2013 including the iPhone \u2013 would be delayed from Sept. 1 to Dec. 15. That will give holiday shoppers some time to buy the phone before the tariffs are raised from 10 percent to 15 percent.\n\n\u201cDespite all the perceived black clouds from being the poster child of the current US/China trade tensions, Apple is seeing a very strong iPhone 11 demand trajectory and defying many skeptics that have been yelling fire in a crowded theater over the past few months,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nApple is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Oct. 30.
