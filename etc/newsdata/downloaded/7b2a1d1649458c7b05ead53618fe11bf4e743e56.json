The first film had a much stronger domestic showing, opening to nearly $70 million domestically in 2014, and the sequel was expected to earn more stateside. Although\n\n\"It's not as strong as we hoped domestically, but it's a good start for October and we have a great window leading into Halloween,\" said Cathleen Taff, Disney's president of theatrical distribution. \"Most encouraging is the fact that audiences seem to be responding very positively.\"\n\nThe A CinemaScore \u2014 in contrast to the mixed critical reviews \u2014 suggests that the film could have a longer life at the box office.\n\nAlthough it fell to second place after two weekends at the top, Warner Bros.' \"Joker\" continues to hold strong at the box office. It added $29.2 million in its third weekend in North America. The villain origin story has grossed over $247 million domestically. Worldwide, it's earned $737.5 million, and has already surpassed the lifetime grosses of \"Justice League\" and \"Suicide Squad.\"\n\nNow the big question is whether the R-rated film will make it to $1 billion, but with a $55 million production budget, it's already a massive hit for the studio and will likely also become director Todd Phillips' highest-grossing film too.\n\n\"It's already in territory that nobody thought it would get to. It's achieved a box office that is above the wildest expectations of the studio and analysts,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst. \"Even if the box office stopped right now it's an absolute, unqualified success.\"\n\nThird place went to another new sequel, Columbia Pictures' \"Zombieland: Double Tap\" with $26.7 million. The R-rated comedy comes 10 years after the original, reuniting Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson with director Ruben Fleischer.\n\n\"Three films earning over $25 million, that doesn't happen very often,\" Dergarabedian noted, although the weekend is down from last year when \"Halloween\" opened to over $76 million.\n\nIn notable landmarks, \"Hustlers\" crossed $100 million domestically this weekend. It's the second STX film to do so this year after \"The Upside.\"\n\nAnd buzzy, awards-friendly indies are continuing to thrive. \"Parasite,\" which opened last weekend, added $1.2 million. This weekend, Taika Waititi's Nazi satire \"Jojo Rabbit\" opened in five theaters with a strong $350,000, the black and white Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe mindbender \"The Lighthouse\" earned $419,764 from eight theaters, and \"Jay & Silent Bob Reboot\" grossed $93,520 from one screen this weekend.\n\nBut the year is still down 5% from last year.\n\n\"It was a great weekend for sequels and great weekend for indie movies,\" Dergarabedian said. \"But we're still struggling to get ahead of last year. We're racing to the finish line here. We've only got 11 weekends left to go.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
