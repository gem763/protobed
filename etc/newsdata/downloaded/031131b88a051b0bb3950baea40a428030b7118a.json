They deny wrongdoing.\n\nThe trial is expected to last five months. The defence will later present its case.\n\nBarclays paid Qatar 322 million pounds in fees that were not disclosed in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined payments and commissions paid to investors as incentives for their support.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that the defendants breached well-established banking practice, under which all investors should be paid equally, and disguised these fees as \u201cbogus\u201d advisory services agreements (ASAs).\n\nBrown said Barclays\u2019 lawyers wanted evidence of services to justify the fees the bank was paying Qatar \u2014 and he alleged the defendants and Lucas had made \u201cafter the event\u201d attempts to demonstrate some services had been provided.\n\nBut he added: \u201cThese did not come close to justifying the huge amounts paid over to the Qataris and, you may well conclude, were nothing more than a smoke-screen to seek to legitimise what had gone before.\u201d\n\nQatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested about 4 billion pounds in Barclays over 2008.\n\nBut that June, the Qataris demanded more than double what the bank had agreed to pay other investors and the defendants, knowing Barclays needed to strengthen its balance sheet in volatile markets, wrestled with how to pay them, Brown said.\n\nBoath laid bare the pressure the bank was under.\n\n\u201cIf he (Sheikh Hamad) doesn\u2019t come through with his money, we\u2019re fucked,\u201d Boath was quoted as saying on June 11, 2008, according to Brown.\n\nJenkins, the former chairman of the bank\u2019s Middle East investment banking arm, Kalaris, who led the bank\u2019s wealth division and Boath, a former European head of corporate finance, are charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over the first fundraising in June 2008.\n\nJenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising that October.", "description": "Former Barclays finance director Chris Lucas would have been criminally charged over two emergency fundraisings launched by the bank at the height of the financial crisis if he were not too ill to stand trial, a London fraud trial heard on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Kirstin Ridley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
