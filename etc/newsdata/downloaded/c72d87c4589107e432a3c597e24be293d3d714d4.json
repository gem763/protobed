After weeks in which Donald Trump and his allies tried to maintain the fiction that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between the White House and Ukraine, Taylor laid the truth bare.\n\nAs we discussed yesterday, Taylor\u2019s testimony, supported by extensive and contemporaneous notes, exposed the American president\u2019s direct involvement in an explicit scheme to leverage both military aid and a White House meeting as part of a plan to coerce Ukraine into participating in Trump\u2019s domestic scheme.\n\nEven a member of Senate Republican leadership conceded that the emerging picture \u201cis not a good one\u201d for Donald Trump.\n\nOther GOP senators may have drawn a similar conclusion, but Politico reported yesterday that \u201ca surprising number of Republicans said they were unfamiliar with even the gist of Taylor\u2019s testimony.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Bill Taylor from Adam. I know you better than I know Bill Taylor. I\u2019ve been busy\u2026 doing important things, not participating in a sham process over in the House,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cThe drip drip drip of leaked testimony is producing daily news stories like you\u2019re asking me about it. It\u2019s part of their plan and scheme and I do not approve.\u201d Cornyn was not alone. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who has rapped the president for pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, said he will \u201ceventually\u201d get around to reading about Taylor\u2019s testimony but hasn\u2019t yet.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch (R-Idaho), who presumably should have some interest in the subject matter, said he\u2019s neither seen nor read Taylor\u2019s opening statement. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) added that he hasn\u2019t yet read it, either.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that each of these GOP senators are fibbing. Maybe they\u2019re aware of what the career diplomat said, and they realize that if they concede to having familiarized themselves with Taylor\u2019s remarks, they\u2019ll be in the awkward position of having to either condemn or defend Trump\u2019s misconduct.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that many Senate Republicans are just incurious \u2013 again.\n\nAs regular readers know, this dynamic comes up more often than it should. Four years ago, as Republicans railed against the international nuclear agreement with Iran, some in the party conceded they hadn\u2019t read the policy they were condemning. The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank noted at the time, \u201cThis is legislating by reflex \u2013 a mass knee-jerk by the Republican majority in Congress. Those who howled \u2018read the bill\u2019 during the health-care debate couldn\u2019t be bothered to read the nuclear agreement before sounding off.\u201d\n\nOnce the Trump era began, the problem intensified. Republicans didn\u2019t read their own health care plan. They also didn\u2019t read their own tax plan.\n\nMore recently, an unnerving number of Republicans conceded they hadn\u2019t read the Mueller report \u2013 including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose job arguably entails reading documents like these.\n\nLast month, many GOP lawmakers said they hadn\u2019t read the complaint from the intelligence community\u2019s whistleblower, either.\n\nIs it unreasonable to wonder whether Capitol Hill would function better if more Republicans simply sat down and read more?", "description": "Is it unreasonable to wonder whether Capitol Hill would function better if more Republicans simply sat down and read more?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_wh_deadline_taylor_191022_1920x1080.jpg?itok=5DmH4QPV", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
