If anyone has any evidence of unethical journalism - including the very serious breach of accepting funds for journalism - we encourage them to go to the Press Council.\"\n\n'Independent inquiry'\n\nIt said that Section 2 of the Code dealt with \"Independence and Conflicts of Interest\" and states that the media shall:\n\n- Not allow commercial, political, personal or other non-professional considerations to influence reporting, and avoid conflicts of interest as well as practices that could lead readers to doubt the media's independence and professionalism;\n\n- Not accept any benefit which may influence coverage;\n\n- Indicate clearly when an outside organisation has contributed to the cost of newsgathering; and\n\n- Keep editorial material clearly distinct from advertising and sponsored events.\n\n\"Further, we have launched our own independent Inquiry into Media Credibility and Ethics, chaired by retired Judge Kathleen Satchwell. We encourage any South African with evidence of journalists acting unethically or illegally to approach Judge Satchwell and the authorities, including the Zondo Commission,\" the statement reads.\n\nREAD | 'My vehicle was settled by close family friend,' says Munusamy, who intends to cross-examine witnesses at Zondo commission\n\nSubmissions should be sent to panel@mediainquiry.co.za.\n\n\"In terms of Munusamy, we again welcome the decision by Tiso Blackstar to grant her special leave.
