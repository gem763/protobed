The company on Sept. 19 outlined its own plan that will pay $17.9 billion for wildfire claims and caps payouts to victims at $8.4 billion and to insurers at $8.5 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, the company reached an $11 billion settlement to resolve most claims by insurance carriers related to the wildfires.\n\nAt the time of its Chapter 11 filing in January, PG&E projected it could face more than $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires, including last year's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of California's modern history.\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Christian Schmollinger)", "description": "A group of PG&E Corp noteholders said in a court filing on Wednesday that they are ready to invest $29.2 billion into the power producer as part of a reorganization plan that will pay off liabilities from wildfires that drove it to bankruptcy.
