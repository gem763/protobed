It shows that while Trump sought a Ukrainian probe into the Biden family, he did not explicitly connect the aid to that effort.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER DID NOT DISCLOSE CONTACT WITH SCHIFF'S COMMITTEE TO INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOURCES SAY\n\nHe later added, \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\" The word \"though\" has prompted Democrats to claim the validity of the initial whistleblower complaint that accused Trump of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"\n\nSources told Fox News on Friday that the intelligence community whistleblower who alleged misconduct at the White House over the July call did not disclose contact with Schiff\u2019s staff to the intelligence committee inspector general (ICIG).\n\nTrump tweeted Thursday that he had an \"absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate or have investigated corruption, and that would include asking or suggesting other countries to help us out!\"\n\nUKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID\n\n\"The whistleblower, who had the facts wrong about the phone call, reached out, and more, to the Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee,\" the president tweeted Friday morning, noting that Schiff \"never told us about this.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe president has taken swings at Schiff, calling for him to resign and tweeting a video Friday after The Washington Post gave Schiff \u201cFour Pinocchios,\" saying he hadn't told the truth about his knowledge of the whistleblower.\n\nTrump has said the whistleblower complaint and impeachment inquiry are nothing but a \"Democrat scam.\"\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas and Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "description": "A second U.S. intelligence official is\u00a0considering filing a formal\u00a0whistleblower complaint about President Trump's dealings with the government of Ukraine, according to a report.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/48834335842_76af06e94f_k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
