(Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nThis is an excerpt from episode 172 of The Editors podcast.\n\nRich: Without further ado, let\u2019s get into the week\u2019s news. Jim Geraghty, the news that dominated this week was the testimony from acting Ukrainian ambassador William Taylor behind closed doors, although we\u2019ve seen his 15-page opening statement, which, if you\u2019re into these sort of things, is gripping reading. Seems more detailed and credible than the opening statements of Kurt Volker and then Sondland, whose first name, I must confess, I don\u2019t know, the EU ambassador, both of whom were okay for Trump, and this was not. It strongly suggests that there was a quid pro quo, at least the intention of a quid pro quo, a lot of maneuvering around a quid pro quo, and an irregular Ukrainian policy channel that was running outside of the normal channels, where everyone thought pressuring the Ukrainians on these investigations was not a very good idea. What did you make of it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim: It was pretty darn bad, Rich, from the administration\u2019s perspective. Bill Taylor is clearly a guy who, the suspicion is, takes copious notes after every single conversation, who clearly was intent upon establishing a paper trail. He clearly had doubts when he stepped into the position. He had been a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine \u201906 to \u201909, so he knew the region, well-respected, knew what he was getting into, and had to be talked into taking the job by Mike Pompeo. Apparently, Mrs. Taylor thought this was a terrible idea. Life lesson, always listen to your wife.\n\nBecause it sounds like once he got there, he found that there were two channels between the Ukrainian government and the U.S. government, one through the official channels and then this second one through Giuliani. Now, a lot of people were . . . There was a huge brouhaha over this around the middle of the week. I think what jumped out to me and just struck me as the most mind-boggling aspect, and one of the reasons . . . an aspect that should be fairly easy to either confirm or deny or conflict pretty easily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, Taylor describes, and this is I guess technically secondhand, but that there was sufficient concern amongst Secretary of Defense Esper, Secretary of State Pompeo, CIA director Gina Haspel, and National Security Advisor John Bolton. All four of them felt that this was a serious problem about withholding aim to Ukraine, that they opposed it, they didn\u2019t understand the reasoning behind it, but that none of them could get a meeting with the president. If those four people can\u2019t get a meeting with the president . . . What is he, hiding? This is a matter . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, if you\u2019re president of the United States, and all four of those people think you\u2019re making a mistake, at minimum, you should listen to them. You should think about \u201cOkay, these are all people I picked. These are all people I entrusted with these duties. All of them are telling me this is a terrible decision and I shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I think, at very least, you got to hear them out. If you really disagree with them, they either have the option of resigning or you can fire them, but you can\u2019t just totally ignore them, or apparently just be too busy to meet with these four positions. It\u2019s baffling. Also, we know from precedent things like Tenet used to go into the morning briefing with President George W. Bush all the time. You can\u2019t quite understand why these people would have such a hard time having a meeting with the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t check out, then Taylor has actually done the cause of impeachment some damage, and it means that his account of things is exaggerated or the worst possible spin is put on it and stuff like that. But if it checks out, you can\u2019t have a president who\u2019s hiding from four of his top advisors on national security and refuses to meet with them. That\u2019s just too dysfunctional to go forward, and you\u2019ve got to end it. You can\u2019t deal with a president who simply won\u2019t meet when his top advisors say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re about to make a terrible mistake here, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRich: MBD, there\u2019s a direct contradiction here between Taylor and Sondland. I guess Sondland is trying to reposition what he said, but Sondland is like, \u201cOh, this is all above board. There was no quid pro quo. We\u2019re just pressuring them on corruption.\u201d Then you have Taylor basically saying, \u201cNo, Sondland was the guy, a major player who was doing it. I had these conversations with him. Sondland might say the president says there\u2019s not a quid pro quo, but they\u2019ve got to do these things to get the money. There\u2019s not a quid pro quo, but the president is a businessman. He wants you to provide the deliverables before he signs the check.\u201d It seems to me before all is said and done on this impeachment process in the House, you\u2019ve got to have these guys, Taylor and Sondland, at a witness table together hashing this out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael: Yeah. I found Taylor\u2019s testimony pretty compelling. I thought the really troubling thing was that . . . I always thought from the beginning that the nature of the conversation was quid pro quo, that this is just the nature of foreign relations when you are a patron state like the United States and you\u2019re dealing with a client state like Ukraine. When the patron starts asking for things and you are dependent on them, you have to think that the strings are going to be pulled if you don\u2019t deliver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was troubling was Taylor was describing that, in a sense, the administration just wanted the announcement of investigations. They just wanted the PR rather than the reality. That really drains the case out of those who say, \u201cOkay, maybe there was quid pro quo here, but the U.S. has a legitimate interest in the corruption,\u201d the Luke Thompson argument that I was open to.\n\nRich: Hi, Luke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael: Taylor sort of pulls me . . . The testimony pulls me away from it because it looks like, if Taylor\u2019s testimony checks out, this is just what he wanted. He wanted the announcement. In effect, he wanted the political effect.\n\nRich: Is that the case, or is it when a foreign government or a politician here in the United States has actually committed to something publicly, then they\u2019re more committed to it than if they\u2019re saying, \u201cYes, yes,\u201d in private?\n\nMichael: Of course, but it just . . . The policymaking hash that was laid out and described just did not seem inconsistent with any notion of statesmanship or even, really, political savvy. It was very blunt, very direct, very ham-handed. The fact that it also goes along with this weird . . . As you look deeper, I think a lot of people glossed over the CrowdStrike elements. I know that didn\u2019t feature as tightly in Taylor. But when you start scratching the surface of that, it\u2019s like this was a conspiracy theory that the president and Giuliani were chasing-\n\nRich: It\u2019s bonkers.\n\nMichael: . . . themselves into a rabbit hole here. Yeah, I think Taylor\u2019s good reputation and the events he described, for me, the takeaway was I felt Democrats are now . . . Yuval Levin has written about this on our website, that once you get the process going towards impeachment inquiry, there\u2019s a momentum that gathers, and I saw a lot of momentum there. It will be very difficult, I think, for Democrats to put that out in public, a very easy story of abuse of power for personal political benefit, I think it\u2019s going to be very hard for them not to impeach him.\n\nRich: Charlie Cooke?\n\nCharlie: Well, the question now is whether this is impeachable and not whether it happened. The question is not whether there was a quid pro quo. The question is not whether there was inappropriate behavior or wrongdoing. The question is whether the Congress wants to impeach the president, whether it\u2019s a good idea to do so as we enter an election year, whether the public thinks this is sufficiently serious to warrant removal, whether the Democrats can keep the momentum up, whether Republicans think that there\u2019s a double standard here, that we know of wrongdoing by other presidents that didn\u2019t lead to impeachment or to removal.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an argument that nothing happened. Alan Dershowitz, this morning, argues that this is not an impeachable offense. Others have argued persuasively that it is. That question is, of course, an entirely political one, but the case that we are talking about a nothing or that this is a witch hunt or that this is peripheral, marginal, simply cannot be made now, in my view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will watch as it plays out. We will watch as Republicans such as Matt Gaetz get more and more ridiculous in their antics. We will watch as the language that was deployed by Democrats in defense of Bill Clinton is picked up by Republicans. Whether there\u2019ll be an impeachment, I don\u2019t know. I suspect not. But there is certainly\u2014\n\nRich: You mean a removal?\n\nCharlie: No, I mean an impeachment.\n\nRich: You don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get impeached by the House?\n\nCharlie: I think he probably will. I think there\u2019s a chance still that he won\u2019t. Depends how quickly they can do it. If they can move quickly, he will be. If it drags out for whatever reason \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine why it would \u2014 if it does, I think the chances of the House pursuing it long into an election year are less. But let\u2019s not pretend that we\u2019re not now talking about an actual scandal and an actual subject for impeachment.\n\nMichael: Hey, Charlie, President Zelensky is a consenting adult. I don\u2019t know what language will be used by Republicans picked up from the 1990s. I think the question you raise, though, is\u2014\n\nCharlie: They used lynching, and we had this whole silly debate about this.\n\nMichael: That\u2019s true.\n\nCharlie: It turns out, of course, that that word was used over and over and over again in 1998, including by Joe Biden. That\u2019s how this goes. We live in a partisan nation. Congress is far more likely to vote along ideological or partisan lines than it is to protect its prerogatives, and so there is an interest for the party that shares the president\u2019s label to cast any attempts to investigate his behavior as the Salem witch trials. It\u2019s going to be funny watching Republicans adopt the same language Democrats did, and Democrats adopt the same language Republicans did, and Adam Schiff become Ken Starr.\n\nMichael: My question for you, though, is do you think that there\u2019s so much public fatigue with Democrats and the Russia collusion story and so on that, in a sense, the Democrats have already spent too much of their credibility to carry this off without damaging themselves?\n\nCharlie: I don\u2019t know. I would\u2019ve thought that more likely before I saw the polling. The reality is this could go both ways, couldn\u2019t it? You could have the voters, after an initial spasm of excitement, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing about this from day one, from before Trump was even president. Enough. Let\u2019s have the election next year.\u201d Or the Russia scandal \u2014 or non-scandal as it turned out \u2014 could serve as a backdrop that makes it seem to those who don\u2019t pay close attention as if Trump has got worse and worse, has been embroiled in scandal since day one, and that it\u2019s about time there was an impeachment drive.\n\nI don\u2019t know which one is more likely. I do know that Democrats will have to move quickly if they\u2019re going to get this done, because I think the closer we get to Election Day, the less useful a process impeachment looks and the stronger the argument, whether it\u2019s made in good or bad faith, that they\u2019re trying to preempt a vote.\n\nRich: Jim, I think sadly, from my point of view, it looks like Pelosi judged this whole thing very shrewdly, because for a couple years, or since the election at least, the midterms, she\u2019s like, \u201cNope, we\u2019re not doing it. Nope, that\u2019s not what this is about. No, we\u2019re not doing it.\u201d Then she sees the window opening here on Ukraine, says, \u201cYeah, actually, we are doing it.\u201d\n\nThe polling so far has showed a window did open. It\u2019s not just Democrats who have swung in favor of impeachment, the ones that were still holdouts. You\u2019ve seen the numbers swinging in some polls among independents a little bit, among Republicans in some polls as well. There\u2019s no downside that\u2019s evident at the moment. Maybe we\u2019ll see that down the road, but I\u2019ve begun to think actually the equities have switched here.\n\nTrump, who\u2019s not being served well in this chapter of his presidency . . . The facts haven\u2019t gotten better the way they did in the Russia probe, even though the media was hysterical throughout the duration. They\u2019ve gotten worse, probably will continue to get worse. And his reaction has been pretty terrible. The human scum thing was disgraceful. The only way he\u2019s going to turn the page on this is to get impeached and, almost certainly, acquitted by the Senate. When that happens, then, two weeks later, we\u2019ll be like, \u201cWhoa, impeachment happened? Wow, I can\u2019t even remember that. Seems like it was a decade ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhereas for Democrats, there\u2019s no downside evident, again, at the moment. It\u2019s a plus 50 percent issue in some polls. It\u2019s more popular than probably some of the other things they would want to do, and they\u2019re getting this drip, drip of revelations that are helpful for them. I take Charlie\u2019s point. You don\u2019t want to push it into April 2020. But I don\u2019t see a major downside if it slides into the new year, which it looks, by the way, whatever they ideally want to do, it looks like it probably will.\n\nJim: Yeah. I was going to say, in normal circumstances, if you were going to get impeached, nobody likes getting impeached, nobody wants . . . Trump, I guess, famously said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want that on your resume.\u201d You\u2019d want it done as quickly as possible, get it into the rear-view mirror, and let it just become a chapter in the book of your presidency and not something . . . I actually think the longer this drags on, the better it is for Trump for the 2020 election.\n\nI think, also, probably the strongest argument Republicans have right now is: \u201cWe\u2019re so close to the 2020 general election. Why would you want to do this? Why would you want to take away . . . Why would you try to have a Senate decision on whether Trump should continue as president right before the American public gets to have its say on whether Trump should continue as president?\u201d I can think of easily four or five Democratic senators who would be saying, \u201cYes, let\u2019s get this done as quickly as possible.\u201d Their names are Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and all these people who\u2019d much rather spend January in Iowa and New Hampshire than stuck in Washington listening to hearings all day.\n\nIn terms of the merits, it\u2019s very tough to say, A, this is no big deal, this is private matters, this is normal. None of this stuff is going to fly. I think you see it in the poll numbers.\n\nThe other thing was that, from the very beginning of the Russia stuff, I\u2019ve counted myself on the skeptical side of it because I just figured at some point you\u2019d have to have either audio tape or written messages or emails, something indicating Trump and Putin cackling together. That would just be . . . The idea that the Russian government and FSB, the successor to the KGB, would manage to get their claws into an American presidential candidate and turn him into the Manchurian candidate, and that all of this would escape the attention of the NSA, all of this would escape the attention of the CIA, FBI, all of our vast intelligence-gathering apparatuses would completely miss all of this, just never passed the smell test. I\u2019m pretty sure we have a lot of people who try to keep an eye on what Vladimir Putin is doing on a day-to-day basis.\n\nIn this case, all the information is from the American side. We\u2019re getting some stuff from Ukraine, but the issue isn\u2019t really how Ukraine responded. In fact, Ukraine seems to have done something semi-honorable by saying, \u201cLook, we want to play ball here, but we\u2019re not going to claim that somebody is under investigation when they\u2019re not. And we\u2019re not going to investigate someone if there isn\u2019t real evidence of a crime here.\u201d I wrote that long timeline saying Hunter Biden stinks to high heaven, and it\u2019s probably very unethical, at the very minimum, a giant, glaring appearance of conflict of interest, but there\u2019s no evidence a crime was committed either here in the United States or over in Ukraine. You don\u2019t get to say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s dig into this guy,\u201d just for the sake of placating the American president.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty darn bad. I suppose the longer this drags on, eventually the exhaustion factor could start playing in the president\u2019s advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRich: Well, Michael, I think the\u2014\n\nCharlie: Even then, Jim\u2014\n\nRich: Go ahead, Charlie.\n\nCharlie: Even then, Republicans have a rhetorical problem because they\u2019ll have to make one of two arguments. The first is \u201cWe\u2019re too close to an election. Let\u2019s judge the president at the polls.\u201d The second is \u201cThis is bad, but it\u2019s not an impeachable offense. It\u2019s the sort of judgment call which the president should be held accountable for by voters.\u201d Then they\u2019ll have to stand next to him in their home state and say, \u201cWe need to reelect President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy for Republicans to push this away by acknowledging there\u2019s something there and pointing at November of next year as the obvious end point . . . until they are asked to campaign for him, which they\u2019re going to have to do. There is a problem here for Republicans in the long run because there\u2019s no escaping it, unless they take the view \u201cLook, the whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is made up,\u201d but that\u2019s now an untenable position.\n\nJim: The only other thing I\u2019d throw in there is that under a normal presidency, you could say, \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s do a resolution of censure. Let\u2019s all go on record expressing our disapproval. Bad, president, bad. Don\u2019t do that again,\u201d slap him on the wrist, and everybody moves on and there\u2019s no risk of his presidency coming to a premature end. Then when you get asked about it on the trail, \u201cLook, I expressed my disapproval of the president. He shouldn\u2019t have done it, but now it\u2019s time to focus on the real issues,\u201d blah blah blah blah blah.\n\nBut you can\u2019t do that with this president. Trump would then take the name of any Republican who voted on that resolution of censure and probably campaign for the Democrat against them. He doesn\u2019t take any of this stuff lying down, or relaxed or laid back about any of this. He really boxes them in. He gives them very limited options.\n\nRich: Michael, one, on the question of whether he should be impeached and removed or whether this is a best matter to be adjudicated in an election, I think that\u2019s the strongest ground for the president and for Republicans to argue. There was a Marist poll the other day; I think it had support for the impeachment inquiry above 50. But far down in the questions they asked, they asked, \u201cDo you want him to be impeached, or do you prefer that there be an election?\u201d and like 57-38, people wanted the election. I think that\u2019s the strongest ground.\n\nTo Jim\u2019s point, contrition is such a powerful force when properly mustered in our politics, and clearly the play here, and a lot of Trump people might say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s too conventional. He\u2019s never going to do it,\u201d certainly never going to do it is true, but I think the obvious play would\u2019ve been to say, \u201cYeah, I see how this looks now. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I really think Hunter Biden is corrupt. I let that take too much control over my actions, and I was pressuring them. I realize how it looks. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. And by the way, here are all the facts right here in one day,\u201d go to it, and you wouldn\u2019t have the drip, drip now. And you\u2019d have, as Jim points out, Republicans be able to say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s put it behind us. He said he\u2019s regretted it. We think it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Instead, they\u2019ve been dragged into this position where everyone has to say the letter is perfect.\n\nAs you were saying, the letter wasn\u2019t perfect. You were saying there was implicit quid pro quo there all along. But they\u2019ve also made quid pro quo the trip wire, which wasn\u2019t necessary. It seems to me the best defense is not impeach and remove twelve months from an election, and ultimately release the money. This was a terrible process, shouldn\u2019t have happened, but end of the day, no harm, no foul.\n\nMichael: They could try it. I think there\u2019s probably growing resentment among elected Republicans that they laid out this \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d trip wire and then were immediately pushed backward over their heels over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to remember the base of the Republican party was still with Nixon when elected Republicans abandoned Nixon. I\u2019d be careful about . . . The elected officials, how they respond to this still matters if they really tire of him. It could matter to the president ahead of the time that we see a big collapse in support in his polling. I think there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s still uncertain here about how people will react, and also just how Trump is going to react if he feels cornered and politically abandoned.\n\nRich: Just seems to me if Trump were removed by the Senate, it would split the party asunder. It would hand whoever the Democratic nominee is the election. I wrote this in a column today. Republicans haven\u2019t won the popular vote in a presidential election since 1988. How are they possibly going to win with any significant division? Trump obviously is not\u2014\n\nCharlie: They won in 2004.\n\nRich: What\u2019s that? Once, yeah.\n\nCharlie: They won the popular vote in 2004.\n\nRich: Yeah, once since 1988.\n\nMichael: Did they win a majority?\n\nRich: If I said never, I misspoke. Yeah, once since 1988. So how are they possibly going to win an election when they have any significant division? Anyway, we should move on.\n\nRich: Exit question to you, Jim Geraghty. William Taylor\u2019s testimony will be remembered as an inflection point in the impeachment drama, yes or no?\n\nJim: You mean the written testimony or if he does it before the cameras in some future hearing?\n\nRich: I should say his opening statement that we\u2019ve seen.\n\nJim: Okay. I think the televised . . . When he does it on camera, it\u2019ll be a bigger deal.\n\nRich: MBD? Inflection point, yes or no?\n\nMichael: No, I think this is still all downstream of the transcript release, the own goal.\n\nRich: Charlie Cooke?\n\nCharlie: I think it\u2019s an inflection point, yes, because it represents the moment at which it became impossible to insist that nothing had happened here and that there was no grounds for an impeachment drive.\n\nRich: I agree with Charlie. I think it\u2019s a minor inflection point. I take MBD and Jim\u2019s points there will be bigger things to come, just from Taylor alone, the rest of the deposition, and I think which has to be public testimony. I think Democrats would want that. He will likely be one of their star witnesses. But it is, at least, a minor inflection point in that it knocked the \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d argument back on its heels.", "description": "This is an excerpt from episode 172 of National Review's \"The Editors\"\u00a0podcast.", "authors": ["Nr Staff", "Ilya Shapiro", "Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
