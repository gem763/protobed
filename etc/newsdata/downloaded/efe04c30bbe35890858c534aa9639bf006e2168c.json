The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.2%.\n\nMSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.1% on the day.\n\nEarlier in Asia, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.66%. Chinese shares fell 1.07%, while Hong Kong shares slumped 1.18%.\n\nU.S. stocks futures were flat to slightly lower, indicating subdued open on Wall Street later.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international benchmark, fell 0.1% to $68.96 per barrel on Tuesday.

Tension between the two countries was already running high over Iran\u2019s suspected ambitions to assemble nuclear weapons.
