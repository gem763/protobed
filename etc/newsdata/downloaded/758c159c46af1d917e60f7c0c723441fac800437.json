USA TODAY\n\nParody: Our company is gearing up for the Battle of Instagram. I must wake early to arm our pro-Trump troops with dangerously witty hashtags.\n\nWay back in September of 2019, President Donald Trump declared a new Civil War in America over accusations he had pressured the Ukrainian president to supply him with damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Constitutional scholars have debated whether a president can declare war via Twitter and whether it counts if he spells it \u201cSivil Wore.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, a letter from one of the troops fighting for the president\u2019s forces has been unearthed and is now housed at the Biggest, Perfect, Most Beautiful Museum Ever (known in 2019 as the Smithsonian Institution).\n\nDearest Melanie:\n\nI hope this WhatsApp message finds you safely. I am stationed here at the front lines of the Civil War, which began late in September after being declared by President Donald Trump via Twitter. As we would all soon find out, deadnaming people via tweet would be enough to get you thrown off Twitter, but presidents declaring civil wars seemed to be well within the site\u2019s terms of service.\n\nRed baseball hat? You're on my side.\n\nI hope you have not lost too much sleep while I have been away. Morale is good, as General Giuliani has kept things light with his winning, ebullient personality. He has convinced us all that we are fighting the most valuable battle since the last Civil War \u2014 clearly the eradication of owning human beings as slaves is morally on par with people saying mean things about President Trump.\n\nHowever, like you, I am a bit perplexed as to how this particular Civil War is supposed to be won. In 1860, the adversaries were identifiable by geographic region \u2014 the North battled the South by marching and firing cannonballs at the rebels. In the Great War of 2019, where Trump loyalists mingle comfortably among the despised \u201cNeverTrumpers,\u201d the battle fronts are \u2026 literally everywhere. It is safe to assume that anyone not wearing an ill-fitting red baseball hat is suspect.\n\nPresident Donald Trump salutes at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 20, 2019.

Just yesterday, when a cuck corporal defamed our great president by suggesting Republicans would have lost their minds if President Barack O-Bummer had solicited foreign help to destroy a political opponent, I tweeted him a crippling \u201cOrange Man Bad\u201d meme. After my 12 followers see it, he will certainly never be heard from again!\n\nChalk one up for my body count when they start handing out postwar medals!\n\nChick-fil-As seized, provisions low\n\nFurther, I have been reassured by Commanders Diamond and Silk that we are winning the intelligence war on the ground. Our greatest minds have been sent to hipster coffee shops to surreptitiously overhear what liberal caffeine enthusiasts might be saying about troop movements and strategies. Word is they are very adept at trying to trick people into filing sexual harassment lawsuits against the hated liberal leaders, which will surely mark their downfall!\n\nI am sad to report, however, that provisions are running low. Leftist freedom fighters have seized all of the Chick-fil-A franchises, leaving conservative warriors all suffering from a waffle fry deficiency.\n\nCountermeasures were taken soon thereafter when a MAGA soldier disguised himself in an Elizabeth Warren for President T-shirt, stood outside a Starbucks and yelled, \u201cI found a high school picture of Mike Pence in blackface!\u201d When the coffee shop patrons sprinted outside to see the nonexistent photo, Pepe Team 6 swooped in and commandeered the shop, seizing all of the unsold Alanis Morissette CDs prominently displayed by the register.\n\nYet no victory was as satisfying as the Battle of Yale, where a single Trump supporter walked on campus wearing a mildly provocative Halloween costume, leaving dozens of students dead. Who knew the \u201cfree speech is violence\u201d people were right all along?\n\nGearing up for the Battle of Instagram\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I have actually just received an emergency message from President Trump\u2019s most brilliant strategic mind, Admiral Stephen Miller, telling me he needs my IMMEDIATE assistance. I stand ready to serve in this war to defend our truth-telling president, and will do ANYTHING to see him rightfully exonerated \u2014 even by checking the \u201c$25 DONATION\u201d box as the letter asks me to do.\n\nI must say, Melanie, that I miss your smell. I crave the touch of your skin. I can only assume it is coincidence that I have not gotten to experience either since I told you 18 months ago that I voted for Donald Trump. I can promise you that those three days we dated were the most eventful of my life, and I yearn to feel your embrace once again while I sweetly whisper to you about how Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server is clearly to blame for all this anti-Trump hate.\n\nI must go now, as our company is gearing up for the Battle of Instagram. I have to get some sleep so I can be up early arming our troops with dangerously witty hashtags.\n\nYours always,\n\nPrivate Jeff\n\nP.S. \u2014 I have some suggestions about who should play me in the inevitable Ken Burns miniseries.\n\nChristian Schneider, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a reporter with The College Fix and author of the book \u201c1916: The Blog.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @Schneider_CM\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
