An August 2011 earthquake left cracks in the stones near the top of the obelisk. It reopened in 2014, but Park Service officials were forced to close it again two years later after a series of elevator malfunctions.\n\n\u201cIt was two or three times a week,\u201d Litterst said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t guarantee that you wouldn\u2019t get stuck.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the monument began in 1848 and took nearly 40 years to complete. The private organization that was running the project ran out of funding and construction was halted in 1854 at around 150 feet; that delay was exacerbated by the Civil War.\n\nConstruction resumed in 1879, but builders were forced to use stone from a different quarry \u2014 giving the obelisk its distinctive two-tone color.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the time of its completion, it was the tallest building in the world, but was soon overtaken by the Eiffel Tower in 1889.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "After a three-year closure, the Washington Monument is reopening to the public.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
