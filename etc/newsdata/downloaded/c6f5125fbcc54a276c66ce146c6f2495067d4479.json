Police said hitting the mosque was an accident.\n\nAs the protesters fled, frontliners stayed behind to slow the advance of riot police, setting fire to makeshift barricades. Clashes went on deep into the night.\n\nA Xiaomi and a Best Mart store \u2013 both mainland Chinese businesses \u2013 were set alight.\n\nTensions were running high after the leader of the group organising the weekend rally, Jimmy Sham, was hospitalised after being attacked by unknown assailants wielding hammers earlier in the week.\n\nLate on Saturday, a man handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed in the neck and stomach, reportedly by an assailant who shouted pro-Beijing slogans.\n\nMany on Sunday\u2019s march said they wanted to show they were unbowed by the attacks and moves by authorities to ban public gatherings.\n\n\u201cThe more they suppress, the more we resist,\u201d said a 69-year-old demonstrator, who gave her surname as Yeung. \u201cCan police arrest us all, tens of thousands of people?\u201d\n\nPhilip Tsoi, a self-described frontline protester, said they needed to keep getting numbers out even though many hardcore activists like him had been \u201carrested or wounded\u201d in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat I want is a truly democratic government whose leader is elected by Hong Kong people instead of selected by a Communist regime,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police fire teargas at the protesters on Nathan Road during the demonstration in Hong Kong on Sunday.
