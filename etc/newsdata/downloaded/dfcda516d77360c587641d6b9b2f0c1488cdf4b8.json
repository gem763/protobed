Nine\n\nMr Calabria's comments came as Alinta chief executive Jeff Dimery and Energy Security Board chairman Kerry Schott downplayed the likely impact of the revised legislation that has won in-principle support from Labor, while taking aim at Snowy 2.0 and policy uncertainty for depressing investment in urgently needed on-demand generation.\n\nThe Origin chief executive said that while there had been \"some improvements\" in the legislation, he was worried that such \"interventionist\" policies and the risk of unintended consequences would make energy neither more affordable nor more reliable.\n\n\"We didn't think some of those changes were necessary in order to achieve some of the outcomes but we are now at a point where the government is committed to it and if it comes in we will work within that, but I am not sure it's going to achieve the particular aims overall that we are seeking, which is more affordable energy,\" Mr Calabria said after the company's annual general meeting.\n\nLabor swung its support behind the legislation this week after it was amended to give the Federal Court, not the treasurer of the day, the power to decide whether a company should have its assets forcibly divested upon a recommendation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.", "description": "CEOs of Origin Energy and Alinta, plus energy czar Kerry Schott, warned the government's big stick regulation won't fix high prices and will depress much needed investment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_68/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2a7e91a75d6bb020c6a7a5beb618315de702ea7f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
