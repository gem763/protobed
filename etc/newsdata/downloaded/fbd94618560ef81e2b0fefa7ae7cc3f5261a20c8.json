The Amazon has the ability to absorb more than 20% of the earth\u2019s carbon dioxide.\n\nThe proliferation of fires in the Amazon rainforest drew international attention in August, especially when French President Emmanuel Macron called for urgent action.\n\nSince then, the eyes of the world have shifted elsewhere as House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, Hurricane Dorian leveled large swaths of the Bahamas, a Brexit deal was left for dead and revived, and U.S. troops pulled out of northern Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, the Amazon continued to burn.\n\nThe number of fires decreased by 35% in September, but experts say this is merely a slowdown in a crisis with global repercussions.\n\nThere were still 19,925 fire outbreaks in September on the Brazilian part of the rainforest, which accounts for nearly 65% of the Amazon basin. Moreover, through the first nine months of the year, the number of fires soared by 41% compared to the same period in 2018, Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported.\n\nOpinion: I've seen the Amazon rainforest fires. They're a warning from the Ghost of Climate Future.\n\n\u201cThe factors that led to such widespread fires in the first place \u2013 decreased enforcement of forest law, illegal deforestation for agriculture and invasion of indigenous territories \u2013 remain in place,\u2019\u2019 said Nigel Sizer, chief program officer for the advocacy organization Rainforest Alliance. \u201cIt is good news that there are fewer fires in the Amazon right now, but this is a short-term respite from the larger problem.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat problem centers on deforestation through the systematic chopping down of trees, which are either logged or burned, mostly to convert the land for raising cattle and growing crops. The practice has expanded from a small scale to an industrial production, leading to about 20% of the Brazilian Amazon being cleared since 1970.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest continues to burn, threatening the habitat of the millions of species found there and putting one of the world\u2019s most important carbon sinks at risk. So far this year, there have been more than 80,000 fires in the Amazon, the largest rainforest on Earth. Well over 4 million acres \u2014 roughly the [\u2026] (Photo: Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images)\n\nDeforestation had diminished for nearly a decade as a result of enhanced law enforcement, an increase in protected areas and environmental activism, but the trend in Brazil has reversed course. There has already been more deforestation in 2019 \u2013 upwards of 8,000 square kilometers, according to INPE \u2013 than at any point since 2008.\n\nBurning: Why is Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest engulfed in flames?\n\nThe Amazon still generates the rain that sustains it, but the removal of trees prompts precipitation to decline and, combined with warmer temperatures that make the ground dryer, may trigger parts of the forest to start dying off.\n\nScientists have warned that the world\u2019s largest rainforest \u2013 whose ability to absorb more than 20% of earth\u2019s carbon dioxide and release oxygen is a critical element of the fight against climate change \u2013 may be approaching a tipping point in which much of it turns to savanna. At that stage, it could start contributing to global warming by emitting instead of sucking in greenhouse gases.\n\nStudents Federation of India activists participate in the protest against the Amazon rainforest wildfires and the Bolsonaro environmental policies, near the Brazilian Embassy in Kolkata, India on August 27, 2019. (Photo: Piyal Adhikary, EPA-EFE)\n\nHigher rainfall totals than usual since the beginning of September and measures taken under mounting pressure by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who deployed the military to the Amazon and imposed a two-month ban on clearing land through fires \u2013 contributed to the burning decline.\n\nBolsonaro argued in August that the fires were merely part of the yearly queimada, the farmers\u2019 practice of burning old vegetation to prepare the land for the next planting. However, aerial photos demonstrated the fires were linked to deforestation.\n\nObservers expect them to resume, pointing out it took an international outcry for Bolsonaro to intervene. The far-right politician came into power in January with the expressed intent of boosting the economy any way possible.\n\n'Trump of the Tropics': 'Five things you should know about the Brazilian president's visit with Trump\n\n\u201cThere was an explicit message that started during the campaign and has carried through to the present day that the Amazon was open for business,\u2019\u2019 said Emilio Bruna, professor of tropical ecology at the University of Florida. \u201cThe government was looking to promote mining and ranching in the Amazon.\u2019\u2019\n\nThose efforts have included putting a stop to new demarcations of indigenous territory, which would make that land available for commercial purposes. Indigenous reserves make up about 25 percent of the Brazilian Amazon, acting as a de facto environmental protection.\n\nBruna said attempts at taking away land rights held by indigenous communities have involved intimidation and acts of violence. He and Sizer fear that without constant vigilance and pressure from the international community, the assault on the Amazon will continue.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see next year is more deforestation and more fires,\u2019\u2019 Bruna said, \u201cand continued government policies, either through omission or direct action, to promote deforestation and create a culture of impunity for those who do deforest or take other kinds of actions that are detrimental for the Amazon.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/18/amazon-rainforest-still-burning-more-fires-future/4011238002/", "description": "The number of Amazon fires has decreased since they elicited an international outcry in August, but experts believe this is just a temporary respite.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
