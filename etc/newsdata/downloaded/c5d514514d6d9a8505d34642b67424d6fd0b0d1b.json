Ms. Powell said the government wasn\u2019t meeting its obligations to provide information and evidence that could exonerate her client.\n\n\u201cThere never would have been a plea to begin with if the government had met its Brady obligation,\u201d Ms. Powell said, referring to a disclosure requirement named for the 1963 Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland.\n\nMs. Powell said the government possesses evidence that would have exonerated Mr. Flynn, though much of it was unrelated to the central facts at issue in Mr. Flynn\u2019s guilty plea.\n\nIn her arguments before Judge Sullivan, Ms. Powell\u2014a strident legal commentator and longtime critic of the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller \u2014echoed many allegations by Mr. Trump and his allies, including that investigators were biased and that Mr. Flynn was the victim of a hostile FBI. The government disputed Ms. Powell\u2019s account and says it has provided everything it is obligated to.\n\nMr. Flynn was an early cooperating witness in the Mueller probe, which concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 election was \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d but didn\u2019t identify evidence of coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign. The former U.S. Army lieutenant general sat for more than a dozen interviews with investigators and provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the special counsel team, according to prosecutors who later recommended Mr. Flynn receive a lenient sentence, including the possibility of no jail time.\n\n\u201cHis early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation,\u201d prosecutors said in a brief last year about his sentencing.\n\nBut in court on Tuesday, prosecutors hinted that deal may now be in jeopardy. When Judge Sullivan asked Justice Department official Brandon Van Grack if the government still stood by its recommendation that Mr. Flynn get no jail time, he declined to answer, saying that it would address the issue in a future court filing.\n\nThe relationship between the government and its star cooperating witness began to unravel earlier this year when Mr. Flynn fired his longtime lawyers at the firm Covington & Burling and retained Ms. Powell.\n\nProsecutors had planned to call Mr. Flynn in the trial of a business associate that began in July. But at the last minute, they decided not to use him as a witness and suggested in court filings they didn\u2019t believe he would tell the truth on the witness stand.\n\nSince then, Ms. Powell has questioned the circumstances surrounding Mr. Flynn\u2019s guilty plea and asked the judge to sanction the government for \u201cmalevolent conduct\u201d in its investigation of him.\n\nShe has stopped short of asking the judge for permission to withdraw Mr. Flynn\u2019s guilty plea.\n\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "description": "Former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s legal team accused the government of withholding evidence, and prosecutors hinted they might depart from their recommendation that he get no jail time.", "authors": ["Byron Tau", "Byron.Tau Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105781/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
