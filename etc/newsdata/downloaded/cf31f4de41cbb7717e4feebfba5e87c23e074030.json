He was struck in particular by a statue of General J.E.B. Stuart and its evocation of Lost Cause ideology, which holds that the Confederate states were the noble targets of Northern aggression.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a black man walking those streets,\u201d he said at the unveiling on Friday, recalling his visit to Richmond. \u201cI\u2019m looking up at those things that give me a sense of dread and fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cwe say yes to something that looks like us. We say yes to inclusivity. We say yes to broader notions of what it means to be an American.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, after white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 protesting the planned removal of a Robert E. Lee statue there \u2014 ignited a deadly melee that sent shock waves throughout the country, Mr. Wiley redoubled his commitment to what became \u201cRumors of War.\u201d", "description": "The sculpture, of an African-American man in streetwear and mounted on a horse, was unveiled Friday and will eventually move to Richmond, Va., home to a number of Confederate memorials.", "authors": ["Reggie Ugwu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/27kehinde-promo/27kehinde-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
