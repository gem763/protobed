It\u00b4s so sad that people would see something negative in it because I can give you my word, as a head coach I would not allow anything like that in the team.\"\n\nThe Springboks were once an iconic symbol of white South Africa and the integration of players from other races since the end of Apartheid and first democratic elections 25 years ago has been a long and often politically-charged process.\n\nIt has been a difficult week for the Boks off the field as the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) confirmed they would open a case against lock Eben Etzebeth over allegations he physically and racially abused a patron in a bar in late August.\n\nEtzebeth has vehemently denied any wrong-doing, but is likely to have to defend himself against the charges in South Africa\u00b4s Equality Court, which hears civil cases, when he returns from the World Cup.\n\nIt has divided opinion in the nation as to whether Etzebeth should be in Japan at all, and stoked conversation about racism as South Africa struggles to reconcile with its Apartheid past.\n\nErasmus, who played 36 times for the Springboks around the turn of the century, said this was one of the most tight-knit South Africa teams he had been involved in.\n\n\"I have been part of a lot of Springbok teams and this is one where there are not a lot of egos,\" he said. \"We have picked the best guys in South Africa and there are so many different cultures and languages.\n\n\"I think this team is representing the country with a lot of pride and we are really united. No-one can points fingers at this team.\" (Reporting By Nick Said Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "description": "By Nick SaidKOBE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus says his Springbok team have never been more united and dismissed claims of racism...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
