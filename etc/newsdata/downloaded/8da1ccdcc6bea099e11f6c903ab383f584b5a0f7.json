Show Hide At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment. The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.\n\nWTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.\n\nSome no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.\n\nThe director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has told Prospect magazine that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d. Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy. Martin Belam\n\nCalla and Romero are Spanish passport-holders who have worked in the UK since 2012 and 2013 respectively. Both have UK residency rights through EU citizenship. Marshall is a UK national who works as a bicycle courier and recently won a European court of justice case on holiday rights.\n\nMarshall, the chair of the IWGB\u2019s couriers and logistics branch, said: \u201cWithout the EU charter of fundamental rights and the European court it would have been impossible for my colleagues and I to bring the landmark \u00a31m holiday pay claim against our employer, The Doctors Laboratory.\n\n\u201cCrashing out with a no-deal Brexit could put the case at risk and couriers like myself would never see the thousands of pounds they are owed by the company. But more importantly, it would mean that other so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019 workers would not be able to rely on EU law to defend their rights to paid holidays and protection from discrimination among other things.\u201d\n\nA no-deal departure would have \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d for UK workers and the three IWGB members in particular, lawyers for all three claimants said in their letter. \u201cIn the absence of any undertaking by [Johnson] that he will comply with his statutory obligations\u201d, the lawyers will seek a declaration and mandatory order.\n\nJohnson\u2019s formal undertaking through government lawyers in the Scottish courts last week promising to seek an extension came despite contradictory comments made outside court in which he has repeatedly implied that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal. The IWGB received a similar written response from Downing Street formally pledging that he would seek an extension.\n\nDr Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the IWGB, said: \u201cFor years we have been trying to get the government to force companies to obey the law. How can we expect that if the government itself doesn\u2019t obey the law? The rule of law is crucial for low-paid workers.\u201d\n\nLiberty, which has been raising money through the CrowdJustice fundraising website for its claim, said it was launching the action not because it was a Brexit issue but because it opposed the prime minister\u2019s threats to break the law.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson has said he will ignore this act of parliament,\u201d Liberty said. \u201cThis will set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. This is not a Brexit issue. No one is above the law \u2013 and if the prime minister breaks it, we\u2019ll see him in court.\n\n\u201cThere is much confusion about whether the government will comply with its obligations under the Benn act,\u201d it said. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s lawyers have told us it will obey the law, but Boris Johnson himself has contradicted that claim.\u201d No date has yet been set for any court hearing.\n\nMeanwhile the Shrewsbury Conservative MP and keen Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski is understood to be considering rival legal action to challenge the validity of the Benn act in the courts.\n\nAs the legal prospects became more complicated, one academic, Dr Robert Basedow at the London School of Economics\u2019 European Institute, has suggested that the European court of justice in Luxembourg could even become involved in adjudicating whether the UK had actually left the EU legally under article 50 after 31 October.", "description": "Union members join civil rights body Liberty in legal bid to stop PM breaching Benn act", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9f5bb99dab94112861340558023e4cd4c8b1096/23_0_978_587/master/978.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f95df53a7a198a6632a3d4ee6eaf3a25", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
