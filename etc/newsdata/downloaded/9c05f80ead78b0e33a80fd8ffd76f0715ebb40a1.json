Well, at least those examples that haven\u2019t been owned by famous people or Formula 1 drivers. Like this white RS6 Avant that\u2019s currently located in the city of Kotka, Finland.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the big news. This speedy estate was previously owned by not just anyone but Kimi Raikkonen, currently part of the Alfa Romeo Racing team in Formula 1. The vehicle was listed for sale at an online auction site earlier this week and is still available at \u20ac125,000, or about \u00a3108,000 at the current exchange rates.\n\nThe previous-gen RS6 Avant doesn\u2019t have the advanced electrified V8 powertrain of the new model but it\u2019s no slouch by any means. With a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 generating 553 bhp and 516 pound-feet of torque in factory form, it is capable of reaching 62 miles per hour from a standstill in just 3.9 seconds. The motor is mated to an eight-speed automatic gearbox and a Quattro all-wheel drive. The top speed is electronically governed at 155 mph.\n\nWant the new RS6 Avant instead?\n\nBut! There\u2019s one big but. This white long-roof Audi was obviously modified as the ad claims it now has 670 bhp, while the torque is rated at 664 lb-ft. That\u2019s possible thanks to a BSR chip tuning, which can easily be removed if needed. The seller also says the price of the car when purchased new by Raikkonen back in 2014 was about \u20ac228,000 (\u00a3197,000). The estate has 69,000 kilometres (42,875 miles) on the clock and is said to be in a virtually unused condition. The equipment includes two sets of tyres - 22-inch summer and 20-inch winter (as required in Finland), adaptive air suspension, and more.\n\n\n\n", "description": "If you can't wait to get your hands on the new RS6, this could be the solution.", "authors": ["Feedback", "Anthony Karr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rXYYEgmn5uUjDjOFvAIjuw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/75518bba4d533a7ea781a95a79aed474", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
