Officials declined to comment.\n\nThe initial ruling had set off a flurry of anger, with women\u2019s rights groups slamming the latest sign of a failure to tackle a scourge of sexual and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cHorror in Zadar: Experts and activists outraged over court decision\u201d, read a headline in the daily Jutarnji List paper.\n\nAnother local daily announced that judges had \u201cdelivered\u201d the victim back to her abusers.\n\n\u2013 #JusticeForGirls \u2013\n\nProtests have been called in several cities across the country for Saturday, under the banner of #pravdazadjevojcice, which means \u201cjustice for girls\u201d in Croatian.\n\nIn a similar case last year in Spain, massive demonstrations erupted after five men were convicted of sexually abusing a teenager at Pamplona\u2019s bull-running festival rather than raping the victim.\n\nSpanish women lambasted the \u201cpatriarchal\u201d judiciary as too tolerant of widespread sexual violence.\n\nIn Croatia and much of the Balkans, the #MeToo movement has yet to make major waves in societies where a patriarchal culture is firmly entrenched.\n\nBut four women\u2019s rights groups are hoping people will heed their calls to join a \u201cloud revolt against a system which supports violence\u201d on Saturday.\n\n\u201cNot punishing a crime is a crime,\u201d declared the organisers, who want to see tougher penalties for sexual and domestic violence.\n\nRape is punishable by up to 10 years under Croatian law.\n\nYet the penal code also includes the lighter offence of \u201csexual intercourse without consent,\u201d which only carries between six months and 5 years in prison.\n\nThis lesser offence has had a \u201chighly detrimental impact on the prosecution of rape,\u201d according to Amnesty International, who says more than 90 percent of rape cases in Croatia have resulted in sentences of one year or less.\n\nLast month the government said it would amend these laws in 2020, with plans to remove the controversial \u201csex without consent\u201d provision.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Be sensitive\u2019 \u2013\n\nPresident Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, Croatia\u2019s first female president, also voiced her \u201coutrage\u201d over the crime online.\n\n\u201cWe must not close our eyes to violence in our society as it additionally insults the victims,\u201d she tweeted this week.\n\nBut other officials have called for calm.\n\nCroatia\u2019s Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic has implored media \u201cto be sensitive in reporting\u201d on the case, as the investigation is still underway.\n\nHe said the judge in Zadar received threats and is now under police protection.\n\nThe Ombudsman for Children, Helenca Pirnat Dragicevic, also called for \u201crestraint in comments on social media\u201d, where she warned against circulating photos of the alleged perpetrators.\n\nAccording to police data, between 90 and 150 rape or rape attempts are reported annually in Croatia.\n\nBut experts say that for each reported case there are up to 20 which never reach the ears of law enforcement.\n\nDomestic violence has also taken the lives of approximately 300 Croatian women in the past decade, mostly by the hands of their relatives and partners.", "description": "Zagreb (AFP) \u2013 Anger is brewing in Croatia after a judge released five men suspected of gang-raping a 15-year-old girl from their village,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/415539_anger-is-growing-in-croatia-release-men-accused-gang-raping-15-year-old-girl-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
