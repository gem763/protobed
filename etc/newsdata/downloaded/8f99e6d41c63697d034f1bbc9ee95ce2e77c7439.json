Some suppliers may have changed their fuel mix since then.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nFor every megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable electricity produced, Ofgem issues one REGO to the generator. These certificates certify that the energy is green.\n\nThe Ofgem website states: 'The purpose of the certificate is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.'\n\nREGO certificates can be purchased by providers from renewable energy generators for as little as 30p to 50p per MWh. With the average customer using 3.1MWh of electricity a year, a supplier could buy REGO certificates to match this usage for as little as \u00a31.55 and state their customer's tariff is 100 per cent renewable.\n\nWhen a supplier buys power from a renewable generator to sell to its customers, it also buys REGO certificates, however, REGO certificates can be sold to suppliers separately from renewable electricity.\n\nSo, energy suppliers can buy their electricity from the wholesale market then purchase enough green certificates to match - without actually buying any power from renewable generators.\n\nWhich? says more clarity is needed around how renewable energy is defined in the industry\n\nAn Ofgem spokesperson said: 'Suppliers offering green tariffs are required to prove that the electricity they supply to these customers is produced from renewable sources. They are required to source REGO certificates from renewable generators matching each megawatt hour of electricity they supply to customers who are on green tariffs.\n\n'Ofgem administers this scheme on behalf of government. Ofgem also requires suppliers who offer green tariffs to explain to their customers clearly and transparently how they source renewable electricity.'\n\nTo gauge people's thoughts on renewable electricity, Which? surveyed 4,054 UK adults in September 2018.\n\nThe survey found that 11 per cent of people believe energy providers who sell renewable electricity generate some of that electricity and 8 per cent believe they generate all of it.\n\nSome 33 per cent also said they expected 'green' or 'renewable' tariffs to deliver 100 per cent renewable electricity to their homes, suggesting they could be misled by some energy firms claims.\n\nWhich? says more clarity is needed around how renewable energy is defined with the industry and believes Ofgem should closely examine how firms are marketing these deals and take action if there is a risk of customers being misled.\n\nWhat do the energy firms say?\n\nThis is Money contacted the firms named by Which? that have REGO certificates, as opposed to generating renewable energy themselves, or having contracts to buy it directly from generators.\n\nGreen Star Energy said in response: 'Green Star Energy is an energy supplier and has never claimed to be a generator. We supply 100 per cent renewable electricity to our customers and are not required to be a renewable generator, nor to have PPAs in place to do so. We are and remain proudly committed to supplying 100 per cent renewable electricity to our customers.'\n\nIt said it sources all electricity from renewable generators, but neither owns renewable generation or has contracts with renewable generators. It purchases REGOs to match customers' use.\n\nAn Ovo spokesperson said: 'All Ovo Group Retail brands that supply electricity are included under one supply licence and all tariffs come with a minimum of 33 per cent renewable electricity backed by REGOs as standard.\n\n'From 1 October 2019 we will be increasing this to a minimum of 50 per cent renewable electricity. Ovo Energy customers can choose to add 100 per cent green electricity backed by REGOs to any OVO Energy tariff.\n\n'Ovo does not own any renewable generation or have any contracts (PPAs) to buy electricity directly from renewable generators.'\n\nWhich? believes Ofgem should closely examine how firms are marketing 'green' tariffs\n\nA spokesperson for energy supplier Robin Hood Energy said: 'Since July 2018, 100 per cent of the electricity we supply to UK homes and businesses is purchased from a partner who source from specified UK wind and solar projects. We are also looking at several options to become a green generator ourselves through our own projects.'\n\nSteve Springett, chief product officer at Tonik Energy said: 'While some energy suppliers have invested in supporting local generators, we've taken the approach of investing in growing a team of experts in installing solar panel, battery storage, and electric vehicle charging technologies. For us that's how we make our vision a reality and put the power in the hands of consumers in the process.'\n\nSteven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said: 'All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.\n\n'Pure Planet uses the very same green certification as ever other green supplier. There are no separate or different grades of REGO.'\n\nA So Energy spokesperson added: 'Every So Energy customer has a great value energy tariff and a guarantee that for every mwh of electricity they use, we will match with a mwh of renewable electricity, and we have to demonstrate this using a REGO certificate.'\n\nFoxglove Energy states 'electricity supplied to your home is 100 per cent green', but it is impossible for suppliers to guarantee this. It also told Which? it doesn't own any renewable generation and buys REGOs for each unit of electricity bought for customers.\n\nFirst Utility claimed just 3.7 per cent of its electricity was renewable, but when it rebranded as Shell Energy earlier this year, it switched almost overnight to claiming customers would receive 100 per cent renewable electricity - by purchasing REGO certificates to match its customers' usage.\n\nIt told Which? it does also buy some renewable electricity directly from generators, but did not specify how much.\n\nWho does buy renewable electricity?\n\nHowever, there are some suppliers, including Ecotricity and Good Energy, whose green status match what some customers would expect, as they generate, or have contracts with generators to buy enough renewable electricity to match customers usage.\n\nThese tariffs are usually pricier as it is more expensive to generate your own electricity.\n\nOfgem recognised that these tariffs could be more expensive when it exempted them from the price cap on standard and default tariffs, saying their higher prices are directly due to the support they give to generating renewable electricity.\n\nWhich?'s analysis also found other firms whose parent company generates some renewable electricity or which buy directly from generators, although not enough to match 100 per cent of what they sell. They reach 100 per cent renewable by topping up with REGOs.\n\nCurrent Ofgem rules say suppliers that sell 100 per cent renewable electricity must have REGOs to prove it. However, they are not required to generate renewable electricity themselves, nor have contracts in place to buy it directly from generators.\n\nRichard Headland, Which? Editor-in-chief, said: 'As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it's concerning that some suppliers appear to be 'greenwashing' their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.\n\n'We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.'", "description": "Around 40 energy providers have been selling 100 per cent renewable electricity tariffs but some of these do not generate the renewable electricity themselves.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
