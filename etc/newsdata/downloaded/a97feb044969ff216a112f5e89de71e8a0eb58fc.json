Mayweather beat Pacquiao by unanimous decision back in 2015, but now Pacquiao has a new recruit on his team: Alibaba founder and China\u2019s richest man, Jack Ma.\n\nIn a tweet published this weekend, Ma can be seen sparring with Pacquiao, who assumes the role of the billionaire\u2019s \u201ctrainer.\u201d The two work up a sweat to the beat of metal guitar riffing before they stop, turn to the camera, and call out Mayweather by name.\n\n\u201cFloyd Mayweather, if you want a real fight, fight me,\u201d Pacquiao says. \u201cIf you want an exhibition, my guy, my friend, Jack Ma will take care of you.\u201d\n\nPacquiao and Ma go on to declare their coalition as the \u201cThe real Manny team,\u201d an apparent dig at Mayweather\u2019s lifestyle brand called \u201cThe Money Team.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m ready,\u201d Ma says after landing a few punches. \u201cAny time any place, Manny\u2019s team is ready.\u201d\n\nJack Ma starred in a Kung Fu movie\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ma, who just retired from Alibaba last month, has found himself in a war of words with professional fighters. In 2017, Ma, who practices martial arts himself, starred in a Jet Li produced Kung Fu film called, Gong Shou Dao. At the end of that film, two world-renowned fighters and British action star Jason Statham dramatically challenged Ma to a fight. One of those fighters was none other than Manny Pacquiao who pops up in the credits and says, \u201cBe careful sometimes, I will find you\u2026 somewhere.\u201d\n\nMa\u2019s self-deprecating insertion breathes some life into an already growing public feud between Pacquiao and Mayweather. The two fought once in 2015 after years of back and forth and disagreements on terms. Pacquiao unanimously lost that clash, which was referred to by many as \u201cThe Fight of the Century,\u201d and has demanded a rematch.\n\nSince then though, much has changed. Pacquiao has gone on to focus on business and philanthropy and was elected to the Philippines senate in 2016. Mayweather has come out of retirement for select high profile fights (like his fight against Irish MMA legend Connor McGregor in 2017), but has also come under renewed criticism for his long history of alleged and proven domestic violence. In 2004, Mayweather was given a one-year suspended sentence after being convicted of two counts of domestic battery. In 2011, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to misdemeanor battery charges in an incident involving his ex-girlfriend Josie Harris.\n\ncaption Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao box during their world welterweight championship bout at MGM Grand Garden Arena. source REUTERS / Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that Ma \u2013 or even Pacquiao \u2013 will ever step in the ring with Mayweather, the billionaire\u2019s recent verbal jabs have served to prolong the already active social media fight between the two.", "description": "Business Insider - A video on Twitter shows the Alibaba founder sparring with Pacquiao and calling out Mayweather by name: \"Any time any place, Manny's team is ready.\".
