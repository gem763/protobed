Among registered voters, 40 percent say they approve of Trump, while 55 percent disapprove.\n\nConcern over the economy \u2014 and specifically Trump\u2019s handling of trade negotiations with China \u2014 have become a drag on the president\u2019s public standing, particularly with women.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll finds Trump\u2019s economic approval rating has also declined from 51 percent in early July to 46 percent in the new survey, with 47 percent disapproving. His relatively positive standing on the economy continues to buoy his reputation amid public criticism on other issues.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics"], "top_image": ""}
