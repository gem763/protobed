That is Donald Trump to a tee,\" he continued.\n\nDuring a speech at the Alabama Democratic Conference, O'Rourke also stated the United States \"is still racist at its foundation, at its core.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:25:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/294/6e42b366-dd77-43a5-9f52-fee43ff9ba18.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
