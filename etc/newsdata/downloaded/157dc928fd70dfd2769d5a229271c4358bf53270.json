We Are Unlimited is part of Omnicom's DDB Worldwide network, and DDB Worldwide CEO Wendy Clark and former McDonald's Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl described it at its launch as the \"agency of the future.\" We Are Unlimited promoted itself as having \"digital and data at the heart\" and included \"embedded teams\" from companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Adobe working alongside its own employees.\n\nIn an uncharacteristically sharp rebuke to the competition, Wieden and Kennedy's memo said that We Are Unlimited has now been \"relegated to an operational role\" on the McDonald's business, though it will retain a small portion of the work it previously handled for the client.\n\nSubsequently, Wieden and Kennedy provided a statement emphasizing the partnership between the two agencies. \"We Are Unlimited is an important partner that brings deep expertise about the brand to the table, and we look forward to working closely with them,\" it read. \"McDonalds' renewed commitment to the power of creativity is a testament to where the brand is headed. Being successful today requires a marriage between the human ways that creativity is able to evoke feelings and bring out the soul of a brand and the insights that lead to the brand's voice creativity will always be rooted in data and strategy.\"\n\n\"We remain a proud partner with McDonald's and are working closely across both the McDonald's and We Are Unlimited teams to ensure we remain focused on our shared goals and priorities,\" said a statement that a We Are Unlimited representative provided to Business Insider in response to the Wieden and Kennedy memo.\n\nIn a press release announcing the change, Morgan Flatley, McDonald's chief marketing officer and a former PepsiCo executive, thanked the team \"for their work over the last three years supporting key moments in our transformation and operational excellence.\"\n\nThe chain also abandoned past policies in agreeing to share an agency partner with its rival KFC\n\nAccording to sources with direct knowledge of the business, the final section of the memo, which is cut off in the version obtained by Business Insider, discussed how Wieden and Kennedy would manage an apparent conflict between McDonald's and another longtime fast-food client, KFC.\n\nThese sources said both companies agreed to allow Wieden and Kennedy to participate in the review \u2014 a significant strategic shift among fast-food brands. Traditionally, such companies forbade their agencies from working with direct competitors. To avoid overlap, one source said the two accounts would be strictly separated in different offices, with Wieden and Kennedy Portland handling KFC and Wieden and Kennedy New York working on McDonald's. Unspecified \"IT safeguards\" will also ensure that the brands' accounts do not conflict with one another.\n\nMcDonald's declined to comment beyond its own press release, and representatives for KFC and its parent company, Yum Brands, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the data-insights company Kantar Media, McDonald's spent $765 million on advertising in the US last year.\n\nSee the memo below.", "description": "McDonald's picked Wieden and Kennedy as its new US ad agency.
