God. What the hell.'\n\n'My brother Mike overdosed on heroin in March. He had struggled with addiction for 12 years and although he had been clean for three months, he relapsed,' Ruth told the publication.\n\n'We were really close and would text every day.

If I had a joke to tell him or a memory I wanted to share or I just wanted to reach out to him, I'd message him in the same way as before he died.'\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Ruth explained she never expected to receive a response to her messages and was shocked when a text came through from 'brothaboo' - her pet name for Mike\n\nAfter leaving the room to find somewhere to cry, having not expected Mike's number to be reassigned so soon, she texted Amber back and the pair got talking.\n\nAfter Ruth apologised and explained to Amber that her number used to belong to her brother, she revealed she too is going through a difficult time.\n\n'My cousin who's like a sister to me isn't doing well and expected to pass any day now,' Amber wrote back.\n\n'So I completely understand. Feel free to text any time you need to. Sending you much love.'\n\nRuth shared the touching exchange on Reddit, where it received 849 comments and more than 80,000 upvotes\n\nAmber then encouraged Ruth to share anything she wanted about her brother, as 'sometimes it helps just remembering the good times'.\n\nShe added: 'I know we don't know each other, but don't mind being a sounding board.'\n\nGrateful, Ruth replied telling Amber she was a 'good human' and urged her to reach out in return should she need to.\n\nRuth said Amber's reaction was comforting and she would love to meet her in person to thank her for her kindness - especially after finding out that Amber's husband used to play in the same poker circles as Mike.\n\nRuth's Reddit post sparked a flurry of people from all over the world to share how they too still contact their loved ones via text, Snapchat and other social media.\n\nRuth said Amber's reaction was comforting and she would love to meet her in person to thank her for her kindness - especially after finding out that Amber's husband used to play in the same poker circles as her brother\n\nJessica Allen, of London, Ontario, told Redditors: 'We buried my brother with his phone, so that we could text him. My parents paid for it for a few months then stopped. Eventually a year later someone got the number.'\n\nJaclyn Schwartz, from Texas, said she too continued to pay for her husband Jason's phone line after his death in 2017 as it enabled her to text him and see the images he took.\n\nAnd Camille Sharrow-Blaum, from Michigan, revealed she and her friends still message their pal Jenny, after she died of cancer aged 27 last year.\n\nAmber admitted she was shocked by the overwhelming reaction to Ruth's Reddit post, asking: 'When did being a compassionate human being become something exceptional?'\n\nShe went on to say it didn't cost her anything to respond and it 'takes nothing to lend your ear'.\n\n'I truly believe I was supposed to get that number,' Amber told the BBC. 'It's more than a coincidence that I was given it.
