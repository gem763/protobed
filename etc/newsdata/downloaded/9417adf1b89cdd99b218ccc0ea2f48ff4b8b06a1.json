Working closely with Macquarie University paves the way for future collaborative ventures between Fujitsu and the University, where corporate and academia can work together on innovative projects that would benefit from a diversity of talent,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Organisations can work with Fujitsu at the DTC to help address business challenges and redefine business problems with a view to jointly create a solution that takes into account different points of view.\"\n\nThe company added the DTC will play host to regular workshops that will be used to develop proof of concepts that could deliver tangible solutions.\n\nThe opening of the DTC in Australia is the sixth for Fujitsu, having already established DTCs in Tokyo, Osaka, Munich, London, and New York.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate and Macquarie University recently found themselves as part of a joint research collaboration with GE Healthcare and Macquarie Medical Imaging to examine how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to detect and monitor brain aneurysms faster and more efficiently.\n\nAs the project's leader, Fujitsu will apply its AI solutions to scanned images of the brain provided by GE's medical imaging scanner. Clinical expertise from Macquarie University and Macquarie Medical Imaging will then use the algorithms to look for brain abnormalities and aneurysms.\n\nRecently, Fujitsu Australia also partnered with Kia Motors Australia to produce a police car prototype that the pair stated could make it cheaper and simpler for police forces to operate vehicles.\n\nThe pair also worked with Whelen Engineering to create a modular lightbar that reduced the numbers of cables from nine to one.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nFujitsu's AI to help judges score gymnastic performances at World Championships\n\nIt will used by judges for four apparatus at the event.\n\nFujitsu develops blockchain-based digital identity play\n\nThe company plans to develop its digital identity exchange technology as a 'trust-based service platform' supporting digital business.\n\nNew research collaboration is using AI to detect brain aneurysms\n\nFujitsu Australia, GE Healthcare, Macquarie University, and Macquarie Medical Imaging are all involved.\n\nFujitsu and Sony think blockchain is the best way to store education records\n\nLearning data of students will be stored and managed as 'unfalsifiable data on a blockchain', in lieu of a paper certificate with pretty gold embossing.\n\nFujitsu's second gen Digital Annealer offers 100x performance improvement (TechRepublic)\n\nFujitsu's quantum-inspired Digital Annealer is available now on the cloud, and will be available for on-premises installations early next year.", "description": "The first Fujitsu DTC in Australia will be a space for current and future customers to co-create solutions with the Japanese conglomerate.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/05/19/a88821d7-6104-4741-897f-e5f41e6a2ea1/thumbnail/770x578/f8289e74ef373e9dc8db022578349c1d/executives-shaking-hands-thumb.jpg"}
