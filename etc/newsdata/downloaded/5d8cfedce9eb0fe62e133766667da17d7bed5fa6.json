It is about diversity, inclusion, and acceptance.\u201d\n\nFrom catwalks featuring plus-sized models to airlines ditching compulsory make-up for hostesses, a growing number of so-called body positive initiatives worldwide are encouraging women to celebrate their appearance.\n\nWomen in Russia are expected to dress to appeal to men, feminists say, highlighting old-fashioned gender stereotypes and rising conservatism, such as a 2017 law decriminalising domestic violence that does not require hospital treatment.\n\nIn a bid to change that, teenage Instagram influencer @Tysya asked her 1.2 million followers to post photos of themselves without make-up with the hashtag #SoMnoyVsyoTak or #AllIsFineWithMe.\n\n\u201cIn Russia ... we show very few people with ordinary bodies,\u201d @Tysya, whose real name is Natalia Zemlianukhina, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.\n\nGirls who are not thin, have acne or different traits are often picked on at school and pressured to diet, she said, adding she had fought to overcome anorexia.\n\n\u201c#AllIsFineWithMe is about the fact that every body is right and beautiful. There are no bodies that need to be worked on, improved or changed.\u201d\n\nMore than 2,500 people have used the hashtag and a video promoting the campaign featuring models with scars, burns and other perceived defects has gathered more than 1 million views and hundreds of comments.\n\n\u201cI am the way I am, and to hide the flaws diligently is a waste of time,\u201d wrote user @krasavina70, who has only one hand due to a congenital disorder.\n\n\u201cI have a bunch of features: uneven skin from acne, post-acne, overweight, cellulite, stretch marks ... [but] after all #AllIsFineWithMe despite the fact that people often try to prove the opposite,\u201d user @myafka.smm posted.\n\n'Escape the corset': South Korean women rebel against strict beauty standards Read more\n\nBut not everyone was supportive of the campaign, with some users saying it promoted unhealthy lifestyles.\n\n\u201cAll these fat girls will accept themselves as they are, and then in old age they suffer from high blood sugar,\u201d one user commented.\n\n\u201cUntil a few years ago the pro-feminist agenda in Russia was barely visible but nowadays it has a much higher profile,\u201d said Akhilgova of Equality Now.\n\n\u201cThis is reflected in new approaches to advertising campaigns, the type of beauty and fashion content featured in glossy magazines, and the growing number of messages on social media with a body positive focus.\u201d", "description": "Social media trend was started by a teen to push back against unrealistic beauty standards", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c7b649b214787e98c77262a52c456837957ade/37_0_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0f66e36712f1cabed6ddeb485ab2901", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
