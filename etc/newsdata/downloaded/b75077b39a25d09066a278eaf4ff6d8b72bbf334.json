The private jet generated an estimated seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight. This was on top of their Ibiza trip this month which was believed to have had a footprint of more than four tons. This was estimated to have emitted about six times more carbon dioxide per person than a scheduled flight. The carbon footprint of an average person in the UK is 13 tons a year. A tree removes about seven tons of carbon dioxide from the air once fully grown - meaning Harry and Meghan would technically need to plant one tree to offset their carbon footprint just from their two trips this month.\n\nResearchers from Lund University, the University of Otago and the University of Oxford state that 21 per cent could be considered to be redundant.\n\nThe research followed a group of international students at Lund University who collectively recalled 587 flights over a six-year period (2012-2017).\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Air Transport Management, also found the most popular motive for travel was 'leisure' at 42 per cent.\n\nProfessor Stefan G\u00f6ssling said: 'We asked active air travellers rigorous questions about the necessity of air travel and our findings suggests that in order to reduce air travel-related emissions, immediate steps should be taken to reduce superfluous air travel which is deemed by the traveller to be unnecessary.\n\n'To this end, ensuring that the cost of flights include the environmental costs of flying should be an important and immediate priority.'\n\nA recent trend has emerged to condemn and shame people who fly regularly, receiving the term \u2018flygskam\u2019.\n\nThis movement has gained momentum on the back of the Extinction Rebellion protests, Greta Thunberg's condemnation of world leaders at the UN climate summit in New York recently and the frivolous spending on private jets of high-profile figures.", "description": "International researchers looked at more than 500 flights spanning a total of more than 21.36 million miles and asked people to rate how important each flight was.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/12/19104090-0-image-a-13_1569842260414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
