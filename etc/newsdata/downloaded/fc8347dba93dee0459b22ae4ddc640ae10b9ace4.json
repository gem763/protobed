It\u2019s not just Michael Keaton\u2019s Damage Control team in Spider-Man: Homecoming who has to worry about New York after every attack.\n\nA new ad for Google\u2019s Pixel 3 answers that question. Whether it\u2019s using Google Maps to try to find a route that isn\u2019t blocked by crashing alien ships or asking Google to play a \u201cdeep focus\u201d playlist, Google says the Pixel 3 is here to help New Yorkers forget about all of those pesky invaders. Even at only half of New York\u2019s regular population (Thanos\u2019 snap probably means more New Yorkers can get a seat on the subway during the morning rush hour), it\u2019s obvious that sending extraterrestrial mercenaries to Earth is still causing a headache.\n\nThe commercial accompanies an announcement from Google that five new Marvel superheroes are joining the Playmoji AR lineup. War Machine, Thor, Black Widow, Rocket, and Captain Marvel join Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Nebula, and Okoye. Pixel 3 users can add these characters to scenes in their actual life and snap some cool photos.\n\nAvengers: Endgame will hit theaters on April 26th.", "description": "A new ad for Google\u2019s Pixel 3 combines the phone\u2019s abilities with Avengers: Endgame to show just how New Yorkers deal with pesky alien invasions.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vte05kye6t6sQMtP-JxZHprjxdE=/177x0:849x352/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16034267/Screen_Shot_2019_04_15_at_1.04.29_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-04-15"}
