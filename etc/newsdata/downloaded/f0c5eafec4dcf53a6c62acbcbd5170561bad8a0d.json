President Cyril Rampahosa has set targets to have 100 Blue Flag beaches by 2030.\n\nTen of Cape Town's beaches got the blue tick, including the V&A Waterfront for the second year in a row. For Marian Nieuwoudt - mayoral committee member for spatial planning and environment for the city - our beaches form an important part of our country's identity.\n\n\"It's not a commodity you can sell, you can benefit from it but it's not yours to exploit,\" sais Nieuwoudt at the launch, adding that they aim to get all of Cape Town's beaches to Blue Flag level. Seaforth Beach in Simon's Town didn't receive status like last year, but there are plans to get on the list again for next season.\n\nALSO SEE: How naked can you go on Cape Town beaches?\n\nThe Western Cape is dominating with 33 Blue Flag beaches, followed by the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal each with six beaches. Coastal province Northern Cape has no Blue Flag beaches.\n\nNewcomers this year include Castle Beach in Overstrand, Jongensfontein and Stilbaai Wes in Hessequa and Glentana in Mossel Bay. The two beaches that were the first to receive the status in South Africa stayed strong yet again for their 19th year - Grotto Beach in Overstrand and Humewood Beach in Port Elizabeth.\n\nHessequa Municipality became the first district to have all their beaches certified with Blue Flag status.\n\nCurrently 35 pilot beaches waiting in the wings to receive their full status, but they are still busing with upgrades and refurbishments to adhere to the strict criteria. The Ethekwini Municipality has 11 pilot sites which could give Cape Town a run for its money.\n\nOn the marina side, the following received Blue Flag status beside Cape Town's waterfront - False Bay Yacht Club, Thesen Island, The Water Club, Yachtsport SA, Harbour Island, St Francis Canals and Royal Alfred. Tourism operators whose boats were awarded the Blue Flag include Offshore Adventures, Dyer Island Cruises, Marine Dynamics, Ocean Odyssey, Great White Shark Tours and White Shark Ventures.\n\nSEE: Sleepy coastal towns where you can have the beach all to yourself\n\nSee the full list of Blue Flag beaches below.\n\nWestern Cape\n\nCity of Cape Town\n\nSilwerstroomstrand\n\nClifton 4th\n\nCamps Bay\n\nLlandudno\n\nMuizenberg\n\nStrandfontein\n\nMnandi\n\nBikini Beach\n\nMelkbosstrand\n\nFish Hoek\n\nREAD: Cape Town beach swearing ban?!
