Earlier in the day, Johnson urged Parliament to pass the deal that would see the U.K. removed from the E.U. on Oct. 31.\n\n\"Now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today,\" he said, \"as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting.\"\n\nTo pass, the deal needs a simple majority of 320 votes, but there is skepticism about whether or not Johnson has the required votes.\n\nIf the vote fails to pass, Johnson would most likely need to ask for an extension on the Oct. 31 deadline, but the prime minister has also repeatedly said that he plans on leaving the European bloc at the end of the month with or without a deal.", "description": "Thousands of protestors\u00a0marched through the streets of London on Saturday as British lawmakers looked over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's latest Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/londonprotestbrexit_101919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
