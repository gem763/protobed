I am wondering if it applies to my current situation. Earlier this year, I received a lump-sum payout for my pension in the form of a check. I deposited the check into an IRA (plus a personal check to cover the 20% withholding).\n\nNow I would like to move the IRA from one brokerage to another. According to my understanding of the \"one rollover per year\" rule, the first transaction (company pension to IRA) was not an IRA rollover and I should be free to rollover the IRA now. Also, I believe that even if the first transaction was considered a rollover, I can still do the current rollover as long as I do a trustee to trustee direct transfer as those do not fall into the definition of IRA rollover and thus are not subject to the \"one rollover per year\" rule.\n\nDoes anyone disagree with my understanding of the \"one rollover per year\" rules? Thank you.", "description": "Solved: I am aware of the basic IRS rule that you can only do one IRA rollover per year. I am wondering if it applies to my current situation.
