We were dominated pretty much all through the test series.\u201d\n\nIndia will be particularly pleased about Rohit\u2019s effortless transition into a test opener after struggling lower in the batting order in his stop-start test career.\n\nThe limited-overs stalwart, the only batsman with three 200-plus scores in one-dayers, was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 212, his maiden test double hundred, in India\u2019s first innings total of 497-9 declared.\n\nRohit also bagged the man-of-the-series award for his 529 runs from four innings, which included three 100-plus scores.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful to the management for the opportunity at the opening slot,\u201d Rohit said after collecting his awards.\n\n\u201cI can take a lot of positives about how to counter the new ball. The new ball is always a threat, and to be able to counter that will be a huge positive. I can take my game forward from that.\u201d", "description": "India completed a 3-0 series sweep against South Africa on Tuesday to consolidate their lead in the World Test Championship race, with Rohit Sharma providing the icing on the cake by successfully reinventing himself as a test opener.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
