REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell 0.3% percent when trading resumed on Sunday, a day after attacks on Saudi oil facilities that risk disrupting global energy supplies.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attacks knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output, or more than 5% of global supply.\n\nS&P 500 e-mini futures initially fell 0.59%, but cut their losses and were last down 0.3%.\n\n\u201cI would expect a rough day for stocks tomorrow since this attack largely came out of the blue,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research. \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned that it\u2019s more than a one-day move, though. We\u2019re not yet talking about a large-scale military intervention in the region.\u201d\n\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury note futures prices TYv1 rose 0.2 pct at the start of trading.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that energy costs don\u2019t rise by some amount worldwide so the long nightmare of disinflation and below target inflation is over, and that\u2019s why the Treasury market is not going to have this flight-to-quality drop in yields,\u201d said David Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors.", "description": "U.S. stock futures fell 0.3% percent when trading resumed on Sunday, a day after attacks on Saudi oil facilities that risk disrupting global energy supplies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430236869&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0RR", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
