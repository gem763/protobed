It announced a \u00a3900 million rescue deal in July, led by its biggest shareholder, Chinese conglomerate Fosun, and other backers.\n\nEarly this morning it was announced that the company had gone bust.\n\nWhy did it collapse?\n\nThe firm\u2019s lenders, led by Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, had said the company needed a \u00a3200 million loan to tide it over. The banks\u2019 patience ran thin, given that they had already given Thomas Cook a \u00a3675 million overdraft.\n\nThomas Cook became saddled with a \u00a31.6 billion debt following years of mismanagement and over-expansion. Pictured are Thomas Cook passengers checking in at Glasgow Airport yesterday\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAdministrators will be called in. It is a criminal offence to continue trading when insolvent.\n\nWhat if I am already abroad with Thomas Cook?\n\nThose who have booked a package holiday should be protected by the Atol scheme. This means they will be entitled to continue their holiday and fly home with another airline.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday promised that none of Thomas Cook\u2019s estimated 165,000 customers will be left stranded abroad, paving the way for Britain\u2019s biggest peacetime repatriation.\n\nPassengers flying from Antalya, Turkey, to Glasgow on Friday were relieved to have boarded what could be one of Thomas Cook's last ever flights. But when a fault with the plane prevented it from taking off, they were stranded at the airport overnight\n\nIt remains unclear how much this would cost, with estimates ranging from \u00a3100 million to \u00a3600 million. Many holiday-makers could be forced to wait for up to two weeks before returning.\n\nWhat about future bookings?\n\nIf customers have Atol protection, they are entitled to a refund or alternative holiday. Those who booked flights only can claim a refund if they used a credit card and it cost more than \u00a3100.", "description": "Thomas Cook became saddled with a \u00a31.6 billion debt following years of mismanagement and over-expansion.
