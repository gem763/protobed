Elizabeth Warren entered Tuesday night's debate as the front-runner for the first time, and her rivals challenged that newfound status throughout the night.\n\nShe fended off attacks from most of the remaining 2020 Democrats on hot-button topics including health care, automation and jobs, and taxes on the wealthy.\n\nThe fourth Democratic debate, at Otterbein University in Ohio, was the first time Warren faced the other contenders after leading a major poll.\n\nIn a Quinnipiac poll released last week, Warren led the field with 29% support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. Former Vice President Joe Biden trailed her by 3 points.\n\nThe poll also did head-to-head matchups for the top three Democrats against President Donald Trump, with 49% of self-identified registered voters saying they'd vote for Warren over Trump, compared with 41% who said they'd reelect the president.\n\nThese are the five attacks from Warren's rivals that generated the biggest fireworks Tuesday evening.\n\n1. Warren accused of being 'evasive' on raising taxes to pay for health plan\n\nCandidates first grilled Warren on how she would will pay for her proposed health care plan.\n\n\"I have made clear\u2026 costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,\" Warren said.\n\n(MORE: 3rd Democratic debate: Candidates clashed on health care, immigration and more)\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg doubled down on his criticism that Warren was been \"evasive\" on how the middle class would pay for \"Medicare for All.\"\n\n\"Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\" he said. \"This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general. ... Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward.\"\n\nPHOTO: Democratic presidential hopefuls speak during the fourth Democratic primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, Oct. 15, 2019. (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images) More\n\nWarren hit back by saying that Buttigieg's proposed plan is \"Medicare for All who can afford it.\"\n\n\"Costs are going to go up for the wealthy, they're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle class families, and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs,\" she insisted.\n\n\"I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice,\" Buttigieg responded. \"And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, who also supports Medicare for All, said, \"I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're gonna go up significantly for the wealthy, and for virtually everybody the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\"\n\n(MORE: On Biden and Ukraine, 2020 Dems walk a fine line; eye front-runner status)\n\n\"At least that's a straightforward answer. But there's a better way,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg's praise of Sanders' directness.\n\n\"I'm sorry Elizabeth, but you've not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're gonna send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on pharmaceutical companies.\"\n\nEven Donald Trump's team weighed in on the discussion.\n\n\"Unable to be honest about raising taxes to pay for her healthcare plan. So obvious that she's dodging and not doing it well,\" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, told ABC News.", "description": "Sen.
