He\u2019s a very great Englishman, and it\u2019s admirable that he\u2019s being canonised.\u201d\n\nIn an article in the Times on 12 October, Prince Charles wrote that Newman\u2019s example was needed now more than ever. \u201cHe could advocate without accusation, could disagree without disrespect and perhaps most of all could see differences as places of encounter rather than exclusion.\u201d\n\nNewman was beatified by Pope Benedict XV, who declared that an American deacon\u2019s recovery from a serious spine condition was due to Newman\u2019s intercession. Pope Francis then credited Newman with a second miracle \u2013 the healing of a pregnant American woman with a life-threatening illness \u2013 which paved the way for his canonisation.\n\nAt a conference on Newman\u2019s life held in Vatican City, Reverend Benjamin King, associate professor of church history at Sewanee University in Tennessee, said Newman\u2019s first trip to Italy, in 1833, had been significant. He wrote home that Rome was \u201cthe most wonderful place on Earth\u201d, and it was after this that he felt called to the Oxford Movement, which sought to renew the Church of England by returning it to its Catholic sources. On converting to Catholicism, he instructed bishops to \u201clisten to the laity\u201d, King added.\n\nNewman, born in London in 1801, was a powerful preacher whose sermons could change lives. Some 15,000 people lined the streets for his funeral in Birmingham in 1890. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t just a thinker; he was a man of action,\u201d said Dr Paul Shrimpton of Magdalen College, Oxford, and author of a 2014 book on Newman\u2019s ideas, The Making of Men.\n\nFour women will also be made saints on Sunday, including Irm\u00e3 Dulce Pontes, who will be Brazil\u2019s first female saint.", "description": "Influential British cardinal who died in 1890 is to be canonised before thousands including Prince Charles at Vatican ceremony", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fbeb7d62c226d33b7e17f1d7e53f9963841a2e6/0_0_5084_3050/master/5084.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb349e6ad14337388604b4752b7222b5", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
