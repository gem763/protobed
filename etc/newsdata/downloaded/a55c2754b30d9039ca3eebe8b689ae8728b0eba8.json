REUTERS/Kate Munsch\n\nWhile students set the global agenda and led local marches, U.S. West Coast tech workers said they turned out in support and called on makers of software and hardware as well as providers of services such as cloud data storage to do more.\n\nThe marches cap a week in which Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said it had increased its wind and solar energy deals by more than 40%, and Amazon.com Inc pledged to use only renewable energy by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out on the streets because we want them to do more,\u201d said Danilo Quilaton, 34, a product designer for Amazon\u2019s video streaming subsidiary Twitch. He called Thursday\u2019s pledge by his company a big win.\n\n\u201cAmazon promised some things, but we still have to hold them liable,\u201d said Quilaton, who held a sign that read, \u201cI work at Amazon. I want zero deals with oil & gas\u201d companies.\n\nThe number of people carrying signs referring to tech companies and shouting tech-related slogans on the streets of San Francisco and Seattle numbered in the hundreds or low thousands, a fraction of the tech workforce. But their presence was bigger than in past protests and represented a change in an industry whose engineers have often focused on their work, rather than social issues.\n\n\u201cAmazon, let\u2019s raise the bar not the temperature,\u201d read one protester\u2019s sign outside the glass domes at Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle known as the Spheres, local symbols of the industry\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cTech is having an awakening,\u201d said Google business analyst Marie Collins in San Francisco. \u201cTech workers are realizing they have to take collective action.\u201d\n\nOne sign with the hashtag #techwontbuildit called for zero emissions by 2030, no deals to provide technology to oil and gas companies and zero corporate sponsorships of groups that deny climate change, echoing internal petitions at the big companies.\n\nThe coordination across various companies paralleled recent joint efforts by staff to oppose work on military contracts, support immigrants and other issues.\n\nTech workers by late morning joined youth-led marches, which filled a dozen blocks of San Francisco\u2019s Market Street. In Seattle, hundreds of tech workers gathered at Amazon\u2019s headquarters and marched to join bigger groups.\n\nThe companies have signaled sympathy with workers on addressing climate change. But Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos on Thursday said it would be a bad idea to leave the cloud company\u2019s oil and gas customers with outdated tools as they are trying to evolve their businesses.\n\n\u2018HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE\u2019\n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman on Friday said the company understands that some employees feel strongly about climate change and so does Amazon. Google, which on Thursday announced its clean energy deals, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThough much of the public thinks of technology as a clean industry, unlike transportation or mainstream manufacturing, the employees said soaring electricity consumption for the data centers used in cloud computing was a major problem.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who build the products,\u201d said an organizer who asked to be identified only as Steven. \u201cWe are the ones who have the power to hold them accountable.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday joined climate-change marches in San Francisco and Seattle, saying their employers had been too slow to tackle global warming and needed to take more drastic action.", "authors": ["Joseph Menn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432158094&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J2DP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
