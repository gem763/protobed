(Photo: Blippi Live)\n\nPreschoolers and their parents all over the world know Blippi. His goofy educational YouTube channel gets more than 200 million views per month, and he has more than 4 million followers.\n\nBlippi recently announced his first Blippi Live! tour across North America, with stops at more than 30 cities across the country.\n\nTicket prices vary based on the city you live in, but prices for the first show in San Antonio, Texas range from $24 to $75. There's also an option to pay $50 for a meet-and-great after the show.\n\nBut, beware, you won't actually be meeting the real Blippi.\n\nAccording to the description of the show, \"Stevin John is the creator of Blippi and acts as the writer and creative force behind the Blippi character. Now that Blippi has evolved as a character he is excited that a dynamic stage performer has been cast as Blippi to entertain and thrill audiences across all the tour markets.\"\n\nUhhhh...OK.\n\nParents aren't too thrilled about this one and voiced their anger on social media, after finding out that they had just bought tickets to see someone other than Stevin John.\n\nIn case any parents are wondering the @blippi live show is not the real blippi, but an actor. I found this out after spending $160 on non-refundable tickets. Not cool @StevinWJohn. I'm 9ne disappointed momma. \u2014 Kelly (thefavesofourlives) (@TheIridescentA1) October 9, 2019\n\nMy kids love Blippi and I was excited to buy tickets to see him live...until I read the info stating that the real Blippi won\u2019t even be there. What is this nonsense?! I\u2019m not paying $150 for 4 tickets to see a Blippi imposter. #whymomismad \u2014 kristine (@kristine_wins) October 8, 2019\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/11/blippi-live-tours-country-without-stevin-john-some-parents-mad/3941457002/", "description": "Blippi is a popular YouTube character.
