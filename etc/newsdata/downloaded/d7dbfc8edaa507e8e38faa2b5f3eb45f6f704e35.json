Cohen and J. Bradford DeLong exalt Alexander Hamilton as the architect of the booming industrial economy that took off in America in the second part of the nineteenth century. Hamilton\u2019s great innovation was to marshal the federal government behind the infrastructure required to create a strong industrial base for the nation. To take just one example, the Department of War launched many of the mechanical devices and processes that later facilitated America\u2019s industrial leap. And in her book The Entrepreneurial State, Mariana Mazzucato painstakingly traces how most of the technologies propelling today\u2019s economy\u2014including its centerpiece, the internet itself\u2014were invented in research laboratories underwritten by the post-World War II Department of Defense.\n\nThe authors of both books are said to be involved in developing concrete strategies for the still-vague concept of a Green New Deal. But the ghost of Alexander Hamilton also smiles upon many of presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plans for addressing the urgent threat of climate change. Vox writer Matthew Yglesias, in an exegesis of Warren\u2019s \u201cplan \u2026 to marry industrial policy to environmentalism and transform the American economy,\u201d notes that fans of the musical Hamilton \u201cwill recall that Hamilton favored setting a fairly high tariff on imported manufactured goods to encourage Americans to set up their own factories.\u201d This is in reference to Warren\u2019s \u201cdesire for monetary policy that\u2019s more attendant to the needs of American manufacturing,\u201d which, Yglesias explains, \u201cimplies that most Americans \u2026 will on balance pay more for stuff,\u201d as with tariffs. \u201cThe case for doing this,\u201d he continues, \u201cis that globally competitive manufacturing industries can breed national wealth over time in a way that non-tradable things like hair salons and child care centers can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prevailing view in Washington\u2014from both political parties\u2014has been that our government should not aggressively intervene in the markets to boost American workers,\u201d Warren has written. She correctly characterizes this approach as having \u201cfailed spectacularly.\u201d She makes much the same Hamiltonian case that Cohen, DeLong, and Mazzucato have advanced, advocating massive government investment in R&D for anti-global warming technology, for economic as well as environmental purposes. However, to those who believe the salvation of the American polity requires a revival of the ideals of civic republicanism, to modify those of individualistic liberalism, Alexander Hamilton is at best an ambiguous figure. True, he was imbued, as were most of the Founding Fathers, with the republican ethic\u2014which calls for putting the general interests of the community ahead of your own personal interests, with respect to issues of public concern. But Hamilton also foresaw its attenuation under the influence of a commercial order, and if he did not wholeheartedly welcome this development, he still considered it both necessary and inevitable, if America was to become the commercial and military empire he envisioned.\n\nFrom the point of view of environmental or \u201cgreen\u201d republicanism, Warren\u2019s plans, like those of the economists advising on the Green New Deal, raise a couple of serious questions. Republican theory puts a heavy emphasis on political participation by the citizenry, and on the structural decentralization that makes citizen involvement feasible. So far, it appears such concerns have eluded the designers of the inchoate Green New Deal. Public opinion in the United States on climate change, and also on how to deal with it, is deeply cleaved, and our current president and his minions at Fox News have made a point of trying to discredit the federal bureaucracy by deriding it as the \u201cdeep state.\u201d A feeling of alienation from the national government, and a lack of confidence in its efficacy, existed before Donald Trump came into office, and is one of the main reasons he got elected. A serious program to forestall further damage to human life from global warming will require major efforts on a national scale, but those efforts must draw on actual citizen involvement and support at the local level. A top-down, heavy-handed bureaucratic structure will not suffice.", "description": "Does an empire of consumers have any hope of saving the planet?", "authors": ["Win Mccormack"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1f6fb6ca06d0505b1904bf600fd3e718a7fa9212.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
