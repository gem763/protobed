She\u2019s the first parent to be sentenced among 34 charged in the scheme.\n\nHuffman has admitted to paying $15,000 to boost her older daughter\u2019s SAT scores in 2017 with the help of William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, an admission consultant at the center of the scheme. Prosecutors say Huffman\u2019s daughter was unaware of the arrangement.\n\nProsecutors have recommended a month in prison, along with supervised release and a $20,000 fine. Huffman\u2019s lawyers say she should get a year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine.\n\nThe case is seen as an indicator of what\u2019s to come for others charged in the case. Over the next two months, nearly a dozen other parents are scheduled to be sentenced after pleading guilty. A total of 15 parents have pleaded guilty, while 19 are fighting the charges.\n\nHuffman\u2019s legal team argues that she was only a \u201ccustomer\u201d in a broader scheme orchestrated by others. In past cases of academic fraud, they said, only the ringleaders have gone to prison.\n\nIn a Sept. 4 letter asking for leniency, Huffman said she turned to the scheme because her daughter\u2019s low math scores jeopardized her dream of going to college and pursuing a career in acting. She now carries \u201ca deep and abiding shame,\u201d she said.\n\nProsecutors countered that Huffman knew the scheme was wrong but chose to participate anyway. They said she wasn\u2019t driven by need or desperation, \u201cbut by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness.\u201d\n\nThe amount Huffman paid is relatively low compared to other bribes alleged in the scheme. Some parents are accused of paying up to $500,000 to get their children into elite schools by having them labeled as recruited athletes for sports they didn\u2019t even play.\n\nAmong those fighting the charges are actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who are accused of paying to get their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as fake athletes.\n\nAuthorities say it\u2019s the biggest college admissions case ever prosecuted by the Justice Department, with a total of 51 people charged.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman is returning to court to be sentenced for her role in a sweeping college admissions bribery scandal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Collin Binkley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/college_admissions-bribery_34853_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
