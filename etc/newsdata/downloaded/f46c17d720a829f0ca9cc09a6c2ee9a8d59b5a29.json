How can I remember something that goes back 80 years?\u201d\n\nGaining more than 101,000 views in two days, the 19-second parody video posted on Saturday depicts a likeness of the Uniqlo TV commercial, which the company began airing this month in South Korea and other markets.\n\nIn the parody, South Korean college student Youn Dong-hyeun stands with Yang Geum-deok, a 90-year-old woman who had been a forced labourer for Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi during World War Two.\n\nYoun, a history major, asks how hard it was for Yang when she was young. \u201cIt is impossible to ever forget that awfully painful memory,\u201d she replies. Youn has posted the video with subtitles in English and Japanese.\n\nUniqlo, owned by Japan\u2019s Fast Retailing Co Ltd, pulled the ad in South Korea on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere was no intention to touch on the issue of comfort women or the South Korea-Japan dispute,\u201d a Uniqlo official in Seoul told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nA university student Bang Seulkichan stands with banners as a protest against recent released Uniqlo commercial in front of a Uniqlo store in Seoul, South Korea, October 22, 2019. The banner reads \u201cColonial rule 80 years ago \u2013 we remember!\u201d REUTERS/Heo Ran\n\n\u201cComfort women\u201d is a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan\u2019s wartime brothels.\n\nRelations between the two countries are at their poorest in decades after a ruling by South Korea\u2019s top court last year ordering Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate wartime forced labourers.\n\nIn July, Japan tightened controls on exports of three key high-tech materials to South Korea. Seoul accused Tokyo of taking the step in retaliation to the court ruling, prompting a wide-ranging boycott of Japanese products.\n\n\u201cWE REMEMBER\u201d\n\nSouth Korea and Japan share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including the use of comfort women.\n\nSouth Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon travelled to Japan on Tuesday to attend Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in.\n\nLee\u2019s office said he planned to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, which would be the highest-level contact between the two countries since July\u2019s export curbs.\n\nUniqlo has already seen its South Korean sales hit and a sharp drop in customers at its stores as part of the boycott.\n\nThe translation for the ad\u2019s subtitles, which was carried out in South Korea, was meant to help convey the message of the original commercial, the official said. She declined to identify who had performed the translation.\n\nStudent protesters took to the streets as the outcry against the commercial grew, demanding an official apology from Uniqlo.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBang Seulkichan, 22, was among those picketing a Uniqlo store in Seoul, holding a sign that read: \u201cColonial rule 80 years ago \u2013 we remember!\u201d\n\nPark Young-sun, South Korea\u2019s minister for small and medium enterprises, told a parliament committee on Monday the ad controversy was \u201cvery upsetting\u201d.", "description": "A commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo has stirred a consumer backlash in South Korea amid accusations that it mocks victims of wartime forced labour and brothel workers, reopening deep wounds from Japan's colonial past.", "authors": ["Sangmi Cha", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443597770&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0AT", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
