But his push won\u2019t have been helped by the French government\u2019s threat yesterday to veto a further extension due to the \u201cworrying\u201d lack of progress in the recent talks. \u201cThe British must tell us what they want,\u201d the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said.\n\nOn Johnson\u2019s return from Dublin, he\u2019s expected to make a second bid to trigger a 15 October general election by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. On what looks set to be a very busy day, the backbench bill aimed at blocking no-deal Brexit is also expected to receive royal assent.\n\nIt will all take place in the shadow of Amber Rudd\u2019s departure, with fears other Tory moderates may follow suit. The Guardian understands that since tendering her resignation, Rudd has been approached by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers who have expressed concern about the direction of the government.\n\nWith such high stakes, columnist John Harris asks why so many Brits are tuning out. \u201cAway from Brexit and the Tory melodrama, I\u2019ve found a mood of weariness and disconnection,\u201d he writes after visiting the north-west.\n\nYou can stay up to date on all today\u2019s developments on our politics live blog.\n\nWorcester Park fire \u2013 Firefighters have been battling a major blaze in south-west London in the early hours of this morning, with a four-storey block of flats engulfed in flames in Worcester Park. A total of 20 fire engines and some 125 firefighters were sent to the scene in Sherbrooke Way at around 1.30am after the fire broke out and quickly spread. The London ambulance service was also on the scene but said no injuries had been reported.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters were called to a blaze in Worcester Park early this morning.

Trump said he \u201ccalled off\u201d the talks after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast in Kabul that killed 12 people, including a US soldier, on Thursday. The revelation that talks were even taking place prompted anger from both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organisation that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop,\u201d tweeted Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger. The Democratic presidential 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar said the president was approaching foreign policy like \u201csome kind of gameshow\u201d.\n\nCarbon-neutral \u2018industrial cluster\u2019 \u2013 Energy companies have ignited multibillion-pound plans for the UK\u2019s first carbon-neutral \u201cindustrial cluster\u201d in the Humber. National Grid, Drax and Norway\u2019s state energy company, Equinor, are leading a campaign to shrink the carbon footprint of Britain\u2019s most polluting industrial zone by trialling world-leading technology to capture and store carbon emissions from factory and power plant flues before they enter the atmosphere.\n\nMMR jabs \u2013 A group of leading GPs has called for the measles vaccination to be compulsory before children start primary school. In a letter to ministers, the four London GPs, who include a former government adviser on health policy, have urged the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to embrace the proposed change. Doing so would save lives and tackle dangerous \u201ccomplacency\u201d among parents who do not ensure that their child is fully immunised, they say.\n\nIndia moon mission \u2013 The lander module from India\u2019s failed moon mission has been located. The mission, known as Chandrayaan-2, was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits that were confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008. The Indian space agency said it lost touch with the Vikram lunar lander on Saturday as it made its final approach to the moon\u2019s south pole to deploy a rover to search for signs of water.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Why do Dubai\u2019s princesses keep trying to run away?\n\nOla Salem discusses the divorce case of Princess Haya, who fled to London.

But in some cases low testosterone is to blame, and there are treatments available. Robbie Williams is perhaps one of the best-known cases of low testosterone, after his wife, Ayda Field, revealed last year that when the singer had depression in his 30s, doctors found he had the testosterone levels of an 80-year-old man. Testosterone replacement therapy, apparently, made an instant difference to his energy levels, giving him a \u201cnew lease of life\u201d. In the UK, it can come in the form of a cream or an injection, costing up to \u00a328 a month. It is generally older men who are more commonly affected \u2013 as many as 10% of men aged 40 to 60 have low testosterone, increasing to one in five among those aged between 60 and 80.\n\nSport\n\nJoe Root vowed to plough on as England\u2019s Test captain as he processed the raw emotion of seeing his side\u2019s bid to regain the Ashes evaporate with the 185-run defeat in Manchester. Afterwards, Australia captain Tim Paine offered a heavy nod towards \u201cthe best player we\u2019ve seen\u201d; it was always going to be tough for England given the genius of Steve Smith, but also the world\u2019s best pace attack. In a men\u2019s final that had pretty much everything, Rafael Nadal turned back the challenge of the dazzling young Russian Daniil Medvedev in five sets to win his fourth US Open. Serena Williams has lost her past four grand slam finals but still has the fire inside to win her 24th major, the same as the Australian Margaret Court. Jonny Wilkinson, England\u2019s World Cup winning fly-half, has spoken about his battle with mental illness and why no amount of trophies can ease the pain of depression. And Lewis Hamilton has called for consistency in penalty decision-making in Formula One, after he felt Charles Leclerc had not obeyed the rules during his victory at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\nBusiness\n\nIn more bad Brexit news, the accountancy giant KPMG has predicted a no-deal Brexit recession in 2020, forecasting the economy will shrink by 1.5%, taking business confidence down with it. Consumer spending, which has provided between 60% and 80% of growth in the economy over the last three years, would also be severely dented, KPMG said. The warning follows forecasts by the Bank of England and the Treasury\u2019s independent forecasting unit, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which have alerted the government to the negative economic consequences of losing access to the EU single market and customs union overnight.\n\nAnd British Airways pilots have gone in strike for the first time in a dispute over pay. Members of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) have said they will walk out for 48 hours, with a further strike set for 27 September if the row remains unresolved.\n\nThe pound is buying $1.23 and \u20ac1.11.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nMost of the papers lead on what promises to be another momentous day in the Brexit crisis. Given the complexity of the situation, it is not surprising there is considerable divergence on the top story of the day.\n\nThe Times splash headline says \u201cJohnson in retreat over delay to Brexit\u201d but the Telegraph reckons No 10 has a plan to thwart backbenchers\u2019 no-deal bill, saying: \u201cJohnson \u2018can legally stop Brexit extension\u2019\u201d. The i prefers the justice secretary\u2019s advice for the PM: \u201cYou do need to obey the law on Brexit, PM warned\u201d. The Scotsman reports \u201cJohnson will \u2018test to the limit\u2019 no-deal legislation\u201d. The Guardian throws it forward to focus on Johnson\u2019s trip to Ireland: \u201cPM heads to Dublin amid fears of more resignations\u201d, on which subject the FT says: \u201cVaradkar plays down prospects of progress on Brexit deadlock\u201d.\n\nThe Mail has its own Brexit scoop from an interview with cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, a remainer who nevertheless pledges to stay loyal to Johnson but demands of his approach to talks with the EU: \u201cWhat is your plan, Boris?\u201d. The Express proclaims \u201cBritain is still backing Boris\u201d.\n\nThe Sun says the PM will fight the no-deal bill in court but leads with: \u201cLittle Mix Jesy: my suicide bid\u201d. The Mirror ignores Brexit completely on its fronts and instead leads with a story on freed killer Kenneth Noye: \u201cRoad rage killer Noye\u2019s new love\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
