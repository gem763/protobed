The lawyers said Trump's acts formed \"a legitimate basis for an expeditious impeachment investigation.\"\n\nFox News poll: 51 percent favor Trump's impeachment and removal from office\n\nNo 'big deal': Trump downplays reports that notes from phone call with Ukraine president were locked up to avoid leaks\n\nThe Democratically-controlled House has opened an impeachment inquiry into the matter, partly based on a complaint from a whistleblower. The White House has said it will not cooperate with the investigation. Trump and his supporters have said one of the reasons they feel the impeachment process is not legitimate is that the whistleblower is able to remain anonymous.\n\nBut the lawyers' statement asserted that \"any efforts\" to \"intimidate or expose the whistleblower\" are \"contrary to the norms of a society that adheres to the rule of law.\"\n\nConway supported Trump in the 2016 election but has been one of his fiercest critics in recent years. He has long argued Trump is unfit for office and the former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference had already presented enough evidence to justify Trump's removal from office.\n\nOn Thursday, Check and Balances called Mueller's report \u2013 which \"revealed, among other things, that the Trump 2016 campaign was open to and enthusiastic about receiving Russian government-facilitated assistance to gain an advantage in the previous election\" \u2013 a \"warning.\"\n\n\"The present circumstances are materially worse: we have not just a political candidate open to receiving foreign assistance to better his chances at winning an election, but a current president openly and privately calling on foreign governments to actively interfere in the most sacred of U.S. democratic processes, our elections,\" the group of attorneys wrote.\n\n\"These activities, which are factually undisputed, undermine the integrity of our elections, endanger global U.S. security and defense partnerships, and threaten our democracy,\" they said.\n\n'You.
