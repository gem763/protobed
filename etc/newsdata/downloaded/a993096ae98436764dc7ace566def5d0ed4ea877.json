Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called \u201cfrontliners\u201d have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, there were a lot of people talking about this massive Democratic online fundraising as if it was somewhat of an aberration,\u201d said Cam Savage, a veteran GOP operative. \u201cI think it\u2019s the new normal.\u201d\n\nThe GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019. And while operatives insist the disparity is not insurmountable, Democrats have undoubtedly amassed a head start in a battle that will be waged in suburban districts that lie in the most expensive media markets in the country.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
