Rodriguez said in her first apology that she\u2019s a longtime Fugees and Lauryn Hill fan, and didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone.\n\nShe sang along to \u201cReady or Not\u201d and recited the racial slur as she sat in a makeup chair.\n\nIn a second apology shared early Wednesday morning, Rodriguez added that, \u201cThe word I sang, carries with it a legacy of hurt and pain that I cannot even imagine. Whatever consequences I face for my actions today, none will be more hurtful than the personal remorse I feel.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She said black women in Hollywood are paid more than Latina women. Detractors at the time noted the highest paid TV actress in the world that year was Sofia Vergara, from Colombia.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The \"Jane the Virgin\" star deleted the video posted Tuesday and replaced it with an apology, but not before memes and other backlash ensued.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gina-rodriguez-nword-apology.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
