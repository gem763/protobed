But that's what we knew would happen if we won test matches.\n\n\"It gives the players - I don't know if there's one word for it - but it makes us incredibly proud. We are playing for 125 million people and most of them don't normally support rugby. But they are behind us.\"\n\nMuch of that new-found favour came following the surprise 19-12 victory over high-ranking Ireland in their second Pool A game, which has presented Japan with the chance to not only qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time, but also secure top spot in the group and avoid New Zealand in the next stage.\n\nBut Joseph has also cautioned that the Ireland victory has perhaps raised expectations a little too high.\n\n\"I've got to put everybody straight. We've got a really awesome opportunity to do something that's not been done before. No-one thought we could beat Ireland and now they think we can win every game we play. That's how silly it is.\"\n\nHe said they are not looking at anything beyond the crucial Scotland fixture having also claimed three wins at the 2015 World Cup in England, which were not enough to secure a place in the knockout stages.\n\n\"It's game-by-game. Enjoy this week again and then get back for what's going to be a really tough game against Scotland.\"", "description": "Rising support, and expectations, lift hosts Japan at World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF9501M_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
