Bernie Sanders unveiled his proposal for a wealth tax on Tuesday \u2013 which is particularly potent when compared to the plans of others in the party \u2013 as support for the tax gains momentum.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSanders, who dubbed his tax \u201cextreme,\u201d appears to have even out-done 2020 rival Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who unveiled a wealth tax in January.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren also has been actively campaigning on implementing a wealth tax if elected, but the timeframe and revenue projections for Sanders\u2019 proposal appear to be much more aggressive,\u201d Geoffrey Weinstein, special counsel in the Tax, Trusts & Estates Department of Cole Schotz, told FOX Business.\n\nAs opposed to taxes levied on income and payrolls, a wealth tax would target the value of accumulated assets owned by rich Americans \u2013 or their net worth.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the differences between the two plans:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho will pay?\n\nSen. Warren has said her tax would be on \u201cultra-millionaires,\u201d starting for those with more than $50 million in assets.\n\nSanders\u2019 tax would kick in for married couples with $32 million in assets \u2013 or individuals with $16 million.\n\nRates\n\nWarren\u2019s wealth tax begins at a rate of 2 percent, climbing to 3 percent on households with more than $1 billion in assets.\n\nSanders\u2019 tax starts at 1 percent, but is much more progressive.\n\nA 2 percent rate applies to those with net worth values between $50 million and $250 million; 3 percent for $250 million to $500 million, 4 percent for $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for $1 billion to $2.5 billion, 6 percent for $2.5 billion to $5 billion, 7 percent for $5 billion to $10 billion and 8 percent for anyone with more than $10 billion in assets. For individuals, those values are halved.\n\nHow many people affected?\n\nSen. Warren estimates her plan would affect 70,000 households.\n\nAbout 180,000 households would be subject to Sanders\u2019 wealth tax.\n\nRevenues\n\nWarren expects her proposal would generate $2.75 trillion over the course of a decade.\n\nSanders\u2019 estimates his would raise $4.35 trillion over the same amount of time.\n\nEnforcement\n\nWarren calls for a 40 percent exit tax, a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget and a minimum audit rate for taxpayers subject to her tax.\n\nSanders calls for the creation of a \u201cnational wealth registry,\u201d as well as significant additional third party reporting requirements and necessitates that the IRS step up audits. The audit rate would be 100 percent for billionaires and 30 percent for wealth tax returns of the top 1 percent. There would also be a 40 percent to 60 percent exit tax.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Sanders estimates his proposal will raise $4.35 trillion over a decade.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-Reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
