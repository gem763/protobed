The first of these would be how banks make their pricing decisions when setting residential mortgage rates, including their response to official movements in the cash rate. This will take into account such factors as the bank's borrowing costs and their profit margins.\n\nSecondly, it will look at whether customers are being gouged by the so-called \"loyalty tax\" by assessing the extent to which the prices paid by new and existing customers differ, as well as the difference between the reference interest rates published by suppliers and the interest rates paid by customers.\n\nThirdly, it will consider the impediments that discourage people from switching banks and what action could be taken to reduce these impediments.\n\nThe inquiry will deliver its findings on pricing decisions related to rate cuts as well as the \"loyalty tax\" on March 30, next year. This creates the potential for response measures to be announced on or before the May budget.\n\nIt also heaps pressure on the banks to pass on in full the next rate cut, which the RBA hinted, when it last cuts rates, could be as early as Melbourne Cup Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ACCC's findings into impediments to switching banks will be in the final report due September 30.\n\nIn 2010, then-Labor treasurer Wayne Swan announced a comprehensive package of measures to help people switch banks which included banning exit fees on new mortgages, boosting consumer flexibility to transfer deposits and mortgages, and empowering the smaller banks so they could compete better with their bigger counterparts.\n\nNo rise in bank levy\n\nThe Coalition government is already implementing consumer data rights giving customers greater access to their personal information and making it easier to switch banks.\n\nIn recent weeks, both Mr Frydenberg and ACCC chairman Rod Sims have effectively accused banks of slugging customers with a \"loyalty tax'', which is hitting long-term customers with higher interest rates in the knowledge they won't switch.\n\nThe same term was used by the government against power companies, which also relied on customers not having the time or inclination to shop around for a better deal.\n\nLast week, Mr Frydenberg said banks were happy \u201cleaving their existing customers in the cold\u201d to win new business, but stopped short of recommending a default market offer-style mechanism for mortgages, similar to the model introduced into the energy sector to stop providers profiting off customer inertia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Frydenberg has ruled out any further increase in the bank levy, something Labor flagged when the banks refused to pass on in full the October rate cut.\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers called then for a new ACCC inquiry and an increased hike in the bank levy as options.\n\n\u201cWe do want our financial system to be as competitive as possible,'' he said. \"We do want to see those rate cuts passed through so that they can do good, not just in household budgets but in the shops and businesses and in the broader economy as well.\"\n\nMr Chalmers said Labor would not support legislation requiring the banks to pass on the full RBA rate cut.\n\nMr Frydenberg said the ACCC inquiry was needed on top of the banking royal commission because the commission looked at misconduct in the sector, not the way banks priced their mortgages.\n\nThe previous ACCC Residential Mortgage Price Inquiry specifically focused on whether the Bank Levy affected the prices charged for residential mortgages.", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has charged the consumer watchdog with investigating the refusal of the banks to pass on in full the recent spate of interest rate cuts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1751%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/efc7e485bdcd02d2efb15d864b00e67d8a798b7c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
