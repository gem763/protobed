He said he would soon sign an order permitting sanctions to be imposed on current and former Turkish officials.\n\n\"I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\" Trump said.\n\nAmerican troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal , a US defence official said.\n\nThe official, who was not authorised to be quoted by name, said US officials were weighing options for a potential future counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside of Syria, perhaps in Iraq.\n\nThe hurried preparations for a US exit were triggered by Trump's decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal.\n\nDefence Secretary Mark Esper said he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to urge European allies to impose \"diplomatic and economic measures\" against Turkey - a fellow NATO ally - for what Esper called Ankara's \"egregious\" actions.\n\nEsper said Turkey's incursion had created unacceptable risk to US forces in northern Syria and \"we also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict\".\n\nThe only exception to the US withdrawal from Syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called Tanf in southern Syria near the Jordanian border along the strategically-important Baghdad-to-Damascus highway. Those troops work with Syrian opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEsper said the US withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure that no US equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump defended his gamble that pulling US forces out of Syria would not weaken US security and credibility. He took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his Syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the Kurds and plays into the hands of Russia.\n\n\"Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,\" he wrote. \"I hope they all do great, we are 7000 miles away!\"\n\nTrump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops, believing it fulfils a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election, according to White House officials.\n\nThis has effectively ended a five-year effort to partner with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group. Hundreds of IS supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading Turkish-led forces and Kurdish fighters, and analysts said an IS resurgence seemed more likely, just months after Trump declared the extremists defeated.\n\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was \"gravely concerned\" by events in Syria and Trump's response so far.\n\nWithdrawing US forces from Syria \"would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"And such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States' strategic interests.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump got quick support from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had lambasted his withdrawal decision last week as \"shortsighted\", \"irresponsible\" and \"unnerving to its core\".\n\nOn Monday, echoing Trump, Graham said on Fox News Channel that the current situation was Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan's fault and Turkey would face \"crippling sanctions\" from the US on its economy.\n\nThe Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and Russia for military assistance, further complicating the battlefield.\n\nThe prospect of enhancing the Syrian government's position on the battlefield and inviting Russia to get more directly involved is seen by Trump's critics as a major mistake. But he tweeted that it shouldn't matter.\n\n\"Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other,\" he wrote. \"Let them!\"\n\nNew Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump was weakening America. 'To be clear, this administration's chaotic and haphazard approach to policy by tweet is endangering the lives of US troops and civilians,\" Menendez said.\n\nAAP", "description": "The US President announced sanctions on Tuesday (AEDT) aimed at restraining the Turks' assault against Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.388%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_77%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/27fbec7eabb445b13cda6f29e67be41ff92af69d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
