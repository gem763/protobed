In the best moments of your career you don't think too much, you just do. You feel the game and you use your skills. In rehab you get fit again but you lose your flow and rhythm.\n\n'To be really reliable again, you need time. We never lost patience, why should we? It is more difficult for players not to lose patience because you still remember what you could do.\n\n'It needs time. He made big steps in the last couple of weeks, but my expectation of Ox is pretty high. I'm impressed by the goals but know there is still more to come.'", "description": "Jurgen Klopp has urged English midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to raise his levels again in order to meet the lofty expectations Liverpool's manager has for his midfielder.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20193876-0-image-a-72_1572029709400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
