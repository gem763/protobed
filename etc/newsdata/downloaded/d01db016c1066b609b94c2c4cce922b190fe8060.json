REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nThe Los Angeles event is the second major presidential forum dedicated to LGBTQ issues during the Democratic nominating campaign, following an event in Iowa last month that drew 10 of the 19 candidates vying to take on U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBooker has written about his evolution from homophobic youth to college activist for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lead the people if you can\u2019t love the people \u2013 all the people,\u201d he said at the forum.\n\nTop contender Bernie Sanders missed the event while he recovers from a heart attack.\n\nGay rights advocates have expressed dismay at the Trump administration\u2019s record on LGBTQ issues, including a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.\n\nLawyers for the Department of Justice argued at the U.S. Supreme Court this week that federal civil rights law does not prohibit employers from firing workers based on their transgender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nThe forum will also include South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who would be the first openly gay U.S. president; former Vice President Joe Biden; U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar; former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke; former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro; and businessman Tom Steyer.\n\nAhead of the forum, Warren, Buttigieg and Harris released plans to secure equality for LGBTQ people.\n\nAll three support the Equality Act, like most other Democrats, which would explicitly add LGBTQ protections to federal anti-discrimination law.\n\nThey also vowed to make pre-exposure prophylaxis, a drug that helps lower the risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus, accessible and affordable to all who want it.\n\nButtigieg said he would eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, in part by restoring the White House Office of National AIDS Policy that has gone dormant under Trump.\n\nAll three candidates promised to elevate LGBTQ concerns as president. Warren said she would appoint a special envoy at the State Department, while Harris said she would create a new White House position, Chief Advocate for LGBTQ+ Affairs, to coordinate efforts across the entire federal government.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, an awkward teenager at St. Joe High School in South Bend, Indiana, who didn\u2019t know a single out LGBTQ+ student there, never would have imagined how far we would come as a country,\u201d wrote Buttigieg, who has spoken frankly in public about his struggle to come out. \u201cBut what does our country look like to a teenager in 2019, just starting to realize who they are?\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThursday\u2019s forum represents a fresh opportunity on the issue for Biden, who has seen his lead in polls wiped out by Warren\u2019s recent surge.\n\nBiden found himself defending his LGBTQ record at last month\u2019s event in Iowa, including his 1993 vote for the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, which banned harassment of closeted gay soldiers but barred those who were out from military service, a compromise with social conservatives now widely viewed as discriminatory and outdated. .\n\nHe later backed repeal of that policy and, while he voted for a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman, he backed same-sex marriage before President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president.", "description": "Nine U.S. Democratic presidential candidates began appearing at an hours-long televised town hall on Thursday focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, starting with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who stressed inclusion and love.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439276564&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991AN", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
