Now, thanks to 1,600 potentially formaldehyde-tainted phone booths, many of its offices reportedly have the odour to match.\n\nAfter years of coasting as a unicorn, the tech-y real-estate company shambled toward the public market with an unearned valuation in 2019 and investors finally balked. Its IPO was cancelled. Its bizarre (even by start-up standards) CEO voluntarily stepped down.\n\nThe company is now so close to running out of money that banks and its major investor have prepped separate bail-out packages.\n\nAny one of those red flags should be enough for investors \u2014 or hell, even potential tenants \u2014 not to touch WeWork with a metre long pole. But if you somehow missed the message, the company helpfully announced today that 1,600 phone booths are being removed from the company\u2019s co-working spaces in the U.S. and Canada due to \u201cpotentially elevated levels of formaldehyde.\u201d\n\nFormaldehyde, you\u2019ll recall, is a carcinogen used in the creation of particle board and other cheap composite lumber. It\u2019s also an embalming agent.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, WeWork sent out emails informing tenants at impacted locations Monday morning, noting that it had received complaints of \u201codour and eye irritation.\u201d After commissioning outside testing, the company apparently decided the phone booths should join the other extraneous, potentially harmful parts of its business \u2014 a private jet, a preschool, a fitness club \u2014 it\u2019s rapidly trying to divest.\n\n\u201cThe safety and well-being of our members is our top priority, and we are working to remedy this situation as quickly as possible. After a member informed us of odour and eye irritation, WeWork performed an analysis, including having an outside consultant conduct a series of tests on a sampling of phone booths. Upon receiving results late last week, we began to take all potentially impacted phone booths out of service,\u201d a WeWork spokesperson told Gizmodo via email. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we are also taking approximately 700 additional phone booths out of service while we conduct more testing.\u201d\n\nAlmost anyone who set foot inside a WeWork should\u2019ve been able to smell that something was off. Those who resisted speculation turned out to be much more observant than they could\u2019ve imagined.", "description": "WeWork, the latest tech darling turned venture-funded flameout, sure looks like a walking corpse.
