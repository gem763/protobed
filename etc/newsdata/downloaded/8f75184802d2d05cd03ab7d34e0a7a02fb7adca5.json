It's Now An Official Design.", "language": "en", "text": "A Florida fourth-grader was bullied for his homemade University of Tennessee T-shirt on his school\u2019s college colors day \u2015 so the university made it into an official design.\n\nIt all began when the unnamed boy\u2019s teacher, Laura Snyder, shared the heart-wrenching story to Facebook last week.\n\nShe explained that the student approached her ahead of college colors day to say he wanted to represent the University of Tennessee, but didn\u2019t have a shirt. She told him he could wear an orange shirt to show his spirit.\n\n\u201cSo when the day finally arrived, he was SO EXCITED to show me his shirt. I was impressed that he took it one step further to make his own label,\u201d Snyder wrote in the post.\n\nSnyder said that after lunch, the boy returned to class, put his head on his desk and cried.\n\n\u201cSome girls at the lunch table next to his (who didn\u2019t even participate in college colors day) had made fun of his sign that he had attached to his shirt. He was DEVASTATED,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSnyder\u2019s touching post was shared thousands of times, and caught the attention of the university.\n\nOn Friday, UT\u2019s campus store released a custom-made version of the boy\u2019s shirt on their online store:\n\nShare in a Florida elementary student's Volunteer pride by wearing his design on your shirt too! Pre-order today for a late September expected delivery. A portion of proceeds from every shirt sold will be donated to @STOMPOutBullyng .https://t.co/NdnTtYREFL pic.twitter.com/OeTZvgC09Y \u2014 VolShop (@UTVolShop) September 6, 2019\n\nThe shirt was sold so many times that the website crashed. The campus store said in a tweet on Sunday that their servers were still down.\n\nThe teacher said that the college also sent a care package to her student, which she gave to him on Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I can put into words his reaction. It was so heartwarming,\u201d she said in an update on her post.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him that his design was being made into a real shirt and people wanted to wear it, his jaw dropped. He had a big smile on his face, walked taller, and I could tell his confidence grew today!\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother said in a letter to Snyder that she was blown away by the love and support for her son and hoped the entire incident would serve as \u201cinspiration for him throughout his life.\u201d\n\nUT says a portion of proceeds from the shirt will be donated to STOMP Out Bullying, a national nonprofit working to prevent and reduce bullying.", "description": "The University of Tennessee turned the fourth-grader's design into an official shirt.
