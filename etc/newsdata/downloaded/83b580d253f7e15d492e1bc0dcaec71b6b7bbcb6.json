Then, a few seconds later, more of them come.\n\n\"There were around 10-15 in the end, but most alarmingly they were armed with long bars. The bouncers out there are a law unto themselves.\n\nRichard, of Dartford, Kent, snapped his ankle and was lucky to be able to walk down the aisle weeks later.\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\nDisturbing photos show the pals in agony on the streets of Benidorm and later following treatment in hospital.\n\nJustin, a self-employed chauffeur in Dartford, himself suffered an elbow fracture and severe bruising to his ribs.\n\nOthers smashed their knees, needed stitches for huge wounds, suffered concussion and broken bones.\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\n\"We didn\u2019t stand a chance, it was like a wasps nest. We didn\u2019t even want trouble,\" Justin continued.\n\n\"We just ventured out the hotel, for the strip but it was an extremely seedy sex scene. There were prostitutes everywhere.\n\n\"We went in two bars, then stayed in the third and then this happened.\n\n\"We weren't heavily drunk. It was horrific.\"\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\n(Image: Justin Scrutton)\n\nThe group had to cut the trip short and return home back in May.\n\nBut despite his nasty injuries, father-of-two Richard was able to marry teaching assistant Leanne in June.\n\nWith beaches, theme parks and plenty of accommodation, Benidorm is a bustling seaside resort.\n\nMore than 11 million people, many of whom Brits, visit the resort every year.\n\nTourism is a huge part of Benidorm's economy.", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.
