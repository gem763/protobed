There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, has been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values - we are an American business - travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets were of massive interest in China, largely because of Yao Ming - the Chinese star who spent his entire NBA career in Houston. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its ties to the Rockets because of the tweet.\n\nMorey has not commented publicly since a pair of tweets on Oct. 6 attempting to clarify his position.\n\n\u201cI understand there is a point of view from some that we shouldn\u2019t be in business at all in China, and I\u2019d say from an intellectual standpoint, that\u2019s fair - not getting into whether the tweet or the response to it,\u201d Silver said.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV did not air the two NBA preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets last week. Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion deal to stream NBA games in China over the next five years, has also stopped showing Rockets games but has not totally dropped all NBA content.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Chinese officials wanted Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to be fired for his tweet supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and the league emphatically dismissed the request.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/china-nba_relationship-what_next_96259_c0-164-3934-2458_s1200x700.jpg?f01b38b71c5c20568bd0fe93bd602272ab9d4a97", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
