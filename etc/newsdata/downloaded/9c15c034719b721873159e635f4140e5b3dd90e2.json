Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s been an sub-rosa issue throughout the earliest phases of the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination competition. But aside from a not-very-clear generational challenge by Eric Swalwell in the very first debate to Joe Biden to \u201cpass the torch,\u201d and a snide comment by Julian Castro in the September debate that suggested Biden had experienced a senior moment.\n\nBut it took a Bernie Sanders heart attack to make the age and health of candidates an issue moderators would raise and debate viewers would have to think about in an informed way. Citing his current age (78), Erin Burnett asked Sanders how he would reassure voters he was up to the job. As the Los Angeles Times reported, that led to a frank exchange involving the septuagenarians in the race:\n\n\u201cWell, let me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens, N.Y.,\u201d Sanders said, before promising a special guest and touting his website. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country that \u2026 I think can reassure the American people.\u201d\n\nTurns out Sanders was alluding to an endorsement he\u2019s about to get from a progressive icon from the other end of the generational spectrum:\n\n\ud83d\udea8SCOOP with @WaPoSean: @AOC is the \"special guest\"\n\nat @BernieSanders's Queens rally, and is expected to support him for president.\ud83d\udea8https://t.co/H1I9woghzG \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) October 16, 2019\n\nAs someone who has openly worried for a long time that Sanders and Biden might be too old to serve as viable challengers to Donald Trump, I\u2019d observe that Sanders was very effective in this debate\u2013possibly more effective than the old pre-heart attack Sanders who tended to shout ever more loudly in events like this one. But Burnett asked the question to the other seniors in the field:\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and experience \u2014 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said, adding that he would release his medical records before the first voting occurred in February.\n\nAnd she also asked Warren, whose age may have come as a surprise to people who hadn\u2019t heard about it:\n\nWarren, who is frequently seen sprinting to the stage at her events, added that age was less important than providing an ambitious plan to attract the American electorate. But she also pointed to her vigor. \u201cI will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThis rare reference to the possibility that Trump could be removed from office or might resign was striking. And when Tulsi Gabbard was brought in as a representative of younger candidates (at 38, she\u2019s a bit older than Pete Buttigieg), she trained her fire on the incumbent\u2019s age and unfitness. So nobody got damaged by the age issue in this debate, and nobody got in a telling dig, either.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t take another candidate\u2019s health crisis to get voters thinking about, and becoming comfortable with, the risks associated with eliminating the sort of informal age cap that before Ronald Reagan kept candidates below the retirement age more or less out of the presidential sweepstakes unless they were already in the White House.", "description": "After Bernie Sanders\u2019 heart attack, moderators asked him, Biden and Warren about their ages and health in the Ohio debate. They handled it pretty well, and younger candidates (like Gabbard) stood aside or changed the focus to Trump\u2019s age and health.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/15/15-warren-biden-bernie.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
