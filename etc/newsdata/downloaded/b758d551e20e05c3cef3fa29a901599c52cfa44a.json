We know this because of what has been found in ice cores drilled in Greenland, as well as from oceans around the world.\n\nGrains of pollen from various plants can also tell us about this cooler period, which people who study climate prehistory call the Younger Dryas and which interrupted a warming trend after the last Ice Age. The term gets its name from a wildflower, Dryas octopetala. It can tolerate cold conditions and was common in parts of Europe 12,800 years ago. At about this time a number of animals became extinct. These included mammoths in Europe, large bison in North America, and giant sloths in South America.\n\nThe cause of this cooling event has been debated a great deal. One possibility, for instance, is that it relates to changes in oceanic circulation systems. In 2007 Richard Firestone and other American scientists presented a new hypothesis: that the cause was a cosmic impact like an asteroid or comet. The impact could have injected a lot of dust into the air, which might have reduced the amount of sunlight getting through the earth\u2019s atmosphere. This might have affected plant growth and animals in the food chain.\n\nResearch we have just had published sheds new light on this Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis. We focus on what platinum can tell us about it.\n\nHow platinum fits into the picture\n\nPlatinum is known to be concentrated in meteorites, so when a lot of it is found in one place at one time, it could be a sign of a cosmic impact. Platinum spikes have been discovered in an ice core in Greenland as well as in areas as far apart as Europe, Western Asia, North America and even Patagonia in South America. These spikes all date to the same period of time.\n\nPlatinum spike and temperature graph.\n\nUntil now, there has been no such evidence from Africa. But working with two colleagues, professor Louis Scott (University of the Free State) and Philip Pieterse (University of Johannesburg), I believe there is evidence from South Africa\u2019s Limpopo province that partly supports the controversial Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.\n\nThe new information has been obtained from Wonderkrater, an archaeological site with peat deposits at a spring situated outside a small town to the north of Pretoria. In a sample of peat we have identified a platinum spike that could at least potentially be related to dust associated with a meteorite impact somewhere on earth 12,800 years ago.\n\nThe platinum spike at Wonderkrater is in marked contrast to almost constantly low (near-zero) concentrations of this element in adjacent levels. Subsequent to that platinum spike, pollen grains indicate a drop in temperature. These discoveries are entirely consistent with the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.\n\nWonderkrater is the first site in Africa where a Younger Dryas platinum spike has been detected, supplementing evidence from southern Chile, in addition to platinum spikes at 28 sites in the northern hemisphere.\n\nWe are now asking a question which needs to be taken seriously: surely platinum-rich dust associated with the impact of a very large meteorite may have contributed to some extent to major climatic change and extinctions?\n\nA meteorite crater in Greenland\n\nVery recently a large meteorite crater with a diameter of 31km was discovered in northern Greenland, beneath the ice of the Hiawatha glacier. It is not certain that it dates to the time of the Younger Dryas, but the crater rim is fresh, and ice older than 12,800 years is missing.", "description": "Scientists suggest platinum-rich cosmic dust and its associated environmental effects may have contributed to the extinction of large animals in Africa", "authors": ["Francis Thackeray"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tutywr_2BR7z1JjVqIoJfQ--~B/aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/7cb49643e0f2d6dd84076eceb6ff9bf4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
