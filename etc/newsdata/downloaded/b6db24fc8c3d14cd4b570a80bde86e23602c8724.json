Can it protect them?\n\nDuring World War II Japan found that control of islands offered some strategic advantages, but not enough to force the United States to reduce each island individually. Moreover, over time the islands became a strategic liability, as Japan struggled to keep them supplied with food, fuel and equipment. The islands of the SCS are conveniently located for China, but do they really represent an asset to China\u2019s military? The answer is yes, but in an actual conflict the value would dwindle quickly.\n\nThe Installations\n\nChina has established numerous military installations in the South China Sea, primarily in the Spratly and Paracel Islands. In the Spratlys, China has built airfields at Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross, along with potential missile, radar and helicopter infrastructure at several smaller formations. In the Paracels, China has established a significant military installation at Woody Island, as well as radar and helicopter facilities in several other areas. China continues construction across the region, meaning that it may expand its military presence in the future. The larger bases (Subi, Mischief, Fiery Cross and Woody Island) have infrastructure necessary for the management of military aircraft, including fighters and large patrol craft. These missiles, radars and aircraft extend the lethal reach of China\u2019s military across the breadth of the South China Sea.\n\nRecommended: Stealth vs. North Korea\u2019s Air Defenses: Who Wins?\n\nRecommended: America\u2019s Battleships Went to War Against North Korea\n\nRecommended: 5 Places World War III Could Start in 2018\n\nMissiles\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "But Beijing is building them anyway.", "authors": ["Robert Farley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vTpLUZYlmoXnUeyQ_M.eww--~B/aD05NDU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/fdb39fb3dc2714ffc9f196a3804feb96", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
