It is understood he was killed for refusing to give up his bike to thieves.\n\nIn the weeks after his death, his family were horrified to learn there is no minimum sentence for carrying a knife.\n\nThey believe that if there was a stronger deterrent against having a knife in place, Leo may still be alive today.\n\nAnthony and Natalie Marcus, Leo\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, first heard he had been stabbed in a phone call from his father Cliff.\n\nThey rushed to the hospital where they spent the next five and a half hours waiting for news of Leo\u2019s condition before being told he would not survive his injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We were all there praying that it was going to be ok and we honestly thought it would.\n\n\u2018We never ever thought that he was not going to make it.\u2019\n\nLeo\u2019s family are desperate that his death makes a difference to other young people (Picture: supplied)\n\nLeo (third from right) at the wedding of his brother Anthony and sister-in-law Natalie (Picture: supplied)\n\nShe added: \u2018When the doctor came down to tell us that he wasn\u2019t going to make it, my husband turned to me and broke down and said, \u201chow can I tell my younger brothers that he\u2019s dead\u201d.\n\n\u2018We just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. We feel totally, totally robbed of his life.\u2019\n\nLeo had a smile that could light up a room, Natalie said. He was killed on 10 July in Woolwich, south-east London, exactly three weeks before his 23rd birthday.\n\nHe was not part of a gang, had no criminal record, and was just riding his bike in the middle of the day as he always did, Natalie said.\n\nThe family believe his death could have easily been avoided.\n\nShe said: \u2018It\u2019s just been such a difficult process.\n\n\u2018Leo was just a normal boy. He loved riding his bike. He loved his nieces and nephews.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s that realisation that someone took his life away at such a young age and so immediately. For us, this loss is going to be such a huge whole in our hearts.\u2019\n\nNatalie said her brother-in-law \u2018lit up the room with his smile\u2019 (Picture: supplied)\n\nLeo was loved by his nieces and nephews (Picture: supplied)\n\nLeo\u2019s dad Cliff and step-mum Sarah Kerr set up a petition in the weeks following his death, calling for harsher sentences for people caught carrying knives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie said they hope Leo\u2019s death can spark a change so that no family has to go through the pain they still feel every day.\n\nShe added: \u2018We know that young people may carry knives for protection, to defend themselves. Others will because they want to go out and attack.\n\n\u2018But if there was that fear that they could get in serious trouble for being found with a knife \u2013 maybe they would be less likely to pick one up.\n\n\u2018Leo\u2019s younger brothers now, they are scared. This happened just down the road from his home. They are in these streets all the time.\n\n\u2018It is scary that this can happen. And it can happen to anyone. It\u2019s a cliche but we truly never thought anything like this would happen to our family.\u2019\n\nLeo was killed just streets away from his family home (Picture: supplied)\n\n\u2018We feel we have been totally robbed of his life\u2019 Natalie said (Picture: supplied)\n\nThe family\u2019s petition calling for \u2018Leo\u2019s Law\u2019 to create a minimum sentence for knife possession hit 10,000 signatures on the day of Leo\u2019s funeral.\n\nNatalie said: \u2018We were all in church and Leo\u2019s dad got the alert and Cliff just stood up and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve just hit 10,000\u201d.\n\n\u2018The whole church started cheering and chanting Leo\u2019s name. He was so, so loved.\u2019\n\nShe and the rest of Leo\u2019s family hope they can reach 100,000 signatures on their petition so it can be considered for debate by MPs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie added: \u2018Leo was just the kindest person. We feel that we cannot let his death pass us by and do nothing to change the current situation on our streets.\u2019\n\nYou can sign the petition here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
