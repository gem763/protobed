Wait, what if I told you I was gay?\u2019 Joyner raps on the 13-second preview of the track.\n\nTo which Em raps back, \u2018What if I\u2019m a hypocrite who\u2019s just afraid to face truth? Wait, what if I told you I\u2019m gay too?\u2019\n\nThe lyrics are quite interesting to say the least, considering the rap icon has been accused of homophobia in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat If I Was Gay marks the duo\u2019s second collaboration \u2013 Eminem had previously collaborated with Joyner on the track Lucky You on his most recent studio album, Kamikaze, which was released in 2018.\n\nIt comes after the 47-year-old had previously been interviewed by the Secret Service over lyrics which apparently were \u2018threatening\u2019 towards US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn documents obtained by BuzzFeed News via the Freedom Of Information Act, it was confirmed that Secret Service Agents interviewed the rapper about the lyrics from the song Framed, off his 2017 album Revival.\n\nThe song sees Em take a subtle dig at the President\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, as he raps: \u2018Donald Dusk\u2019s on, there\u2019s a Tonka Truck in the yard.
