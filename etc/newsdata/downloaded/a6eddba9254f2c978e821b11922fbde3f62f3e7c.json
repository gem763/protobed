I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he added:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great precedent to be releasing calls with foreign countries, heads of foreign countries. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great precedent.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump shrugged off the impeachment talk, saying he was not taking it seriously.\n\nDEMOCRATS SEEK DOCUMENTS\n\nCongressional Democrats on Monday demanded documents from the White House about the Trump team\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.\n\nThree House of Representatives committees \u2014 Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight \u2014 called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce documents related to contacts between Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Democratic-led committees said in a letter that they \u201cjointly request documents related to reported efforts by President Trump and his associates to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president\u2019s bid for reelection.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday hit out at Biden, calling him and his son \u201ccorrupt.\u201d\n\nNeither the president nor aides have provided any details of possible corruption by Biden when he was vice president.\n\nUkrainian officials, while acknowledging that they had met with Giuliani, have not said that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son.\n\nUkraine\u2019s former general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Reuters on Friday that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden\u2019s son in his relationship with the energy firm.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and the New York Times on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader in the phone call to investigate the involvement of Biden\u2019s son with the company. He also asked Zelenskiy to work with his Giuliani, who had been urging Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden and his son in the July 25 call.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate Intelligence Committee was working to get the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general to speak to the panel to discuss the whistleblower\u2019s allegations.\n\nA Senate aide said a briefing with the panel\u2019s chairman and vice chairman was expected to occur this week.\n\nThe media reports about the phone call said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president under former President Barack Obama to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into the gas company in which Biden\u2019s son was involved was fired.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump responds to reporter's questions as he departs to Texas from the White House, Washington, DC, U.S., September 22, 2019.

Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases.\n\nA top official in Zelenskiy\u2019s administration told Reuters\n\nthat Ukraine wants to stay out of the domestic political battle in Washington and that any attempt by either side to take advantage of Ukraine would damage relations.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday denied trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating his Democratic political rival Joe Biden, but wavered about whether he would release a transcript of a phone call that some Democrats say are grounds for his impeachment.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433131242&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1DR", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
