(AP) - The Oregon Liquor Control Commission on Friday a six-month ban on the sale of flavored vape products amid an outbreak of illnesses that has sickened more than 1,000 people nationwide - and killed two in Oregon.\n\nThe board made the unanimous decision before a room packed with marijuana processors, distillers and other business interests, some of whom criticized the action as overly broad and reactive.\n\nEarlier this month Gov. Kate Brown had ordered the temporary ban. Several other states, including Washington, New York and Michigan, have also imposed temporary bans.\n\nThe illnesses first appeared in March, with symptoms including shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Most who got sick said they vaped products containing THC, the marijuana ingredient that causes a high, but some said they vaped only nicotine.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority had asked Brown for broader six-month ban on sale and display of all vaping products, including tobacco, nicotine and cannabis. The agency also urged Oregonians to stop using all vaping products until federal and state officials have determined the cause of the illnesses.\n\nJason Thompson, sales director for a vaping processor called Sublime Solutions, said even the more limited temporary ban would force his company to lay off half their employees and cut pay for the rest. The Eugene, Oregon based Sublime extracts marijuana oil from dried cannabis flower and then adds popular flavors to the oil before it goes into the vaping devices that are sold under major labels for sale in Oregon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to kill immediately 70% of my company\u2019s revenue. It\u2019s based off of what we consider faulty logic and faulty understanding\u201d of the science behind adding flavor to marijuana vape pens, he said, after the vote.\n\nThe ban on flavoring does not include terpenes, or flavor compounds, extracted from pure marijuana, but Thompson said most customers don\u2019t want vapes that taste like pot.\n\nJoe Bergen, general manager for two companies, Avitas Oregon and Hellavated, said sales of vapes have already dropped because of the scare over lung illnesses and he\u2019s had to reduce his workforce by nearly 20%.\n\nHellavated makes flavored vapes, while Avitas only makes vaping devices containing pure marijuana. Hellavated will be \u201cheavily impacted\u201d by the new ban, he said, and it\u2019s unclear if the OLCC\u2019s move will help because the cause of the illnesses hasn\u2019t been determined.\n\n\u201cOne of the things this crisis has illuminated is that there is no long-term research on vaping and cannabis consumption, period,\u201d Bergen said. \u201cThere needs to be more research into both those things.\u201d\n\nTJ Sheehy, manager of the OLCC\u2019s marijuana technical unit, told commissioners before the vote that vape brands that contain flavor compounds are \u201ccompletely unknown black boxes in terms of their contents\u201d and that consumers have to \u201ctake on faith\u201d their safety.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, no one buying these things knows what\u2019s in them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ban goes into effect Oct. 15 and lasts until April 11.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Oregon Liquor Control Commission on Friday a six-month ban on the sale of flavored vape products amid an outbreak of illnesses that has sickened more than 1,000 people nationwide - and killed two in Oregon.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gillian Flaccus"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
