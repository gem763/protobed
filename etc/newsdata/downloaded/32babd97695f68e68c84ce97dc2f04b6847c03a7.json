Their involvement in the coup should not be taken as evidence that the mainstream clergy supported or participated in the coup, as Bayandor implies. And the clerics who did participate did so with U.S. support. Acknowledging the role of Iranian actors, including some of the Shiite clergy, in the 1953 coup does not absolve the United States of responsibility for the coup. Many historians of the 1953 coup, most recently Ervand Abrahamian and Ali Rahnema, have judiciously documented the overwhelming evidence that the United States played a central role in toppling Mosaddeq. But their voices are being drowned out by a shrill cacophony of opportunistic politicians and revisionist scholars and pundits. While British and Iranian actors played significant roles in the events before and during the coup in August 1953, it was the Americans who organized and led the overthrow of Mosaddeq, mobilizing and directing the Iranians who carried it out.\n\nThe 1953 coup was a clear case of blatant U.S. interference in Iran\u2019s internal affairs. Overthrowing Mossadeq was one of the earliest examples of destructive U.S. meddling in the affairs of other nations during the Cold War, and it should be taken as a cautionary tale about what happens when the U.S. tries to dictate the political future of another country. Our government bears responsibility for the coup, and it seems fair to conclude that without our government\u2019s involvement the coup would not have happened. Iran\u2019s political development was severely distorted as a result of the coup, and Iranians have been living with the consequences of this interference for decades.\n\nMeddling in Iranian affairs didn\u2019t just blow up in America\u2019s face later on, but it was also the wrong thing to do at the time. It was one of the first things Eisenhower did as president, and it was one of his worst mistakes. Whatever the U.S. might have gained from the coup in the short term has been far exceeded by the damage that U.S. support for the shah did to Iran and to U.S.-Iranian relations over the longer term. We need to remember the truth about this shameful intervention so that it isn\u2019t whitewashed and erased by propagandists, and we also need to learn from it that our government has no right to meddle in other countries\u2019 affairs.\n\nIt is interesting that the leading \u201crevisionists\u201d that have tried to cast doubt on the importance of the U.S. role in the coup are leading proponents of interfering in Iranian internal affairs today. Iran hawks today are strangely eager to minimize the U.S. role in 1953 in order to promote a regime change agenda now. They seem to think that if they can shift the blame for the coup to Iranian clerics that this will help to undermine the current government:\n\nIf the revisionists can pin the blame for Mosaddeq\u2019s downfall on the Shiite clergy of the 1950s, so the thinking goes, then they might be able to use Mosaddeq\u2019s ongoing popularity to mobilize Iranians against their clerical rulers today.\n\nThe problem for the \u201crevisionists\u201d is that there is so much evidence of U.S. culpability that this will never work, but their attempt to rewrite history needs to be refuted just as Alvandi and Gasiorowski have done in their article. Iran hawks want to rewrite Iran\u2019s past so they can justify another outrageous U.S. intervention in Iranian politics, and they mustn\u2019t be allowed to get away with it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iran.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
