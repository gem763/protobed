Today\u2019s forecasting is very, very accurate, but the path of Dorian hitting Florida is within a margin of error. The forecast currently is taking storm 60 miles offshore of Florida, where it would still be strong enough to impact the (state\u2019s) economy. But if it jogs to the left even just a little bit, we will see way more destruction and devastation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last storm that looked like this one was Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which occurred around same timeframe and was upgraded to a Category 5. It didn\u2019t hit Florida directly and it still generated $10 billion in negative economic impact.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c(Dorian) is a very uncertain storm, and that makes for negative implications on commerce,\u201d he added.\n\nBusinesses nowadays are at a massive advantage when it comes to preparing for storms of Dorian\u2019s magnitude, which in turn helps consumers to properly prepare as well, according to Walsh.\n\nAs Floridians statewide rush to supermarkets and gas stations to stock up on necessities, Walsh said modern technology, weather data and analytics will help prevent a shortage of those particular provisions needed during the worst of the storm.\n\nImage 1 of 5 \u25bc Photograph shows the filled Publix parking lot ahead of Hurricane Dorian landfall, August 29, 2019.

Businesses have had plenty of advance notice to prepare for this storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a retail perspective, stores need to know a few things in advance. What do people buy during storm preparations like we see with Dorian? How much of it do they buy during a time like this? The answers to those questions are married to the forecast, and with technology and analytics, retail businesses can put in place an ability to optimize those particular goods, which in turn helps people become more prepared for the storm as well.\u201d\n\nHowever, should Dorian hit Florida directly, the economic implications could be staggering.\n\nBack in 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused $65 billion worth of damage in the U.S. alone. Hurricane Katrina caused a whopping $150 billion. And in those two cases, recovery time took years, or has yet to be fully recovered at all.\n\nAccording to Walsh, determining the overall economic impact of a massive superstorm or hurricane depends on three separate phases.\n\n\u201cThere are three phases of a storm like this on businesses. The first is the forecast factor, which is what we\u2019ve seen the past three or four days, focusing on preparation for the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd oftentimes, that forecast impact be bigger than actual storm. People take these forecasts extremely serious, as they should.\u201d\n\nThe first phase sets about an economic stimulus, where consumers rush to retailers to buy provisions in bulk. What happens during the second phase, however, determines how damaging the storm will be financially and economically.\n\nShoppers load their truck with supplies to prepare ahead of Hurricane Dorian at The Home Depot on Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019, in Pembroke Pines, Fla.

And the third phase is recovery, which can take months or even years,\u201d Walsh said, citing Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned residents of Abaco Islands in the Bahamas to take immediate shelter on Sunday as Dorian makes its way northward, with maximum winds increased to nearly 175 mph and gusts over 200 mph.\n\nThe worst of the weather for Central Florida will arrive around Tuesday evening and last through the night, with Hurricane Dorian already tied for the fourth-strongest winds in the Atlantic since at least 1950.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "As Hurricane Dorian was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, FBN spoke with Global Director of Consumer Weather Strategy Paul Walsh on the economic impact Dorian may have on small businesses in the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/NWS-DORIAN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
