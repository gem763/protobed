Looks like we will be sitting down together soon. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 16, 2019\n\nThe comedian has been at the center of controversy since the NBC show announced the newest members of its cast for its 45th season last week. In footage from \u201cReal Ass Podcast,\u201d on which Gillis appeared in May, the comedian repeatedly referred to Yang as a \u201cJew chink.\u201d He had also made a host of anti-Asian comments, saying that New York\u2019s Chinatown is \u201cfull fucking China. It is [Chinese] down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the fucking chinks live there,\u201d he\u2019s heard saying in a mocking tone.\n\nIn another clip, Gillis was heard complaining about Asians \u201ctrying to learn English\u201d and claimed that it irritates him more than \u201cany other minority playing music in a restaurant loud on their phone.\u201d\n\nThe comedian\u2019s remarks were all the more disheartening because \u201cSNL\u201d had also announced the addition of Bowen Yang, only third Asian to join the cast in its decades-long history.\n\nYang responded to the racist rants while on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, acknowledging that anti-Asian racism \u201churts.\u201d However, he claimed that he feels \u201cour country has become excessively punitive and vindictive about remarks that people find offensive or racist and that we need to try and move beyond that if we can, particularly in a case where the person is, in this case to me, like a comedian whose words should be taken in a slightly different light.\u201d\n\nThe presidential candidate had also tweeted that he felt Gillis shouldn\u2019t lose his job over the remarks.\n\nYang\u2019s comments have since drawn further criticisms from many commenters online who felt Gillis shouldn\u2019t be excused for his behavior, regardless of the comedic context.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, a spokesperson for \u201cSNL\u201d claimed that they \u201cwere not aware of [Gillis\u2019] prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nGillis responded with his own statement, claiming that he\u2019s \u201ca comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can\u2019t be taken away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI respect the decision they made. I\u2019m honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a mad tv guy anyway.\u201d", "description": "The comedian had used an Asian slur in comments about the 2020 presidential hopeful.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8015d52300005805551a53.jpeg?cache=wxynuiucxv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
