Biden Jr., finds himself grappling with the fallout of a still-secret whistle-blower complaint that is said to be about Mr. Trump and his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nFor Mr. Biden, it is both the contrast he wants and the controversy he would rather avoid.\n\nThe revelations offered voters a preview of what is likely to be an extraordinary general election contest if Mr. Biden were to win the nomination, one in which attacks by the president and his team could boomerang, transforming Mr. Biden into a sympathetic figure under ugly attack with foreign help.\n\nIt could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a bygone era.", "description": "Reports that President Trump sought help from the Ukranian government could offer former Vice President Joseph R.
