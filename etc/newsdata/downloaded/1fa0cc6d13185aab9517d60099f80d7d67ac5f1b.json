(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nPentagon officials on Wednesday will begin notifying lawmakers who represent districts where key military construction projects will be delayed due to construction of President Trump\u2019s border barrier, according to two congressional officials.\n\nTrump issued an emergency declaration in February in an attempt to free up new federal funding for his controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall that had been denied by Congress and triggered a record-long partial government shutdown earlier this year. But since the border emergency was issued earlier this year, the Trump administration had not detailed publicly which projects would be affected.\n\nUnder the declaration, about $3.6 billion designated for military construction projects would be rerouted for border barrier construction. Of that, about $1.8 billion would be taken from military projects overseas, while the other half would come from projects in the continental U.S. and territories, according to one of the congressional officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement was not public.\n\n\u201cPut another way, there is no way to [redirect] $1.8 [billion] without touching health-safety-security-troops stuff,\u201d said one Democratic lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the impact of re-routing the funds.\n\n[Trump\u2019s declaration of national emergency hit with first lawsuits]\n\nHouse Democrats were informed of the Pentagon\u2019s plans at a Tuesday afternoon caucus-wide call. Defense Secretary Mark Esper had notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) earlier in the day.\n\nSchumer said in a statement that one of the affected projects is at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York.\n\n\u201cIt is a slap in the face to the members of the Armed Forces who serve our country that President Trump is willing to cannibalize already allocated military funding to boost his own ego and for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday. \u201cThe president is trying to usurp Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse and loot vital funds from our military.\u201d\n\nThough the administration, in its conversations with Capitol Hill, has characterized the projects as merely being delayed, it would depend on Congress approving new funds to revive them. House Democrats, who have uniformly opposed Trump\u2019s emergency declaration at the border, have vowed not to \u201cbackfill\u201d the money \u2014 a promise that Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who leads the House panel overseeing money for military construction projects, reiterated on the call earlier Tuesday.\n\nThe administration does not plan to provide a full list of affected projects to Capitol Hill until it has had a chance to inform individual lawmakers, congressional officials said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Under the emergency declaration Trump issued in February, about $3.6 billion designated for military construction projects would be rerouted for border barrier construction.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm", "Seung Min Kim Is A White House Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering The Trump Administration Through The Lens Of Capitol Hill.
