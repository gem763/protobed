However, the modern skyscrapers are only one part of the city\u2019s rich architectural heritage.\n\nThat soon becomes clear to anyone taking part in the Hang Lung Young Architects Program (HLYAP). It is an education initiative run by Hang Lung Properties in 2017, together with Walk in Hong Kong, an organisation focused on aspects of local culture, to give young people the chance to learn more about Hong Kong\u2019s architectural DNA and to understand the city\u2019s diverse cultural identity.\n\nThe second edition of the HLYAP officially began on September 28, 2019 and the theme this time is \u201cSketch Your Sky\u201d, with the aim of encouraging students to explore Hong Kong\u2019s built history and the relationship between architecture and communities.\n\nHearting HK: From secret spots to enjoy our famous skyline to chillax spots - what we love in the 852 this week\n\nDuring the opening ceremony for the 2019-20 edition, Weber Lo, Chief Executive Officer of Hang Lung Properties, noted that the company sees this as a way to serve the wider community by helping talented youngsters develop skills and knowledge in new areas.\n\n\u201cThe Hang Lung Young Architects Program allows young people to make full use of this architectural education platform to deepen their understanding of the beauty of and the stories behind architecture, thereby contributing to the inheritance and development of the Hong Kong construction industry,\u201d he said.\n\nStudents explore Hong Kong's history and the relationship between architecture and communities.

They were chosen by ballot from an initial entry of more than 750 students from 80-plus schools.\n\nWhile embarking on a journey \u201cto become young architects over the course of the academic year\u201d, students will also take part in a series of interactive seminars, workshops, walking tours and creative projects. These are all designed to stimulate and inspire participants to gain a better understanding of connections between architecture and the community, and learn how to do architectural modelling and use 3D digital drawing techniques.\n\n5 forgotten spots to snap the best photos of the HK skyline from for your Instagram feed\n\nLearning by doing\n\nThe HLYAP 2017-18 teams were set the task of designing their own architectural tours.\n\n\u201cWhen we started working on our project, I realised I didn\u2019t know a lot about Hong Kong,\u201d said Athena Chow Wai-yin, a member of the HLYAP 2017-18 champion team from Ying Wa Girls' School. \u201cIt made me want to understand more about my hometown. Later, I began to have new thoughts and ideas after learning about the rich history of some of the buildings we saw.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Nicavera Heung was a member of the HLYAP 2017-18 second runner-up team and, in the tour they devised, she took the chance to share stories and information about the Tuen Mun district where her school, YPICA Lee Lim Ming College, is located.\n\nStudents pose at 1881 Heritage, a Tsim Sha Tsui landmark revamped from the colonial-era Marine Police Headquarters.

But they all found ways to deal with that.\n\n\u201cWe just got on with things, dividing the work between team members to ensure everything got done on time,\u201d Chow said. \u201cWe also had a lot of fun coming up with the interactive activities and games we included as part of our tour.\u201d\n\nHow Hong Kong\u2019s skyline affects air quality in the streets\n\nHeung suggested that students participating in the HLYAP 2019-20 should aim to have fun and make the most of the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give our best, so that\u2019s what we kept in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cWe worked as a team, and I certainly learned a lot about collaborating with others and being more proactive.\u201d\n\nFostering talent\n\nStudents taking part in the HLYAP can expect support from 15 Programme Advisors, including leaders from Hang Lung\u2019s senior management, the construction industry and academia, and more than 70 other mentors and young architects ready to offer suggestions and guidance to the competing teams whenever necessary.\n\nNot all participants will go on to be architects, but for everyone the HLYAP is a great chance to acquire lifelong skills and explore new interests. For instance, Heung is currently thinking of a future career in business, but benefitted by learning the importance of good communication, teamwork and being fully engaged. Chow, though, has gone on to study architecture at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cAfter the program, I started to see architecture in a new light,\u201d Chow said. \u201cI thought about the design aspect, but also the connection with the community and became more enthusiastic about studying architecture and going into the profession.\u201d\n\nStudents, teachers, programme mentors and advisors are among those who join the opening ceremony of the Hang Lung Young Architects Program 2019-20.
