Thirty people were later charged.\n\n\u201cWe have tried petitions, lobbying and marches, and now time is running out,\u201d Australian activist Jane Morton said.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to rebel until our government declares a climate and ecological emergency and takes the action that is required to save us.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s conservative government has resisted adopting new environmental standards and backed lucrative coal exports.\n\nThirty more people were arrested in New Zealand\u2019s capital Wellington after halting traffic by chaining themselves to a bright pink car.\n\nThere were also protests in India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, which choking smog from traffic congestion has made one of the most polluted cities in the world.\n\nThe epicentre of past actions has been London \u2014 the movement\u2019s birthplace.\n\nA small group pulled up a mock nuclear missile outside the defence ministry building there on Monday.\n\nLondon police said they had made 21 arrests by 8:00 am (0700 GMT). The group said it was bracing for hundreds more.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said it was setting up 12 protest sites near government offices in central London that could block access to parliament and the prime minister\u2019s office.\n\nThe disturbances came at a delicate time in Britain as the government plans to leave the European Union on October 31.\n\nSome protesters banged drums and lay down in the middle of streets during the morning rush hour.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make radical changes and the government are just not on it \u2014 they\u2019re just banging on about Brexit,\u201d said Harriet Thody, 53, a mother of two from Cornwall, southwest England, as she sat in the road.\n\nFurther protests were planned in 60 cities around the world, including Buenos Aires and Cape Town.\n\nTwo are planned in the United States \u2014 in New York\u2019s Battery Park a few blocks from Wall Street and in downtown Chicago \u2014 and one in Toronto.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Burn capitalism!\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe movement is partially credited with pushing the UK government in June to become the first in the Europe Union to commit itself to a net-zero target for harmful emissions by 2050.\n\nBut now Extinction Rebellion is demanding governments reach that target by 2025.\n\nThe parliament in Norway \u2014 not an EU member \u2014 in June adopted a target of 2030.\n\nThere has been less movement in other parts of Europe or across Asia, where lung-clogging pollution forces many to commute wearing white surgical masks.\n\nAt the weekend, hundreds of activists barricaded themselves inside a Paris shopping centre for hours.\n\nGroups unfurled banners with slogans such as \u201cBurn capitalism, not petrol\u201d above restaurants and fashion boutiques.\n\nHundreds brought blankets and sleeping bags to one of the main roundabouts in central Berlin which police expect to be shut down for many days.\n\nDutch police said they had arrested 50 people after Extinction Rebellion protesters occupied a bridge outside the famed Rijksmuseum art gallery.\n\n\u2013 Shaming and seizure \u2013\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s tactics in Australia prompted senior conservative politicians to call for protesters\u2019 welfare payments to be cut and for public denunciations.\n\nSydney assistant police commissioner Mick Willing accused protesters of putting themselves and others at risk, warning that such disruptive protests in the future would \u201cnot be tolerated\u201d.\n\nIn London on Sunday, protesters alleged the police had been ordered to seize tents, toilets and other equipment as part of what it said were \u201cpre-emptive tactics\u201d against them.\n\nburs-zak/phz/rlp", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Climate protesters from Sydney to London blocked roads on Monday, sparking arrests as they kicked off two weeks of global protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/697eee_protesters-blocked-bridge-in-amsterdam-climate-protesters-block-roads-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
