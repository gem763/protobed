And her understanding of how to expand it to incorporate 20th-century classical music and boogie-woogie blues was not only ahead of its time \u2014 it was mastery for any era. We strove to offer such breadth in this collection. In addition to her own piano playing, we've included some of Williams' piano contemporaries like Bud Powell, Fats Waller and her friend Marian McPartland. You'll also hear Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington, for whom Mary Lou Williams helped arrange. We had to include the late Geri Allen, who worked with her \"Mary Lou Williams Collective\" to tackle the Zodiac Suite.
