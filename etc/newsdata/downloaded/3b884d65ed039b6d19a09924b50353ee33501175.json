We never really knew how to. We played the game as we saw it.\n\n\u2018We challenged our barriers where they were. I think the barriers have moved a long way. These guys, it\u2019s a new generation, they\u2019re quicker, they\u2019re faster, stronger.\n\n\u2018Everyone\u2019s more complete. Whatever number is on your back you\u2019re able to do everything.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re a prop\u201d. \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a winger\u201d. \u201cYeah, well, fine\u201d.\n\n\u2018I look at these guys and every position, they\u2019re challenging stereotypes.\u2019\n\nAnd Wilkinson is proud of the fact that his 2003 team will have inspired the senior men in Jones\u2019 squad.\n\nWilkinson's (top left) side from 16 years ago are revered in the nation\u2019s sporting psyche\n\n\u2018What we did in 2003 opened the door for people younger \u2013 at the age of 11 or 12 like Owen Farrell and George Ford \u2013 to go \u201cwow, these guys can pass left to right hand,\u201d\u2019 said Wilkinson, speaking on behalf of Land Rover, Official Worldwide Partner of Rugby World Cup 2019.\n\n\u2018You have got props looking at Phil Vickery thinking: \u201cJeez, he gets around the field\u201d. Suddenly by the age of 21 you have got incredible players.\n\n\u2018Players are going to get better and that's good because it is as a result of what we are doing. They are not better than us, they are better because of us. That's the beautiful thing.\u2019\n\nWhile Wilkinson himself felt caught up in the search for tangible success he sees this side as one who can go on to achieve greater things.\n\n\u2018This is a stepping stone for these guys whether they like it or not,\u2019 said the former fly-half, now 40 years old.\n\nWilkinson kicked the winning drop goal to give England victory in extra time in Sydney\n\n\u2018At the age of 21 you can see some of them being like: \u201cWell I've won the World Cup, I'll retire now.\u201d\n\n\u2018It's a stepping stone. Life gets better. Not measured up against lifting up a World Cup, it gets better because you get to perform again.\n\n\u2018And also you speak to guys like Lawrence Dallaglio and the other guys \u2013 Martin Johnson \u2013 I don't think he was thinking: \u201cI just need to get through this game\u201d.\n\n\u2018Those guys just loved battling. They loved it. They would have done it for another two hours in that game.\n\n\u2018I got the impression that most of our team wanted Elton Flatley to kick that last goal in extra-time in 2003 because they were thinking: \u201cwe don't want to win because your guy missed, we want to win because we win it.\u201d\n\nThe England legend thinks the current crop of players are superior in terms of skill and speed\n\n\u2018I got the impression those guys were excited. \u201cLet's get in there, we can go win it again.\u201d\n\n\u2018For me I was a little bit caught up in the reputation thing.\u2019\n\nBut he feels Farrell and Co will not be bogged down by the most important week of their lives.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll have the same press days, the same training sessions,\u2019 he explained.\n\n\u2018Maybe several more faces appearing at those press days, maybe more white shirts appearing around the hotel. That\u2019s the bit that looks different.\n\n\u2018Nothing to do with what the England team are doing. It\u2019s more how they managed that side of it.\n\nWilkinson doesn't think England will be bogged down by the most important week of their lives\n\n\u2018As you get nearer the end you get excited about arriving, and that\u2019s the danger because you start to feel \u2013 \u201cget me there\u201d.\n\n\u2018The arriving is a recognition of reward, and I feel that\u2019s the danger in a World Cup.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re getting closer. On a vulnerable day in the World Cup finals I was involved in - if you\u2019d got to me with a piece of paper that said \u201cyou can win this but you don\u2019t get to play,\u201d I\u2019d have signed that.\n\n\u2018I just feel like they are en route so much more than I was.\u2019\n\nLand Rover is Official Worldwide Partner of Rugby World Cup 2019.
