Lovecraft, the father of the cosmic horror genre.\n\nIt\u2019s not the evil clowns, the ghosts, or monsters that make King\u2019s books so scary, but their firm link to the society we live in.\n\nHe uses three of the most basic literary devices \u2013 foreshadowing, callback, and payoff \u2013 to achieve his scare.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\n\u201cThe terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years\u2013if it ever did end\u2013 began, so far as I know or can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspapers floating down a gutter swollen with rain.\u201d This is how Stephen King begins \u201cIt,\u201d his 22nd novel, published in 1986. It\u2019s a passage that really exemplifies what King does best: instantly engrossing you in the horrific and unknown. And it\u2019s this unique ability that has made him one of the best-selling writers of our time, selling over 350 million copies worldwide and earning him the distinguished title of Master of Horror.\n\nYet, despite his success and popularity, King is still a difficult writer to discuss among the literary circle. Once described by The New York Times as \u201ca writer of fairly engaging and preposterous claptrap,\u201d there has been a long-standing discussion on whether King\u2019s works are really literature or just glorified pulp. Nonetheless, King has managed to create some of the most iconic and haunting stories ever to come out of the genre. Which raises the question: How does he do it?\n\nLike any writer, King isn\u2019t shy to share his sources of inspiration, most notably writers like Richard Matheson of \u201cI Am Legend\u201d and Bram Stoker of the now classic \u201cDracula.\u201d But perhaps the writer that most closely resembles his style is H.P. Lovecraft, one of the most influential writers of the horror genre. He single-handedly created a whole new subgenre that is now more commonly known as cosmic horror, in which unknown cosmic entities and phenomena beyond our understanding, often portrayed as ancient, mythical monsters, became the subject of horror. But the monsters of Lovecraft were never really monsters.\n\nInstead, they were metaphors that symbolized Lovecraft\u2019s deep fear of the rapid technological and scientific advancements in the early 20th century. The helplessness he felt towards the changes around him reflected in the hopeless struggle of people against forces that are far beyond their control. Lovecraft believed that people\u2019s inability to truly understand their reality was the most merciful thing in the world and that doing so would be enough to drive anyone to insanity.\n\nIn many ways, this is the same kind of horror that King taps into. Whether it\u2019s vampires, a haunted hotel, or a rabid dog, the subjects of King\u2019s horror all represent our fear for something else. More specifically, the societal fears of the American people. In \u201cDanse Macabre,\u201d King\u2019s study of the horror genre, he explains that there are two different kinds of horror.\n\nThe first is horror that plays on our phobic pressure points. These are fears based on our individual phobias, like the fear of spiders or ghosts, something that a lot of recent horror movies have based themselves on. But these horrors also have a clear limit, as they target a very specific group of people with that specific phobia. Which is why more effective and successful works of horror play with what\u2019s known as national pressure points. These are political, societal, and psychological fears that are shared by a wider spectrum of people. Like in the works of Lovecraft and King, are represented by the abnormal and the supernatural. It\u2019s what King excels at, living through some of the most tumultuous periods in American history.\n\nHis debut novel, \u201cCarrie,\u201d on the surface a book about a girl with telekinetic powers, is really a story about the suppression of female sexuality in the \u201960s, published just six years after the famous Miss America protest in 1968. And in \u201cThe Shining,\u201d a book about a family stranded in a haunted hotel, King picks apart the concept of patriarchy that is deeply rooted into the American culture to discuss the cyclical nature of parental legacy. Sometimes it\u2019s more personal.\n\nTwo of his most famous works, \u201cMisery\u201d and \u201cCujo,\u201d deal with addiction and the lack of self-control it accompanies and were written by King during his own struggle with drugs and alcohol. Like Lovecraft, the horrors that King portrays are self-reflective and grounded in our reality. Which in turn makes the horror feel that much more real. They\u2019re representations of American fear. Things that threaten the very foundation of the society we live in. And just like Lovecraft, it\u2019s reality that terrifies King. As he once put it, it isn\u2019t the physical or mental abnormalities that really horrify us, but the lack of order in our reality they represent.\n\nSo, how does King put this on paper? The first thing to note is that situation comes first. King\u2019s books are often based on situations rather than intricate plots. Every single one of his works is based on a series of what-if scenarios. Like what if an ancient, cosmic evil in the shape of a clown terrorised a small town in Maine? Then he drops a group of well-fleshed-out characters right into the heart of the situation. But it\u2019s not to help them work their way free, but to simply watch what happens. And it\u2019s this spontaneity that allows for some of the most unexpected and shocking moments in King\u2019s stories. And it\u2019s impossible to talk about Stephen King without talking about suspense.\n\nAnother master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, once said suspense is \u201cthe most powerful means of holding on to the viewer\u2019s attention.\u201d And it\u2019s what King also excels at. Grabbing your attention and keeping it on something horrific, so you\u2019re unable to turn away. And he accomplishes this by applying three of the most basic literary devices. The first step is foreshadowing. Both his books and adaptations are riddled with lines and moments that hint at what\u2019s to come. This is why King\u2019s stories have an overarching sense of doom and dread.\n\nUnlike most horror novels and films, it\u2019s not the uncertainty of danger that has you on edge, but exactly when that danger will finally happen. Then, the next step is callback, where King racks up the suspense by continuously reminding the audience that the danger is lurking. And oftentimes, it takes a while for the danger to actually show its face. And then, finally, the payoff. In which the suspense we\u2019ve been building towards reaches its peak and we finally face the danger we\u2019ve been waiting for. And it\u2019s at this final moment that King scares us. And you can very well see this throughout King\u2019s career. Even in the passage that started this video. With just one line, foreshadowing the terror to come, a callback to the longevity of said terror, and, finally, the payoff to the very thing that started it all.\n\nAnalysing the works of Stephen King is a great opportunity to understand what really scares us at the end of the day. His works are prime examples that show us that our object of fear very much exists in our own reality. Sometimes it\u2019s not the monsters or ghosts that scare us, but the horrors of everyday life lurking in the corners, waiting to strike. And it\u2019s this horror that King knows and understands perhaps better than anyone. And if that\u2019s not enough to make him the Master of Horror, it would be hard to find someone else that deserves it more.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
