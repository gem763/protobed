The company is located in Jiaxian, in China's Henan province. (Jeanne Whalen/The Washington Post)\n\nJIAXIAN, CHINA \u2014 Yi Yake and his boyhood friends grew up in a farming village in central China, swinging sickles to harvest the family wheat crop.\n\nAs young adults, they ventured out of the farm economy. Yi got a job marketing computer games. His friend worked in a fireworks store.\n\nToday Yi drives a white BMW and, along with two childhood buddies, employs over 200 people in what is quickly becoming a boom industry in China \u2014 artificial intelligence.\n\nTheir company, located in a city near their parents\u2019 village in Henan province, provides an essential early service in the AI process, labeling images and videos to help make computers smarter. Before a self-driving car can learn to avoid hitting people or trees, it must learn what people and trees look like \u2014 by digesting thousands of images labeled by thousands of humans.\n\nDemand for labeling is exploding in China as large tech companies, banks and others attempt to use AI to improve their products and services. Many of these companies are clustered in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai, but the lower-tech labeling business is spreading some of the new-tech money out to smaller towns, providing jobs beyond agriculture and manufacturing.\n\nThe science is mired in controversy in China, where the ruling Communist Party is using AI to help it identify and track people in mass-surveillance programs, most prominently in the largely Muslim province of Xinjiang, according to Human Rights Watch. The rights group has raised concerns that China\u2019s private sector has aided the government surveillance by providing AI-powered software and other services.\n\nYi said his business, Ruijin Science & Tech, mostly works for Chinese tech giants Baidu and Alibaba, labeling footage captured by autonomous cars. Data labeling for autonomous vehicles is taking off in both the United States and China, as both countries invest heavily in the technology.\n\n[Google offshoot Waymo launches nation\u2019s first commercial self-driving taxi service in Arizona]\n\n\u201cI was working on online game promotion and never heard about the AI labeling business,\u201d Yi said during a break in his office, serving green tea in small ceramic cups. He and his partners noticed other small firms getting into the field and decided to try it out with an initial investment of $15,000. \u201cWe believed this business could become better and bigger,\u201d he said.\n\nJust outside his office, in a large room resembling a field house, employees worked cheek-by-jowl at long rows of computers, examining blurry images filmed by self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe employees, who earn $350 to $550 a month, drew digital boxes around each object on the screen, and labeled them from a drop-down menu \u2014 vehicle, human, obstacle, animal. If they selected \u201cvehicle,\u201d another drop-down menu with more options appeared \u2014 small car, motorbike, truck, train.\n\n\u201cSometimes there could be a train at a crossing,\u201d explained 30-year-old Kang Qing, though he added he\u2019d not yet encountered one after 18 months on the job. The workers mostly label objects located directly on the road, but when they see a human near the road, they label that, too, because a human could theoretically move into traffic.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young I heard about AI from robots in movies. It was a term that sounded mysterious to me,\u201d Kang said. \u201cIt\u2019s still mysterious, but I\u2019ve learned more about it, and I\u2019ve developed a more reasonable view. It\u2019s humans setting the rules for AI, and the scary feeling mostly comes from the movies, I think.\u201d\n\nKang and others said they hadn\u2019t yet seen self-driving cars in the real world, but the vehicles are being tested in bigger cities.\n\n\n\nBaidu is testing its self-driving cars in China. (Baidu) (N/A/Baidu)\n\nAt the Beijing headquarters of Baidu \u2014 China\u2019s answer to Google \u2014 autonomous cars, buses and sweepers roam the campus. The company is testing self-driving cars in 13 cities, where they cruise around in regular traffic. The Lincoln-brand cars, made by Ford, have a human driver at the wheel as a backup in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor now the cars don\u2019t ferry passengers, but Baidu says it plans to introduce a self-driving taxi service in the city of Changsha in October. The taxis, called Apollo Go, will be connected to the city\u2019s new 5G wireless Internet network, Baidu said. The company is using cars made by Chinese company FAW Group for that project.\n\n[Here's what it's like to ride in one of Waymo's self-driving cars.]\n\nIn the United States, Google offshoot Waymo last year launched the nation\u2019s first commercial self-driving taxi service, in the Phoenix area. Industry experts say U.S. autonomous-car companies generally outsource their image labeling to freelancers who work at home, or to lower-cost workers in countries such as India or the Philippines.\n\nMuch of Ruijin\u2019s business comes directly from Baidu and Alibaba, but sometimes the company gets jobs through outsourcing companies, said Liu Zhanjie, one of Yi\u2019s business partners. On a few occasions, that work has involved drawing digital boxes around photos of human faces, for use in payment apps, Liu said.\n\nFacial-recognition screens are cropping up at retailers across China, allowing customers to pay by having their faces scanned. Amos Toh, an AI researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there is concern among rights activists that the proliferation of facial recognition for commercial use could give the Chinese government more pools of data to access for public surveillance.\n\nLiu said Ruijin\u2019s clients were using the data for commercial purposes. How else it might be used down the road \u201cis beyond our job or knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nChildhood friends Yi Yake, Liu Zhanjie and Shi Xiaohui founded Ruijin Science & Tech near their hometown. (Jeanne Whalen/The Washington Post)\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Ruijin workers were handling a job for Microsoft, which had hired the company through an intermediary. The assignment was simple: drawing boxes around handwritten Japanese or Korean characters. A different company would later label each character with its proper name, so a computer could recognize the text. The process, known as optical character recognition, or OCR, is a basic form of AI.\n\nThe Ruijin employees guessed the work was aimed at improving a translation app, but they didn\u2019t know for sure. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t understand the text,\u201d said He Yongchao, 29, a high school graduate from the area whose previous tech experience was limited to playing computer games. \u201cWe just draw a frame around the image to crop the text \u2014 that\u2019s all we\u2019re responsible for.\u201d\n\nAI used to sound extraordinary to him, He said. \u201cNow I have more knowledge about it. ... The intelligence becomes intelligent based on a huge amount of manual work.\u201d\n\nSome data-labeling businesses have moved up the food chain. BasicFinder, a company in Beijing, has developed an online platform to handle data collection and labeling. Its customers include government clients, which have used the platforms to label text, images and vocal recordings, said chief operating officer Yolanda Huang.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know the ultimate purpose of the government\u2019s work. \u201cWe don\u2019t really think about it. We are a third-party service provider,\u201d she said.\n\nBasicFinder has also worked for a self-driving-car project at University of California at Berkeley, a job the firm got through its founder\u2019s connections, Huang said. UC Berkeley said BasicFinder is one of 10 data-labeling providers its autonomous vehicle program has used.\n\nAt Ruijin, sales this year are on track to be about 10 times as high as last year, Yi said from his desk, beneath a framed Chinese proverb: \u201cRide on the crest of success.\u201d\n\nThe company has hired dozens of new employees to keep pace, finding them through social media ads and a billboard near the office. Yi said he mostly seeks out young high school graduates, between 18 and 35, who are handy with computers.\n\nIn the past, some of these young people might have departed for bigger cities to look for work, \u201cbut now they don\u2019t have to,\u201d Yi said.\n\nAs the partner in charge of marketing, Yi often travels to Beijing and other large cities to meet with clients. Negotiating with tech giants like Baidu and Alibaba can be hard, and he is always glad to get home, he said.\n\n\u201cI visit Beijing often, but I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy the pace of life here in my small hometown.\u201d", "description": "Before a self-driving car can learn to avoid hitting people or trees, it needs to learn what they look like.
