And then he called the play.\n\nFor months, Jones existed as an object of mockery and a symbol of supposed organizational incompetence. On Sunday afternoon, in a 32-31 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he revealed himself to be the fluorescent future of the New York Giants. In his NFL debut, Jones passed for 336 yards, threw two touchdown passes, ran for two more scores, led a game-winning touchdown drive and, give or take depending on the accuracy of the latest New York City census, converted about 8.5 million skeptics.\n\nLast weekend, Jones was Eli Manning\u2019s backup and a source of blurry optimism for a proud franchise suddenly losing its way. Now he is the both the Giants\u2019 exciting present and unbridled hope for the future. The Giants\u2019 roster remains in decay, as the performance of their defense suggested. But they have Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram and Jones, and suddenly that looks like the basis of something real.\n\nBrewer: The Saints prove they are more than just Drew Brees in a win over the Seahawks\n\nIt\u2019s only one game, sure. But did you see that game? Jones stepped in for Manning, benched after having started 223 of 224 regular season games over 15 years while winning two Super Bowls along the way. The Giants, 0-2 to start the day, trailed by 18 at halftime. Jones lost Barkley, the engine of the Giants\u2019 offense, to a gruesome ankle injury late in the second quarter. Jones was sacked five times and lost two fumbles.\n\n\u201cHe could have easily shut it down and got discouraged,\u201d Engram said over the phone from Tampa, just before boarding the team bus. \u201cHe played it cool.\u201d\n\nJones dragged the Giants to a victory. He hit tight end Engram for a 75-yard touchdown on the first play of the second half. He dropped a gorgeous touchdown pass from a crowded pocket to Sterling Shepard, chased by two defenders. Trailing by six with 3:16 remaining, Jones marched the Giants downfield. He faced fourth and five at the 7, dropped back, saw the middle of the field clear and darted into the end zone.\n\nThe Giants still could have lost. Their defense, which seems to be terrible, surrendered 66 yards in three plays, which set up Tampa for a game-winning, 34-yard field goal. Jones\u2019s magic carried over to special teams: Matt Gay pushed the kick right, teammates mobbed Jones on the sideline, and Barkley sprinted on the field despite crutches and a walking boot on his right leg.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best feeling,\u201d Engram said. \u201cIt\u2019s so addicting.\u201d\n\nNo rookie in NFL history \u2014 let alone one making his first start on the road, in place of a quarterback who had won two Super Bowls \u2014 had ever thrown for at least 300 yards while both rushing and passing for multiple touchdowns.\n\nWhen the Giants drafted Jones sixth overall in April, both franchise and quarterback became targets of social media derision and tabloid ridicule. The New York Post chose \u201cBlue\u2019s Clueless\u201d for its back cover the next morning, splashed under a photo of Jones in a Duke uniform. NFL evaluators had a more positive view of Jones than media and fans, but public opinion took hold and built on itself. It became an accepted and easy stance that General Manager Dave Gettleman was a dope and Jones was a bust waiting to happen.\n\n\u201cOh, man, it honestly didn\u2019t faze him at all,\u201d Engram said. \u201cIt was bad on draft night. I knew it wouldn\u2019t bother him or hinder him. But I knew it would put something in his tank and motivate him. He\u2019s a great guy. He was prepared for the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout\n\nPreparing for the moment \u2014 that was the theme of the NFL week. Eight teams started a different quarterback in Week 3 than they started in Week 1, or planned on starting late in training camp. Those eight quarterbacks \u2014 Jacoby Brissett, Kyle Allen, Teddy Bridgewater, Mason Rudolph, Josh Rosen, Luke Falk, Gardner Minshew II and Jones \u2014 went 5-3 despite seven of their games coming on the road. One of the losers, Rudolph, put the Pittsburgh Steelers in position to win late in the fourth quarter.\n\nThose quarterbacks entered for different reasons and in divergent circumstances. The New Orleans Saints signed Bridgewater to the richest contract for a backup in the league as insurance for Drew Brees, and their careful planning paid off with a victory in Seattle. Allen and Rudolph replaced injured incumbents while giving teams looks at potential heirs apparent.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles showed the importance of a good backup two years ago, when Nick Foles steered a loaded roster to a Super Bowl title. This season will only reiterate that. Further injuries are inevitable. It is likely a matter of time before Dwayne Haskins receives the reins in Washington. Given Marcus Mariota\u2019s struggles in the wake of Tennessee not reaching a contract extension with him, Ryan Tannehill may get a shot behind center for the Titans.\n\nJones was not a typical backup. The Giants drafted him with the clear plan he would replace Manning. That it happened after two games showed both how ineffective Manning was and how quickly Jones had developed. His mobility ultimately won the Giants the game, but all game long it made New York\u2019s offense more dynamic and opened up Giants Coach Pat Shurmur\u2019s playbook.\n\n\u201cHe took a couple sacks, the fumbles, some of that loose stuff, we can work on that,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cThere\u2019s drills for that. But the stuff that he did in the game, there\u2019s not drills for that. We believed in him from the day we drafted him. And first time out, he didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s performance in preseason, when he completed 29 of 34 attempts for 416 yards and two touchdowns, reduced the volume of criticism directed at Jones. His promising first half validated Jones\u2019s preseason, and the second half eliminated any lingering doubt.\n\nIn the Giants\u2019 locker room, Shurmur told the offense his plan for the first snap of the third quarter. The Bucs would be expecting the Giants to run the ball to protect their rookie. Instead, the Giants would run play-action. The scheme put Engram on a linebacker, and Engram torched him over the middle, turned and ran for a 75-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cHe was definitely in a groove,\u201d Engram said. \u201cHe definitely is communicating. He just stays efficient, stayed cool. He had a swagger to him in the huddle.\u201d\n\nThat swagger had been missing from the Giants. It may have been just one game, but the Giants know it will stay there for a long time to come.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\n\u00b7 The Baltimore Ravens made a seemingly strange choice to go for two in their 33-28 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, down 30-19 early in the fourth quarter. But the math supported Coach John Harbaugh\u2019s decision, and given the NFL\u2019s growing embrace of analytics, you can expect calls like that to happen more often.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very savvy decision and increases your chance of winning over the decision to kick the PAT,\u201d Pro Football Focus\u2019s Director of Research and Development George Chahrouri wrote in an email. \u201cIt basically follows the same logic as going for 2 down 8 and you can draw it out assuming the Ravens get stops for the rest of the game, though it works out in other permutations.\u201d\n\nIn the Ravens\u2019 case specifically, Chahrouri pointed out, the math tilts even further in their favor. Playing the Chiefs in Kansas City meant they would be an underdog in overtime, and with a Lamar Jackson-led offense, their odds of converting the two-point try were higher than a typical 50 percent shot.\n\nJackson\u2019s run failed and the Ravens ended up losing by five, but Harbaugh made it clear he\u2019ll trust the numbers again in the future, even if it leads to unconventional strategy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep playing that way, just for the record,\u201d Harbaugh said in a news conference. \u201cWhen you write your article, just understand that we\u2019ll disagree with your criticism. We\u2019re going after it.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 The New England Patriots\u2019 blowout victory over the New York Jets bumped Bill Belichick\u2019s all-time winning percentage to .682, which ties him with George Halas. Belichick is an obsessive student of history, and so chances are that will mean something to him.\n\n\u00b7 Belichick glared at a CBS interviewer who asked him about the release of troubled wide receiver Antonio Brown, who played last week after a woman accused him of rape. Belichick\u2019s response was childish. He behaved as though his decision to play Brown should be of no consequence, that the only thing he needs to care about is what happens on the field. It was his choice to play Brown last week. To act like explaining that decision is an affront is ridiculous.\n\nRead more:\n\nRams overcome a slow start and late interception, hang on for a win over Browns\n\nAntonio Brown says he\u2019s done with NFL, blasts Robert Kraft and Ben Roethlisberger\n\nPatriots quickly moved on from Antonio Brown, but Julian Edelman\u2019s injury is an issue", "description": "Having spent months as an object of ridicule, Daniel Jones authored an impressive NFL debut after replacing Eli Manning.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IFFTR3W5S4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
