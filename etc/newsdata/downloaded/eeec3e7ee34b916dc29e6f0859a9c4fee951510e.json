If you are an EU citizen with a criminal conviction, you can travel to the UK, as long as you are not deemed to be a threat to national security.\n\n'If you are not an EU citizen and have a conviction or prison sentence imposed - even if suspended - you are banned from coming to the UK.\n\n'There are a number of very famous footballers with convictions and suspended sentences for tax evasion. They, thus far, have not had to worry as they have EU passports.\n\nImmigration lawyer Andrew Osbourne of firm Lewis Silkin says it could be a stumbling block\n\n'But post-Brexit, they potentially may not be able to enter the country (as they will be treated like non-EU nationals).\n\n'Anyone with a prison sentence of any sort, the starting point is you are not allowed in.\n\n'This could provide disruption to Champions League squads and also whether they (UEFA) will play finals in England if players potentially may not be able to come in.\n\n'Clubs will need to take steps.'\n\nThere is an expectation that Messi would be handed an exemption by the Home Office if the situation did arise.", "description": "The Barcelona forward has previously been convicted for tax fraud and as part of his punishment he was hit with a 21-month suspended prison sentence by the Spanish courts.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19374810-0-image-a-88_1570403453518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
