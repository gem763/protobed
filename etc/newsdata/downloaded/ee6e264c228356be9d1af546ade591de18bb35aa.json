We do need people to have varying opinions and it should be treated with respect so therefore everybody should have their freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nActually\u2026 ah fuck, sorry. There\u2019s been a mix up. That\u2019s what Kennerley said in 2016, when she defended fellow TV person Sonia Kruger for backing a proposed ban on Muslim migrants settling in Australia.\n\nHere\u2019s what Kennerley actually said about the climate activists today, as pointed out by Junkee:\n\nPersonally, I would leave them all super glued to wherever they do it, the guy hanging from the Story Bridge. Why send emergency services? Leave him there until he gets himself out\u2026 no emergency services should help them, nobody should do anything, and you just put little witches hats around them, or use them as a speedbump.\n\nYes, Kennerley\u2019s response to the concept of protesters disrupting peak hour traffic is to mow them down. Her response to an Extinction Rebellion protester suspending himself some ten metres below Brisbane\u2019s Story Bridge is to simply leave him dangling.\n\nWhile Kennerley appeared to back off from that run-them-over-lmao statement a moment later, she continued with her diatribe, suggesting authorities should \u201cput them in jail, forget to feed them.\u201d\n\nConsidering Queensland Premier Annastacia Palazsczuk appears to be juicing laws which could see protesters hurled into jail, Kennerley\u2019s wishes might not be too far away.\n\nThings got worse later in the broadcast, when the panel discussed recent criticism of Ellen DeGeneres, who was photographed palling it up with former US President and Iraq War instigator George W. Bush.\n\nAngela Bishop, daughter of former Howard Government minister Bronwyn Bishop, said \u201cif someone dares to air an opinion which is unlike yours on social media, you do not deserve to be heard, according to them.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened\u2026 but now if someone dares to disagree with you, they are to be silenced.\u201d\n\nThe message here, of course, is that free speech privileges are to be extended to media mainstays and political heavyweights, to the exclusion of folks drawing attention to the fact the humanity is cooked unless we drastically wind back carbon emissions.\n\nEllen DeGeneres has addressed the criticism about her friendship with George W. Bush after they were spotted together at a football game. @AngelaBishop: \"If someone dares to air an opinion which is unlike yours\u2026 you do not deserve to be heard, according to them.\" #Studio10 pic.twitter.com/ftalmNtJXl \u2014 Studio 10 (@Studio10au) October 9, 2019\n\nVery cool and normal all around.", "description": "The daytime TV queen is back on top and joking about extrajudicial killings on 'Studio 10'.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/kak-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
