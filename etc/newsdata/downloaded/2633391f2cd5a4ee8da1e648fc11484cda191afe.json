(Kamil Krzaczynski/Reuters)\n\nWorkers at Target stores are struggling to pay their bills after the company cut the total amount of employee working hours in preparation for raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, according to a report from CNN.\n\n\u201cI got that dollar raise but I\u2019m getting $200 less in my paycheck,\u201d said Heather, who works at a Florida branch. She began working 40 hours per week but is now offered less than 20.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how I\u2019m going to pay rent or buy food,\u201d she continued.\n\nTarget committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020 in a statement on September 25, 2017.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) has made the $15 minimum wage a tenet of his campaign. He has blasted large companies such as McDonald\u2019s and Walmart for refusing to pay their employees $15 per hour.\n\nLast year was Target\u2019s best business year since 2005. Sales were up five percent and company stocks were up four percent since 2017, prompting Target CEO Brian Cornell to laud the company\u2019s \u201csuccessful, durable model.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, cuts in worker hours have affected employees\u2019 eligibility for health benefits. Employees who work less than 30 hours per week are deemed ineligible for company health benefits at the start of Target\u2019s spring enrollment period.\n\n\u201cTarget worked me hard from mid-July of 2018 to February 2019, right before my medical coverage was about to kick in,\u201d said former employee Caren Morales of Diamond Bar, California, who worked between 35-40 hours per week. Once the enrollment date approached, she said, \u201cThey cut my hours right then.\u201d\n\nMorales quit several months later, saying she couldn\u2019t afford to pay for her daughter\u2019s day care.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why many workers have seen their hours cut, although the trend may partially be attributable to the introduction of new store management methods.\n\n\u201cWe needed to change the way we operate in the store to create a better, more inviting experience for our guests,\u201d commented Target COO John Mulligan. The changes include elimination of some backroom shifts and the introduction of self-checkout machines, along with specialization of some jobs to cover a specific department instead of an entire store.\n\nSeveral other giant retail stores have also recently decreased working hours, according to statistics from the Bureau of Labor.", "description": "Workers at Target stores are struggling to pay their bills after the company cut the total amount of employee working hours in preparation for raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, according to a report from CNN.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
