Hill denied the claim in a letter to constituents but admitted to a separate relationship with an unnamed female staffer on her congressional campaign, which she called \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Hill is bisexual and was a vocal advocate for LGBTQ equality in Washington.\n\nHouse rules enacted at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2018 prohibit relationships between members of Congress and their employees. But the rules do not cover campaign aides.\n\nUS congresswoman Katie Hill threatens to sue Daily Mail over nude photos Read more\n\nIn her resignation letter, Hill alleged her husband and \u201chateful political operatives\u201d coordinated a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her.\n\nThe congresswoman also apologized for \u201cmistakes made along the way and the people who have been hurt\u201d.\n\nThe ethics inquiry stemmed from the publication of a nude photographs and private text messages on the far-right website, Redstate. According to Hill, the material were leaked to the website by her estranged husband amid acrimonious divorce proceedings.\n\nThe Daily Mail followed last week with the publication of more explicit photographs of Hill and claims that she had a Nazi-inspired tattoo. Lawyers for the congresswoman denied the claims and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Mail that demanded the publication \u201cremove these photos from publication at once\u201d.\n\nSupporters and activists say Hill is a victim of \u201crevenge porn\u201d, a criminal offense in most states, including California and in Washington DC.\n\nIn her statement, Hill called the publication of nude photographs without her consent illegal and said she is \u201ccurrently pursuing all legal options\u201d. \u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt,\u201d she said, explaining her decision to resign. It is unclear when Hill will officially step down. A spokeswoman for her office said the date remains \u201cuncertain\u201d.\n\nHill unseated a Republican incumbent to win her suburban Los Angeles district in 2018, when a historic wave of Democratic women candidates swept the party to power in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the young Californian under her wing, naming her vice chairwoman of the powerful House oversight and reform committee, a rare high-ranking appointment for a freshman member on a panel that has played a key role in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Pelosi said Hill has \u201cacknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a member untenable\u201d.\n\nShe praised Hill\u2019s \u201cgreat contribution as a leader of the freshman class\u201d but said the House \u201cmust ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Congresswoman blames estranged husband and \u2018hateful political operatives\u2019 for smear campaign against her", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63222eba9e27f17b61b0f34791c58d337edfe7b0/691_0_3641_2186/master/3641.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57f184b8c40429975864a65475fbfa3d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
