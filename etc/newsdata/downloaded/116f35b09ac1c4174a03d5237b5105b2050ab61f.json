Since the year began, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) is down more than six percentage points, against near 16% rise for the S&P 500.\n\nBut not all biotechs are created equal -- and not all biotech stocks will remain as cheap as they are today. Utilizing the Stock Screener at TipRanks to seek out strong-buy-rated stocks with incredible profit potential, we've come up with a trio of small cap biotechs with a chance to triple their share price (or more) in the coming year. Let's take a closer look:\n\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals (AUPH)\n\nBased out of Victoria, British Columbia, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotech developing a drug called voclosporin, which it hopes will prove useful in treating lupus nephritis (LN), an autoimmune disease affecting the kidneys, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (another kidney disease) -- or if not those, then maybe dry eye syndrome.\n\nIf that sounds to you like Aurinia hasn't quite decided \"what it wants to be when it grows up\" ... well, we kind of wonder about that, too. Still, the company has $131 million in the bank and minimal debt. With a cash burn rate of only $51 million, Aurinia has the better part of three years to figure itself out and get its drug to market to accomplish something.\n\nJust recently, Oppenheimer analyst Justin Kim initiated coverage of Aurinia stock with an outperform rating on the theory that voclosporin \"could become the first therapeutic approved for treatment of LN.\" Kim thinks the drug has a 60% chance of proving successful for that purpose, and the stock could be worth $10 a share if that's the only indication the drug is approved for. If voclosporin proves effective in treating the other two diseases, the stock could be worth even more. (To watch Kim's track record, click here)\n\n\"Considering the near-term readout of the pivotal Phase 3 LN study, we anticipate shares could re-rate following a positive primary outcome in 4Q19. In addition to an initial pipeline opportunity in FSGS and a maturing late-stage program in dry eye syndrome, we are positive on the stock\u2019s setup into 2020,\" Kim opined.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street likes the risk/reward factor at play here, as TipRanks showcases a strong buy consensus rooting for Aurinia's success. In fact, the consensus of analysts following Aurinia is that this stock could triple in value over the next 12 months, rising from $5 and approaching $17 per share. (See AUPH's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)\n\nTherapeuticsMD (TXMD)\n\nTherapeuticsMD is a somewhat different story. On the one hand, it's a higher-price stock with nearly twice Aurinia's market capitalization, and a weaker balance sheet -- $183 million in cash, and $198 million in debt -- with a much higher burn rate of $152 million per annum. On the other hand, TherapeuticsMD has several products under development, including two formulations of topical progesterone cream.\n\nTherapeuticsMD even has products on the market, including estrogen insert \"Imvexxy,\" for the treatment of menopause-related dyspareunia (sales of which are accelerating year over year), \"Bijuva\" for the treatment of menopause-related \"hot flashes,\" and soon, \"Annovera,\" a contraceptive insert.\n\nStory continues", "description": "2019 has not been a great year to own biotech stocks (so far).
