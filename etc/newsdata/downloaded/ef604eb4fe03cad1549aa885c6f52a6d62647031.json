Pharmaceutical imports, which hit a record high in July, were down 15.8 percent in August, nearly reversing the gain from the previous month.", "description": "Ottawa (AFP) \u2013 Canada\u2019s trade deficit narrowed to Can $955 million (US $718 million) in August, according to government data released Friday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/99b990_canadian-exports-jumped-on-strong-aircraft-shipments-including-business-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
