But after buying up government debt and bank stock, the dramatic upturn he and his partners predicted failed to materialize and the fund's value plunged by an estimated 90 percent.\n\nEaglevale Partners was started in 2011 by Mezvinsky and his partners, with their former boss, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, one of the first investors.\n\nAnother is leading financier, Marc Lasry, co-founder of $13 billion hedge fund Avenue Capital, where Chelsea worked after graduating from Stanford.\n\n'I gave them money because I thought they would make me money,' Mr Lasry told The Times last year, after investing $1 million in Eaglevale and urging a relative to do the same.\n\nWorking mom: Chelsea Clinton is seen coming out of her New York apartment on September 30\n\nMezvinsky was long gone from his job at Goldman in October 2013 when his mother-in-law Hillary was paid to give a speech to executives at the company during a technology conference in Arizona.\n\nShe was reportedly paid $225,000 for that appearance.\n\nMezvinsky and his partners had written to clients in 2014 to declare confidence in their 'Hellenic Opportunity' fund, predicting that Greece was on the path to a 'sustainable recovery'.\n\nBy that point they had collected $25 million but stopped taking money by the end of that year when it became clear the country's economy would collapse without a massive Eurozone bailout.\n\nThen, in February 2015, Eaglevalle said in a letter to investors that year that they had been 'incorrect' to bet on Greece and that is why the company had lost money two of the three years prior.\n\nThe main fund dropped 3.6% in 2014, gained just 2.06% in 2013 and lost 1.96% in 2012.\n\nBut good news for the people working at the hedge fund, as most funds collect management fees meaning money comes in even if funds lose money.\n\nThe failure was a huge personal blow to Mezvinsky, who is also the son of political figures, albeit less well known that his wife's famed parents.\n\nThe grind: Mezvinsky (right with Chelsea going into hospital ahead of her third birth on left) is joining the private equity firm TPG where he will be part of the newly formed $1.6 billion Tech Adjacencies fund\n\nHis father, Edward Mezvinsky, represented Iowa's 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives for two terms in the 1970s and his mother, Marjorie Margolies, represented Pennsylvania from 1993 to 1995.\n\nEd Mezvinsky pleaded guilty to 31 charges of felony fraud in 2001 and spent five years in federal prison after he admitted scamming his friends and family out of $10 million in a Ponzi scheme.\n\nHis son met Chelsea Clinton at a political retreat when the pair were children and they became lifelong friends. They became romantically involved after her 2005 split from ex-boyfriend Ian Klaus, when Mezvinsky became 'a shoulder to lean on', according to Chelsea's chief of staff, Bari Lurie.\n\nThe pair married in July 2010 and two years later Chelsea revealed their desire to start a family, with Mezvinsky telling Vogue his wife was 'the yin to my yang'.\n\nThey welcomed their first child, Charlotte, in 2014, and s second son Aidan in 2016. Their third child,\n\nShortly after starting Eagleville, Mezvinsky and Chelsea moved into a $10million New York City apartment opposite Madison Square Park.\n\nThe four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot apartment is one of only four residences in the building, which despite the low occupancy rate still has a full-time doorman.\n\nThe apartment, whose hallways stretch a full city block, also has two dishwashers, two washer and dryers, dressing rooms with double-sided vanity mirrors, and two massive walk-in closets.\n\nThe bedrooms meanwhile face right into Vera Wang's bridal design studio, who designed Cheslea's dress for her wedding day.\n\nFamous neighbors in the building include NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and Jennifer Lopez, who paid $22million for the two-floor penthouse.\n\nThe apartment's current value is closer to $15million.", "description": "Chjelsea Clinton, who spent the weeks before and after giving birth promoting her new catalogue of children's books, is now in talks to start developing a TV series based on her", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20342612-0-image-a-34_1572379574029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
