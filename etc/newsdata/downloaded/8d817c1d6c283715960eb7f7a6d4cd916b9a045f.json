One is through surveys of business executives, who spent Trump\u2019s first two years being very bullish, but have now become remarkably pessimistic.\n\nYou can also see it in the bond market, a much better indicator of economic expectations than the stock market. Long-term interest rates tend to be high when investors expect a booming economy, in which the Fed will tighten money to head off inflation; they tend to be low when investors expect protracted economic weakness and easy money as far as the eye can see.\n\nAnd 10-year bond rates have plunged, from more than 3 percent last year to 1.75 percent as I write this. The last time we saw this kind of plunge was 2010-11, when investors finally realized that recovery from the Great Recession was going to be slow and painful, not a repeat of \u201cmorning in America.\u201d\n\nSo what happened to the Trump boom? The collapse in confidence began late last year, when it became clear that Trump was serious about waging trade war on China; it continued as evidence accumulated that the 2017 tax cut was a big fizzle, doing basically nothing to boost business investment and providing at most a brief sugar high to overall growth.\n\nBut the truth is that even pessimists expected the tax cut to do more good, and the trade war less harm, than they did. Why have things turned out so poorly? One answer, to which I\u2019ve subscribed, is that in addition to its direct impacts on U.S. exports and businesses that rely on Chinese suppliers, the trade war has created damaging uncertainty. Businesses that rely on global supply chains won\u2019t invest for fear that the trade war will get even worse; but businesses that might move in to replace imports also won\u2019t invest for fear that Trump will eventually back down.\n\nI suspect, however, that there\u2019s even more to the story. Business interests spent a long time in denial, but now even they are facing up to the reality that Trump and his team are very strange people who have no idea what they\u2019re doing \u2014 and the uncertainty that reality implies.\n\nI mean, considering that trade confrontation with China is the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s economic policy, it\u2019s not reassuring to learn that his trade war czar, Peter Navarro, has an imaginary friend \u2014 a source named \u201cRon Vara\u201d whom he has repeatedly cited in his books, but who doesn\u2019t exist, and whose name is in fact just an anagram of \u201cNavarro.\u201d\n\nNext year\u2019s election should be about Trump\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office. Realistically, however, it also matters that the economy probably won\u2019t be his friend.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
