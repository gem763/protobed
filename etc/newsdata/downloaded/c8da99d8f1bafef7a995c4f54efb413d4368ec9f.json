I love Catalonia, Linares and I'm Spanish, but I am not a separatist because I don't want barriers.\"\n\n\"Not only one part (of Catalonia) is valid,\" added this woman. \"If the Catalonia regional government does not represent the rest of Catalans we have to take to the street and say we are here. Not only one part is valid, we all make up Catalonia\".\n\nThe central government in Madrid was represented by Spain's acting foreign minister, Josep Borrell.\n\n\"This violence is damaging Barcelona and Catalonia very much,\" Borrell told reporters. \"It's essential we take the path of a pacific coexistence. Without it, there's no solution to the political problems we have.\"\n\nOn Saturday night a rally organised by a pro-independence direct action group descended into clashes as protesters targeted the police headquarters.\n\nStones and bottles were thrown at officers who responded with batons and shields.\n\nThe incidents marred a largely peaceful demonstration earlier in the day when around 350,000 people marched in support of jailed Catalan separatist leaders.", "description": "Around 80,000 people took to the streets of Barcelona on Sunday in a show of support for Spanish unity.", "authors": ["Mark Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/14/78/1000x563_cmsv2_db3b4c53-bf6b-5c31-aeec-ef7c438c22b2-4261478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
