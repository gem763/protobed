The Chancellor will promise an 'infrastructure revolution' as he sets out the Tory Party's stall ahead of an expected early general election. He is set to announce the first projects in a \u00a325billion, five-year road investment strategy, a \u00a35billion package to support broadband roll-out to the hardest-to-reach 20 per cent of the country, and a \u00a3220million fund for bus routes. Mr Javid will pledge that the investment will 'make the UK a better place to live and work' adding it will ensure 'no community is left behind'. Projects with the go-ahead include upgrades for the trans-Pennine A66 and the A428 between Cambridge and Milton Keynes. Some \u00a320million will go on trials for 'on demand' bus services and \u00a330million will improve existing services or replace cut routes.\n\nThe move will raise fears of a rash of unsightly developments \u2013 but ministers hope it will allow growing families to expand their property without moving, and encourage developers to add new homes to existing buildings.\n\nMr Jenrick will say: 'The bold changes to the planning process will make a real difference to people up and down the nation.\n\n'All too often the planning system proves complicated, outdated and bureaucratic and is too complex and costly for people and small businesses to navigate. This is a barrier to building the homes that we need...\n\n'I want to give families the freedom they need to expand their homes and ensure small developers get a fair chance to succeed.\n\n'Our vision for reforming the planning system will speed up and simplify the process, while ensuring that communities still retain a say over their future.'\n\nMinisters will also try to accelerate the conversion of disused and unsightly commercial properties into residential homes.\n\nUnder a 'permission in principle' system, developers will not have to get detailed planning permission before the bulldozers can move in.\n\nA source said: 'This will create more attractive and prosperous high streets by replacing eyesores with family homes, while also reducing the need to build houses on green field land and in the countryside.'\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick will announce the move in a package of measures tearing up 'outdated and bureaucratic' planning laws (pictured: Robert Jenrick appears on 'Peston' earlier this month)\n\nBig developers will also be offered the option of a fast-track planning service in return for higher fees.\n\nThe package is part of wider moves to boost housebuilding, which is seen as a key battleground for an upcoming election.\n\nHowever, ministers have dropped plans for new housing to be built on green belt areas close to railway stations.\n\nSources said existing green belt protections would remain in place.", "description": "Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will announce the move in a package of measures tearing up 'outdated and bureaucratic' planning laws in the UK.", "authors": ["Jason Groves Political Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/29/22/19083892-0-image-a-87_1569792558135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
