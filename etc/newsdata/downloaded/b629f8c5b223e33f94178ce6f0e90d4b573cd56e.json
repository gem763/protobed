It\u2019s not always the case that sensational, Instagram-famous dishes are carefully calibrated to taste so good, but this one breaks the mold: It\u2019s as pretty as it is delicious. The egg salad is brightened with a touch of rice wine vinegar and mustard and bound with Kewpie mayonnaise. When making it at home, be careful not to undercook the eggs or you\u2019ll cross that fine line between jammy and runny. At the heart of the sandwich is a perfect hard-boiled egg, and we suggest cooking a couple extra in case they break or you have trouble peeling them. Extra eggs, still warm, with a touch of salt and pepper, make for a great snack while you're assembling.\n\nFeatured in: How To Make The Egg Salad Sandwich That Drew Eyes On Instagram.", "description": "This famous egg salad sandwich comes from Konbi, the tiny Los Angeles cafe run by co-chefs Akira Akuto and Nick Montgomery It\u2019s not always the case that sensational, Instagram-famous dishes are carefully calibrated to taste so good, but this one breaks the mold: It\u2019s as pretty as it is delicious The egg salad is brightened with a touch of rice wine vinegar and mustard and bound with Kewpie mayonnaise", "authors": ["Tejal Rao", "Craig Claiborne", "Alex Witchel", "David Tanis", "Elaine Louie", "David Latt", "Gabrielle Hamilton", "Lidey Heuck", "Daniela Galarza", "Alison Roman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/dining/30eggrex1/30eggrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-30"}
