Richard Condit is a whistleblower attorney in Washington, DC. Cleveland Lawrence III is a whistleblower attorney in Washington, DC.\n\nRudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has indicated that he will invoke attorney-client privilege in response to the impeachment inquiry triggered by Trump\u2019s July 25th phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reacting to his likely role as a witness, Giuliani recently told CNN, \u201cUltimately, if I were to say yes and [Trump] were to say no, I can\u2019t testify,\u201d recognizing that the attorney-client privilege belongs to the client and in this case, could be waived only by Trump. Giuliani has tweeted the same, referencing \u201cattorney client and other privileges in response to the subpoena.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news for Giuliani and Trump: Attorney-client privilege, which preserves confidentiality between the two parties to ensure that legal advice can be given freely, doesn\u2019t apply to everything. If there is evidence that a lawyer has been used to advance a crime or fraud, the privilege vanishes. And for Giuliani, that evidence is everywhere.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt already appears that Giuliani\u2019s attorney-client privilege defense will be tested. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has issued a subpoena to Giuliani compelling the preservation and production of information relating to his attempts to get Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s Democratic rival.\n\nAnd Giuliani might well have to answer to it. We represent private sector and government whistleblowers. When we find out that lawyers representing the defendants in those cases are advancing a fraud themselves, we have used what is called the \u201ccrime-fraud exception\u201d to obtain documents and testimony that the defendants\u2019 attorneys initially claimed were protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe Supreme Court has endorsed the application of the crime-fraud exception as an appropriate tool to prevent the misuse of the attorney-client privilege by fraudsters and criminals. Much like in the Godfather movie, where the Corleone family hides behind its attorney and bribery scheme mastermind Tom Hagen, it is not uncommon for defendants to use their relationship with their attorneys to obscure evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe crime-fraud exception is applied by the courts using a \u201cprudent person\u201d standard, when a judge decides that there is evidence for a prudent person to believe that the objective of the client\u2019s communication with the attorney was to further a fraudulent scheme. (In this case, if Giuliani claims attorney-client privilege for any documents in response to a subpoena, the House Intelligence Committee could challenge the privilege by bringing the issue before a federal judge, who would then have to determine whether the exception should apply.)\n\nIt won\u2019t be difficult for Giuliani and Trump\u2019s conduct to meet the standards for the crime-fraud exception. The potential crime is their efforts to solicit foreign support, in the form of dirt on political rival Joe Biden, to help Trump in the 2020 U.S. election. Federal election law bars foreign nationals from contributing anything of value \u201cfor the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\u201d The effort to pressure Zelensky to provide information regarding Biden\u2019s son\u2019s involvement with the Ukrainian gas company Burisma is a solicitation of something valuable to Trump. Complicating matters less, both men have admitted to this solicitation, and it is present in the summary of the telephone call between Trump and Zelensky released last week. So, Giuliani\u2019s likely refusal to testify based on privilege would be an effort to withhold evidence of his and Trump\u2019s involvement in the commission of a potential fraud or crime\u2014and the crime-fraud exemption should apply.\n\nElection law might not be the only possible violation that should interest a judge in deciding whether attorney-client privilege can hold in this case. Giuliani may also have conducted U.S. foreign policy in violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits any private American citizen from engaging in unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments.\n\nGiuliani has said his work in Ukraine was official business on behalf of the State Department\u2014a claim that, if true, would conceivably put him on the right side of the Logan Act and possibly protect his activities under executive privilege, allowing the president to prevent documents and communications from disclosure if he can argue that doing so would compromise national security or executive branch deliberations.\n\nHowever, Giuliani\u2019s claims to be on official business have already been undercut by recent reporting. On September 25, the Washington Post reported that a senior administration official said Secretary of State Mike \u201cPompeo and the State Department never authorized what Giuliani was doing.\u201d The Post went on to report that the \u201cdepartment\u2019s August statement emphasized that Giuliani is a private citizen, was acting in his personal capacity and \u2018does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nA federal judge using a prudent-person standard may have to decide what is more plausible: a reasonable conclusion that Trump\u2019s personal attorney ran afoul of the Logan Act, or Giuliani\u2019s work on Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is official State Department business. The latter scenario is simply too far-fetched; no judge would believe it.\n\nThe evidence of Giuliani as adviser and co-conspirator to violate federal election laws and the Logan Act is substantial. The evidence demands application of the crime-fraud exception if Giuliani cites attorney-client privilege to avoid providing key evidence during the impeachment inquiry. As a once-esteemed member of the bar and federal prosecutor, Giuliani should avoid being a real-life Tom Hagen\u2014a consigliere helping to break, not uphold, the law.", "description": "Sure, the privilege works sometimes.
