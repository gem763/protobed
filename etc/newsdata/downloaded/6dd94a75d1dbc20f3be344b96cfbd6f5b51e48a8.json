It has drawn in technologically advanced players like the United States, Britain and Russia.\n\nThere is a host of regional rivalries. The most pronounced fault-line is between Israel and the Gulf Arab states on the one hand, and Iran, its allies and proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis, on the other.\n\nUSA\n\nThe US has used armed drones extensively in the Middle East, as part of its campaigns against both al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State (IS).\n\nWeapons such as Predator and Reaper drones have been used against targets in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.\n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper is a larger, heavier and more capable aircraft than the Predator, capable of carrying a significantly larger weapons payload with a much longer range.\n\nAs one of Washington's closest military allies, Britain purchased a number of Reaper systems from the US, and has operated them extensively against targets in both Iraq and Syria.\n\nIsrael\n\nLong-acknowledged as one of the pioneers in UAV technology, Israel is one of the major exporters of unarmed UAVs, accounting for - according to one 2018 study - about 60% of the global market.\n\nAmong others customers, it has sold surveillance drones to Russia, and has even shot at least one down when it crossed into Israeli territory from Syria.\n\nIsrael uses a varied fleet of UAVs for intelligence gathering, surveillance and attack missions.\n\nIts armed drones include the Heron TP, the Hermes 450 and the Hermes 900.\n\nBut Israel has been reluctant to export these armed drones.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Iran has developed its own UAV technology\n\nIran\n\nDespite the arms embargo and sanctions, Iran has developed a capacity to build reasonably sophisticated armed UAVs.\n\nThe Shahed-129 was unveiled in 2012 and has been used to hit IS and targets in Syria and Iraq. The Mohajer 6 has been in production since 2018.\n\nBut the other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its technology to its allies and proxies in the region.\n\nOther countries\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) has deployed a fleet of Chinese-supplied Wing Loong 1 UAVs, which have been used against targets in Yemen and in the civil war in Libya.\n\nThe UAE backs the faction led by General Haftar. Turkish drones have been used in Libya in support of the Government of National Accord.\n\nUnable to buy American UAVs, Turkey builds its own, which have been used in strikes against Kurdish targets both inside Turkey and in Syria.\n\nIraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Algeria have all purchased Chinese UAVs.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with UAVs\n\nUse by militant groups\n\nHouthi rebels are among the most adept UAV users among the non-state actors. They operate a number of systems which, according to UN and other experts, depend heavily on Iranian technology. The Houthis have used the Qasef-1, which a UN panel of experts has determined is virtually identical to an Iranian model.\n\nThese are effectively \"kamikaze\" drones that are deliberately crashed into their targets. A subsequent UN report highlighted the Houthis' use of a more sophisticated UAV-X drone, sometimes referred to as the Samad-2/3, which is believed to have a small explosive warhead.\n\nLebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah has operated a small number of what appear to be Iranian-supplied drones.\n\nThe war in Syria saw the first significant use of drones in a major swarm attack intended to overwhelm air defences. Rebel forces have directed several drones at major Russian military bases in Syria.\n\nWhat are the consequences for the region?\n\nIt's clear that armed drone technology has spread widely.\n\nParadoxically, US reluctance to sell advanced UAVs to its allies has not removed the possibility of drone proliferation, because China has stepped in to market its broadly equivalent technology.\n\nUsing UAVs to strike at targets has helped to open up a new kind of combat, blurring the line between war and peace.\n\nUAVs have offered the potential to strike precise targets with limited side-effects (at least if the intelligence guiding them is right).\n\nThe armed drone or UAV seemed tailor-made for the so-called war against terror. But it was also tailor-made for the sorts of unequal struggles in the region between technologically advanced and far less advanced players.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The offensive use of drones has grown significantly in recent years, nowhere more so than in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Jonathan Marcus", "Defence", "Diplomatic Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7EEC/production/_108829423_us_drone.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
