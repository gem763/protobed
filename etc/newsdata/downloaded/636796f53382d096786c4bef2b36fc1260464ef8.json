Adam Schiff, now leading the closed-door impeachment inquiry, has left a trail of anti-Trump allegations that remain unproven or conflict with the official record, an analysis shows.\n\nThe California Democrat once insinuated that a blocked call on Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s cell phone was to tell his dad about an upcoming meeting with a Russian lawyer.\n\nTurned out, the call was to a business associate.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff is basically the Jussie Smollett of Congress on steroids,\u201d Don Jr. said on Fox News.\n\nThat is just one example. A Washington Times review of Mr. Schiff\u2019s comments on Russia and impeachment found multiple embellishments, half-truths and factual misstatements.\n\nThe renewed focus on Mr. Schiff\u2019s truth record comes as the Democratic leader, in making the case for impeachment, has put words in the commander in chief\u2019s mouth that President Trump never uttered. And, a comparison of the congressman\u2019s statements to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report finished in March raises concerns about Mr. Schiff\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s narrative amounts to \u201call these lies,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff lied about having quote-unquote stone-cold evidence about Russia collusion,\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gridley told Fox News.\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s most recent allegation had even some normally loyal pundits criticizing him.\n\nAt a Sept. 26 nationally televised hearing, Mr. Schiff said Mr. Trump requested that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky fabricate evidence against former Vice President Joe Biden. In other words, Mr. Trump was asking Mr. Zelensky to commit a felony.\n\nSuch a request isn\u2019t in the transcript of the July phone call. Challenged by Republicans, Mr. Schiff defended his version of the call as his own personal \u201cparody.\u201d\n\nAfter two days of taking heat, the California Democrat shifted his defense, tweeting that the unidentified anti-Trump whistleblower \u201cconfirmed\u201d the quote. He didn\u2019t explain where. It isn\u2019t in the nine-page complaint against Mr. Trump that the whistleblower, a CIA analyst and Democrat, sent the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nRepublicans also accuse Mr. Schiff of lying about when he or his staff had contact with the whistleblower. At first, the congressman said there was no contact. But now it turns out the person consulted with committee Democrats.\n\n\u201cYou know what else Adam Schiff has been saying to you and the American public that was not true?\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin, New York Republican. \u201cThat he had no contact with the whistleblower \u2014 he\u2019d like to, but he didn\u2019t have any contact. He lied.\u201d\n\nThere are other examples of Mr. Schiff\u2019s dubious assertions since early 2017. The trail starts with the infamous dossier.\n\nThe Steele dossier\n\nAt a March 2017 hearing with FBI Director James Comey at the witness table, Mr. Schiff repeatedly cited the discredited Christopher Steele dossier. He gave credence to a list of unverified felony charges against Mr. Trump. The allegations came straight from the Kremlin, creating the irony of Mr. Schiff using Moscow\u2019s election-year allegations against Mr. Trump to investigate the Russians\u2019 own U.S. election meddling. Since that hearing, Republicans forced the disclosure that it was Mr. Schiff\u2019s party that funded Mr. Steele. None of his 13 separate conspiracy allegations prove true. Mueller found no Trump conspiracy in his report. Mr. Schiff fought efforts to find out who funded the dossier and how the FBI used it to target Mr. Trump.\n\nSecret was no secret\n\nMr. Schiff said Mr. Steele correctly predicted that energy company Rosneft would sell a 19% stake to a private investor. The charge was aimed at buttressing Mr. Steele\u2019s allegations against Trump volunteer Carter Page.\n\n\u201cIs it a coincidence that the Russian gas company, Rosneft, sold a 19% share after former British intelligence officer Mr. Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size?\u201d Mr. Schiff said at the hearing.\n\nIn fact, an Internet search shows the news media reported on the 19% stake weeks before Mr. Steele wrote that particular dossier memo.\n\nMisleading a judge\n\nIn 2018, then-House intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, California Republican, issued a report on how the FBI used the dossier to convince a judge to approve a year\u2019s worth of wiretaps on Mr. Page. Mr. Schiff issued a counter-memo which the established press accepted, labeling Mr. Nunes\u2019 paper \u201cdebunked.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Schiff was wrong on a number of points.\n\nHe wrote that Bruce Ohr, then a top Justice Department official, didn\u2019t go to the FBI with dossier dirt until Nov. 2016 so it would be impossible for him to have influence on the wiretaps application in October.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Ohr began feeding dossier information in August 2016, starting with Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and reaching deep inside the Justice Department. He talked directly to Agent Peter Strzok, the man heading the Trump investigation who held great animus toward the president.\n\nMr. Schiff said the Nunes report \u201cmischaracterizes Bruce Ohr\u2019s role, overstates the significants of his interactions with Steele.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Ohr, as associate deputy attorney general, the No. 4 position, played a critical role in repeatedly ferrying Mr. Steele\u2019s allegations to the Obama administration and continued talking to him well into 2017. Mr. Ohr\u2019s wife worked at Fusion GPS, Mr. Steele\u2019s handler. Mr. Ohr provided the FBI all of her anti-Trump research, as well.\n\nAxes to grind\n\nMr. Schiff said the FBI notified judge\u2019s of the dossier\u2019s partisan nature by writing, in a footnote in the application, that the FBI \u201cspeculates\u201d that it came from a person who wanted to harm Mr. Trump.\n\nIn fact, the FBI knew far more. Mr. Ohr told the bureau Fusion worked for the Hillary Clinton effort and told Mr. McCabe that Mr. Steele was \u201cdesperate\u201d to destroy candidate Trump.\n\nMr. Schiff said the FBI \u201cindependently corroborated\u201d Mr. Steele\u2019s allegations that Mr. Page, while on a public trip to Moscow in July 2016, secretly discussed bribes for sanctions relief.\n\nIn fact, the FBI didn\u2019t confirm this, according to the Mueller report.\n\n\u201cThe investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 election,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn November 2016 an internal FBI report graded the dossier as only \u201cminimally corroborated.\u201d\n\nNo corroboration\n\nMr. Schiff said the FBI didn\u2019t cite a Yahoo News story as dossier corroboration to a judge. He said the FBI included it in the application to show Mr. Page\u2019s denial.\n\nIn fact, when Mr. Nunes eventually obtained a declassified wiretap application, it clearly showed the article was meant as corroboration. The FBI stated that the Yahoo story didn\u2019t come from the same source \u2014 Mr. Steele \u2014 because the ex-British spy told agents he didn\u2019t talk to reporters. Mr. Steele had spoken to the Yahoo reporter who based the story on him. There was no corroboration for the judge.\n\nLeaks by the number\n\nLeak 1: Mr. Schiff\u2019s Democrats have leaked several erroneous anti-Trump stories that garnered big liberal media play.\n\nDonald Trump Jr testified to the House intelligence committee on Dec. 7, 2017. Almost immediately CNN reported that he received a heads-up from Wikileaks that it planned to release more stolen Democratic Party emails. Thus, evidence of collusion.\n\nThe story was wrong. The email Mr. Trump Jr. provided the committee showed the unsolicited Wikileaks message came the day after the release occurred. The CNN story stayed uncorrected for hours.\n\nLeak 2: Democrats leaked misleading Facebook numbers for Russian-bought ads, showing they supposedly targeted Michigan, Wisconsin and other swing states.\n\nRepublicans released numbers that showed deep-blue Maryland displayed more Russia ads than Wisconsin, 262 to 55.\n\nLeak 3: Mr. Nunes, then the committee chairman, worked closely with the White House in writing his wiretap-dossier abuse memo. Mr. Nunes said he didn\u2019t and Democrats presented no evidence that he did.\n\nLeak 4: Democrats leaked that White House communications director Hope Hicks in testimony admitted to telling \u201cwhite lies.\u201d It turned out her example was that she would tell a caller Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t in when he was.\n\nRebuttal problems\n\nMr. Schiff, aregular guest on CNN and MSNBC, suggested pre-Mueller report that he had seen evidence of a conspiracy or that certain known contacts between a Trump associate and a Russian amounted to election collusion.\n\nIn March 2017, the month he read from the dossier, Mr. Schiff said on MSNBC, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into specifics, but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of investigation, so that is what we ought to do.\u201d\n\nThe following December on CNN he said, \u201cWe have all of these facts in chronology, you\u2019d have to believe that these were all isolated incidents, not connected to each other \u2014 just doesn\u2019t make rational sense \u2026 We do know this: the Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help, the Russians gave help and the president made full use of that help. That is pretty damning, whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not.\u201d\n\nOne of Mr. Schiff\u2019s major pieces of evidence is the July 2017 disclosure that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. The meeting lasted about 20 minutes and she didn\u2019t relay any dirt. The meeting had nothing to do with Russian hacking or social media information warfare.\n\nIn his overall conclusion, the Mueller report said, \u201cThe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d\n\nIn April 2018, Mr. Nunes and the Republican majority issued a report saying there was no election conspiracy. Mr. Schiff issued a 99-page rebuttal.\n\nOne section focused the George Papadopoulos, the Trump adviser who met Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor active in Western national security circles. In London, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos on April 26, 2016 that he heard Moscow owned \u201cthousands\u201d of Clinton emails.\n\nMr. Schiff said Mr. Nunes never sought records to \u201cdetermine whom on the campaign he would have reported this overture to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot find what you dod not seek,\u201d the Schiff report said.\n\nIn fact, the Mueller report a year later found that Mr. Papadopoulos never acted on what Mr. Mifsud said nor told anyone on the campaign. He communicated with a Russian tied to a think tank about having candidate Trump visit Moscow. No visit happened.\n\nMr. Mueller examined all of Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019 actions in Europe. There was no evidence he was involved in coordinating hacking or social media.\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s report is dotted with a Russian here and a Russian there reaching out to the Trump campaign. But again, the long Mueller investigation did not find anything contact was part of a conspiracy.\n\nThe Schiff report implies that the National Rifle Associate took millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions from Russia. This is a theory pushed repeatedly by Fusion GPS, Hillary Clinton\u2019s opposition research firm which handled Mr. Steele and circulated his bogus dossier.\n\nThere was no evidence of this in the Mueller report. Nor have there been any confirmed reports that the FBI is investigating the NRA.\n\nResign and censure\n\nNews in March that the Mueller investigation found no Trump-Russia election conspiracy prompted House intelligence committee Republicans to write a letter demanding Mr. Schiff resign the chairmanship.\n\n\u201cThe findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity for his committee, and undermine faith in U.S. government institutions,\u201d the Republicans wrote.\n\nAfter Mr. Schiff\u2019s \u201cparody\u201d routine, Rep. Andy Biggs, Arizona Republican, offered a resolution calling on the House to censure him.\n\nMr. Schiff vigorously defended himself at a March 28 hearing.\n\nHe mentioned: Don Jr.\u2019s willingness to meet with the Russian attorney; Paul Manafort, former campaign manger, providing polling data to his long time employee in Ukraine who the FBI says is tied to Russian intelligence; Adviser Roger Stone, who had a brief message exchange with a persona who turned out to be a Russian intelligence officer.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues may think it\u2019s OK that the Russians offered dirt on the Democratic candidate for president of part of what was described as the Russian government\u2019s effort to help the Trump campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might think that\u2019s OK. My colleagues might think it\u2019s OK, when that was offered to the son of the President who had a pivotal role in the campaign, that the President\u2019s son did not call the FBI. He did not adamantly refuse that foreign help. No, instead that son said that he would love the help of the Russians.\u201d\n\nNone of Mr. Schiff\u2019s examples went to the core investigation: did Trump associates conspire with Russians to interfere in the election?\n\nSaid Mr. Schiff, \u201cI have always said that the question of whether this amounts to proof of conspiracy was another matter, whether the Special Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the proof of that crime would be up to the Special Counsel and I would accept his decision, and I do. He\u2019s a good and honorable man, and he is a good prosecutor. But I do not think that conduct, criminal or not, it\u2019s OK. And the day we do think that\u2019s OK is the day we will look back and say that is the day America lost its way.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
