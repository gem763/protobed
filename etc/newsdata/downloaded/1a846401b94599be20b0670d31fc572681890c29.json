The event saw upwards of two million tokens, worth more than $36 million. This number represents 20% of the company\u2019s quarterly profits. Naturally, as the burn takes place and it eliminates BNB from circulation, the price might react, but will it?\n\nBinance Burns Two Million BNB\n\nBinance has managed to successfully complete its 9th BNB coin burn. The event saw a total of 2,061,888 BNB burned, which is roughly around $36,700,000. This represents 20% of Binance\u2019s quarterly profits. In its very young age, Binance had just crossed one billion USD in revenue.\n\nCumulatively, Binance also just crossed $1 billion in profit. pic.twitter.com/mNHdnOdQgS \u2014 Larry Cermak (@lawmaster) October 17, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that the last burn took place back in July and it saw BNB worth about $23,838,000 million taken out of the supply.\n\nThis implies a growth of about 56% in the company\u2019s profits over the past three months alone. During this period, Binance launched Bitcoin futures trading, which already surpassed the spot trading in terms of volumes, perhaps adding to the company\u2019s revenues.\n\nIn addition, Binance also added other features to its platform, including Binance staking for 12 cryptocurrencies at the time of this writing. Users are able to stake them in return for an annualized interest rate, hence giving them an option to earn passively.\n\nDespite the plunging prices of cryptocurrencies in the past three months, the company is obviously doing well and it manages to keep its profits increasing.\n\nWill BNB Price React?\n\nIn theory, when the supply of an asset is reduced while the demand for it remains the same or increases, its price should go up.\n\nSince news of the burn broke out, BNB has managed to mark a slight increase in its price.\n\nAs seen on the chart, BNB increased to slightly above $18, which is an increase of a little more than 3%. It\u2019s interesting to see whether the coin will be able to gain more.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "Binance, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has completed its 9th quarterly burn of Binance Coin (BNB).
