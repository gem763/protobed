Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE (D-Mass.) has jumped to the top of some national polls recently, and her status as the new front-runner was underlined when several of her rivals attacked her.\n\nThey clearly see an urgent need to curb her momentum.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegO'Rourke hits back at Buttigieg over criticism of his gun buyback proposal Chasten Buttigieg fundraising for husband Pete overseas Progressives fume at Buttigieg, warn him not to attack Warren at debate MORE (D) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharHillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Analysis: Warren and Booker most cyber-aware 2020 candidates Poll: Democratic support for Warren climbs to record high MORE (D-Minn.) were among the most aggressive in jabbing at Warren early on, though others, including Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisO'Rourke hits back at Buttigieg over criticism of his gun buyback proposal Warren leads Democratic field by 3 points in new national poll Analysis: Warren and Booker most cyber-aware 2020 candidates MORE (D-Calif.) and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas), joined the fray later.\n\nWarren by no means crumbled. But she was put on the defensive as she has never been before.\n\nOn her \"Medicare for All\" plan, Buttigieg argued it limited choice, while Klobuchar hit her refusal to acknowledge that paying for it would almost certainly involve tax hikes.\n\nWarren\u2019s argument on the tax issue \u2014 that voters are concerned about overall costs, and that any tax increase would be offset because there would be no private insurance premiums \u2014 is logically defensible. But her rivals will exploit her tendency to sound evasive on the tax point.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator seemed to become more comfortable as the night wore on. And her basic position that Democrats need a platform more ambitious than one that \u201cnibbles around the edges of the big problems in this country\u201d has real magnetism for progressive voters.\n\nWarren survived her first turn in the firing line competently. But everyone will be watching the polls in coming days to see whether the sustained attacks on Tuesday slowed her march.\n\nA bad night for Biden \u2014 again\n\nIndifferent debate performances have been a problem for former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE before \u2014 and he failed to break the streak on Tuesday.\n\nThe 76-year-old faded into the background for large swathes in Westerville. When he did gain the spotlight, his answers were prone, once again, to lack sharpness or punch.\n\nEven though Biden is two years younger than Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill On The Money: Trump touts China trade deal | Wall Street, Washington see signs for caution | Trump threatens sanctions on Turkey | Sanders proposes sharp hike to corporate taxes MORE (I-Vt.), he continues to sprinkle his remarks with much more anachronistic phrases. On Tuesday, he talked about people \u201cclipping coupons in the stock market\u201d \u2014 a reference that seemed several decades out of date.\n\nBiden\u2019s backers would argue that his support has always come from older, more centrist Democrats and that he is the strongest candidate to take on Trump.\n\nBut there was nothing remotely dominant about his performance on Tuesday night.\n\nBernie bounces back \u2014 with AOC\u2019s help\n\nSanders came into this debate facing serious questions about his health. It was the 78-year-old\u2019s first major appearance since having a heart attack.\n\nThe Vermont Independent began putting those worries to rest with a typically feisty performance. There was no sign of a lack of vigor or stamina.\n\nBut the biggest boost to the veteran democratic socialist came from outside the debate hall.\n\nAs the clashes in Westerville were winding down, The Washington Post broke the news that he would be endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezObamas' first Netflix project nominated for Critics' Choice Documentary Awards Sanders wishes Ocasio-Cortez happy birthday Democrat launches primary challenge to Ocasio-Cortez MORE (D-N.Y.) at a Saturday rally in Queens, N.Y. Soon after, news emerged that Reps. Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarIlhan Omar raises .1 million in third quarter New California law bans school lunch debt shaming The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by USAA \u2014 Ex-Ukraine ambassador testifies Trump pushed for her ouster MORE (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib Rashida Harbi TlaibTrump labels Tlaib 'a despicable human being' Tlaib says Democrats have discussed detaining White House officials who don't testify The 13 House Democrats who back Kavanaugh's impeachment MORE (D-Mich.) would also back him.\n\nThe endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez was arguably bigger news than anything that happened on the debate stage on Tuesday. The young left-wing icon\u2019s endorsement may not be a surprise in itself \u2014 she worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign \u2014 but the timing delivers a jolt of excitement to his campaign at just the right moment.\n\nIt will also come as a disappointment to Warren, whom Ocasio-Cortez had also previously praised.\n\nButtigieg seizes his moment\n\nButtigieg was the single standout performer on Tuesday. He took the fight to Warren, was prominent in the key early stages of the debate and made his case more broadly as a candidate able to connect with voters beyond the liberal base.\n\nButtigieg has always been an effective television performer, and he has showed startling fundraising strength.\n\nHe has, however, struggled to translate those assets into real momentum in the polls.\n\nThe 37-year-old mayor\u2019s path into serious contention lies in the possibility that he could supplant Biden as the centrist standard-bearer against the progressive wing of the party, represented by Warren and Sanders.\n\nHe helped himself in a big way on Tuesday \u2014 and Biden\u2019s weakness also played into his hands.\n\nHarris misfires with Warren attack\n\nHarris shone in the first Democratic debates in Miami in late June, but she has faded in the polls since then.\n\nShe enjoyed a good moment early on Tuesday when she turned a general discussion of health care to the topic of women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2014 a winning move with the crowd in the hall, and presumably with a lot of Democratic voters.\n\nJust as memorable \u2014 but for the wrong reasons, from Harris\u2019s perspective \u2014 was a later exchange with Warren on the subject of President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nHarris pressed Warren on why she wouldn't support Harris\u2019s push to have Trump banned from the social media platform. But Warren easily turned the attack around by saying that she was focused on removing Trump from the White House, not just from Twitter.\n\nHarris persisted with the confrontation but the overall effect was to diminish herself rather than Warren, with the California senator seeming mean-spirited and somewhat petty.\n\nIt was a bad moment for a candidate who could ill afford one.", "description": "It was Round Four of the Democratic debates on Tuesday, with 12 candidates squaring off in Westerville, Ohio.
