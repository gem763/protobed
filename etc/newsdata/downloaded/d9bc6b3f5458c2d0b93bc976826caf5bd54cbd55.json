RPI was last lower in November 2016.\n\nThe CPI including owner-occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) - the ONS's preferred measure of inflation - was 1.7 per cent in September, unchanged from the previous month.", "description": "Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 1.7 per cent last month, the same as in August.
