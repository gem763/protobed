She offered her remarks on Tuesday\u2019s edition of Dennis Prager\u2019s eponymous radio show while discussing her latest book, Provocations: Collected Essays on Art, Feminism, Politics, Sex, and Education.\n\nPaglia highlighted left-wing denial of the biological origins of sex, including left-wing framing of sex as an arbitrary and subjective social construct. \u201cThese ideas aren\u2019t based on any actual study of biology,\u201d she said.\n\nPaglia noted much of the news media\u2019s ambivalence towards the aforementioned experimentation on children:\n\nI think that experiments of unproven drugs \u2014 drug protocols \u2014 on children is a crime against humanity, and it should not be tolerated. It amazes me there is hardly any media attention to this matter. I think the future will look back with surprise and shock at the ethical indifference of the major media right now in the United States to this going on. It is simply not right. These drugs have not been fully tested, and we\u2019re using children as experiments? Boys forever are going to have, in adulthood, a child\u2019s size penis? I cannot believe that this is happening without protest.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t imagine that the child knows his or her future identity at age three, or ten, for that matter,\u201d added Paglia. \u201cFlash-freezing a child\u2019s development through the introduction of drugs \u2014 pre-puberty, on and so on \u2014 seems to me, should be recognizably, not just wrong, but horrific.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nPaglia reflected on her own gender dysphoria, speculating on how her maturation may have unfolded differently had she been exposed to ubiquitous contemporary left-wing characterizations of sex as a purely social construct:\n\nIf all of this was in the air when I was young, I would have become absolutely convinced that I was really a man, and I think I would have probably been vulnerable to that fantasy until my mid-twenties, probably. \u2026 And completing my massive 700-page book Sexual Personae, in a sense, exorcised that. \u2026 Right from the start, in 1990, I was describing that book as a transgender construction. It\u2019s a voice. It\u2019s an other self. I\u2019ve never felt female, but I don\u2019t feel male, either. \u2026 I would have been obsessed.\n\n\u201cI feel that \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this publicly \u2014 prescribing puberty blockers to children is a violation of human rights,\u201d determined Paglia.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "Using puberty-blocking drugs on children in order to stultify their sexual development \"is a crime against humanity,\" said Camille Paglia.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Camille-Paglia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
