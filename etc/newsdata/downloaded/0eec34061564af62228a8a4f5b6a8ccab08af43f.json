Photo: Brad Barket/Getty Images for The New Yorker\n\nWho better to kick off the New Yorker Festival than Patti Smith, the platonic ideal of New York City condensed into a person? The woman entered to a standing ovation! In the hour-and-a-half conversation with New Yorker editor-in-chief and friend David Remnick that followed, the singer and writer read from her new memoir, Year of the Monkey (it\u2019s about \u201c70 percent\u201d true), waxed about her favorite detective shows (she loves Idris Elba in Luther: \u201cTalk about a guy!\u201d), and told the story of meeting Trump in the \u201970s (horrifyingly, \u201che brushed his eyebrows up straight\u201d). And even if the event was just billed as a talk, an acoustic and electric guitar sat next to the two chairs, hinting at what the Godmother of Punk had in store.\n\nRemnick had already coaxed acoustic performances of Smith\u2019s \u201cPissing in a River\u201d and Neil Young\u2019s \u201cAfter the Gold Rush\u201d out of Smith before he asked Smith about the political life of her song \u201cPeople Have the Power.\u201d She explained how her late husband and co-writer, Fred Smith, would be proud of the song\u2019s impact, and Remnick replied, \u201cAll right, well that\u2019s our cue!\u201d The audience applauded, and, Remnick didn\u2019t spare Smith a second to think before he picked up his electric guitar. (Yes, the editor-in-chief of The New Yorker accompanied Patti Smith.) \u201cOh! You\u2019re pulling out the big guns,\u201d Smith said when she noticed he went electric.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t practice, so I think this is awesome,\u201d Smith told the crowd as Remnick started to play. Yet she was in her element, joining in when the crowd started clapping. At the end of the second verse, she forgot a line, stopped the song and brushed it off like it was nothing at all. \u201cWait, I forgot to sing, that\u2019s okay! Come on people, get up!\u201d she said. \u201cI need to find the chorus.\u201d And she did! That power! When the song softened, she told the audience, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I fell out of rhythm, so \u2014 it wasn\u2019t David\u2019s fault, it\u2019s always mine. He\u2019s the new Bob Dylan!\u201d And then in seconds, she got the crowd clapping a new rhythm. The people have the power, indeed! \u201cUse! Your! Voice!\u201d she said at the end of the song.\n\nThe impromptu performance may have only left time for one audience question, but Smith still imparted more of her signature wisdom to the crowd: \u201cIf things are getting really rough, eat a Snickers bar!\u201d Think that\u2019s how she can still do it all at 73 years young?", "description": "Kicking off this weekend\u2019s New Yorker Festival, singer and writer Patti Smith read from her new book \u201cYear of the Monkey\u201d and sang a surprise rendition of her protest hit \u201cPeople Have the Power.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/12-patti-smith.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
