I\u2019ve been second guessing myself, my family told me it has worked before and it\u2019ll work again I just had to keep believing and thankfully I did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We play each other in practice a lot, when I do that I get into a rhythm and flow, and I told myself I just had to do that today. I got off to a great start and that just settled the nerves even more.\n\nSelby is back to winning ways (Picture: VCG via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s fantastic, to play Dave in the final is an absolute privilege. It\u2019s only a matter of time for him, you can\u2019t be as good as him and not win tournaments, I expect him to win one this year and then the floodgates will open and he\u2019ll win many more.\n\n\u2018Over the moon to win another tournament on UK soil, a lot of my wins have been out in China.\u2019\n\nFormer world number three Neal Foulds now sees Selby as a major threat at the Triple Crown events this season, having rediscovered some of his best form.\n\n\u2018You look at the UK Championship and the World Championship now for Selby because there\u2019s hardly a better player around better equipped for 17 days at the Crucible,\u2019 Foulds said on Eurosport.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s back in that type of form now and I think whatever bookmakers have prices for him might have just taken a number off him.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelby admitted earlier in the week that his confidence has been a bit fragile during his search for form, but should now take great heart from this success.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019ve achieved in the game, if you keep getting beat, your confidence is going to go,\u2019 Selby admitted.\n\n\u2018You start thinking to yourself, \u201cdo I need to change something?\u201d But I\u2019ve watched videos and what I\u2019m doing now is exactly the same to when I was winning, it was just the mental side of things.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan stunned by Mei Xiwen and Tom Ford hits 147 on dramatic English Open night\n\nMORE: Stephen Hendry backs Judd Trump to triumph in rivalry with Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan", "description": "Mark Selby produced a sensational performance in the English Open final to destroy David Gilbert 9-1 and lift his first title in over a year.
