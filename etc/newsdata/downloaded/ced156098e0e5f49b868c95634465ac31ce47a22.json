And it has surprised former White House and National Security Council officials who say the NSC\u2019s codeword-level system is specifically designed to protect highly sensitive compartmented intelligence matters.\n\nThose include covert action programs, diplomatically sensitive information and other national security secrets, said Larry Pfeiffer, the former Situation Room senior director under President Barack Obama and CIA chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration. An example, he said, would be \u201cinformation surrounding the very sensitive negotiations and conversations involving Oman\u201d in the early stages of negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cIt would never be used to protect or \u2018lock down\u2019 politically sensitive material or to protect the president or senior officials from embarrassment,\u201d Pfeiffer said.\n\nA former Trump National Security Council official acknowledged that \u201cit would be unusual to put transcripts in the code word system,\u201d and that \u201cit is probably not done frequently.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower, who is a member of the intelligence community but whose identity remains unknown but, alleged in a complaint filed on August 12 that Trump sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cto take actions to help\u201d his 2020 re-election campaign during a phone call on July 25\u2014and that White House officials tried to cover it up.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\n\u201cI am concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed watchdog for the intelligence community conducted a \u201cpreliminary review\u201d of the whistleblower\u2019s accusations, which reportedly included witness interviews, and deemed them credible despite the whistleblower not having first-hand knowledge of the incident and \u201csome indicia of an arguable bias in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d according to a letter released on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House released a \"memorandum\" documenting that conversation, which backs up the allegation that Trump dangled U.S. aid to Ukraine as a carrot for Zelensky\u2019s cooperation in investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden. Trump also tried to get Attorney General William Barr involved, according to the memo.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the memo the White House released, which was originally marked \u201cSECRET/ORCON/NOFORN,\u201d is the one the president\u2019s aides were allegedly trying to conceal. It was declassified before its release on the president\u2019s orders.\n\nBut the whistleblower alleged that senior White House officials had intervened to \u201c\u2018lock down\u2019 all records\u201d of that call by removing it from the system where these transcripts are normally stored and uploading it into a separate system \u201cmanaged directly by the NSC\u2019s Directorate for Intelligence Programs.\u201d They did so because \u201cof the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain,\u201d according to the whistleblower.\n\nThe White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, though President Trump has angrily accused Democrats of conducting another \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and defended his conversations with Zelensky.\n\nAfter 2017, when verbatim transcripts of his conversations with the leaders of Australian and Mexico were leaked to the press, the White House began to restrict the number of officials who had access to the transcripts. One former Trump administration official confirmed that the White House started placing transcripts into the codeword system after those leaks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the person who leaked those was ever really discovered,\u201d said the former Trump administration official. \u201cSo there was a decision to tighten the restrictions for those who had access to those transcripts.\u201d\n\nApril Doss, who served as senior minority counsel for the Russia investigation on the Senate Intelligence Committee and, prior to that, as a top attorney at the National Security Agency, said the S//OC//NF designation of the memo \u201cseems like a typical level of classification for that kind of call.\u201d\n\nThat classification indicates that the disclosure of the call would cause \"serious damage\" to national security, cannot be disseminated by anyone except the originator, and is prohibited from disclosure to foreign nationals. A code word classification, meanwhile, is top secret\u2014a level higher than secret\u2014and then further compartmentalized by adding a code word so that only those who have been cleared for each code word can see it.\n\nDoss said it would be \u201chighly unusual\u201d for this kind of routine call between world leaders to be placed into a system that\u2019s used for information about the nation\u2019s most highly compartmented programs. \u201cIt risks undermining a whole host of important national security activities,\u201d she said, noting that \u201cmost if not all\u201d officials who would need to have access to call readouts as part of carrying out their regular duties in advising on foreign affairs and implementing the administration\u2019s policies \u201cwould not have access\u201d to the codeword system.\n\nThe president has ultimate classification authority and it\u2019s an open legal question whether he\u2019s bound by executive orders, including one signed by Obama in 2009 that says information can\u2019t be classified in order to \u201cconceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error\u201d or \u201cprevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency.\u201d\n\nBut it would be squarely within the whistleblower\u2019s rights, as governed by the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, to sound the alarm over the potential violation of that executive order, Doss said\u2014especially if it was done by the president\u2019s staff. That in turn could at least partly be why the IC IG considered it to be within the intelligence community\u2019s purview, despite the DNI\u2019s determination that it fell outside their jurisdiction.\n\nA former intelligence official who served on Obama\u2019s National Security Council, but who wished to remain anonymous to discuss the NSC\u2019s codeword-level system, agreed that storing a transcript on that system \u201cwould severely limit those personnel able to view it.\u201d\n\nWhile limited in what he could disclose about the system without revealing classified information, the official said, \u201cThe bottom line is that if the administration attempted to upload the transcript to that system it would have been to make it nearly impossible to share. The system was not intended for unclassified material.\u201d\n\nNew Window How to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe added that he\u2019d \u201cnever\u201d seen a presidential transcript stored there. Pfeiffer said that he could not recall ever seeing a transcript stored there, but said it would\u2019ve only been possible if a president\u2019s calls \u201ctouched on compartmented matters requiring that protection.\u201d\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire acknowledged in an open hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday that he immediately consulted the White House upon receiving the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from the IC IG\u2014prompting Democrats to grill him on why he would ask for advice from a White House that had already been credibly accused of seeking to conceal the call at the heart of the complaint.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your business to protect the nation\u2019s secrets,\u201d said Democrat Eric Swalwell. \u201cIf there\u2019s cover-up activity because the president is improperly working with a foreign government, that could compromise our nation\u2019s secrets, is that right?\u201d\n\nMaguire replied that the allegation of a coverup had not yet been proven.\n\nThe whistleblower said he or she had been told by White House officials that \u201cit was not the first time\u201d under Trump that a presidential transcript was placed into the NSC\u2019s codeword-level system \u201cfor the purpose of protecting politically sensitive\u2014rather than national security sensitive\u2014information.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who embraced an official impeachment inquiry earlier this week, accused the White House of engaging in a \u201ccover-up\u201d following Maguire\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cWe are at a different level of lawlessness that is self-evident to the American people,\" Pelosi said, adding, \"We have a heightened responsibility to act upon those facts.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The allegations surprised former White House and National Security Council officials.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand", "Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/db/c8/ce80b4194bdd8fca8a1cb6133730/19926-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
