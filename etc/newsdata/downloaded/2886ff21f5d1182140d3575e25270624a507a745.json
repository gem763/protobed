Biden in the debate Thursday slammed his far-left rivals\u2019 plan for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d government-run health care.\n\n\u201cThe senator says she is for Bernie, well, I am for Barack,\u201d said Mr. Biden, simultaneously bucking Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernard Sanders while reinforcing his ties to President Obama.\n\nMr. Biden said the plan would knock nearly 150 million people off their private health insurance plan and raise taxes for middle-class Americans.\n\nHe later quipped about their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan: \u201cIt\u2019s a good plan if you like it. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren extended an olive branch.\n\n\u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said Obamacare was a major turning point that extended health coverage to millions of Americans but the next step would be universal coverage under \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nThe single-payer plan, which would eliminate private health insurance companies, has become a flashpoint in the fight over the direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nMr. Biden, the frontrunner in the race, is offering a return to normalcy, while Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren want major structural change to the federal government.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
