Does That Matter?", "language": "en", "text": "For the third time in a row, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren pulled off a well-received debate performance, new polling finds.\n\nMore broadly, the state of the 2020 campaign appears to remain much where it\u2019s stood since August: Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead in the horse race polls, trailed by Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. A few other metrics suggest Warren may be positioned for further growth. And most primary voters remain very far from locked into a decision, meaning there\u2019s plenty of room for things to change.\n\nThirty-seven percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the debate last Thursday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, while just 9% said their opinions of her worsened. That\u2019s not as dramatic as her reception in the first and second debates, when half or more reported improved views, but it\u2019s still enough to place her ahead of her rivals this round.\n\nThree other candidates also saw their positive ratings for the debates significantly outstrip their negatives: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (31% had an improved view of him compared to 11% whose view worsened); former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (30% improved to 13% worsened) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (26% improved to 11% worsened).\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 who aggressively challenged Biden onstage \u2015 saw the worst numbers (15% improved compared to 41% worsened), with the remaining candidates breaking more or less close to even.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov Poll on the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate.

Plenty of voters, as FiveThirtyEight notes, didn\u2019t even watch the debate. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only about 55% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they caught even clips of the event.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of the debates affecting this race so far has been California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 brief surge following a strong initial performance, and her subsequent fall from the top tier of polling when she failed to match it in subsequent debates. By contrast, Sanders\u2019 poll numbers have remained basically stable since summer, while Warren\u2019s rise has appeared gradual and largely untethered to any specific incident.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re practically raised to believe that debates impact election results in big ways. Millions watch, candidates spend countless hours preparing, media can\u2019t stop talking, and writing, about them. And, after all, we\u2019re taught debates are the way we should be making voting decisions. They\u2019ve just got to be game-changers,\u201d Democratic pollster Mark Mellman wrote. \u201cBut they\u2019re not ... Voters in the early states will get lots more direct exposure to the candidates through other mechanisms.\u201d\n\nTo examine the broader state of the race beyond debate night, the new HuffPost/YouGov poll also asked voters to look over the full slate of Democratic candidates and pick whom they\u2019d be enthusiastic or upset to see nominated, and who they believe is capable of defeating President Donald Trump.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Joe Biden still leads in the polls, and last week's debate doesn't look like a game-changer.
