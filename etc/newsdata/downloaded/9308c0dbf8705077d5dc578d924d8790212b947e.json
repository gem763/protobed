Morgan Babst \u200b\n\nJesmyn Ward\u2019s eerie, powerful uncovering of history\n\n\u201c[Ward] uses a haunting, magical-realist style to masterfully warp two of life\u2019s most inflexible realities: time and death. Her book seems to ask whether a family or a nation can atone for inequities that remain well and alive.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Sing, Unburied, Sing, by Jesmyn Ward\n\nWhy the Gulf Coast is uniquely vulnerable to disasters\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t just find themselves in places vulnerable to flooding. They are pushed there by racial injustice, economic inequality, and short-term, profit-driven development practices.\u201d\n\n\u200b \ud83d\udcdaEnvironmental Disaster in the Gulf South, edited by Cindy Ermus\n\nThe chemist who thought he could harness hurricanes\n\n\u201c[Irving Langmuir] soon sketched out an idea so revolutionary that he abandoned every other project on his slate to pursue it. It promised not only to improve rainmaking but to give Langmuir the superhuman power to control hurricanes.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda An excerpt from Caesar\u2019s Last Breath, by Sam Kean\n\nThe Reference Desk\u200b\n\n\u200b (New York Public Library)\n\nThis week\u2019s question comes from Richard in North Carolina. He\u2019s wondering why people would choose to read at the beach when they could do so at home\u2014which got us wondering in turn about the specific appeal of outdoor reading and the origin of the \u201cbeach read.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no one reason why people enjoy reading outside, but a variety of factors throughout history may have shaped the habit. In the 18th and 19th centuries, reading in private was seen as morally suspect, while reading in public presumably left fewer opportunities for transgressive thoughts. The popularization of paperback books in the late 1930s made reading outside easier\u2014even on the front lines of battle. According to the journalist Michelle Dean, the phrase beach read emerged in the 1990s, most likely as a catchy way for publicists to sell their new summer releases.\n\nReading while on vacation and/or reading outside has remained a popular choice for those who associate both reading and the outdoors with pleasure: I\u2019d recommend Annie Dillard\u2019s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek as an interesting book to read outside.\n\nWrite to the Books Briefing team at booksbriefing@theatlantic.com or reply directly to this email with any of your reading-related dilemmas.
