Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara has a range of tools at her disposal to cushion the car maker\u2019s finances while workers are on strike.\n\nAmong them are trimming costs, delaying payments to suppliers and reducing capital expenditures, analysts said.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union strike, which began Monday, involves about 46,000 workers at 30 plants in 10 U.S. states.\n\nFinance chiefs play a key role in planning a company\u2019s spending plans as well as managing its cash balances, payment cycles and costs.\n\nGM had about $17.5 billion in cash and marketable securities from automotive operations alongside a $16.5 billion revolving credit facility at the end of June, leaving it with about $34 billion in available liquidity, according to Fitch Ratings Inc.\n\nThe amount is considered substantial, but Ms. Suryadevara\u2014who has been at the helm of the company\u2019s finance department since last September\u2014will have to keep a close eye on cash as the strike continues.\n\nEstimates on the potential length of the strike range from a few days to several weeks, analysts said. GM\u2019s last strike, in 2007, lasted about two days.\n\n\u201cWhen vehicle production stops, cash flows quickly turn negative,\u201d said Stephen Brown, a senior director at Fitch covering the North American auto sector.\n\nEstimates for the loss in operating income at GM range from around $50 million to roughly $100 million a day, according to analysts.\n\nMs. Suryadevara could focus on reducing variable costs such as marketing and could delay payments to suppliers to ensure GM maintains a strong cash balance, said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. \u201cYou don\u2019t have control over receivables, but over payables,\u201d he said.\n\nTo improve year-end cash flow, the company tends to wait until the next year to pay some bills received in the fourth quarter, Mr. Whiston said,.\n\nGM declined to disclose details on its payment cycles or to make Ms. Suryadevara available for comment.\n\nU.S. auto manufacturers usually take 30 to 45 days, sometimes even longer, to pay their suppliers, according to Fitch.\n\nMs. Suryadevara could also zero in on GM\u2019s capital expenditures in search of additional savings, analysts said. The company plans to spend $8 billion to $9 billion on capital expenditures this year, according to the CFO during an Aug. 1 earnings call.\n\nGM\u2019s management \u201cwould be more aggressive on reducing capex in 2020 if the strike lasts longer,\u201d Bill Selesky, a senior analyst at Argus Research Co., said in an interview.\n\nGM is currently working to reduce annual costs by $4.5 billion through 2020 and is on track to meet its target, Ms. Suryadevara said at a bank conference on Aug. 13.\n\nShould the walkout last longer than a few weeks, the finance chief could be forced to revise the company\u2019s guidance, analysts said. GM said on Aug. 1 it remained committed to its full-year outlook of earnings per share of $6.50 to $7.00 and free cash flow from automotive operations of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.\n\n\u201cThey have about two weeks before the upper end of the EPS guidance is in jeopardy,\u201d Mr. Whiston said. A strike lasting four to six weeks is expected to result in a cut to the car maker\u2019s guidance. \u201cThat\u2019s the hard part\u2014to know how long this is going to last,\u201d he said.\n\nUncertainty around the strike could affect how the company plans for 2020. GM usually finalizes its budget at the end of October, but it could be forced to update its spending plans if the strike continues, Mr. Selesky said.\n\n\u201cWhen they make a budget, they always have a best-, medium- and worst case scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "General Motors Co.
