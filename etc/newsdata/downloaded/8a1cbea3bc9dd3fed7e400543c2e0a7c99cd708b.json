Next comes the P45, and this one won't be from a prankster", "language": "en", "text": "If I may be permitted to begin with a vanishingly rare bit of gonzo sketch writing, towards the end of Boris Johnson\u2019s question and answer session, at the end of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at a police training centre in Yorkshire, which ended at least an hour and a half after 32 trainee police officers had been ordered to form up behind it, I raised my hand.\n\nThe question I was hoping to ask was, roughly, thus: \u201cPrime minister, it\u2019s your first proper week in the job. You have lost four parliamentary votes. You have chucked Ken Clarke out of the Conservative Party. Your brother has resigned. You have failed to get a general election and you can\u2019t get Britain out of the European Union. Did you ever imagine it would go this badly?\u201d\n\nAt this point, the junior copper standing immediately behind him collapsed. Her colleagues appeared to wish to give medical assistance, but it was not clear if that was the right thing to do. They were only four weeks into the job, after all, the prime minister was here, and they were live on television. Instead, the one to the collapsed one\u2019s right just stared skyward and looked as if she might cry.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe prime minister turned around and let out a short groan. Euuurgh. It happened to be the precise same noise that had exited his gob just two days previously, when he was standing at the despatch box of the House of Commons, and he watched his tiny parliamentary majority vanish directly in front of his eyes.\n\n(Phillip Lee defected to the Lib Dems, in case you don\u2019t recall. It turned out not to be that big a deal in the end, as Johnson sacked 21 other Conservative MPs a few hours later anyway).\n\nThe fainter, frankly, came from nowhere. All through the speech, the ranks of journalists had their eye on a different young woman, three to the right. She had been standing waiting for so long in the late afternoon sunshine, that her encrimsoning cheek had already required medical attention from a senior officer. By the time the prime minister drew to a close, it was puce. Before the incident occurred, it\u2019s fair to say she was expected to be the day\u2019s only medical casualty.\n\nThe signs are not good. The previous Tory prime minister managed almost a year and half in the job before suffering her first collapsing backdrop. Johnson is barely into week five. In other portents, he lost his voice as well. For around 30 mad seconds, he tried to recite the words to \u201cthe caution\u201d.\n\nYou do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence \u2013 and so on. It remains unclear why he thought reciting this was a good idea, not merely because he clearly didn\u2019t have a clue what the words are (a rarity among those in his profession), but chiefly because this was an audience of adults, and he was not in a primary school.\n\nBehind him, 32 faces went simultaneously red. Mercifully, most went back again.\n\nIn other d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu news, there are already rumours that parliamentary colleagues are preparing the P45, and this one won\u2019t be a prank.\n\nIt remains unclear whether these young men and women are officially part of the 20,000 new police officers Johnson is promising to create. And so it may not strictly be true to say it\u2019s already one down, 19,999 to go.\n\nHis other major pledge is 20 hospital upgrades and \u00a334bn for the NHS. At this rate of attrition, one\u2019s going to be needed just to deal with the other.", "description": "If I may be permitted to begin with a vanishingly rare bit of gonzo sketch writing, towards the end of Boris Johnson\u2019s question and answer session, at the end of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at a police training centre in Yorkshire, which ended at least an hour and a half after 32 trainee police officers had been ordered to form up behind it, I raised my hand.", "authors": ["Tom Peck"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/18/front-boris-johnson-police-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
