The old story dominating their coverage for the past two years has consisted of trying to prove that our president had \u201cuntoward relations with the Russians\u201d and had committed obstruction of justice in the process. (They\u2019ll not give up on the latter.)\n\nBut when Robert Mueller \u201cwalked off that witness stand,\u201d the whole \u201ccollusion\u201d thing fell apart. What that tells us about contemporary journalism and the man who oversees its practice at what is still considered one of the world\u2019s great newspapers is problematic, to say the least. Nor is it just a matter of social and political bias at work here.\n\nAs former federal prosecutor and National Review contributing editor Andrew J. McCarthy points out in this dense, deeply researched and highly readable book, there was indeed an extraordinary story growing out of the politics of the 2016 election, involving a national and international cast of characters at the highest levels, a story begging to be told by journalists true to their professions.\n\nThat story, in part, was indeed of collusion \u2014 not between the Trump campaign and the Russians, as Mr. McCarthy writes, but between the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration.\n\nAs the world knows, throughout the campaign, Hillary Clinton held a commanding lead in the polls. But there was always an unnamed unease among her most dedicated supporters \u2014 she wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s warmest or natural campaigner, and sooner or later she\u2019d have to debate Donald Trump. So a little extra campaign insurance was thought necessary, and the \u201ccollusion\u201d myth was born.\n\nThe myth, as fashioned by organs such as The New York Times and embellished by agents of some of our most trusted agencies and departments, was centered, as Mr. McCarthy writes, \u201cin the essential allegation: a Trump-Russia cyberespionage conspiracy to \u2018steal the election.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere was never any evidence of this, \u201cjust the sometimes lurid, sometimes laughable innuendo known as the \u2018Steele dossier,\u2019 a slapdash collection of \u2018intelligence\u2019 reporting, crafted by a former British spy and his former journalists partners, the anti-Trump partisans Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson, whose work was commissioned by the Clinton campaign.\u201d\n\nMr. McCarthy proceeds to take us through the process of the non-stop post-election peddling of the collusion narrative by ideologues of the national media, endless congressional hearings to charge the president with anything at all, intelligence agents and officials desperate to redeem their reputations, and those in the Washington establishment who still can\u2019t believe they\u2019re no longer taken seriously.\n\nHowever, he warns, the animus hasn\u2019t diminished, and the next election is looming. True, the \u201ccollusion\u201d charge didn\u2019t stick, rendered inoperative when Robert Mueller went home. But, as Mr. McCarthy says, \u201cThe collusion narrative had served its purpose \u2026 [S]eeded by the Obama administration, tilled by intelligence leaks, and tended by constant media care it accomplished its objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cA special counsel [in effect, an independent prosecutor] to monitor the Trump presidency was imposed, despite the absence of a criminal predicate.\u201d That special counsel, although producing a report that failed to satisfy committed partisans like the editor of The New York Times, did produce one that \u201curged an impeachment roadmap on the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives,\u201d thus providing the Democrats the meat of their 2020 campaign \u2014 a roadmap that Representatives like Jerrold Nadler are already enthusiastically following, to the apparent exclusion of any other congressional duties.\n\n\u201cThat is the Ball of Collusion: counterintelligence as a pretext for a criminal investigation in search of a crime; a criminal investigation as a pretext for impeachment without an impeachable offense; an impeachment inquiry as a pretext for rendering Donald Trump un-reelectable, and all of it designed as a straitjacket around his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill it succeed? That depends on whether President Trump exposes and defies the narrative, or plays the role it has scripted for him.\u201d\n\nAnd a little objective reporting by the national media wouldn\u2019t hurt at all.\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBALL OF COLLUSION: THE PLOT TO RIG AN ELECTION AND DESTROY A PRESIDENCY\n\nBy Andrew C.
