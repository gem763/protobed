It\u2019s electricity,\u201d said Max Fuentes, a utility consultant in Sacramento. \u201cWithout it, you\u2019re a Third World country. Well, right now, California is starting to act like a Third World country.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom heaped blame for the rolling blackouts on PG&E, the beleaguered electrical utility that filed for bankruptcy in January, citing its failure to maintain and improve transmission lines on its 70,000-mile service area.\n\n\u201cThis is not from my perspective a climate change story as much as it is a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,\u201d Mr. Newsom said at a Thursday press conference. \u201c[It\u2019s about] neglect, and a desire to protect not public safety but profits.\u201d\n\nPG&E faces as much as $30 billion in legal claims after its lines were found to have ignited 2017 and 2018 wildfires, including the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in state history, but critics like Rep. Tom McClintock, California Republican, said that focusing on the utility doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nPG&E lines may have provided the spark, but decades of mismanagement on state and federal forests left millions of dead and dying trees ready to erupt, thanks in part to environmental policies and legal challenges aimed at curtailing tree-cutting.\n\n\u201c[W]e need to recognize that bad public policies are contributing to a bad decision,\u201d said Rep. Tom McClintock, California Republican, who disagreed with the decision to deenergize the power lines.\n\nHe cited California\u2019s strict-liability law holding utilities responsible for wildfires caused by their equipment, even if no negligence or fault is involved. The state\u2019s wildfire commission has proposed scaling back the law, although such a change is seen as politically untenable.\n\n\u201cUntil the state government changes laws that currently hold utilities strictly liable for circumstances beyond their control, and until the state and federal governments change the laws that have made active public lands management all but impossible, we will continue to face these perils every windy day into the future, and that is unacceptable,\u201d said Mr. McClintock in a statement.\n\nPG&E\u2019s decision trades the risk of wildfire for the certainty of millions of dollars of damage to customers and I do not support it. However, bad public policy is contributing to this bad decision.https://t.co/XND5UIMeCD \u2014 Tom McClintock (@RepMcClintock) October 9, 2019\n\nThe Republican Party of California lashed out at Democrats, who control state government, accusing them of failing to prioritize public safety.\n\n\u201cLegislative Democrats have failed our state, our resources and our people by not properly taking preventative measures to avoid these annual atrocities,\u201d said the party in a statement.\n\nWhat California Democrats have done is prioritize climate change, setting a goal of 50% of electricity consumption to be provided by renewable energy by 2030.\n\nPG&E\u2019s reorganization plan would allow it to honor its $42 billion in power-purchase agreements for renewable energy sources, \u201cunder pressure from state lawmakers and regulators worried that breaking them could undermine the state\u2019s renewable energy goals,\u201d as reported by Green Tech Media.\n\nAt the same time, PG&E has fallen short on its grid-maintenance goals, completing only 30% of tree-trimming on its 2,455 miles of power lines and removing only about 40% of dead and dying trees, according to figures from the Wall Street Journal, thanks in part to a \u201clack of qualified tree workers.\u201d\n\nOne reason: The decline of the Pacific Northwest timber industry, driven by falling lumber prices and the 1990 Northern spotted owl decision. The forests have also become overgrown, making it easier for bark beetles and flames to spread.\n\n\u201cThey pass state laws and federal laws making it impossible to do logging,\u201d said H. Sterling Burnett, senior fellow at the free-market Heartland Institute. \u201cThey say you can\u2019t cut down these trees, even if they\u2019re dead, which means you\u2019re creating more and more fuel. They\u2019ve got forests there that historically may have had 300 trees per acre that now have 900 trees per acre.\u201d\n\n\u2018Climate change is coming\u2019\n\nClimate activists argue that the focus on tree-counts is meaningless without reducing atmospheric carbon-dioxide, which they blame for driving the 2011-17 drought that left the forests tinder-dry and vulnerable to fire.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s massive power outages show climate change is coming for everyone, even the rich,\u201d said the Saturday headline on Quartz.\n\n\u201cThe move exposes how brittle our systems are in the face of the climate crisis, which is making conditions that are ripe for large fires worse,\u201d said Gizmodo\u2019s Brian Kahn. \u201cIt also raises questions about how private companies handling public services are preparing for the coming onslaught of climate-fueled disasters.\u201d\n\nClimate Depot\u2019s Marc Morano disagreed, arguing that climate change \u201ccannot be blamed for California\u2019s electricity woes, despite claims to the contrary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main culprit in California\u2019s new blackout economy is mismanagement of water, forests and electrical lines,\u201d he said. \u201cIf California had been more proactive in scaling back tree and brush growth near electrical lines, mass-scale electrical blackouts would not be necessary.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said that the California blackouts illustrate the need for renewable power sources.\n\n\u201cThink of the alternative to these power outages and intense wildfires if America tackles climate change,\u201d tweeted Mr. Sanders. \u201cWe can build a smart, safe, and modern electrical grid that gives every American access to clean, cheap, and reliable energy from renewables.\u201d\n\nThink of the alternative to these power outages and intense wildfires if America tackles climate change.\n\n\n\nWe can build a smart, safe, and modern electrical grid that gives every American access to clean, cheap, and reliable energy from renewables. https://t.co/DYEUr1CWnz \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 10, 2019\n\nUnless that power is provided exclusively by rooftop solar tiles, however, transmission lines will be part of the equation.\n\n\u201cCalifornia greens will inevitably argue for more solar and wind power to \u2018save\u2019 the state,\u201d Mr. Morano said. \u201cBut they will not mention that mandating more solar and wind power will require many additional new power lines to transmit the energy.\u201d\n\nPG&E CEO Bill Johnson apologized last week for the blackouts and related technical issues, saying the company was given a choice between \u201chardship on everyone or safety, and we chose safety.\u201d\n\nFor Californians, the bottom line is that it may be too early to mothball their diesel-powered back-up generators. Another major electricity provider, Southern California Edison, shut off power Thursday to 13,000 customers in response to high winds.\n\n\u201c[G]iven the risk to public safety, the desire to have zero spark, we will very likely have to make this decision again in the future,\u201d said Mr. Johnson.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
