Hinds said that these results \"strengthens the case for further policy support next year.\"", "description": "\"The drop in the ESI, from 103.1 in August to 101.7 in September, marked a resumption of the steady decline in the index since the start of 2018.\"", "authors": ["Yusuf Khan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8dde4e2e22af718d6c26e7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
