It\u2019s the home of posh people gliding through immaculately decorated period sets dropping acid bon mots from their half-closed mouths. It\u2019s twisty crime dramas with dark edges and plentiful cliffhangers or anarchic and strangely sad comedies in which just about anything might or will go. What it rarely is it is the sort of raw, believable and authentic story that accurately reflects the reality of life for many in the UK today. This is where Top Boy comes in.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Is this the most violent show on TV?\n\n- The Dark Crystal is weird and brilliant\n\n- The Indian Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n\nWhen it first aired on the British TV network Channel 4 in October 2011 Ronan Bennett\u2019s series, directed with energy and flair by French-Algerian director Yann Demange (who would go on to make the equally tense \u201971), felt like a welcome jolt to the complacency of much other UK drama.\n\nSet on a fictional housing estate in East London\u2019s Hackney, the show detailed the efforts of two young men \u2013 Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane \u2018Kano\u2019 Robinson) \u2013 as they attempted to gain control of the estate\u2019s drug trade even as their actions put their friendship under impossible strain.\n\nWalters and Robinson\u2019s performances turned them into stars, but what made the show so important was its refusal to rely solely on their charisma. Instead, creator Ronan Bennett had a wider story to tell \u2013 in addition to Dushane and Sully we met the troubled Ra\u2019Nell (Malcolm Kamulete), a young teen increasingly struggling following his mother\u2019s sectioning; spent time with Turkish gangs as they attempted to muscle in on the trade; and met those who wanted to get in on the life, those who rejected it and those who just wanted to survive the daily grind.\n\nNo other show on British TV has so ambitiously attempted to tell the story of a community whose voice is rarely allowed to be heard\n\nA dark, beautifully paced and ultimately devastating second series built on the sense that here was a show truly prepared to pin a way of life to the page. Its authenticity was bolstered by the use of local teens in key roles and a grime-filled soundtrack that felt like the music you heard blasting from headphones on the streets every day.\n\nPlaudits swiftly followed. In a review of the final episode of that series, I compared it to David Simon\u2019s critically acclaimed The Wire and it\u2019s a comparison I stand by. No other show on British TV has so ambitiously attempted to tell the story of a community whose voice is rarely allowed to be heard. The stage should have been set for a triumphant third series, and one of those moments when a beloved cult series breaks out to become the only thing that anyone is talking about. Instead, Channel 4 cancelled it.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult, very disappointing,\u201d admits Bennett, describing the network\u2019s decision as \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d. \u201cBecause I\u2019d seen the impact the show had the community \u2013 we had a young cast filled with people who were not often represented on TV and who were all very excited about the kind of opportunities that might only come their way once in a lifetime and for that to be pulled away from them was terribly sad.\u201d\n\nSecond chance\n\nThankfully an unlikely saviour was waiting in the wings. Canadian rap superstar Drake turned out to be a huge fan and a third series has just launched on Netflix. \u201cDrake\u2019s been like the gasoline to our fire, enabling us to get the show back,\u201d says Bennett, adding that the rapper otherwise took a creatively hands-off producing role. Netflix commissioned a 10-episode third series, which \u201callowed the space to really explore the world and take the time we needed to tell the stories in far more detail\u201d.\n\nSo what should long-time fans and intrigued newcomers expect? First, and most importantly, while allowing for a bigger budget, the move to the streaming giant has cost the show none of its raw appeal. From the opening moments, when the camera pans over the Hackney and Dalston streets, to the sounds of man-of-the-moment AJ Tracey, it\u2019s clear that Top Boy is back.\n\nWithin a few brief scenes we\u2019ve been introduced to a new cast of strivers and dreamers trying to get by at the Summerhouse estate (notable performances include Michael Ward as the contained Jamie, who is trying to both become Top Boy and raise his two brothers away from the life) and checked in on some familiar faces as well.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we spent a long time discussing was the fact that Sully and Dushane would now be in their mid-30s and in roadman terms that\u2019s really ancient,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cWe had to acknowledge that and then find a reason why they still might be in that life. But we also wanted to point up that ageing, to say look six, seven years have gone past what does that mean?\u201d\n\nBennett was also keen to show how current events such as a looming Brexit truly impact on the daily lives of ordinary people. He began writing the third series just as the Windrush scandal broke \u201cand I knew I had to include that\u2026 if you write something that\u2019s very specific to time and place then you can\u2019t avoid those references. They have to go in.\u201d\n\nStreet smart\n\nSimilarly, there are acute scenes involving austerity, school cuts and careless middle-class drug consumption which nestle alongside more light-hearted digs at Hackney\u2019s gentrification and instantly recognisable scenes featuring laughing teenagers shooting the breeze ahead of a night out.\n\nThe key to getting those scenes correct, says Bennett, lies in allowing the young cast a certain freedom. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious of being a white middle-class man so while I do the first drafts, Gerry Jackson, who\u2019s from the community, is the script consultant. Once we\u2019ve got a pretty good version of the dialogue the actors then workshop the scene and make changes which is very important because the last thing I would want to force them to do is say lines they were uncomfortable with.\u201d\n\nBennett and his fellow producers, Charles Steel and Alasdair Flind, were also determined that the directing remained diverse. The first three episodes are shot by Reinaldo Marcus Green, director of the haunting Monsters and Men, while Nia DaCosta helmed an additional two. \u201cThose were conscious decisions not to add yet more middle-aged white men,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cSimilarly, with the casting \u2013 our criteria is always that the actor needs to look like they\u2019re from the world. The people working on the show recognise the feel and the tone and really understand what they\u2019re representing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m very aware that my own propensity is to start dark and get darker \u2013 but I think that when you\u2019re telling tough stories you need some hope for the audience \u2013 Ronan Bennett\n\nThat said, the new series has some eye-catching casting with key roles for rappers Simbi \u2018Little Simz\u2019 Ajikawo and David \u2018Dave\u2019 Omoregie. \u201cI hadn\u2019t actually heard of Dave,\u201d admits Bennett, sounding slightly shamefaced about the man whose debut Psychodrama reached Number one in the UK album chart and has been shortlisted for the 2019 Mercury Music Prize. \u201cBut Des Hamilton (the show\u2019s casting director) is very into music and he was very aware...he\u2019s great in the role. With Simz, Kane mentioned her and when she came in to read against Ashley [Simz plays Shelley, a local girl who has been looking after Dushane\u2019s mother in his absence], we could see that there was real chemistry there.\u201d\n\nThere is a sense, too, that this series has the balance just right between the harrowing, hard-hitting moments and the lighter moments of respite. \u201cI\u2019m very aware that my own propensity is to start dark and get darker,\u201d admits Bennett. \u201cBut I do think that when you\u2019re telling tough stories you need some hope for the audience. They can\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being hammered over the head with every episode. That\u2019s not to say they shouldn\u2019t be challenged but there are also limits.\u201d\n\nDoes he feel that the show\u2019s resurrection might see it become a global phenomenon along the lines of other recent UK hits such as Peaky Blinders? \u201cI just hope people think it\u2019s worth the wait now that it\u2019s risen from the dead. Obviously I think it is \u2013 I believe it starts strongly and that there\u2019s no dip and I don\u2019t think anyone will guess the ending. I suppose the one thing I\u2019m slightly concerned about is that anyone who watches it in the first couple of days might spoil it but that\u2019s the way in which TV is watched these days. We\u2019re not unique in that situation.\u201d\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLove TV?
