Sadly, he says it\u2019s never happened.\n\nLast week, in front of a crowd of SpaceX employees, some guests and a few members of the media in Boca Chica, Texas, Musk finally confirmed the truth that we\u2019ve never contacted aliens.\n\n\u2018As far as we know, we\u2019re the only consciousness, or the only life that\u2019s out there,\u2019 Musk said.\n\n\u2018There might be other life, but we\u2019ve seen no signs of it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018People often ask me,\u2019 Musk said, according to Space.com, \u2018What do you know about the aliens?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, I tell you, pretty sure I\u2019d know if there were aliens. I\u2019ve not seen any sign of aliens.\u201d\u2018\n\nMusk is confident we haven\u2019t ever had any close encounters of the third kind (Columbia Pictures)\n\nDuring a recent visit to Shanhai, the genius tech mogul said it was fundamentally important for humans to launch Mars exploration missions.\n\n\u2018Not from the standpoint of Mars just being an escape hatch or because I think Earth is doomed, but because there is a certain irreducible probability that something may happen to Earth,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Despite our best intentions and everything we try to do, there is a probability of external forces or some internal unforced error causing civilisation to be destroyed or sufficiently impaired such that it can no longer extend to another planet.\u2019\n\nHe said the fact we\u2019ve not managed to see any aliens could indicate our society is doomed to destruction. Some scientists have suggested the reason humanity has been unable to detect extraterrestrial civilisations is that intelligent beings inevitably kill themselves or die out in natural disasters before becoming sophisticated enough to journey through space and send messages through the cosmos.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX is leading the charge to colonise Mars (SpaceX)\n\n\u2018I think we should not take it for granted that consciousness will continue because we have not encountered any aliens,\u2019 Elon said.\n\n\u2018I think the thing about Mars is that it\u2019s important for us to take the set of actions that are most likely to continue consciousness into the future.\u2019", "description": "He hasn't had any", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_76845316_1570523422.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
