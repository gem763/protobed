made to ensure the safety of high-rise residents.\n\nThese touch on the ways the buildings are designed, constructed, approved and managed and how fire and rescue services respond.\n\nWhen deciding on the recommendations, Sir Martin said he had particularly considered their capacity for \u201cmaking a significant contribution to the safety of those who live in high-rise buildings\u201d.\n\nHere are the key recommendations, plus the areas to be looked at in phase two.\n\nEvacuation:\n\n\u2013 the Government must develop national guidelines for carrying out partial or total evacuations of high-rise residential buildings, which include procedures for evacuating people who are unable to use the stairs in an emergency, or who may require assistance (eg disabled people, older people and young children)\n\nFirefighters spraying water after the fire engulfed Grenfell Tower (Victoria Jones/PA)\n\n\u2013 fire and rescue services must develop policies and training for partial and total evacuation of high-rise residential buildings\n\n\u2013 all current and future high-rise residential buildings must be equipped with sounders or similar devices enabling fire services to send an evacuation signal to the whole or a selected part of the building\n\n\u2013 all fire and rescue services must be equipped with smoke hoods for evacuation through smoke-filled exit routes\n\nThe owner and manager of every high-rise residential building must:\n\n\u2013 draw up and regularly review evacuation plans, provide copies in electronic and paper form to their local fire service and place in an information box on the premises\n\n\u2013 prepare personal emergency evacuation plans (PEEPs) for all residents whose ability to self-evacuate may be compromised and keep these in the information box\n\n\u2013 the owner and manager of every residential building containing separate dwellings must provide fire safety and evacuation instructions in a form that the occupants of the building can reasonably be expected to understand\n\nEmergency calls:\n\n\u2013 The LFB\u2019s policies must be amended to draw a clearer distinction between callers seeking advice and callers who believe they are trapped and need rescuing\n\n\u2013 all fire and rescue services must develop policies for handling a large number of fire survival guidance (FSG) calls simultaneously\n\n\u2013 electronic systems must be developed to record FSG information in the control room and display it simultaneously in units at the fire\n\n\u2013 policies must be developed for managing a transition from \u201cstay put\u201d to \u201cget out\u201d\n\n\u2013 control room staff must receive training on handling such a change of advice and conveying it effectively to callers\n\nFire doors:\n\n\u2013 the owner and manager of every residential building containing separate dwellings must carry out an urgent inspection of all fire doors\n\n\u2013 they must carry out checks no less than every three months to ensure that all fire doors are fitted with effective self-closing devices in working order\n\n\u2013 all those who have responsibility for the condition of the entrance doors to individual flats in high-rise residential buildings with unsafe cladding must ensure that they comply with current standards\n\nFloor numbers:\n\n\u2013 floor numbers must be clearly marked on each landing within the stairways and prominently in all lobbies so they are visible both in normal conditions, low lighting and smoke\n\nPlans and inspections:\n\nThe owner and manager of every high-rise residential building must:\n\n\u2013 provide their local fire service with information about the design and materials of its external walls and inform them of any material changes\n\n\u2013 provide their fire service with up-to-date paper and electronic floor plans, showing key fire safety systems\n\n\u2013 regularly inspect lifts intended to be used by firefighters in an emergency, test the mechanism which allows firefighters to take control of them and report the results to the fire service every month\n\nAll fire and rescue services must:\n\n\u2013 ensure that all officers of the rank of crew manager and above are trained and aware of the requirements expected during inspections of high-rise buildings\n\n\u2013 be equipped to receive and store electronic plans and to make them available to incident commanders and control room managers\n\n\u2013 ensure that all staff understand the risk of fire taking hold in the external walls and know how to recognise this\n\nCommunication:\n\n\u2013 all officers who may be expected to act as incident commanders must receive training on communication with the control room\n\n\u2013 all control room operators of assistant operations manager rank and above must receive training on communication with the incident commander\n\n\u2013 a dedicated communication link must be provided between the senior officer in the control room and the incident commander\n\nCommand and control:\n\n\u2013 the LFB must develop policies and training to ensure better control of deployments and the use of resources\n\n\u2013 the LFB must develop policies and training to ensure that better information is obtained from crews returning from deployments and that it can be made available immediately to the incident commander\n\n\u2013 the LFB must develop a communication system to enable direct communication between the control room and the incident commander and improve the means of communication between the incident commander and the bridgehead\n\n\u2013 the LFB must investigate the use of modern communication techniques to provide a direct line of communication between the control room and the bridgehead\n\nEquipment:\n\n\u2013 the LFB must urgently take steps to obtain equipment that enables firefighters wearing helmets and breathing apparatus to communicate with the bridgehead effectively\n\n\u2013 the LFB must urgently take steps to ensure that the command support system is fully operative on all command units and that crews are trained in its use\n\nEmergency services:\n\n\u2013 each emergency service must communicate the declaration of a major incident to each other as soon as possible\n\n\u2013 clear lines of communication must be established as soon as possible between the control rooms of the individual emergency services\n\n\u2013 steps must be taken to investigate the compatibility of the emergency services\u2019 systems with a view to enabling them to read each others\u2019 messages\n\n\u2013 Emergency services and local authorities must investigate ways of improving the collection of information about survivors and making it available more rapidly to those wishing to make contact with them\n\nSir Martin did not make recommendations in certain areas, instead saying they fall under the remit of the inquiry\u2019s second phase\n\nThese are:\n\n\u2013 whether the regulations relating to high-rise buildings in England and Wales should be changed to apply to buildings lower than 18 metres\n\n\u2013 whether the use of combustible materials on the outside of high-rises should be banned\n\n\u2013 the testing and certification of materials\n\n\u2013 the installation of sprinklers", "description": "Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick made the
