That means all outpatient clinics that are not on a hospital's campus would be paid lower rates for doctor visits, essentially eliminating \"facility fees\" that hospitals add on top of their billing.\n\nMore specifically, this policy will only affect routine clinic visits based on a certain billing code. Instead of paying $116, which the standard hospital outpatient rate would have been, Medicare instead would pay the lower $46 physician rate \u2014 a 60% cut.\n\nThis does not involve other services, and does not affect outpatient clinics located on a hospital's campus or ambulatory surgery centers, Brookings Institution health policy researcher Loren Adler notes.\n\nBy the numbers: CMS estimates this policy would cut rates to hospitals by about $760 million next year, which is only about 1% of Medicare's outpatient payments. About 20% of those savings would accrue to Medicare beneficiaries in the form of copays they would no longer have to pay.\n\nBe smart: This is a somewhat narrow policy, since it only affects one kind of service. But it could open the floodgates for more services in more types of hospital outpatient settings to be paid at lower rates, and that's what frightens hospitals.\n\nHospital lobbying groups predictably put out statements condemning CMS' proposal.\n\nBut Axios asked the American Hospital Association if CMS had valid points with the policy, given that independent experts agree the current system gives incentives for hospitals to buy doctors' offices so they can jack up rates and add on facility fees.\n\nThe AHA responded with an old op-ed written by its top lobbyist, arguing how higher payments are needed so hospitals can provide \"around the clock\" care.\n\nLooking ahead: Expect hospitals to lobby extremely heavily against this, especially major teaching hospitals that would see some of the biggest payment reductions. And depending on what happens with the final rule, there likely could be litigation, similar to what hospitals are doing for major drug cuts that Medicare imposed.\n\nFlashback: This is not a new idea from the Trump administration.", "description": "Site-neutral payments are on the horizon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OQQRVqEkLrj1QZVWtA42LKeQ_dQ=/0x133:3800x2271/1920x1080/2018/07/26/1532629775230.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-26"}
