(Richard Shotwell/AP Photos)\n\nThe NBA Board of Governors convened on Friday and voted on a series of rule changes that will affect the upcoming season, notably involving tampering, traveling and setting lineups.\n\nTampering has been a big point of discussion over the offseason as dozens of stars changed teams, and early contact between teams and players remains among the sport\u2019s worst-kept secrets. The Board of Governors, made up of representatives from every team, is hoping this solution will help.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHow the new rules will actually be enforced and what their unintended consequences will be are worth monitoring as well.\n\nNew rules clarify the gather step\n\nJames Harden\u2019s creative gather step took the NBA by storm last season but also left plenty of fans (and players) scratching their head, wondering why he wasn\u2019t being called for a travel.\n\nWith that in mind, the league voted to add new language to the rule book on traveling violations that clarify the rule. As ESPN's Marc J. Spears reported, the rules will more clearly define the gather and how many steps players can take after it a player can take.\n\nNo word yet on if Harden\u2019s one-legged step-back three will be deemed legal if he debuts it in the fall.\n\nPenalties for tampering will be harsher\n\nPerhaps the most notable changes came with tampering, where fines for teams will be doubled to a maximum of $10 million, plus $6 million for entering into unauthorized agreements. Silver noted that fines are not often the best way to punish multi-billionaire owners, but he wanted to increase his power.\n\nESPN's Tim Bontemps also reported that Silver will have the ability to take phones and computers away from executives and players to check for impermissible communication.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Silver on tampering punishments: \"Suspending executives...taking away draft picks....voiding contracts...All those provisions are on the table. The ultimate goal is compliance.\" Silver says fining teams can often be the least effective avenue to rules compliance. \u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) September 20, 2019\n\nHow much this will affect free agency will be quite interesting. Teams and players come to agreements on deals well before the moratorium is lifted. Kevin Durant announced he was headed to the Brooklyn Nets before he was allowed to sign. It will be hard to know how things will change until the league drops its hammer on a team to send a message.\n\nSome teams were reportedly concerned that the league was rushing to come up with a solution and weren\u2019t clear how the league\u2019s investigations would work. However, the vote passed unanimously.\n\nSlightly altered rules about setting lineups\n\nAs one other notable rule change, teams will now have to report their starting lineup to the league 30 minutes before the opening tip rather than 10 minutes before, as the rules currently allow.\n\nTeams will still be allowed to make changes after the fact if a player aggravates an injury or suffers a new one, but this should give teams and fans more clarity about what to expect.\n\nSeveral other pro leagues have moved up the time at which teams are required to turn in lineups to give more transparency to bettors and clarity about injuries.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The league unanimously followed commissioner Adam Silver's advice and increased the penalties for tampering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gm7BIG3s_SUWBaieBgGVHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDYuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FpLxlbpvWcuCA28pROz1IA--~B/aD0yMTI2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5b603950-dbe4-11e9-bfda-7a1cf8ff3393", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
