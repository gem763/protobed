The president said he was also concerned about Turkey\u2019s ability to detain Islamic State (ISIS) fighters.\n\n\u201cThe president wants to make clear that it is imperative that Turkey not allow a single ISIS fighter to escape,\u201d he said.\n\nMnuchin said that the Department of Defense and the State Department would continue to monitor the Turkey military action for any humanitarian violations.\n\n\u201cThese are very powerful sanctions; we hope that we don\u2019t have to use them, but we can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, members of Congress are discussing leveling their own economic sanctions on Turkey in response to their military incursions into Syria, but it is unclear whether Trump\u2019s announcement will satisfy them.", "description": "President Donald Trump prepared possible sanctions against Turkey on Friday, warning the country against further violence against the Kurds.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Donald-Trump-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
