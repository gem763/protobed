But the embattled retail industry saw job losses that nearly doubled in September from August, reflecting a sector beset by bankruptcies, restructuring and headwinds from the U.S. trade war.\n\nIn a note to clients, Capital Economics chief U.S economist Paul Ashworth noted that the decline in retail employment \"reflects structural change rather than cyclical weakness.\"\n\nAll told, the retail trade shed 11,400 jobs in September, with most of that concentrated from the clothing and accessories business. The Labor Department showed much of that concentrated in clothing (down 14,000), which was partly offset by a 9,000 job gain in food and beverages.\n\nBut \u201csince reaching a peak in January 2017, retail trade has lost 197,000 jobs,\" the BLS stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople enter a Forever 21 store at a shopping mall in Montebello, California on September 30, 2019 a day after the fashion retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. - Global fast-fashion retailer Forever 21 said it was filing for voluntary bankruptcy Sunday, the latest US brick-and-mortar chain to embark on restructuring as shoppers migrate online.

Amid a widespread shift to buying on the web, malls and physical retailers have shuttered, and big retail chains \u2014 under fierce pressure from online retail giant Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 are consolidating.\n\n\u201cYou continue to see this move to online shopping,\u201d Bank of America\u2019s chief U.S. economist Michelle Meyer told Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade\u201d on Friday, underscoring why retail\u2019s been shedding workers for some time.\n\nThe competitive environment is \u201cchanging the workforces and showing up in the statistics,\u201d she added. People \u201care just spending differently and retailers are trying to accommodate that.\u201d\n\nIt suggests the payroll data\u2019s weakness is more about the brick-and-mortar getting displaced by the rise of e-commerce than economic weakness.\n\nA key takeaway is along the lines of what investment bank UBS said in a note to clients in April.\n\nAt the time, UBS predicted that roughly 75,000 retail stores that sell clothing, electronics, and furniture would close by 2026, as e-commerce continues to gain share. The bank noted around 16% of retail sales are currently online \u2014 and that number is expected to grow to 25% of all retail sales in 2026.\n\nBreaking the forecasted 75,000 number further, UBS expects 21,000 apparel stores to close their doors, along with 8,000 furniture stores and 10,000 consumer electronics locations.\n\nThe decline in the U.S. unemployment rate, which in September hit a 50-year low. More\n\nEven still, consumers are certainly not slowing down. The National Retail Federation said it expects holiday retail sales to surpass 2018, with a forecasted increase between 3.8% and 4.2% to total between $727.9 billion and $730.7 billion.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy is continuing to grow and consumer spending is still the primary engine behind that growth,\u201d NRF CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, there has clearly been a slowdown brought on by considerable uncertainty around issues including trade, interest rates, global risk factors and political rhetoric. Consumers are in good financial shape and retailers expect a strong holiday season. However, confidence could be eroded by continued deterioration of these and other variables.\u201d", "description": "Underneath the headline numbers of what was a solid U.S. jobs report for September is a retail sector that\u2019s relentlessly shed jobs, with no end in sight.", "authors": ["Julia La Roche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qNBOgYrSL7KBG9WPJBXN5w--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9NTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/aa6594c0-e6af-11e9-bba7-e9987d38a613", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
