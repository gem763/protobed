What\u2019s that? Procrastination? Nooo, this is research, dear friends.\n\nThere are many different options - and those four different accessory packs - to choose from, so in theory everyone should be able to build the Defender that perfectly suits their needs.\n\nBut what if it\u2019s not all about you? What if you\u2019re lucky enough to own a doggo? A huge 26 per cent of the UK\u2019s population do, so car design for canines should be important to manufacturers.\n\nAlso, dogs are the best.\n\nLuckily Land Rover knows this, because the new Defender has some seriously dog-friendly options. There are three different packs available for your pooch, all serving a different purpose.\n\nFirst up is the \u00a3696 Pet Loadspace Protection Pack, which adds a quilted boot liner and a partition between the boot and rear seats \u2013 something that\u2019s invaluable if you\u2019ve got an excitable Cockapoo in the back. Yep, we\u2019re speaking from experience.\n\nNext up is the Pet Care and Access Pack. It costs a whopping \u00a31,228, but it includes a ramp for your dog. A ramp! This is too cute. There\u2019s also a portable shower so you don\u2019t get muddy paws on your posh, 21st century interior.\n\nFor when you\u2019re on the move there\u2019s the Pet Transportation Pack. At \u00a3479, it\u2019ll add a foldable pet carrier, a rubber floor mat and a \u2018spill resistant water bowl\u2019 \u2013 whatever that is.\n\nThat\u2019s \u00a32,403 if you spec all three of the packs then. Expensive yes, but good luck looking your pooch in the eye and telling them you didn\u2019t buy the ramp\u2026", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1280w/public/images/news-article/2019/09/ed9a42b921df7e1e2eb7ce9d866eb3c5/screen_shot_2019-09-12_at_10.17.54.jpg?itok=CHC8vRWB", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
