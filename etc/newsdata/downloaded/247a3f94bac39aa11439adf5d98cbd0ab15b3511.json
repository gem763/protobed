The senator called it a \u201cbloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nHe was also one of the first, and few, GOP senators to raise concerns about a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of an impeachment probe into Trump's alleged soliciting of foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nAfter the White House released a partial reconstruction of the call, Romney said it was \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nIf the House voted on articles of impeachment, it would require at least 20 GOP Senators to vote to remove Trump in order to reach the necessary two-thirds majority.", "description": "Republican Sen.
