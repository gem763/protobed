He was less into the artistic side of photography and more into the technical side, more George Eastman than Ansel Adams.\n\n\u201cI was a guy with a camera trying to make a living and get started in the business,\u201d said Moien, who eventually found success running a custom photo lab.\n\nBut in 1971 Moien had just opened a photo studio in Hyattsville, Md., and when he saw a man named Jones Benally at Prince George\u2019s Plaza, he knew he had to take his picture.\n\n\u201cSomehow or other I got the nerve to go up to him and I said to him: \u2018I have a photo studio about a mile away from here and I would love to do some portraits of you,\u2019\u201d Moien said.\n\nBenally was a Native American dancer from Arizona. A promoter had brought him to the mall to perform the traditional dances of the Navajo, also known as the Din\u00e9, a word that means \u201cthe people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhotographing someone like him was out of the ordinary,\u201d Moien said. \u201cWe did family photos. I did the granddaughters of the guy who owned the Ford dealership.\u201d\n\n\n\nJillian O\u2019Brien at the National Folk Festival with Jones Benally, a Navajo dancer from Arizona. When she was in kindergarten, a photo of Benally hung in her classroom. She\u2019s a teacher now and has the photo, taken by Barry Moien. (Mike McLaughlin)\n\nMoien took Benally to his studio on Hamilton Street in Hyattsville and asked him to sit in front of a blue background. He took several photos with his Hasselblad, including one with Benally \u2014 slashes of paint on his cheekbones \u2014 wearing a crown of white and black feathers set in a beaded headband. It\u2019s known as a war bonnet.\n\nBy the time Moien had processed and printed the photos, Benally had moved on to perform elsewhere. It was 20 years before he saw the portrait. In the 1990s, Moien heard that Benally was performing in Washington with his children. He dug out the negatives and asked an employee at his Custom Touch lab named Mike McLaughlin to make enlargements.\n\nMoien went to the show and gave Benally some copies. The photos made an impression on Benally\u2019s children, who hadn\u2019t seen their father with anything but gray hair.\n\nMcLaughlin had made an extra print. He framed it and gave it to his daughter Jillian\u2019s kindergarten teacher, Pat Heinz. On the back he taped newspaper clippings about the Jones Benally Family Dancers. Maybe, he thought, Heinz could use it in the classroom.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how a photo of Jones Benally, a Navajo hoop dancer from Arizona, was used for more than a decade every fall when Heinz talked with her students about Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI think they too were struck by the beauty of the picture,\u201d said Heinz. \u201cIt just really made everything more real for them.\u201d\n\nWhen Heinz retired a few years ago, she gave the photo back to McLaughlin. He knew exactly what he\u2019d do with it: pass it on to his daughter Jillian O\u2019Brien, now a teacher herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to make it my own,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, who teaches fifth grade in Howard County.\n\nAnd the man in the photo? On Tuesday at noon he\u2019s performing with his children and grandchildren at the Library of Congress\u2019s Coolidge Auditorium. On Monday night, daughter Jeneda and son Clayson are performing at Rhizome DC with their two-person band Sihasin, a Navajo word meaning \u201chope.\u201d\n\nBenally remembers the photo.\n\n\u201cAt that time, we traveled to all the shopping centers,\u201d he said last week on the phone from St. Louis, en route to Washington. \u201cWe danced all over the world.\u201d\n\nHe remembers the war bonnet, too. \u201cThat was passed on from my grandfather,\u201d Benally said. \u201cHis name was Water Buckskin .\u201d\n\nMany people have seen Benally perform. He\u2019s in a children\u2019s book, too, Jeneda said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting that so many educational institutions have kind of adopted my dad into their classrooms \u2014 which is wonderful, because he is a teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a teacher of traditional Navajo culture. . . . When we talk to kids, my dad talks a lot about how we\u2019re all brothers and sisters and how important it is to respect each other and understand each other.\u201d\n\nBenally is in his 90s, though his family is unsure of his exact age. And now he\u2019s back in Washington \u2014 or \u201cWashingdoon,\u201d as some Navajo call it.\n\n\u201cWashingdoon is the place where a lot of the legislation that has impacted our people came from,\u201d said his son Clayson. Some of the government\u2019s worst policies \u2014 from boarding schools to genocide \u2014 are \u201ckind of summed up in that one word.\u201d\n\nThe portrait, Clayson said, is \u201ca very accurate portrayal of how our father is, how he traveled all across the world and has basically been an ambassador for our people.\u201d\n\nWhat does Jones Benally want those who gaze upon his face to think?\n\n\u201cThe people are still here.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Now in his 90s, Jones Benally has traveled the world sharing his culture.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dI0_EBAFPw0JMgH0IP-rSpinwNs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VOEGJJWSLAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
