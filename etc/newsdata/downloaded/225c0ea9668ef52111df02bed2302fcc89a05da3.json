REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng/File Photo\n\nIn an escalating row over the smoke haze, a Malaysian minister said on Thursday that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad would write to Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo to raise concerns about cross-border haze.\n\nMalaysia closed hundreds of schools and sent half a million face masks to Sarawak this week, after the smoke built up to unhealthy levels.\n\nAir quality in Indonesian towns closest to the fires have risen to hazardous levels and on Wednesday thousands held mass Islamic prayer for rain.\n\nForest fires have become an almost annual occurrence in Indonesia, especially in dry years, and Indonesia\u2019s neighbours have complained of the thick, choking haze wafting in, raising concern about health and the impact on tourism.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar on Friday said she felt Malaysia had not painted an objective picture of the flames, which have ripped through parts of Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra and Borneo islands for more than a month.\n\nBakar said while smog from fires in Indonesia may have crossed over to Malaysia, fires detected last week in the Malaysian state of Sarawak in Borneo and peninsular Malaysia also contributed to worsening air quality there.\n\n\u201cI only asked that they (Malaysians) be objective and sequential in their data analysis,\u201d she told Reuters on Friday, responding to Kuala Lumpur\u2019s remarks that it was using recent data from ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin in a post on her Facebook page on Thursday evening said Indonesia \u201cshould not be in denial\u201d and data should speak for itself.\n\nYeo said the ASEAN data put the number of hotspots in the Indonesian provinces on Borneo and on Sumatra island at 474 and 387, respectively, versus 7 in Malaysia. She also claimed that wind direction meant the haze could not be from Sarawak.\n\nBakar said she was not seeking to look for excuses but did not \u201chave time for polemics\u201d and would rather work on putting out fires that she said covered a \u201chuge\u201d area.\n\nJakarta had deployed 46 helicopters for water bombing and cloud seeding, Bakar said.\n\nIndonesia has sent thousands of security personnel to try to douse the flames. The government has also sealed off plantations operated by at least 30 companies, where fires had been spotted, and brought criminal charges against four.\n\nAt least four palm oil companies whose land had been sealed off were subsidiaries of Malaysian groups, Bakar said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A member of Manggala Agni (forest fire brigade) tries to extinguish peatland fires at a palm plantation in Pekanbaru, Riau province, Indonesia, September 4, 2019 in this photo taken by Antara Foto.

Sime Darby and IOI both said they were checking their Indonesian operations.\n\nSukses Karya Sawit, Rafi Kamajaya Abadi and Adei Plantation and Industry could not immediately be contacted. The parent companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Indonesia on Friday rejected Malaysian complaints about hazardous smoke drifting from its forest fires across the border, saying blazes were also raging in parts of Malaysia and on Malaysian-owned plantations in Indonesia.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429343468&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0GR", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
