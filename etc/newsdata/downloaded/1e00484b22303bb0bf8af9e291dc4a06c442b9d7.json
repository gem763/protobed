(Picture: Channel 4)\n\nEvery time I see Henry on screen, I hear Jidenna\u2019s lyrics, \u2018Calling on me like a young OG, I\u2019m a classic man.\u2019\n\nMy favourite stylish contestant, he continued to shine his fashion light in the tent, despite the heatwave (a heatwave feels so far away right now\u2026).\n\nHis range of shirts and ties have created quite the fashion wave in the tent since week one and will be missed. I\u2019ve got to give it to him, that\u2019s not easy attire to wear.\n\nAdded to that, each episode of Bake Off is filmed over two days, meaning that after a long day of stressful baking you have to wear the same clothes again the next day \u2013 which brings with it a particular set of challenges.\n\nI was very worried about a sweaty day in the tent so would spend the evening after the first day of filming hand washing my tops in my hotel room sink with a bar of hotel soap and then dry them on the radiator overnight ready for the next day\u2019s filming. I was a savvy banker and didn\u2019t splash out on two of the same item of clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI generally smell nice after a shower (the majority of the world\u2019s population do, to be fair) so there was never a stench from me after repeating outfits! The most unattractive thing known to mankind is B.O so I live by the mantra: cleanliness is next to godliness, B.O is a big NO, NO.\n\nI cracked out a floral shirt for botanical week (Picture: BBC/Tom Graham)\n\nFor nearly all tent residents, this is the first time being filmed for the telly too, which means you do tend to plan your outfits nearly as much as your bakes!\n\nBaking is a pretty physical pastime, with long hours on your feet, in hot, stressful conditions, so it\u2019s equally important to feel comfortable and not too restricted. There are added restrictions for TV attire, too (avoiding stripes for example, as they tend to get distorted on camera).\n\nPeople might not have realised, but I would theme my outfits based on my bake and mood for that week. In week six I cracked out a floral shirt for botanical week and a red T-shirt for Tudor Week (red is also my favourite colour and I was celebrating having made it that far!).\n\nI\u2019m a colourful guy and enjoy wearing clothes that reflect it. Hopefully Tan France from Queer Eye would approve. Although I personally think Antoni Porowski is a great kitchen fashion icon \u2013 he can rock a stylish tee while whipping up a feast. Total tent goals.\n\nTimes have moved on and chefs can fortunately now express themselves more freely in the kitchen, although it still seems to surprise lots of people.\n\nAntoni cooking with TV host Seth Meyers (Picture: Lloyd Bishop/NBC)\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a misconception around chefs that they\u2019re shouty and disciplined, but in actuality they\u2019re a highly creative bunch who are happy to spend hours along in the kitchen experimenting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to my cooking outfit of choice, I like to keep it simple with a T-shirt and chinos combination \u2013 maybe the occasional pair of jeans. Don\u2019t be fooled though, I do clean up quite well in a suit when the time calls for it!\n\nOne of the reasons behind my look is that, as a big guy (think Moto Moto in Madagascar), it can be tricky picking the right outfit. While T-shirt and chinos might appear simple, I like to think it\u2019s a classic look \u2013 clean and presentable.\n\n\u2018Moto Moto, name so nice you say it twice\u2019. Anyway, I digress!\n\nThis season Henry\u2019s been flying the flag for the next generation of bakers, showing that creative bakes go hand in hand with personal creative expression.\n\nI think the next Celebrity Bake Off should have a creative/fashion edition: RuPaul, Reggie Yates, Adele, Antoni and our queen, BadGirl Ri-Ri setting the tent alight!\n\nAnd of course, Henry needs to be featured too, as he shall be sorely missed \u2013 I\u2019m going to have to rely on Noel for fashion flamboyance next week! He better not disappoint\u2026..\n\nI\u2019m going to end this week with a toast to the young \u2018inappropriately\u2019 well dressed gentleman that is Henry!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope he continues to shine and see this opportunity as a stepping stone to bigger and better things. Not all is lost.
