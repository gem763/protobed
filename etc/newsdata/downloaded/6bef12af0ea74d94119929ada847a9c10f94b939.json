(Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg News)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A judge ruled Friday that Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, broke federal labor law by targeting union activity, the latest in a series of stinging rebukes to the electronic vehicle company.\n\nThe violations included a 2018 tweet from Musk\u2019s personal account that said nothing was stopping employees from voting, \u201cBut why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.\u201d\n\nTesla also introduced rules requiring permission for the distribution of union pamphlets and other materials in addition to threatening the loss of stock options if unionization occurred. The company also told employees that it would be \u201cfutile\u201d to unionize because they would lack a voice, according to the ruling.\n\nThose constituted \u201cunfair labor practices\u201d under the National Labor Relations Act, ruled Administrative Law Judge Amita Baman Tracy.\n\nNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 21, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Musk has gotten in trouble for his tweets. Last year he ended up in a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweet saying he had \u201cFunding secured\u201d to take the company private. Musk was removed as chairman of the company\u2019s board, and he and the company were each fined $20 million in a settlement of the charges. He is also now limited in what he\u2019s allowed to post on social media.\n\nFederal safety regulators also accused Musk of issuing \u201cmisleading statements\u201d on his company\u2019s Tesla Model 3 last year, sending a cease-and-desist letter after the chief executive claimed it was safer than other vehicles.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Friday ruling.\n\nTesla also unfairly disciplined employees who were seen as engaging in activity to advance a union, according to the ruling. Tesla must offer a fired employee his job back and remove disciplinary records for him and another worker who was warned in connection with his union activity, according to the ruling, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\n[Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk settles with SEC, paying $20 million fine and resigning as board chairman]\n\nTracy cited more than 10 actions committed by Tesla and Musk that violated provisions of the Labor Relations Act and ordered remedies including back pay and re-employment for the fired worker, the rescinding of rules that targeted union activity and a meeting at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, Calif., where the company must give workers detailed notice of the labor violations.\n\nMusk must be present for any such meeting, the judge ruled.\n\nTesla is likely to appeal the decision, which was brought in response to a suit filed by affected workers and the United Auto Workers union.\n\n[Former employee sued by Tesla says he was a whistleblower, alarmed by company practices and Elon Musk]", "description": "The judge ordered Tesla to reimburse one pro-union worker for lost wages and rescind rules aimed at union activity.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber", "September At Pm", "Faiz Siddiqui Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Technology Team.
