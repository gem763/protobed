REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nBolivia has been convulsed by protests for more than a week after its electoral tribunal abruptly suspended publication of presidential election results, later announcing Morales had pulled off a razor-thin victory allowing him a fourth term.\n\nThe results, which meant Morales narrowly avoided a run-off with Mesa, sparked accusations of fraud from the opposition leader and his supporters.\n\nMorales, Latin America\u2019s longest-serving leader, has denied the allegations but agreed to an audit and said he will go to a second round of voting if irregularities are found.\n\nNo date has been set as yet for the audit by the Organization of American States (OAS) but Bolivians have taken to the streets. Residents of capital La Paz on Monday took part in a general strike called by the opposition.\n\n\u201cI have always had the spirit of dialogue and a democratic and peaceful spirit, but my personal will is, at this time, conditioned by the popular protests,\u201d said 66-year-old Mesa, who was previously president from 2003 to 2005.\n\n\u201cThe popular protests are today demanding the government take a step back and admit fraud has been committed,\u201d Mesa told Reuters at his office.\n\nBolivians \u201cwould not accept a negotiation where the fundamental principles that are being defended today on the streets could be ceded,\u201d Mesa said.\n\nThe election audit should be carried out with speed and precision, he said, adding he backs calls for a second round from the OAS and the European Union.\n\nMesa demurred when asked how he can square desire for a run-off with distrust of the electoral tribunal, given some opposition members have called for the vote to be annulled.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely convinced that once it is unequivocally established that there was fraud, there is an open space,\u201d said Mesa, declining to elaborate.\n\nHe said the crisis was due entirely to Morales\u2019 desire to stay in power for his lifetime.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that his intention is to stay in government indefinitely, illegitimately,\u201d Mesa said. \u201cThis is a political process that is debasing, deteriorating and corrupting - that is expressed by the desire for power for power\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nMorales has regularly said his continued candidacies are a response to the will of Bolivians and a patriotic sacrifice on his part.", "description": "Bolivian opposition leader Carlos Mesa on Monday ruled out any negotiations with President Evo Morales to end the South American country's political crisis, as strikes closed roads, schools and businesses around the nation.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445979330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1N2", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
