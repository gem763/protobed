It also comes in a waterproof formula (Lights, Camera, Splashes), but it unfortunately isn\u2019t on sale at either retailer today.\n\nHuffPost This mascara normally retails for $23 at both Sephora and Ulta, but you can get it for just $11.50 today.\n\nWhat makes this beauty battle really interesting is the timing. Both retailers are fiercely fighting to be your first destination for beauty picks. For instance, Ulta\u2019s 21 Days Of Beauty sale started on Sept. 1 and will continue offering a different skin care, hair care or makeup product for half-off its original price every day until Sept. 21. That means 50% off best-selling brands like Mario Badescu, Too Faced and Urban Decay, with some exclusive deals for Ulta Diamond and Platinum members (those who spend $450-$1,200 a year at Ulta).\n\nThough Sephora just had its summer sale a few weeks ago, the brand low-key announced a surprise sale this week of one-day-only deals at 50% off until Sept. 21, coinciding with Ulta\u2019s 21 Days of Beauty. Coincidence? We think not.\n\nWe\u2019re sure this won\u2019t be the last time both beauty retailers get back in the ring, but we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll see another deal like this on a cult-favorite mascara, so shop today while it\u2019s still on sale.", "description": "Both retailers are fiercely fighting to be your first destination for beauty picks.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a7700230000580551ff39.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
