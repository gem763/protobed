More expansive suites offer ultra-luxurious accommodations but can cost well over $800 per night.\n\nI spent a night in an upgraded King One-Bedroom Suite with Balcony and think it's worth every penny.\n\nI'm a fan of the staycation. You can rest and recharge without stepping foot in an airport. And by removing actual travel costs, you might have extra cash to spend.\n\nBut as a resident of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the idea of one at the William Vale Hotel felt a bit funny. My own bed would be just a 20-minute walk away. It would have to be a pretty special hotel to feel worth it.\n\nIt was.\n\nThe William Vale is, quite simply, one of the coolest hotels in New York. It's effortlessly sophisticated and super modern, best evidenced by the fact that locals actually hang out here. I would know; I'm one of them.\n\nSince the hotel opened in 2016, I've been a regular visitor to Westlight rooftop bar, as well as the on-site Italian restaurant, Leuca. They are both top choices for celebrating special occasions and anniversaries or to impress out-of-town friends and family.\n\nIt was only after booking a room however that I realized I was missing out on half the experience. Staying overnight won't come cheap, but it's absolutely worth it.\n\nStandard rooms typically cost around $400 per night, though if you're able to stay on a weeknight or book a special package, you might snag a deal as low as $228. Entry-level offerings are quite small for a rather expensive price; if you're able to afford an upgrade (or have credit card points to use), I think it will feel more worth it.\n\nWhile spacious suites start at around $800 per night, they offer the chance to spread out in one of New York's hippest hoods with unrivaled views. I spent the night in a King One-Bedroom Suite with Balcony, comped for review purposes, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for anyone looking for a super stylish splurge.\n\nIndeed that's who stays here: a well-heeled set in search of sophisticated accommodations, with the budget to pay for it. They want VIP access to the hotel's on-site hotspots, but without the typical snobbery that sometimes accompanies high-end hotels.\n\nAnd, as any Brooklynite will tell you, staying over the river in Williamsburg is so much better than cramming into Times Square.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by the William Vale Hotel in Williamsburg.", "description": "The William Vale Hotel in Williamsburg is one of the coolest hotels in New York.
