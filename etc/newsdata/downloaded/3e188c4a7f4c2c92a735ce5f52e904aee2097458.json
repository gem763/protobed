REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/Files\n\nEasyJet shares, however, fell sharply from a five-month high hit in the previous session, with some brokers disappointed by a lack of positivity on the underlying outlook given the struggles of rivals across the sector.\n\nBritish Airways pilots went on strike for two days last month, grounding thousands of flights. BA owner IAG said that the strikes would take 137 million euros ($150.47 million) off this year\u2019s earnings.\n\nThough Ryanair (RYA.I) flights ran as scheduled during industrial action last month, easyJet said the strikes helped to lift its revenue per seat by 0.8% in the second half, having previously expected a slight fall.\n\nEasyJet now expects full-year headline pretax profit of between 420 million pounds ($515.6 million) and 430 million pounds, said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren, citing increased demand because of the disruption at British Airways and Ryanair.\n\nIt had previously forecast profit between 400 million and 440 million pounds.\n\nWhile Lundgren also pointed to more price points for seat selection and hold luggage, as well as measures to make its fleet more resilient to operational disruptions, he said market conditions remain \u201cchallenging\u201d.\n\nThe company added that full-year headline costs would increase by about 12%, partly due to higher fuel prices.\n\nBernstein analysts said they hope for more detail from next month\u2019s full-year earnings call on whether the boost from strikes at BA and Ryanair was obscuring underlying trends.\n\nTravel group Thomas Cook TCG.L collapsed last month, with the company unable to service its debts and convince banks to back a rescue plan in the face of changing customer habits and intense competition from fast-growing airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair.\n\nEasyJet\u2019s expected capacity growth in 2020 is expected to be at the lower end of its historic range, it said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe market was hoping for a more robust commentary, with a mention to positive pricing trends, with this needed to deliver reasonable profit growth this year given the less attractive fuel hedging it has in place compared to last year\u2019s rates,\u201d broker Goodbody said in a note.\n\n\u201cOverall, we see today\u2019s release as disappointing.\u201d", "description": "British budget airline easyJet expects full-year profit towards the top end of expectations, helped by pilot strikes at rivals British Airways and Ryanair , it said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438348032&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970BX", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
