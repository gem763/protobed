The outages may last until midday Monday.\n\nForecasters are predicting the strongest winds in years throughout the region.\n\nThe shutoff could potentially affect a larger number of people than two weeks ago, when PG&E cut off power to 738,000 customers in 34 counties.\n\nCalifornia Office of Emergency Services Director Mark Ghillarducci is warning Californians to be prepared with supplies because gas stations and grocery stores might lose power.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nThe Gentle Barn animal sanctuary in Santa Clarita was forced to evacuate 74 animals, ranging from horses and pot-bellied pigs to an emu and a parrot, as fire embers rained down over their property and volunteers stomped them out.\n\nFounder Ellie Laks says Friday they were unable to evacuate a stubborn horse named Zoe, a massive 750-lb (340 kilograms) pot-bellied pig named Zeus and a 3,000-lb (1,360 kilograms) cow named Forgiveness, as well as five other cows who couldn't be separated.\n\nThe goats and sheep must be moved again because they're too close to coyotes and bobcats\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nThe U.S. government says there will be no enforcement of immigration laws during California wildfire evacuations and relief efforts unless holding back on detaining someone would pose a serious public safety threat.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Friday in a statement that agents and officers will scale back immigration enforcement to help save lives and keep people safe. It has made similar announcements during hurricanes and other major natural disasters.\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies are both part of Homeland Security and often assist during natural disasters. The sight of uniformed officers can frighten people in the country illegally and deter them from seeking help.\n\nPew Research Center estimates that 2.2 million California residents are in the United States illegally, the highest of any state by far.\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom says only 6,700 Pacific Gas & Electric customers remain without power after a widespread blackout the utility imposed to prevent deadly wildfires.\n\nBut the company is planning a major shutdown that could hit 2 million people throughout the region starting Saturday night and last up to 2 days.\n\nForecasters are predicting the strongest winds in years throughout Northern California Saturday night and Sunday.\n\nCalifornia Office of Emergency Services Director Mark Ghillarducci is warning Californians to be prepared with supplies and to be ready to flee their homes if they are ordered to evacuate because of wildfires.\n\nHe urges people to fill up their vehicles with gas and buy food because gas stations and grocery stores might lose power.\n\nAnother 40,000 customers are still without power in Southern California because of the pre-emptive shutoffs.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nShares of California's largest utility have closed down 31 percent on news that the company's equipment might have played a role in another wildfire.\n\nThe plunge for Pacific Gas & Electric stock on Friday came after the utility announced Thursday that it found a broken wire on a transmission line near a wildfire that broke out in wine country north of San Francisco.\n\nThat fire has destroyed 49 homes and other structures.\n\nPG&E is in bankruptcy because of massive liability from recent major wildfires, including one last year that killed 85 people and wiped out much of the Northern California community of Paradise.\n\nSince then, PG&E's stock has fallen from nearly $50 per share to $5.\n\n___\n\n1:35 p.m.\n\nFirefighters in Southern California's San Diego County have corralled a wind-driven wildfire that triggered evacuations near the community of Ramona.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says the forward spread of the blaze was stopped early Friday afternoon.\n\nThe 97-acre (39-hectare) fire is 15% contained.\n\nFirefighters are also working to contain fires burning in north Los Angeles County and in wine country north of San Francisco.", "description": "A spokeswoman for Southern California Edison says the utility had turned off power hours before a fire sparked in Southern California that now threatens more than 15,000 structures in suburban developments north of Los Angeles.
