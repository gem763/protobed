Several Midwestern cities have seen big hits to their population in the last decade as a result of more people moving away than coming in.\n\nUsing data from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates program, we found the metropolitan areas located in the Midwestern states with the most negative net migration between 2010 and 2018, adjusted by the size of the 2010 metro area population.\n\nNet migration measures the number of people who moved into the metro area from some other part of the US or another country, minus the number of people who left the metro area over that period. That means the cities on our list saw many more people move out since 2010 than move in.\n\nHere are the 20 Midwestern cities with the most net outmigration as a share of 2010 population:", "description": "Many cities in the Midwestern region of the US saw big population outflows over the last decade as more people moved away than moved in.", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0acbfcc4a0a54c34b9f45?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
