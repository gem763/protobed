The waters are a major shipping route for global commerce and are rich in fish and possible oil and gas reserves.\n\n___\n\n\u2018ABOMINABLE\u2019 PULLED IN VIETNAM, MALAYSIA OVER SEA CHINA SEA MAP\n\nThe animated movie \u201cAbominable\u201d has been pulled from Vietnamese and Malaysian theaters due to a scene showing a map supporting Chinese claims to the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe image in one scene showed the so-called nine-dash line, a vague and broken outline around resource-rich waters China claims as its own territory.\n\nTrailers and other associated information for \u201cAbominable\u201d have been removed from the Vietnamese distributors\u2019 website and social media channels. The movie\u2019s trailer and posters were removed from advertising screens in theaters.\n\nA Dreamworks representative did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment about the scene and Vietnam\u2019s ban.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it had no information about the ban. It reiterated that China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea were clear and consistent.\n\nThe movie will skip Malaysian theaters after producers decided against cutting out the scene showing the map.\n\nMalaysian film distributor United International Pictures said in a brief statement Monday that \u201cUniversal has decided not to make the censor cut required by the Malaysian censor board and as such will not be able to release the film in Malaysia,\u201d where it was due in theaters on Nov. 7. It declined to give further details.\n\nUniversal is the parent company of DreamWorks Animation, which co-produced the movie with China-based Pearl Studio. \u201cAbominable,\u201d which has nothing to do with the territorial dispute, is about a Chinese girl who helps a yeti get back to its home on Mount Everest.\n\n___\n\nUS OFFICIAL: CHINA LACKS SINCERITY OVER CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nA top U.S. diplomat says Washington questions China\u2019s sincerity in negotiating a code of conduct with other South China Sea claimants.\n\nIn testimony Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, David R. Stilwell said China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is pursuing a \u201crepressive alternative vision\u201d for the region that seeks to reorder it in its favor and has put Beijing \u201cin a position of strategic competition with all who seek to preserve a free and open order of sovereign nations within a rules-based order.\u201d\n\nStilwell, assistant secretary of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said China\u2019s claim to virtually the entire South China Sea as exemplified by the \u201cpreposterous nine-dashed line\u201d lacked \u201clegal, historic, or geographic merit.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said they still impose real costs on other countries by inhibiting them from accessing more than $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves, while \u201ccontributing to instability and the risk of conflict.\u201d\n\nStilwell was especially scathing about China\u2019s claim to be pursuing a peaceful code of conduct with other parties, given what he described as its consistent use of its navy, coast guard and other actors to bully neighbors such as Vietnam and cement its claims in their area by building artificial island outposts.\n\n\u201cWe remain skeptical of the PRC\u2019s sincerity to negotiate a meaningful Code of Conduct that reinforces international law.,\u201d Stilwell said.\n\n\u201cIf it is used by the PRC to legitimize its egregious behavior and unlawful maritime claims, and to evade the commitments Beijing signed up to under international law, a Code of Conduct would be harmful to the region, and to all who value freedom of the seas.\n\n___\n\nUS, BRUNEI FORCES HOLD JOINT TRAINING\n\nMilitaries of the U.S. and Brunei, whose South China Sea claims overlap with those of China, are holding joint exercises simulating the securing of a beachhead and conducting jungle warfare and combat medical training inland.\n\nMembers of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit arrived in Brunei aboard the U.S. amphibious dock landing ship USS Harpers Ferry more than a week ago to prepare for the drills, known as Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training, or CARAT, the Navy said on Tuesday.\n\nThe exercises include the use of amphibious assault vehicles and are intended to demonstrate Washington\u2019s commitment to its security partnerships in the region. China has sought to weaken those through economic inducements and sponsoring its own multinational exercises.\n\n\u201cOur participation in CARAT shows the United States\u2019 commitment to the region and strengthens longstanding maritime partnerships with our allies,\u201d Cmdr. Janice Pollard, commanding officer of Harpers Ferry, was quoted as saying in a Navy news release.\n\nWorking side-by-side with Brunei\u2019s armed forces, the U.S. can \u201cdevelop cooperative maritime security capabilities in support of security, stability and prosperity in maritime regions throughout Southeast Asia,\u201d Pollard said.\n\n___\n\nTYPHOON FORCES CANCELLATION OF JAPAN FLEET REVIEW\n\nTyphoon Hagibis forced Japan to call-off an international fleet review that was to include participants from China for the first time.\n\nThe review would have been the first in four years. It was scheduled for early October in Sagami Bay, southwest of Tokyo, but high winds and rough seas forced its cancellation.\n\nRepresentatives from a record seven nations - the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, Singapore, India and China - were to have attended.\n\nDespite continuing distrust over Japan\u2019s militarist past and China\u2019s goal of regional military dominance, the two countries agreed last year to conduct reciprocal port visits by naval vessels. China is especially critical of Japan\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the U.S. and the presence of Japanese naval assets in the South China Sea.\n\nOne of China\u2019s most advanced guided missile destroyers, the Type 052D Taiyuan, had planned to take part in the review. Ongoing tensions between Tokyo and Seoul dictated that South Korea\u2019s navy was not invited.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple territorial disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons.
