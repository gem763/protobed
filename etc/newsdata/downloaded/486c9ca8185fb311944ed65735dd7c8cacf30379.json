Just like Steele\u2019s dossier, the complaint is riddled with third-hand rumors, gossip and hearsay gathered from similarly anonymous officials.\n\n\u201cI was told that a State Department official\u201d did this or that. \u201cI heard from multiple US officials\u201d that such and such. \u201cOfficials have informed me. \u2026\u201d And so on. Much like Steele, the Ukraine informant lacked first-hand access to evidence he claimed proved Trump\u2019s guilt. It must have been hard to blow an accurate whistle when the whistleblower wasn\u2019t even in the same room.\n\nThe questionable use of media sources to buttress hearsay claims is also consistent across both documents. After Steele compiled his dossier, he peddled the allegations to numerous reporters, who then dutifully reported them as fact. The Obama administration then cited those articles, which were sourced directly to Steele and his dossier, as proof of the validity of the allegations. One article was given to a federal intelligence court to justify wiretaps on a Trump campaign affiliate. The information it alleged was false.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sean Davis", "Nypost.Com"], "top_image": ""}
