Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Finance Committee, found that senior NRA officials pursued personal business interests on the trip and then helped a senior Russian government official and a Russian gun rights activist meet GOP presidential candidates and other political figures during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cDuring the 2016 election, Russian nationals effectively used the promise of lucrative personal business opportunities to capture the NRA and gain access to the American political system,\u201d Wyden said as he released findings of an 18-month investigation by the Finance Committee minority staff into the NRA\u2019s relationship with Russia.\n\nThe NRA rejected the findings, which come as the organization is beset by infighting and allegations that top officials gained financially from their ties to the tax-exempt gun rights group.\n\n\u201cThis report promotes a politically motivated and contrived narrative,\u201d said William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA. \u201cThis report goes to great lengths to try to involve the NRA in activities of private individuals and create the false impression that the NRA did not act appropriately. Nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nThe report was dismissed by the Republican chair of the Finance Committee, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who labeled it \u201ca political document directed at an organization well-known in U.S. politics to be despised by Democrats,\u201d adding that the GOP majority \u201cfinds no wrongdoing by the NRA.\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, top NRA officials, including the organization\u2019s incoming president, Pete Brownell, and a past president, David Keene, traveled to Moscow. The group met with Maria Butina, who later pleaded guilty of working as an unregistered Russian agent.\n\nThe NRA has said that the trip to Moscow was not officially approved by the tax-exempt organization.\n\n\u201cCertain NRA members made the trip of their own accord,\u201d said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. \u201cNRA CEO Wayne LaPierre was opposed to it and, at his directive, no NRA staff members or employees attended.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman for Brownell, who left the NRA board in May, said that the group approved the trip and that he obtained guidance from the U.S. government before going.\n\n\u201cHe went to support the NRA as the incoming president and would not have gone if it was not an NRA trip,\u201d Brownell spokesman Ryan Repp said. \u201cPete received absolutely no business for his company as a result of this trip. He has fully cooperated with all inquiries into this matter and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nIn his report, Wyden cites official NRA documents and internal communications to buttress his claim that it was an official NRA trip. The report cites instances in which NRA officials met with officials from the Kremlin. The report also says that Brownell explored business opportunities with Russian arms manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThis was an official trip undertaken so NRA insiders could get rich \u2014 a clear violation of the principle that tax-exempt resources should not be used for personal benefit,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 report also suggests NRA insiders may have violated U.S. sanctions against Russia by meeting with sanctioned Russian government officials and state-linked weapons manufacturers.\n\nIn 2018, Wyden asked the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control to investigate whether some of the Russian weapons manufacturers the NRA delegation met with have evaded U.S. sanctions by abusing domestic shell companies.\n\nWyden called on the IRS and Treasury Department officials to examine his findings. Grassley said nothing in the Wyden report \u201creasonably calls into question the NRA\u2019s tax-exempt status.\u201d", "description": "A long-running inquiry by Sen.
