Adam Schiff (D-CA) indicated this week that he is not concerned about the impeachment effort hindering the re-election chances of vulnerable Democrats.\n\n\u201cLet the chips fall where they may,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff declared, seemingly throwing some of his Democrat colleagues under the bus.\n\nSchiff\u2019s comments came during an interview Monday at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, moderated by New York Times reporter Nicholas Kristof.\n\nThe moderator noted that former Rep. James Rogan (R-CA) lost his congressional seat to Schiff in 2000 after voting in favor of impeaching President Bill Clinton.\n\nKristof asked Schiff:\n\nThere are certainly some House members and some Senators who are going to be up for re-election. \u2026 Do you worry that whether because of Fox News, whether because of polarization that this investigation is going to end up hurting some of these Democrats \u2026 in the same way that it hurt James Rogan when you first ran for office?\n\nSchiff responded:\n\nI don\u2019t\u2019 focus on, and I really don\u2019t do the analyses of how does this cut in 2020. I can understand why people are really interested [in] and concerned about that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the question I should be asking myself. There are good arguments that could be made about this base being more excited or that base being more excited by impeachment. I think the question that we need to ask ourselves in Congress is \u2014 is this the right thing to do for the country and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nSchiff is one of the chairmen leading the impeachment investigation. The Democrat-led Committee on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment probe.\n\nSome constituents in Democrat-controlled congressional districts have already expressed dismay at their lawmakers\u2019 support for the impeachment investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nVulnerable freshman Democrats in the House representing Republican-friendly regions, in particular, met at least some opposition to their support for the impeachment investigation during the recent two-week congressional recess.\n\nRecent internal polling suggested a storm is brewing for vulnerable Democrats in key congressional districts.\n\nPolling by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) showed most voters do not consider Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an impeachable offense.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d claim that Trump attempted to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter by withholding aid triggered the impeachment probe. Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegation.\n\nAccording to some polls, public support for impeaching and removing Trump is on the rise. Some of those polls, however, have been discredited.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of House Democrats support the impeachment probe, eight do not, the New York Times reported.", "description": "Schiff indicated he is not concerned about the impeachment effort hindering the re-election chances of vulnerable Democrats.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/interview-for-adam-schiff-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
