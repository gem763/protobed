The Kurdish Red Crescent has raised concerns about civilians being affected by chemical weapons in the conflict between Turkish and Turkish-backed forces and Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\n\"The OPCW is aware of the situation in northern Syria and is collecting information at OPCW Headquarters with regard to the alleged use of chemical weapons. So far, the OPCW has not yet determined the credibility of these allegations,\" the OPCW told Insider via email. The allegations were first reported by Lara Seligman in Foreign Policy.\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent said in a statement that six victims had burns from \"unknown weapons\" and that it was investigating the incident. The Times of London reported that a 13-year-old boy in a hospital in Tal Tamir, near fighting in Ras al-Ayn, was affected with excruciating burns that suggested more than just a conventional weapon.\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent told the Rojava Information Center that the victims suffered second- and third- degree burns, and that, \"We as KRC cannot confirm use of chemical weapons yet, but working together with international partners to investigate this subject.\"\n\n\u2014Rojava Information Center (@RojavaIC) October 18, 2019\n\nHamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former official with the UK's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment, told The Guardian that photos of the injuries suggested the use of white phosphorus, a chemical that in itself is not illegal to use during combat; it can illuminate an area at night, and provide a smokescreen for troops during daylight hours. But its use against civilians is banned, as it causes horrific and searingly painful burns on the skin.\n\n\"It is a horrific weapon, and has been used repeatedly during the Syrian civil war; unfortunately its use has become increasingly normalized,\" de Bretton-Gordon told The Guardian.\n\nSeveral reports from 2017 allege the use of white phosphorus by the US-led coalition in Syria in 2017, although it is unclear whether its use caused civilian injuries.\n\nOn Thursday, a halt in Turkey's offensive against Kurdish-backed forces was announced; however, Kurdish-led forces near the border say that the fighting has continued on the border, in the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn. According to Kurdish forces, civilians were hit in shelling by Turkish and Turkish-backed Syrian forces, and five Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighers were killed, CNN reported.\n\nTurkey has denied the reports, but emphasized that this is not a permanent ceasefire, and that it will continue to attack should Kurdish-backed forces should they not evacuate Turkey's proposed \"safe zone\" by Tuesday night.", "description": "Images from a hospital in a Syrian border town showed children with horrific burns that may be consistent with white phosphorus.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9d21bcc4a0a5fad0b25ed?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
