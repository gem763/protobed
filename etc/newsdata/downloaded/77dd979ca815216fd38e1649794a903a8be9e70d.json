I called you out!'\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @thehill Fmr. President Barack Obama: \"This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're politically woke, and all that stuff -- you should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.\" pic.twitter.com/6ISzic13yK \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 30, 2019 Report\n\n\"That's enough,\" he said. \"If all you're doing is casting stones, you are probably not going to get that far.\"\n\nMr Obama added that \"people who do really good stuff have flaws\".\n\nHis comments come as Democrats prepare for the 2020 presidential nomination race. So far, there has been a focus on how \"woke\" candidates are, with a number apologising for past incidents.\n\nBefore withdrawing from the race, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand went on television to apologise for using the term \"illegal alien\" in the past. Elizabeth Warren has apologised for identifying as Native American, while Pete Buttigieg has apologised for his use of the phrase \"all lives matter\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Michelle Obama: \"I want to remind white folks: Y'all were running from us\"\n\nIt isn't the first time Mr Obama has raised the issue.\n\nLast April, he told a crowd at an Obama Foundation event in Berlin: \"One of the things I do worry about among progressives in the United States, maybe it's true here as well, is a certain kind of rigidity where we say 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be' and then we start sometimes creating what's called a 'circular firing squad', where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues.\"\n\nJen Psaki, former Obama White House communications director, told CNN that she believed Mr Obama's most recent comments were a message for the Democratic Party and those running for election.\n\n\"If we are launching purity tests, we are going to have such a small party and will not be able to win. Governing is not about saying: 'You don't agree with me, then you can't be part of the conversation.'\"", "description": "The former US president says being judgemental does nothing to bring about change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sjql4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
