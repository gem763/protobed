There's no way I will sit back and do nothing. It just means I'm going to have to start this campaign as well as going through my cancer.\n\n\"But I have a massive network of family and friends who have been so supportive and amazing.\"\n\nSpeaking in the Senedd on Wednesday, Torfaen AM Lynne Neagle said she has repeatedly raised concerns about the IPFR process with Health Secretary Vaughan Gething and his predecessors.\n\nAddressing Mr Gething, she said: \"After two successive refusals by the IPFR panel in Gwent, Gemma is having to launch a fundraising campaign to raise the money to pay for her treatment.\n\n\"Even though the difference in treatment cost between Kadcyla and the [anti-cancer] drugs she is currently on - which her clinician has advised her are unlikely to help her - is small she will, of course, have to fundraise the full cost of the treatment - some \u00a345,000.\n\n(Image: WalesOnline/WS)\n\n\"I still don't believe the IPFR process is working for my constituents and it certainly isn't working for Gemma Williams.\n\n\"Can I ask you whether you can look again at this to ensure that all patients in Wales are getting access to new treatments clinician believe they need?\"\n\nMr Gething, who vowed to look at this specific case with Ms Neagle, replied: \"We had a review [of IPFR] at the start of this Assembly term because of issues members around the chamber had raised about the apparent inequalities in access and the inability to understand the system from both a clinician and patient point of view.\n\n\"Following the review we have implemented all of the 27 recommendations. I can't comment on the individual circumstances surrounding this particular case, but across the system seven out of 10 IPFR requests are currently being approved.\"\n\nA whole host of fundraising activities are taking place in Gemma's honour. Her husband Jamie is planning on climbing Snowdon in March 2020, then walking the 134 miles back to their home in Cwmbran.\n\nTo donate please go to https://www.gofundme.com/f/gems-pink-army", "description": "Gemma Williams, 35, from Pontnewydd, Cwmbran,\u00a0 is now fundraising \u00a345,000 so she can have to access to a pioneering drug Kadcyla", "authors": ["Mark Smith", "Image", "Walesonline Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20720951.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mum-35-with-aggressive-breast-cancer-denied-funding-for-lifesaving-drugGemma-Williams-is-now-havi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
