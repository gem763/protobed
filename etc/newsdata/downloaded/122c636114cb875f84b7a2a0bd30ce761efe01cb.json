The effort over the past couple of months has alarmed civil rights groups, which see it as part of a backdoor move by the Trump administration to reduce the political power of minorities.\n\nIn August, the bureau began requesting five years' worth of driver's license records, promising the information would be kept confidential. The effort began after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Trump's administration plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and the president instead ordered citizenship data compiled through administrative records.\n\nAt least 13 states have refused to share the driver's license data, 17 are still deciding what to do, and 17 haven't yet received a request, according to the AP survey. Three states didn't respond to multiple AP queries.\n\nRepublican and Democratic states alike have said no, citing privacy concerns and prohibitions in state law.\n\n\"Philosophically, we believe the information in the database doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the people who it pertains to,\" Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said. \"It's not ours to give away.\"\n\nTwo of the biggest states, California and New York, haven't received requests yet. Three more of the top five most populous states \u2014 Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania \u2014 are deciding how to respond.\n\nCensus Bureau officials had no immediate comment.\n\nDemonstrators rally at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on April 23, 2019, to protest a proposal to add a citizenship question in the 2020 Census.

Many states got calls or emails similar to one from a Census Bureau official asking an Arkansas Driver Services official if she had time to discuss the bureau's \"new and exciting project.\"\n\nScott Hardin, a spokesman for the Arkansas agency, said: \"We are currently working to determine whether the requested information is eligible for release.\"\n\nUtah officials turned down the request because state law says personal data can be shared only for public safety reasons, said Marissa Cote, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Safety in the Republican-leaning state.\n\nDemocratic-leaning Nevada also declined.\n\n\"We value our residents' privacy and hesitate to release records in bulk,\" said Kevin Malone, a spokesman for the motor vehicle agency.\n\nStates that haven't decided how to respond said they were researching the legal and privacy implications. In issuing driver's licenses, most states require documents such as a birth certificate that would reflect citizenship or require that recipients be either citizens or in the U.S. legally.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has urged states to turn the Census Bureau down.\n\nThe ACLU and other civil rights groups say the requests are part of an overall strategy by the Trump administration to encourage states to use counts of citizens only, as opposed to total population, when redrawing state and local electoral districts. Such a move could make districts older, whiter and more Republican.\n\n\"This endeavor appears to be part of a scheme motivated by an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose to dilute the political power of communities of color,\" said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project.\n\nSupreme Court blocks 2020 census citizenship question for now\n\nThe Census Bureau said in its requests that the driver's license records would be used, in part, to help build a statistical model for calculating the number of citizens and noncitizens in the U.S.\n\nCivil rights groups say driver's license records do a poor job of showing if a person is a citizen.\n\nThey point to what happened earlier this year when Texas' election chief gave prosecutors a list of 95,000 potential noncitizens on the state's voter rolls. The list was drawn up with the help of motor vehicle records. But it turned out that many of those people had become citizens before casting their ballots.\n\nThe battle over whether citizen-only counts can be used for congressional reapportionment or redistricting at the state and local levels is being waged in federal courtrooms in Alabama and Maryland.\n\nIt has been longstanding practice in the U.S. to include immigrants living in the country illegally in census counts, which are also used to allocate billions of dollars in federal spending.", "description": "After the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's proposal for a Census citizenship question, it turned to state DMVs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/14/ee8a23e2-fe63-41ff-9de1-eeacbf8db384/thumbnail/1200x630/f92483c9ae736f10092b5bbc16b03425/ap-19281782392868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
