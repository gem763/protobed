Those who have worked closely with him for a number of years admit he is yet to really open up in public, while others who are trying to get to know him are largely left to guess what he might be feeling.\n\nThe guessing game has gone into overdrive ever since Pulisic arrived at Chelsea this summer and told reporters looking for clues about his personality that they would have to make up their own minds about what his tattoos mean from photographs because he did not want to tell them.\n\nIt has been similarly hard to read how he has been feeling about his start to life at Stamford Bridge, following the forward\u2019s \u00a358million move from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nTo his credit, Pulisic has not ducked questions over his tough introduction to English football. But, other than confirming he wants to start more games, the American has not given much away in terms of how he has been dealing with the challenge of being Chelsea\u2019s only big-money arrival during the club\u2019s Fifa transfer ban and a summer in which Eden Hazard left for Real Madrid.\n\nHe cut a frustrated figure during his last Chelsea start, against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, when Pulisic struggled to make the sort of impact head coach Frank Lampard would have expected against League Two opposition.", "description": "It is not easy to scratch under the surface of Christian Pulisic.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Alan Tyers", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000206447615-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwaf8jc-4qYo1BBAVcdHD7Wc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
