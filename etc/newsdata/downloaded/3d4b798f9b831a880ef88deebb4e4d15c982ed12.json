China must end its draconian surveillance and repression, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease its coercion of Chinese Muslims abroad, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said in a statement.\n\n'If you enter a camp, you never come out': inside China's war on Islam Read more\n\nThe US punitive measures mark the first time China has been held to account internationally for its programme of mass incarceration and persecution of religious minorities.\n\nThe sanctions prompted a furious response from Beijing\u2019s embassy in Washington, which said that the US was using \u201cthe excuse of human rights\u201d to interfere in the China\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nIn a string of tweets the embassy said the move \u201cseriously violates the basic norms governing international relations, interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs and undermines China\u2019s interests\u201d.\n\nThe embassy said: \u201cThe counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang are aimed to eradicate the breeding soil of extremism and terrorism. They are in line with Chinese laws and international practices, and are supported by all 25 million people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang.\u201d\n\nInside the administration, the sanctions mark a victory for Pompeo, Vice-President Mike Pence, the administration\u2019s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, Sam Brownback, and the new deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, over the treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin.\n\nMnuchin reportedly argued against sanctions that would further derail difficult trade talks. News of the sanctions drove stock prices lower on the assumption that it would make a trade deal less likely.\n\nDonald Trump himself has sought to avoid direct criticism of the Chinese government for its treatment of the country\u2019s Muslims, as well as its attempts to crush pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, so as to avoid a breakdown in his personal relations with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.\n\nAt a meeting on religious freedom last month at the start of the UN general assembly, scheduled at the same time as a global climate action summit, Trump gave the keynote speech but did not mention China or the events in Xinjiang, leaving it to Pence, Pompeo and Brownback.\n\nThe fact that these long-planned measures have been taken may reflect Trump\u2019s awareness of his reliance on the religious wing of the Republican party for his re-election bid next year.\n\nThe state department announcement did not name the Chinese officials that had been targeted, but officials had previously pointed to the Xinjiang party secretary, Chen Quanguo, a member of the politburo.", "description": "More than 1 million Uighurs and other minorities detained, and move to censure China is seen as victory for Pompeo and Pence over Mnuchin", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a84ed0a22d77ac1b46d56834e2fcb2ece56afd5/0_125_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f1b1e955e7f4b23f55de6f56c81b9ef", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
