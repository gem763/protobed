Some clinicians have told the CDC they were concerned about patients resuming use after treatment.\n\nThe guidance also recommends clinicians follow up with patients within one or two weeks after being discharged from the hospital.\n\nThe CDC and the Food and Drug Administration don\u2019t know what is causing the illnesses, but most patients have reported vaping THC products.\n\n\u201cI think that there will be multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\u201d said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC.\n\n\u201cI do think the phenomenon we\u2019re seeing is going to have an explanation. It may not be tomorrow. It may take a few months to really understand the portion of the illness that's due to some new risky practice in the preparation of these materials or other other causes.\u201d\n\nThe CDC on Thursday confirmed 26 deaths since the outbreak started early this summer.\n\nIn all, 1,299 confirmed or probable lung injury cases related to vaping have been reported to the CDC so far, an increase of 219 cases from figures released last week.", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidance Friday for\u00a0clinicians whose patients might have lung illnesses related to vaping.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/vaping_070919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
