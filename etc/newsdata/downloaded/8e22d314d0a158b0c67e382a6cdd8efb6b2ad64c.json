The games just keep coming and players like that. They much prefer to play games than train \u2013 well, as a player I did and I\u2019m sure the lads are the same.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to St Mirren and Livingston and Hamilton, so they have witnessed these types of stadium. What I will say, having seen it only on TV, is that the pitch there looks great. That\u2019s our main concern \u2013 a good playing surface \u2013 and that makes it great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been really good because they invest a few quid in it and that\u2019s typical of Roy. He\u2019s a class act.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sixth in the league and they\u2019ll be happy with their start but we\u2019ve got to ask the boys to go again and go again and repeat. We go there off a good result against Motherwell, coming back from a goal down, so it\u2019s just about keeping it going.\u201d", "description": "For Steven Gerrard and some of his recent recruits, Rangers\u2019 visit to Ross County on Wednesday evening will be an introduction to one of the Scottish Premiership\u2019s singular arrangements \u2013 a trip to the league\u2019s most northerly outpost just after the clocks have gone back.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214330269-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqC_LLCXkS_z-CZqgOMP7Be9WPY3Z_26YLrAU_gL4_dbY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
