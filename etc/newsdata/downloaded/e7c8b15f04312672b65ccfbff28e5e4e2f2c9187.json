(USAT)\n\nCHESTNUT HILL, Mass. \u2013 It has been nearly three full years since Les Miles ingloriously left the college football sideline, fired from LSU after a September loss to Auburn in 2016. Miles took two full seasons off after that year, experimenting with a vegetarian diet, starring in beer commercials and discovering the joy of Lulu Lemon shorts.\n\nAlong the way, he discovered that all he really wanted to do was coach, and his best opportunity came at one of college football\u2019s worst programs \u2013 woebegone Kansas.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe comeback of Les Miles, 65, began formally in November when he arrived in Lawrence. But he announced himself as back Friday night with his first signature victory, pummeling three-touchdown favorite Boston College, 48-24, to give Kansas a needed adrenaline shot of relevancy.\n\n\u201cIt was a soft moment for me,\u201d Miles told Yahoo Sports in a hallway after the game. \u201cI saw our players who were celebrating and happy. It\u2019s just what you wanted to be a part of. It\u2019s why you came back.\u201d\n\nA viable and interesting Les Miles makes college football more fun. And it certainly makes Kansas football more interesting.\n\nMiles told the team they could stay in Boston and go \u201cout on the town\u201d after the game if they won, joking after that he committed a potential NCAA violation. He also spent a few minutes postgame with two random Jayhawk fans \u2013 Boston University dental students \u2013 who sat with Miles\u2019 wife and daughter, Kathy and Smacker, during the game and were deemed good-luck charms.\n\nStory continues\n\nKansas entered the game having lost 48 consecutive Power Five road games, a streak that stretched back to 2008. Miles ended that with alacrity, as the Jayhawks compiled 541 yards of offense. A week after scoring seven points in a brutal home loss to Coastal Carolina, Kansas somehow scored on seven straight possessions. (Miles deflected credit to defensive coordinator D.J. Eliot for shutting out BC in the second half.)\n\nTailbacks Khalil Herbert (187 yards on 11 carries) and Pooka Williams Jr. (121 yards) carried Kansas. Crafty senior quarterback Carter Stanley finished 20-of-27 for 238 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe only good thing for Boston College was that this game was broadcast on the ACC Network, which meant limited viewership. This will go down as the most dispiriting loss of Steve Addazio\u2019s seven seasons at BC, as the Eagles\u2019 defensive front got consistently mauled and the backend missed tackle after tackle. The offense disappeared. Addazio used the phrase \u201cmy responsibility\u201d three times in his postgame news conference.\n\nThat left Miles with his 200th career victory, and a great postgame scene where he was FaceTiming with his youngest daughter Macy back in Lawrence on his other daughter Smacker\u2019s phone as he walked into his new conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for him,\u201d Kathy Miles told Yahoo Sports. \u201cThis is what he\u2019s done his whole life.\u201d\n\nAnd Miles was happy to predict more eye-popping moments for Kansas.\n\n\u201cThose things are going to happen, more regularly with our program,\u201d Miles said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf anybody wants to know why a guy would come back, college football, this night tells you how important college football is.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Miles has the signature early win of his Kansas tenure.
