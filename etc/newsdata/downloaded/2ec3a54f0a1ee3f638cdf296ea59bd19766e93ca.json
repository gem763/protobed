We\u2019re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week at a U.N. press conference in New York.\n\nAnalysts say the sheer amount of revenue isn\u2019t unprecedented, but it is an unusual turn of events in the post-World War II era.\n\n\u201cWe used to get most of our revenue from tariffs. But it\u2019s very unusual because for the last 80 years tariffs have been a declining source of revenue, so this is the first time [in recent history] it\u2019s been rising source of revenue,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nTariffs are a tax on imports, largely designed to promote domestic producers by making outside goods less attractive.\n\nMr. Trump says China is \u201ceating\u201d the cost of his levies, but it\u2019s complicated. Some Chinese companies may be forced to offer discounts to U.S. importers, though American-based businesses often pay the cost of the tariffs\u2014 and pass it along to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe price tag is set to rise this fall, as Mr. Trump imposes a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of additional Chinese goods. It took partial effect Sept. 1 but won\u2019t be fully implemented by mid-December, to avoid ripples during the Christmas shopping season.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan Chase estimated the average American family could face up to $1,000 in new annual costs once the levies are in place, since the tariffs are starting to hit popular consumer goods.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has retaliated with trade moves and tariffs of its own, hurting farmers in particular. While Mr. Trump is using some the incoming duties to bail out the agricultural sector, some Senate Republicans say all Americans should see relief.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, Florida Republican, has been meeting with the White House on a proposal that would pass along tariff revenue in the form of tax cuts.\n\n\u201cSen. Scott supports the president\u2019s efforts to get tough on China, but any revenue brought in to the federal government should be returned to the taxpayers,\u201d Scott spokeswoman Sarah Schwirian said.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, filed legislation last week that would gather up tariff revenue and give it to working-class taxpayers in the form of a rebate check that arrives several months after tax-filing season.\n\n\u201cTariffs are an effective way to apply pressure to China and other nations in trade negotiations, but there\u2019s no reason that tariff revenue can\u2019t help working Americans in the process,\u201d Mr. Cotton said.\n\nU.S. adults who are citizens or legal residents, file federal taxes and earn less than $84,200 as an individual filer or $168,400 as joint filers would be eligible for a rebate check. The plan starts with a special rebate check for calendar years 2017 and 2018 \u2014 mailed within 90 days of enactment \u2014 and would establish a recurring, annual rebate for eligible filers so long as money is pouring in from what\u2019s known as section 201, 232 and 301 duties.\n\nAccording to Mr. Cotton\u2019s office, the rebates would be a good way to shore up political support for the U.S. crackdown on China, while protecting American wallets against any prices increases that emerge as tariffs increase.\n\nThe White House hasn\u2019t weighed in yet \u2014 the bill was just released \u2014 though Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has voiced support for Mr. Scott\u2019s push to offer tax cuts equal to the amount the U.S. collects in tariffs.\n\nMr. Scott\u2019s spokeswoman said the senator plans to put forward a formal proposal in the coming weeks.\n\nMr. Goldwein said the perceived merit of the proposals will depend on one\u2019s view of the tariffs in the first place. If you think tariffs are good policy, by preventing trade that\u2019s harmful to American interests, then it makes sense to help consumers bear some of the costs with a rebate.\n\nIf you think tariffs are unwise and hinder economic growth, \u201cin that case you\u2019re sort of just masking the effect of a bad policy,\u201d Mr. Goldwein said.\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union is in that latter group, saying it would be better to scrap the levies instead of shifting money around.\n\n\u201cInstead of imposing tariffs on Americans and running the money through D.C. and then trying to rebate it to taxpayers, it would be much simpler and fairer to just not impose the tariffs in the first place,\u201d said Bryan Riley, director of NTU\u2019s Free Trade Initiative.\n\nAs Congress plots its next steps, Chinese Vice Premier Liu Hu is set to return to Washington with his trade delegation Oct. 10 to resume talks with the Trump administration.\n\nBeyond the 10% tariff being rolled out in stages, levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise from 25% to 30% Oct. 15.\n\nThey were supposed to start Oct. 1, though Mr. Trump delayed them for two weeks as a goodwill gesture as China celebrates the 70th birthday of the start of communist rule there.\n\nMr. Trump toasted China\u2019s anniversary in a tweet Tuesday, cultivating his relationship with President Xi Jinping even as members of his party chastised Beijing for its stifling rule and ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nThe president often goes out of his way to compliment Mr. Xi as a strong leader who drives a hard bargain, even as he slams China\u2019s economic practices in the same breath.\n\nMr. Cotton and other Republicans said there was nothing to cheer Tuesday, citing brutal social campaigns over the past decades and the detainment of Uighurs in western China.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
