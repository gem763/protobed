Isn\u2019t the country drug-ridden and dangerous? And isn\u2019t the capital Bogota a no-go area?\n\nThe answer is no \u2013 things have moved on. Backpackers and birdwatchers have been visiting Colombia for a while and the country is open for business. There are even tours of Medellin (though drug lord Pablo Escobar\u2019s house has been demolished).\n\nVisitors are in part lured by the incredible food scene, with chefs rediscovering forgotten regional ingredients and salvaging traditional cooking techniques. Stop over for a couple of days, perhaps en route to a second Latin American country, and give your tastebuds a treat.\n\nDespite its turbulent reputation, backpackers and birdwatchers have been visiting Colombia for a while and the country is open for business. Pictured is Bogota, the country\u2019s sprawling capital\n\nMODERN MARVELS\n\nIn Bogota, El Chato was recently voted one of Latin America\u2019s top 50 restaurants. The restaurant has a youthful buzz \u2013 bench seats and tables surround a luminous bar. Chef Alvaro Clavijo likes to \u2018mix the best local ingredients in unexpected ways\u2019 \u2013 and so it proved. After a soft crab starter with squid-ink rice paper came sea bass in a luxurious coconut cream sauce. Expect to pay \u00a340pp for a two-course dinner with wine (elchato.co).\n\nHEAD TO MARKET\n\nRikot of colour: One of the fruit and veg stalls at Paloquemao market in Bogota\n\nThe next morning I accompanied chef David Orozco to Paloquemao market. You\u2019ll find everything from the tropical to the temperate here \u2013 bananas, limes, figs, grapes, even apples and raspberries. I lost myself among the stalls, finding dairy products from the Colombian highlands and sugar cane from the coast. Eventually Orozco reappeared with some snacks \u2013 pan de yuca (cheesy bread), almojabana (corn buns) and bunuelo (a fried dough ball). Organised market tours cost about \u00a325pp.\n\nBOOK A COOKERY COURSE\n\nCooking courses are always fun, so I visited Krone, a small bistro owned by Ana Maria Mendez and Nicolas Rengifo. Nicolas adapts dishes, combining ingredients from Colombia\u2019s different regions, to create something new. For ceviche, we \u2018cooked\u2019 shrimp in lime juice, but instead of ketchup we flavoured it with a fresh tomato and garlic sauce. In Cali, pork loin generally comes as leche de dolores \u2013 with tomato, red onion, garlic and coriander. Here, we gave the pork more texture with a tempura batter and served it with coconut rice from the Caribbean coast. The course costs about \u00a365pp.\n\nHEAD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\n\nThe cutting edge of culinary Bogota is driven by social media \u2013 you\u2019ll find posts about \u2018closed door\u2019 dinners. Both David Orozco\u2019s restaurant Oculto and the Krone bistro offer them. At Krone, Ana Maria says: \u2018Like in Italy, the best local food was always at your grandmother\u2019s, so nobody went out to eat. But people are now starting to experiment.\u2019 According to a menu card from the previous night, guests had eaten a sanduche de chicharron from Medellin (a pork-belly sandwich), then beef tongue cooked in coriander and cane juice, before a black pudding and seared scallop salad. Finally, the cocoa creme brulee originated from Tumaco on the Pacific coastline. It costs \u00a345pp with half a bottle of wine (facebook.com/OcultoBogota).\n\nGO ON A FOOD SAFARI\n\nThe next morning I joined a tour with Bogota Foodie (\u00a328pp). We started at Paloquemao, with a hearty local fish sancoche (potato, plantain, yucca) then explored Colombia\u2019s extraordinary produce, arranged in colour-co-ordinated stacks \u2013 yellow, orange and red peppers; ranks of purple and green avocados; and some fruits you won\u2019t recognise (mamoncillo, anyone?) bogotafoodie.com.\n\nFORAGE FOR INSPIRATION\n\nGridlocked traffic is a drawback in Bogota but it\u2019s well worth the drive to reach Canasto Picnic Bistro, the lunchtime restaurant of chef Alejandro Cuellar, who is known for using edible flowers grown on his family hacienda just outside the city. His dishes are a riot of colour. In an open-air dining room, I chose a plate of beetroot carpaccio, crumbled goat\u2019s cheese, grapefruit and grilled artichoke, sprinkled with nasturtium, begonia and borage (\u00a310, canasto.co).\n\nCOFFEE JUST GOT COMPLICATED\n\nChemistry lesson: The coffee class at Cafe San Alberto\n\nAll of this indulgence made me sleepy, so a caffeinated jolt at Cafe San Alberto was most welcome. Its \u2018molecular coffee\u2019 afternoon (\u00a335pp) was like stepping into a lab \u2013 miniature glass beakers and brass stills were ranged on the table. We sniffed essential oils from phials, testing the basic flavours (sour, sweet, bitter, salt), and the aromas of coffee \u2013 floral, earthy, herbal, woody, spicy.\n\nAnd then the alchemy began as coffee was bubbled through tubes, thrown into nitrogen and calcium chloride, and even suspended in tonic water for a coffee cocktail. My favourite experiment was making coffee caviar \u2013 tiny pieces of jelly that exploded in the mouth like coffee grenades (cafesanalberto.com).\n\nTHE GRAND FINALE\n\nMy last dinner was a superb, tasting menu with paired wines at Bogota\u2019s most imaginative restaurant, Villanos en Bermudas. The restaurant is extremely polished and our courses included a yogurt, roasted radicchio and dragonfruit salad, a pil-pil fish broth with an olive oil emulsion, and chocolate with a cantelope melon sorbet and a butter cracker that danced on the tongue. Expect to pay \u00a340pp with a cocktail (villanosenbermudas.com).", "description": "Visitors are in part lured to Columbia for the incredible food scene, with chefs rediscovering forgotten regional ingredients and salvaging traditional cooking techniques.", "authors": ["James Henderson For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/16/19627154-0-image-a-48_1570893306813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
