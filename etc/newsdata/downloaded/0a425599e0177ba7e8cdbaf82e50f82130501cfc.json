Roth Jr. Bridge and was completely submerged, Master Cpl. Michael Austin of the Delaware State Police said Sunday.\n\nPolice are still investigating why it went off the road. A bystander called 911.\n\nFirst responders found a 16-year-old girl sitting on the banks of the canal, near the scene of the crash, Austin said. She told police that the 18-year-old driver of the vehicle helped her get safely to shore, then jumped back in to rescue the three boys.\n\nFirst responders found the 18-year-old's body in the water nearby. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Austin said.\n\n\"He was a hero,\" Austin said. \"He tried to do everything he could to help the remaining passengers in that vehicle.\u201d\n\nJust before 5 p.m., police say the vehicle was removed from the water, where the 16-year-old and 12-year-old boys were found dead.\n\nThe 6-year-old boy remains unaccounted for, police said.\n\nThe search and related investigation are active and ongoing, a Sunday evening press release from state police said.\n\nAll four males were related, Austin said. The girl, who is from New Castle, was an acquaintance.\n\nThe victims' names will be released once their family has been notified of the deaths, police said.\n\n\"My thoughts and prayers go out to a family whose lives were changed forever today,\" Austin said.\n\nA massive response\n\nSearch and recovery operations spanned the day.\n\nDozens of emergency personnel and about 50 vehicles lined the south bank of the canal as divers worked in the water just beyond.\n\nThe canal was temporarily closed to commercial traffic, according to police radio, though private vessels were being allowed through.\n\nThere were at least four police and fireboats in the water at about 1:30 p.m., plus a couple of small inflatables. Dive teams were used to search the canal, while a helicopter hovered overhead for at least part of the response.\n\nThe C&D Canal is flanked on both sides by steep embankments and is about 35 feet deep, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nFollow Jessica Bies, William Bretzger and Matt Moore on Twitter: @JessicaJBies, @billbretz and @MattKenMoore.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Delaware News Journal: Delaware canal car crash: 18-year-old dies trying to save passengers", "description": "A 16-year-old girl was found sitting near the scene of the crash on Sunday, Delaware State Police said.
