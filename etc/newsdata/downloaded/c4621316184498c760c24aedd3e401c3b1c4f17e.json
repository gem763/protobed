In 2015, he produced the first-ever encyclical letter on care for the environment.\n\nA vocal advocate of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, Pope Francis has urged climate change skeptics to an \u201cecological conversion,\u201d stating that such skeptics are often engaged in \u201ccontinued wars of domination camouflaged by righteous claims\u201d that \u201cinflict ever greater harm on the environment and the moral and cultural richness of peoples.\u201d\n\nFrancis has stated that humanity is experiencing a \u201cclimate emergency,\u201d and therefore disbelief in human-induced climate change is a \u201cperverse\u201d attitude that endangers everyone.\n\nFour \u201cperverse\u201d attitudes that obstruct the quest for concrete solutions to the problem of climate change \u201crange from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation, or blind trust in technical solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nThese perverse attitudes, Francis said, \u201ccertainly do not help honest research and sincere and fruitful dialogue on building the future of our planet: denial, indifference, resignation and trust in inadequate solutions.\u201d\n\nLast June, the pope threw his moral weight behind a carbon tax, saying is imperative to oblige people to curb the use of fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cA carbon pricing policy is essential if humanity wants to use the resources of creation wisely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe failure to manage carbon emissions has produced a huge debt that will now have to be repaid with interest from those who come after us.\u201d\n\nThe cost of carbon usage must be paid here and now by those who use it, and not deferred for future generations to cover, he proposed.\n\nThe pontiff warned of disastrous consequences if humanity does not immediately react to the threat of climate change, since the world has reached a \u201ccritical moment\u201d and there is no time to waste.\n\n\u201cDear friends, time is running out!\u201d the pope told a group of participants in a Vatican-sponsored conference on energy transition.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford the luxury of waiting for others to come forward or of prioritizing short-term economic benefits. The climate crisis requires decisive action from us, here and now,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The archbishop of Mexico City said that climate change skeptics are the \u201cblack sheep\u201d of the Church since we are near a point of no return.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
