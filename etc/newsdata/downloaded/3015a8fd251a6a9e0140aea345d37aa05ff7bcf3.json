The problem here is less the overall tab than where it\u2019s going and how it got there. Not only does the president often visit his own properties and charge the government\u2014that is, you and me\u2014but here he has directed the vice president to do the same. (Pence will reportedly pay for his mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s share of the bill out of pocket, which means that not only will he be directing government funds into one of the president\u2019s properties, but he\u2019ll be handing over some of his own cash too.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a request, like a command,\u201d Marc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters. \u201cI think that it was a suggestion. It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you should stay at my place.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet what could the vice president do? He was in no position to refuse Trump\u2019s suggestion, which Short valiantly tried to spin as a generous offer. But, of course, Trump was not inviting Pence to stay at his home as a guest. The president could have comped the stay as a gesture of magnanimity, or he could have discouraged it to avoid the conflict of interest, but instead, he invited Pence to spend thousands of dollars to benefit Trump. It\u2019s a double victory for the president, because he reaps not only the cash from the stay, but also the free publicity for the resort. As the president has demonstrated in the past, he is extremely attuned to the nebulous art of enhancing brand value.\n\nPence has strong family ties to Doonbeg, where his great-grandmother lived. He said few facilities in the area could accommodate the logistical needs of his entourage\u2014but other presidents and vice presidents have visited Ireland and found places to stay. Willing or not, Pence is already an accomplice in lining Trump\u2019s pockets. As the Daily Beast reports, Pence\u2019s PAC has spent more than $200,000 at Trump properties since 2017.\n\nConversations about the ways Trump has used the presidency to benefit himself often bog down in obscure discussions about the Emoluments Clause, standing, and other legal arcana. The Doonbeg example is comparatively simple, though: Trump is using government travel to line his own pockets. Trump\u2019s actions in driving business to his properties may or may not be legal, but they are undeniably scandalous. Matt Yglesias points out that for other politicians, this sort of move is a career death sentence: \u201cWhen it turned out that Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh was making companies that contracted with the city buy copies of her book, she was drummed out of office almost immediately.\u201d For Trump, it\u2019s business\u2014literally\u2014as usual.\n\nTrump says it is \u201cprobably costing me from 3 to 5 billion\u201d dollars to be president. That number is hyperinflated, just as Trump\u2019s previous estimates of brand value were, but it may be true that Trump is actually losing money as a result of being president. (Because Trump\u2019s company is privately held, and because he has not released tax returns, unlike previous presidents, it\u2019s hard to get a full accounting.) Mar-a-Lago, Bedminster, and the Trump International Hotel have become popular destinations, both because they are closely associated with the president and because customers clearly view spending money there as a way to curry favor with him. Attorney General Bill Barr will spend about $30,000 on a holiday party at Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, The Washington Post reported last week.", "description": "The president suggested that Vice President Mike Pence and his retinue spend tens of thousands of dollars at his golf resort in Ireland.", "authors": ["David A.
