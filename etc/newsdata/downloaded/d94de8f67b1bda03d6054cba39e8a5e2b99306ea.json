Putting too much stock in a small sample size might cause you to make a decision that hurts you in the long run. That said, it doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be taking stock of what\u2019s happened in the immediate past. It can be useful when it comes to weekly or especially daily lineup decisions, waiver wire considerations, tracking who might be coming into more playing time, etc.\n\nThe Rotoworld Player Rater is a handy tool that\u2019s among the extensive offerings in Season Pass .

That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is he\u2019s sharing the A\u2019s catcher job with Josh Phegley, as Murphy has made starts in back-to-back days just once so far. The rookie has been in the lineup for four of the previous six contests, however, so perhaps he\u2019ll continue to earn more and more starts. Murphy is a worthy second catcher even with less than ideal playing time \u2026 Speaking of timeshares, Robinson Chirinos and Martin Maldonado have split playing time almost right down the middle since the Astros acquired Maldonado, with Chirinos receiving 23 starts to Maldonado\u2019s 19 starts. Maldonado has actually been more productive at the dish during that stretch, although Chirinos edged him out on this list \u2026 Austin Romine is in line for regular playing time for a while with Gary Sanchez (groin) going down. The 30-year-old has posted a .984 OPS with five home runs so far in the second half and is worth owning in deep leagues as part of that lethal Yankees lineup \u2026\n\nFirst Base\n\nMatt Olson\u2019s week included a two-homer game and also a stretch of three straight games with a long ball. The red-hot first baseman is sporting a 1.242 OPS with eight dingers, 17 RBI and 17 runs scored across his last 16 contests. Olson has again remained elite in the hard-hit department this season. Only Miguel Sano, Aaron Judge and Joey Gallo top Olson\u2019s 52.1 percent hard-hit rate \u2026 It was fair to question how much Luke Voit was going to offer fantasy owners in the final weeks after he went down with a sports hernia. He avoided surgery, though, and after a sluggish few games he caught fire last week, posting a 1.168 OPS with two homers, seven RBI and eight runs scored. Voit has moved all over the lineup since returning from the injured list, hitting as high as third and as low as eighth. Where he ultimately settles in when/if the Yankees are at full strength is worth keeping an eye on \u2026 Albert Pujols has a shot at another 100-RBI season following his four-RBI game on Sunday which included his 23rd long ball of the year. With Mike Trout (foot) and Shohei Ohtani (knee) done for the season, Pujols is back to hitting third or fourth after being used in the fifth or sixth spot for a while. Of course, he\u2019s also no longer going to have Trout and/or Ohtani on base ahead of him \u2026\n\nSecond Base\n\nPerhaps talk of him being benched lit a fire under Rougned Odor. Following a stretch when he hit just one home run over 29 games, Odor has since gone deep six times across his previous 11 contests. He also reached double digits in stolen bases for the season with a two-steal game last week. The ride is always going to be bumpy with Odor, but he\u2019s still nearly been a top-10 second baseman this season even with his average hovering around the Mendoza line \u2026 Gavin Lux\u2019s first week in the big leagues was fairly nondescript, but his bat started to heat up last week. The rookie went 8-for-20 at the plate in six games, belting his first two major league home runs while also adding his first stolen base. Lux has settled into the No. 7 spot in the Dodgers\u2019 batting order and he has started 11 of 12 games since his promotion (although the Dodgers have only faced two lefties during that span) \u2026 Garrett Hampson has started each of the last four games (at three different positions) for the Rockies and taken advantage of the playing time in going 8-for-18 with a home run and a stolen base. Hampson has been a flop this season after receiving plenty of buzz this spring, but he remains an intriguing fantasy option if the at-bats are there, especially in weeks where the Rockies are at Coors Field \u2026\n\nThird Base\n\nKris Bryant entered last week with his arrow pointing down after he missed a couple games and received a cortisone shot in his ailing right knee. The shot evidently worked, though, as he belted five home runs and had three four-RBI games during a six-game stretch. The knee could certainly flare up on him again at any time, but for now Bryant looks like his old self \u2026 Although just one of his hits left the yard, Yoan Moncada has gone a sizzling 23-for-48 (.479) across his previous 11 contests, adding a couple stolen bases along the way. While Moncada is still striking out a lot, his 27.3 percent whiff rate this season is a massive improvement from last year\u2019s 33.4 percent mark. The third baseman is also sporting a 92.7 mph exit velocity, which ranks in the top three percent of baseball \u2026 Mike Moustakas was looking like an iffy fantasy play last week due to a lingering hand ailment, but he showed he was healthy with three dingers and eight RBI over five games. With Christian Yelich (kneecap) going down, Moose has moved up to the No. 3 spot in the Brewers\u2019 batting order \u2026\n\nShortstop\n\nMarcus Semien has slugged four home runs over his last six tilts, pushing his season total to an even 30. Semien had a good first three months of the season, but he\u2019s been a monster since the beginning of July, posting a .294/.379/.618 batting line with 19 dingers, 43 RBI, 58 runs scored and five stolen bases across 64 contests. Only Trevor Story, Francisco Lindor and Xander Bogaerts have eclipsed Semien for fantasy value at shortstop this season \u2026 The Cubs rushed Nico Hoerner to the big leagues after Javier Baez (thumb) and Addison Russell (concussion) went down, but he\u2019s looked up to the task and then some. Hoerner is 11-for-29 (.379) at the dish in his first seven games and he went deep in two straight contests over the weekend as part of the team\u2019s demolition of the Pirates. Russell could still make it back at some point before the end of the month, but the shortstop job is probably Hoerner\u2019s to lose for the rest of the regular season \u2026 Luis Urias has mostly looked overmatched in the majors to this point, but he\u2019s finally shown signs of life lately with a robust .400/.447/.571 line, one home run and six RBI across his last nine games. Granted, a series at Coors Field helped, and Urias hasn\u2019t shown enough extra-base pop to be trustworthy in fantasy leagues \u2026\n\nOutfield\n\nEloy Jimenez looks like he might close out an up-and-down rookie campaign on a high note, as he went 10-for-23 (.435) with three bombs, 11 RBI and six runs scored last week. With seven contests against the Tigers still on the docket, Jimenez has a good chance to reach 30 home runs in his age-22 season in fewer than 130 games \u2026 Jason Heyward went through a disastrous 12-game stretch during which he went just 3-for-42 (.071) at the plate. That slump got him dropped from the leadoff spot down to the lower third of the Cubs\u2019 batting order, but he\u2019s since bounced back with an 11-for-25 (.440) run with three long balls, 10 RBI and 11 runs scored over eight games. The 30-year-old has reached the 20-homer plateau for just the second time in his career \u2026 Former first-round pick Kyle Lewis homered in each of his first three major league games and then popped his fourth home run on Sunday in his sixth tilt. It\u2019s been cool to see, and Lewis has found himself batting cleanup each of the last two days. Still, given his numbers in the minors, it\u2019s hard to view this as anything other than a short-lived hot stretch \u2026 Harrison Bader has become an everyday player again since returning from a brief stint in the minor leagues. On the whole he has looked improved since his return last month, putting up a .853 OPS with four homers, 16 RBI, 18 runs and four stolen bases across 25 games. He\u2019s also cut his strikeout rate from 28.1 percent to 24.5 percent and upped his walk rate from 11.2 percent to 13.8 percent over that span. Bader notched his first career two-homer game on Sunday \u2026", "description": "Ryan Boyer highlights and analyzes the hottest hitters using Rotoworld's Season Pass Player Rater.
