Proprietary trading is the notion of a bank using customer deposits for risky trading activity.\n\nIn a press release, the Federal Reserve said the following about the updates, which take effect in 2020.\n\n\u201cUnder the revised rule, firms that do not have significant trading activities will have simplified and streamlined compliance requirements, while firms with significant trading activity will have more stringent compliance requirement.\u201d\n\nWatch the complete interview here:\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
