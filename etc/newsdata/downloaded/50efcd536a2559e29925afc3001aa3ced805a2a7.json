Supplied\n\nWhen Woolworths outlaid $2.1 billion for David Jones in 2014, food was not a key part of its turnaround plan, even though the South African retailer generates about 60 per cent of its sales from food and is regarded as one of the best food retailers in the world.\n\nHowever, Mr Moir spotted a gap in the $70 billion retail food and $27 billion food service markets. Australian consumers had lost faith in big food \u2013 Woolworths and Coles \u2013 and David Jones, once renowned for its gourmet groceries, had \"fallen off the map\".\n\nSmall sites elusive\n\nIn 2017, Mr Moir unveiled plans to spend at least $100 million over three years building a world-class retail food business aimed at differentiating David Jones from rivals, protecting it from pure-play online retailers and creating a 'halo effect' by using food to encourage shoppers to linger longer in stores.\n\nUnder a three-pronged strategy overseen by Mr de Wet, David Jones planned to open half a dozen 1700-square-metre to 2500-square-metre food halls in flagship CBD stores, 500-square-metre to 800-square-metre food halls in suburban and regional stores, and 300-square-metre to 500-square-metre stand-alone stores in high-density locations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first flagship food hall opened in Bondi Junction in Sydney in 2017, the second in David Jones' Wollongong store later that year (it's since been downsized slightly) and the third in Malvern in Melbourne in 2018. The Sydney CBD food hall will reopen in March in the refurbished Elizabeth Street store.\n\nIn August, David Jones launched a partnership with energy giant BP to sell a range of about 350 premium packaged and convenience foods at selected BP fuel outlets. The first of ten opens in Brighton in Melbourne in November.\n\nMr de Wet said David Jones would see how the BP stores performed before deciding how many stand-alone stores to open.\n\nDavid Jones' first foray into gourmet food between 2000 and 2003 cost the department store chain $120 million. Rob Homer\n\nGourmet groceries have had a chequered history in Australia.\n\nDavid Jones opened a chain of gourmet food stores dubbed Foodchain in 2000 but was forced to pull the plug three years later after racking up losses of more than $120 million.\n\nColes closed its loss-making Let's Eat upmarket food and wine venture in 2001 and Woolworths abandoned its nine-year-old Thomas Dux gourmet grocery brand in 2017.\n\nAustralia's original gourmet food store, Jones the Grocer, collapsed twice in 18 months and the only remaining store in Australia is in Albury. The brand is now owned by L Catterton, which has opened stores in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Jones hopes to create a more sustainable business model by leveraging Woolworths' expertise and suppliers including In2Food, which supplies produce and prepared meals.\n\n\"If you try to create a business that competes with supermarkets you're not going to be successful ... your offer needs to be differentiated and you can only do that if you have the right intellectual property to create products that are different and better,\" Mr de Wet said.\n\nHe ruled out selling David Jones-prepared meals or branded foods in Woolworths or Coles.\n\n\"That's not something we'll ever consider \u2013 we're trying to create a halo effect to our mother brand, we are certainly not putting all this effort into developing amazing quality products to sell them through channels we don't have control over.\"", "description": "It's taken five years, but David Jones has opened its first stand-alone food store in one of Melbourne's best-known retail strips.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ab1ec1e859c02af4ad6c0904207a1914687a1a45", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
