REUTERS/Kim Kyung-hoon\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.13 % while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was flat.\n\nWall Street shares ticked up a tad on Tuesday with the S&P 500 gaining 0.26%.\n\nBrent crude futures dipped 0.1% to $64.50 a barrel, having conceded more than 60% of their gains made after the weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.5% to $59.06 per barrel, compared to four-month peak of $68.38 marked on Monday.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin on Tuesday Salman sought to reassure markets, saying the kingdom would restore its lost oil production by month-end having recovered supplies to customers to the levels they were prior to weekend attacks.\n\n\u201cI would think a spike in oil prices will likely prove to be short-term given that the global economy isn\u2019t doing too well,\u201d said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One.\n\nStill, heightened geopolitical tensions underpinned oil as well as some safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday the United States believes the attacks originated in southwestern Iran, an assessment that could further increase the rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh.\n\nAdding to uncertainties in the Middle East were exit polls from Israel\u2019s election, which showed the race too close to call suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s fight for political survival could drag on.\n\nGold was mostly flat at $1,502.10, while the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 1.810%, compared with Friday\u2019s high of 1 1/2-month high of 1.908% ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy announcement on Wednesday.\n\nWhile a 25-basis point rate cut is seen as near-certain, investors look to the statement and economic projections from Fed policy makers, given signs of deep disagreements among them.\n\n\u201cMarkets are currently almost pricing in three more rate hikes by the end of next year, including one by the end of this year, but the chances are that the Fed\u2019s stance will be more hawkish than markets and we could see rise in bond yields in the near term,\u201d said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein.\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war has raised policymakers\u2019 concerns about slowing factory output although resilient domestic consumption has given hawks some reasons to worry about cutting rates too hastily.\n\nPossibly further complicating their discussion, short-term U.S. interest rates shot up this week, with overnight repo rates rising to 7%, due largely to seasonal factors such as huge payments for taxes and bond supply.\n\nThat prompted the New York Fed to conduct its first repo operation in more than a decade to inject funds to stressed money markets.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve said late Tuesday it will conduct a repurchase agreement operation early Wednesday \u201cin order to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range of\u201d 2.00% to 2.25%.\n\nJeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday that the repo market squeeze makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will resume expansion of its balance sheet \u201cpretty soon.\u201d\n\nAlso in focus is the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy meeting due Thursday. While the latest Reuters poll suggests the BOJ will keep its policy on hold, 28 of 41 economists expect it will ease its policy this year and 13 believe it may surprise by taking action at the Thursday meeting.\n\nIn the currency market, the euro stood flat at $1.1066 after 0.6% gain the previous day on better-than-expected readings in Germany\u2019s ZEW survey on investor confidence.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2489, down 0.05% so far on the day, having hit two-month high of $1.2528 as investors reversed their bets against the currency on fear of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month.\n\nThe yen eased slightly to 108.26 yen, near 1 1/2-month low of 108.37 touched on Tuesday.", "description": "Oil prices cooled on Wednesday as Saudi Arabia said full oil production would be restored by month's end while caution ahead of an expected U.S. interest rate cut kept wider financial markets in tight ranges.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431043209&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H04B-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
