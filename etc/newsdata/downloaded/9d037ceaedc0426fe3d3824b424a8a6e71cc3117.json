Warren of Massachusetts, whose annual wealth tax would fund spending proposals such as universal child care and student-loan forgiveness. \u2026rich would pay whether they make money or not, whether they sell assets or not and whether their assets are growing or shrinking.\n\nThe report includes this comparison of current law with various soak-the-rich proposals (click here for my thoughts on the Wyden plan).\n\nThe article does acknowledge that there are some critiques of this class-warfare tax proposal.\n\nEuropean countries tried\u2014and largely abandoned\u2014wealth taxes. \u2026For an investment yielding a steady 1.5% return, a 2% wealth levy would be equivalent to an income-tax rate above 100% and cause the asset to shrink. \u2026The wealth tax also has an extra asterisk: it would be challenged as unconstitutional.\n\nThe two economists advising Elizabeth Warren, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, have a new study extolling the ostensible benefits of a wealth tax.\n\nI want to focus on their economic arguments, but I can\u2019t resist starting with an observation that I was right when I warned that the attack on financial privacy and the assault on so-called tax havens was a precursor to big tax increases.\n\nIndeed, Saez and Zucman explicitly argue this is a big reason to push their punitive new wealth tax.\n\nEuropean countries were exposed to tax competition and tax evasion through offshore accounts, in a context where until recently there was no cross-border information sharing. \u2026offshore tax evasion can be fought more effectively today than in the past, thanks to recent breakthrough in cross-border information exchange, and wealth taxes could be applied to expatriates (for at least some years), mitigating concerns about tax competition. \u2026Cracking down on offshore tax evasion, as the US has started doing with FATCA, is crucial.\n\nNow that I\u2019m done patting myself on the back for my foresight (not that it took any special insight to realize that politicians were attacking tax competition in order to grab more money), let\u2019s look at what they wrote about the potential economic impact.\n\nA potential concern with wealth taxation is that by reducing large wealth holdings, it may reduce the capital stock in the economy\u2013thus lowering the productivity of U.S. workers and their wages. However, these effects are likely to be dampened in the case of a progressive wealth tax for two reasons. First, the United States is an open economy and a significant fraction of U.S. saving is invested abroad while a large fraction of U.S. domestic investment is financed by foreign saving. Therefore, a reduction in U.S. savings does not necessarily translate into a large reduction in the capital stock used in the United States. \u2026Second, a progressive wealth tax applies to only the wealthiest families. For example, we estimated that a wealth tax above $50 million would apply only to about 10% of the household wealth stock. Therefore increased savings from the rest of the population or the government sector could possibly offset any reduction in the capital stock. \u2026A wealth tax would reduce the financial payoff to extreme cases of business success, but would it reduce the socially valuable innovation that can be associated with such success? And would any such reduction exceed the social gains of discouraging extractive wealth accumulation? In our assessment the effect on innovation and productivity is likely to be modest, and if anything slightly positive.\n\nI\u2019m not overly impressed by these two arguments.\n\nYes, foreign savings could offset some of the damage caused by the new wealth tax. But it\u2019s highly likely that other nations would copy Washington\u2019s revenue grab. Especially now that it\u2019s easier for governments to track money around the world. Yes, it\u2019s theoretically possible that other people may save more to offset the damage caused by the new wealth tax. But why would that happen when Warren and other proponents want to give people more goodies, thus reducing the necessity for saving and personal responsibility?\n\nBy the way, they openly admit that there are Laffer Curve effects because their proposed levy will reduce taxable activity.\n\nWith successful enforcement, a wealth tax has to deliver either revenue or de-concentrate wealth. Set the rates low (1%) and you get revenue in perpetuity but little (or very slow) de-concentration. Set the rates medium (2-3%) and you get revenue for quite a while and de-concentration eventually. Set the rates high (significantly above 3%) and you get de-concentration fast but revenue does not last long.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at experts from the other side.\n\nIn a column for Bloomberg, Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute takes aim at Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bad math.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan would augment the existing income tax by adding a tax on wealth. \u2026The tax would apply to fortunes above $50 million, hitting them with a 2% annual rate; there would be a surcharge of 1% per year on wealth in excess of $1 billion. \u2026Not only would such a tax be very hard to administer, as many have pointed out. It likely won\u2019t collect nearly as much revenue as Warren claims. \u2026Under Warren\u2019s proposal, the fair market value of all assets for the wealthiest 0.06% of households would have to be assessed every year. It would be difficult to determine the market value of partially held private businesses, works of art and the like\u2026 This helps to explain why the number of countries in the high-income OECD that administer a wealth tax fell from 14 in 1996 to only four in 2017. \u2026It is highly unlikely that the tax would yield the $2.75 trillion estimated by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the University of California, Berkeley, professors who are Warren\u2019s economic advisers. Lawrence Summers, the economist and top adviser to the last two Democratic presidents, and University of Pennsylvania professor Natasha Sarin\u2026convincingly argued Warren\u2019s plan would bring in a fraction of what Saez and Zucman expect once real-world factors like tax avoidance\u2026are factored in. \u2026economists Matthew Smith, Owen Zidar and Eric Zwick present preliminary estimates suggesting that the Warren proposal would raise half as much as projected.\n\nBut a much bigger problem is her bad economics.\n\n\u2026a household worth $50 million would lose 2% of its wealth every year to the tax, or 20% over the first decade. For an asset yielding a steady 1.5% return, a 2% wealth tax is equivalent to an income tax of 133%. \u2026And remember that the wealth tax would operate along with the existing income tax system. The combined (equivalent income) tax rate would often be well over 100%. Underlying assets would routinely shrink. \u2026The tax would likely reduce national savings, resulting in less business investment in the U.S\u2026 Less investment spending would reduce productivity and wages to some extent over the longer term.\n\nStrain\u2019s point is key. A wealth tax is equivalent to a very high marginal tax rate on saving and investment.\n\nOf course that\u2019s going to have a negative effect.\n\nChris Edwards, in a report on wealth taxes, shared some of the scholarly research on the economic effects of the levy.\n\nBecause wealth taxes suppress savings and investment, they undermine economic growth. A 2010 study by Asa Hansson examined the relationship between wealth taxes and economic growth across 20 OECD countries from 1980 to 1999. She found \u201cfairly robust support for the popular contention that wealth taxes dampen economic growth,\u201d although the magnitude of the measured effect was modest. The Tax Foundation simulated an annual net wealth tax of 1 percent above $1.3 million and 2 percent above $6.5 million. They estimated that such a tax would reduce the U.S. capital stock in the long run by 13 percent, which in turn would reduce GDP by 4.9 percent and reduce wages by 4.2 percent. The government would raise about $20 billion a year from such a wealth tax, but in the long run GDP would be reduced by hundreds of billions of dollars a year.Germany\u2019s Ifo Institute recently simulated a wealth tax for that nation. The study assumed a tax rate of 0.8 percent on individual net wealth above 1 million euros. Such a wealth tax would reduce employment by 2 percent and GDP by 5 percent in the long run. The government would raise about 15 billion euros a year from the tax, but because growth was undermined the government would lose 46 billion euros in other revenues, resulting in a net revenue loss of 31 billion euros. The study concluded, \u201cthe burden of the wealth tax is practically borne by every citizen, even if the wealth tax is designed to target only the wealthiest individuals in society.\u201d\n\nThe last part of the excerpt is key.\n\nYes, the tax is a hassle for rich people, but it\u2019s the rest of us who suffer most because we\u2019re much dependent on a vibrant economy to improve our living standards.\n\nMy contribution to this discussion it to put this argument in visual form. Here\u2019s a simple depiction of how income is generated in our economy.\n\nNow here\u2019s the same process, but with a wealth tax.\n\nFor the sake of argument, as you can see from the letters that have been fully or partially erased, I assumed the wealth tax would depress the capital stock by 10 percent and that this would reduce national income by 5 percent.\n\nI\u2019m not wedded to these specific numbers. Both might be higher (especially in the long run), both might be lower (at least in the short run), or one of them might be higher or lower.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to understand is that rich people won\u2019t be the only ones hurt by this tax. Indeed, this is a very accurate criticism of almost all class-warfare taxes.\n\nThe bottom line is that you can\u2019t punish capital without simultaneously punishing labor.\n\nBut some of our friends on the left \u2013 as Margaret Thatcher noted many years ago \u2013 seem to think such taxes are okay if rich people are hurt by a greater amount than poor people.\n\nP.S.
