And Brexit cannot be allowed to happen because Brexit would not be normal. \u201cThe 2017 election,\u201d Blair writes, \u201cshould warn us against confusing a normal election with the not-normal but enormous issue of Brexit.\u201d You might counter that, in the thousand-year history of Britain, it\u2019s fairly not-normal for the country to surrender its sovereignty over everything from criminal justice to immigration policy to regulatory minutiae. You might also argue that it\u2019s fairly not-normal for a great country to simply ignore what its own voters clearly ordered because the elites don\u2019t like it.\n\nAh, but there you\u2019d be wrong! Christopher Caldwell pores over the anti-democratic European playbook in a superb essay in the Claremont Review of Books. In EU-land, it\u2019s perfectly normal for referenda to be ignored. In 1992, voters in Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty, then they voted the proper way in 1993. Irish voters rejected the EU Treaty of Nice in 2001, then in 2002 were ushered back to the polls, when they voted in accordance with EU wishes. After Ireland rejected the Treaty of Lisbon in 2008, the voters returned to the polls to deliver the EU-desired result in 2009. \u201cThese do-overs had become a Europe-wide symbol of contempt for voters,\u201d Caldwell writes. \u201cAnd that is why Parliament voted overwhelmingly in March 2017 to validate the referendum, activate the E.U.\u2019s Article 50, and fix the date for British withdrawal.\u201d That date was March 29, 2019, which turned out not to be all that fixed after all. The currently mooted terms would delay Brexit at least another 90 days past October 31, pushing the saga into 2020.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Nationalreview.Com Brexit-New-Referendum-Proposal"], "top_image": ""}
