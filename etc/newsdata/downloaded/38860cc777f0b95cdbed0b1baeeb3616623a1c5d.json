(Stephen Lam/Reuters)\n\nFacebook on Tuesday shut down a request from Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign to pull a Trump campaign advertisement alleging that the former vice president improperly used his office to boost his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe mammoth social media platform said the move was \u201cgrounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d according to a letter from Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, to the Biden campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s 30-second video, which has been viewed over 5 million times, ad claimed that Biden offered Ukraine $1 billion in aid, provided the country oust the prosecutor in charge of an investigation into the natural gas company that was paying the former vice president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe Biden campaign excoriated Facebook\u2019s decision, calling it \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,\u201d said campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo in a statement. \u201cIt is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform.\u201d\n\nCNN meanwhile refused to air the ad, saying it peddled \u201cassertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\u201d\n\nFacebook has come under fire for allowing misinformation related to politics and elections on its platform, largely from bad actors misrepresenting their identity. While the company said in August that it will tighten its rules on political advertising ahead of the 2020 elections, Facebook added last month that it does not fact-check posts by politicians and allows such content to remain on the platform even if it breaks the company\u2019s content rules.", "description": "Facebook on Tuesday shut down a request from Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign to pull a Trump campaign advertisement.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
