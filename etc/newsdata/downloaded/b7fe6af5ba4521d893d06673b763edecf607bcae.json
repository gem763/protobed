Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, this week introduced legislation that would compel the Fed to report annually to House and Senate banking committees on detailed points regarding its cybersecurity strategy.\n\nThe legislation would ensure that Congress is \u201cread in\u201d on the Fed\u2019s countermeasures and cybersecurity readiness, Mr. McHenry said in an interview. He referred to a 2018 report from the Fed\u2019s Office of the Inspector General that reviewed the central bank\u2019s information security program. The report found that while the Fed had certain protections in place, such as multifactor authentication and staff training, it lacked full oversight over its technology and security processes.\n\n\u201cThe report informs me that we need to have a better grasp of what the Fed is doing. The Fed is the largest bank in the world, it is globally systemically important, and we should have proper congressional oversight of their cybersecurity preparations,\u201d Mr. McHenry said.\n\nThe legislation calls for requiring the Fed to report details about malware and denial-of-service attacks, as well as other attempts to breach its computer networks. The central bank would also be required to show that its cybersecurity employees are qualified and report on its use of cybersecurity technologies. The reports should be issued as public documents but may include a classified annex \u201cif appropriate,\u201d the bill states. Such information isn\u2019t generally made public, although the Fed chief is required to testify before Congress twice a year about monetary policy and other matters.\n\nThe bill comes at a time when cybersecurity is regarded as a critical risk to the safety of the financial system. Mr. McHenry said that chief executives from top banks he met over the summer said that cybersecurity rates \u201cvery highly\u201d as a risk factor.\n\nHe added that while this bill focused on the Fed, there was a wider need to examine cybersecurity preparations across federal agencies. In the future, Congress could also look into cybersecurity at other financial regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment. In testimony before the House committee in July, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that he regarded cyber risk as a principal threat to the financial system, describing it as \u201cthe big one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent 10 years building up capital, helping the banks be much more conscious of their risks, building up liquidity, stress-testing, all those things. And we have a really good playbook there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that is really hard is the idea of a successful cyber attack.\u201d\n\nOther financial regulators have also been sharpening their focus on cybersecurity. The SEC said in testimony before Congress this week that it had increased its IT security staff by 75% from 2017 levels. In February, the regulator said it was hiring its first chief risk officer, Gabriel Benincasa.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, meanwhile, plans to discuss cybersecurity at a meeting of its technology committee Oct. 3.\n\nWrite to James Rundle at james.rundle@wsj.com", "description": "The top Republican lawmaker on an influential House committee wants the Federal Reserve to be more open about its cybersecurity preparations.", "authors": ["James Rundle"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111031/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
