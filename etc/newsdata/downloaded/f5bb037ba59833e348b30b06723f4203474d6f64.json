It\u2019s part of an IAAF research project on the effects of heat and body-core temperatures. They couldn\u2019t have picked a better time or place - in Doha, where the temperatures reach 100 degrees (38 Celsius) every day, and less than a year removed from the Olympics in Tokyo, where conditions are expected to be every bit as stifling.\n\nMost of the volunteers for this study come from endurance events such as the marathon, 10,000 meters and race walks. The marathon and race walks are being held outside the air-conditioned stadium. Temperatures have been around 90 (32 C) with humidity above 70 percent each night. About 25 to 40 percent of the athletes dropped out of the women\u2019s marathon and 50k race walks. There are around 20 runners taking part in the study for the men\u2019s marathon Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning a lot from these elite athletes with this technology,\u201d said Paolo Emilio Adami, the health and science department medical manager for the track federation.\n\nThis is how it works: About two hours before they start, runners in the study are asked to swallow a capsule - the size of a typical antibiotic - that contains a transmitter and battery. The capsule works its way into the intestines by race time (that\u2019s the goal, anyway) and the medical staff takes it from there, with equipment set up to sync with the transmitter after an athlete finishes. The transmitters record body-core temperatures.\n\nIn addition, there are thermal cameras set along the course that calculate heat emission through high-definition pictures (it\u2019s not recorded through the transmitter). And the participating athletes are weighed before and after the race to assist in gauging hydration levels.\n\nAmerican marathoner Roberta Groner of Montclair, New Jersey, raised her hand to take part in the project. No surprise, given her background is in nursing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything for research,\u201d Groner said.\n\nShortly after finishing the midnight women\u2019s marathon on Day 1 of worlds, and still drenched from the race, Groner was escorted over to a station, where the medical staff hung a transmitter around her neck to download the information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good data for the sport and for myself to find out how I did throughout the competition,\u201d Groner said.\n\nShe\u2019s eager to see what the results yield after her sixth-place finish. It could offer some useful training tips going forward and with the Olympics on the horizon.\n\nFor the project, IAAF partnered with Aspetar, an orthopedic and sports medicine clinic in Doha. It\u2019s similar to the heat research cycling conducted during its 2016 world championships in Doha.\n\nAdami stresses the data is only being conducted for research purposes and can\u2019t be used to impact an athlete during the competition since it\u2019s not real-time.\n\nThe IAAF medical team focuses on body core temperature. If that number runs too high, it could be an indication of such things as heat stroke.\n\n\u201cOur body is the most perfect machine that exists,\u201d Adami said. \u201cWe are learning with this technology device and interpreting the messages that we normally feel and that we would not be paying enough attention to.\u201d\n\nAll athletes competing at worlds have been urged to fill out a survey, where the researchers asked questions involving hydration and acclimation plans to brace for the Doha heat.\n\nDistance runners can use all the information they can get with Tokyo less than a year away. They\u2019ll be running in extreme heat, as well as sunshine. Unlike these marathons, which are starting at midnight, next year\u2019s marathons will go off at 6 a.m.\n\n\u201cThat will be a massive difference,\u201d Adami said.\n\nSome of the teams that reached out to participate in the project include Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, Australia and Kenya. There have been individual athletes from France, Britain and the U.S. who wanted in on the research, too.\n\n\u201cBased on this data, ideally, they should be able to tailor the needs to each athlete,\u201d Adami said.\n\nAs for how the device is dispelled - well, nature simply runs its course.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The stopwatch is only one way to measure the gains athletes are making at the world championships this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/qatar_athletics_worlds_technology_pill_45016_c0-282-4467-2886_s1770x1032.jpg?6853e521932d5511c4f376e4b07ac851dd89776b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
