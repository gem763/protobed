REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump\u2019s booze tariffs could have been worse for Europe\u2019s distillers. Makers of Scotch whisky and French wine were among the victims when the famously teetotal U.S. president slapped tariffs on European imports worth $7.5 billion on Wednesday. Investors could find solace in French cognac and champagne, which were spared, at least for now.\n\nDiageo was arguably the worst hit. The $93 billion giant\u2019s products including Lagavulin single malt whisky and Baileys liquor are exposed to the levies. Analysts at Jefferies reckon annual revenue worth $440 million will be affected \u2013 almost 5% of total U.S. sales. In the short term the company led by Ivan Menezes can probably afford to swallow the extra cost, rather than raising prices, in the hope of protecting loyal American customers until the trade dispute blows over.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s too soon for a celebratory snifter. If Washington\u2019s broader trade war with China is anything to go by, this could be just the aperitif. The Trump administration has demonstrated its willingness to target industries totally unrelated to the original dispute, which in this case involved European Union subsidies for aircraft maker Airbus. True, these sanctions were authorised by the World Trade Organization. But earlier this year Trump ordered a probe into France\u2019s planned tax on companies such as Alphabet-owned Google and Facebook. A retaliatory attack on champagne or cognac may be hard for him to resist.\n\nIf the menu of sanctioned drinks persists, the likes of Diageo will have little choice but to pass on the cost to American drinkers. Unlike, say, German carmakers, there\u2019s no way for makers of Scotch whisky to shift their supply chains stateside. European booze brands have avoided the worst, but they can\u2019t rule out a delayed hangover.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump\u2019s booze tariffs could have been worse for Europe\u2019s distillers.
