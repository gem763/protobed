(how) our medicine is going to be affected because we won't get all the medicine we need and it will be more expensive,\" said 27-year-old Joanne Baigorri, a credit officer at the Falklands' only bank.\n\nGabi McRae, a Chilean who works in quality control at the Falkland Islands Meat Company, has already noticed the effect of a weakening pound.\n\n\"In the first few years when I did the exchange, one pound was equal to 1,000 Chilean pesos. Now it's just 600-700,\" said the 31-year-old.\n\nRoberts, though, feels that whatever happens, the islanders' \"natural sort of pragmatism and sense of spirit\" will help them find a way to survive.", "description": "It may be a remote archipelago 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometres) from mainland Britain but the Falkland Islands' incredible biodiversity, as well as fishing and meat exports, are under threat from Brexit.
