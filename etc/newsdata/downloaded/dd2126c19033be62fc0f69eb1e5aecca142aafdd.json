He had been a vocal critic of Poland\u2019s nationalist government and an advocate of tolerance in the city, which had long been a stronghold of the liberal opposition.\n\n\u2018We feel orphaned\u2019: Polish city mourns Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my mission and my obligation to do this. I don\u2019t want the death of my husband to be in vain,\u201d she said during a recent interview in Gda\u0144sk, to which she wore a black T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan \u201cImagine there\u2019s no hate\u201d, which has become her trademark look.\n\nIn the week after her husband\u2019s murder, Adamowicz was in shock and did not participate in public events or rallies, she said. Afterwards, though, she was struck with a sense of purpose, and decided to stand in European parliamentary elections in May. She easily won a seat, and said working on new Europe-wide hate speech legislation is the main task for her mandate.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not only in Poland, the problem is worldwide. We need new regulations to define hate speech. In Poland we have some regulations but they are limited and they are clearly not working. Hate is everywhere,\u201d she said.\n\nPolish society is split between supporters of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, and the more liberal opposition. As an advocate for the rights of LGBT people, immigrants and other minorities, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz was often in the crosshairs of the pro-PiS media.\n\nWhile there is no proof of a direct link between increasingly fraught political rhetoric in Polish politics and the attack, and there is reason to believe the perpetrator suffered from mental illness, many people in the aftermath claimed the climate of hate played a part, and the politician\u2019s widow agrees.\n\n\u201cI believe my husband was the victim of hate speech. I don\u2019t want to blame anyone personally. I do not feel any hate to the man who did it \u2026 a person who is under the influence of hate speech and takes it seriously and then commits a crime because of the hate, they are kind of victims too,\u201d she said.\n\nThe killing of Gda\u0144sk\u2019s mayor is the tragic result of hate speech | Piotr Buras Read more\n\nFor some time after the murder, a kind of truce held. \u201cThe murder of Adamowicz is a huge tragedy for all of us. It\u2019s a great evil, which evokes condemnation, sadness and sorrow,\u201d tweeted the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who is a PiS politician.\n\nRados\u0142aw Fogiel, an adviser to the PiS chairman, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, blamed the opposition for beginning the split in Polish society but admitted that the atmosphere was unhealthy. \u201cOur electorate and the other side\u2019s electorate sometimes tend to hate each other more than the politicians do,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, with crunch parliamentary elections due in October that will determine whether PiS keeps its hold on power for another term, government-controlled media outlets are again ratcheting up the rhetoric.\n\nAleksandra Dulkiewicz, the deputy mayor of Gda\u0144sk under Adamowicz who won a March election to replace him, said she receives threatening letters, phone calls and comments on social media accounts on a daily basis. She now has two bodyguards.\n\nThe day before she met the Guardian, during a break from a sitting of the city parliament, she received one message saying \u201cYou will hang\u201d and another with her mocked up in the uniform of a Nazi soldier. Every threat is reported to police, and according to Polish media, as of early August police were investigating eight separate threats against her.\n\n\u201cThis atmosphere is not normal. This is not the way a democratic society should be organised,\u201d she said. She is backing Adamowicz\u2019s campaign for new laws.\n\nAdamowicz said part of her plan was to make companies such as Facebook held more responsible for hate speech published on their platforms, not only the users.\n\n\u201cIf you are a journalist and you write some fake information in your newspaper, you and your editor are both responsible, so I think we have to do the same online,\u201d she said. She has already met Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, in Palo Alto to discuss what the social media giant is doing to combat hate speech, and has meetings planned with Twitter in Brussels later this month.\n\nAdamowicz realises that the proposals are not without controversy, given the difficult and knotty issue of where freedom of speech stops and hate speech begins, and she expects any legislation to take several years to discuss and push through. But she believes that in the end, it will be possible to change the culture.\n\nShe compared it to improvements in violence and discrimination among British football fans over recent years. \u201cAfter changing the law, some changes in stadium infrastructure, implementing bans and increasing education, you can see that there is a very big change,\u201d she said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Monika Pro\u0144czuk", "description": "Magdalena Adamowicz draws sense of purpose from murder of husband Pawe\u0142, a critic of nationalism", "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaaabb85c972ca7262c892c25eb49d20ac857d60/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1796fc0c312f3ec29ca58a41e656426b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
