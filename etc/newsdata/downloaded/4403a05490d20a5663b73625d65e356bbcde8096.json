Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book about his groundbreaking investigative work on Harvey Weinstein, Catch and Kill, includes a shocking new twist on Lauer\u2019s abrupt firing from NBC News and the Today show. Farrow reveals that the Weinstein story forced NBC to deal with an allegation of rape from a Lauer colleague that the network had known about for some time. \u201cThis was no secret,\u201d Farrow writes about the charge made by Brooke Nevils about what took place during the network\u2019s coverage of the Sochi Olympics in 2014:\n\nIn Sochi, Nevils was tasked with working with former \u201cToday\u201d co-anchor Meredith Vieira, who\u2019d been brought back to the show to do Olympics coverage. In her account, one night over drinks with Vieira at the hotel bar where the NBC News team was staying, they ran into Lauer, who joined them. At the end of the night, Nevils, who\u2019d had six shots of vodka, ended up going to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice \u2014 once to retrieve her press credential, which Lauer had taken as a joke, and the second time because he invited her back. Nevils, Farrow writes, \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d Once she was in his hotel room, Nevils alleges, Lauer \u2014 who was wearing a T-shirt and boxers \u2014 pushed her against the door and kissed her. He then pushed her onto the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d According to Nevils, she \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days,\u201d Farrow writes. Nevils tells Farrow: \u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nThe story gets complicated after this, however, as Nevils continued to have sexual encounters with Lauer after Sochi. Farrow notes, in fact, that Nevils initiated those contacts at times. Nevils told Farrow that she did it to protect her career, calling the encounters \u201ctransactional\u201d:\n\nBack in New York City, Nevils had more sexual encounters with Lauer. \u201cSources close to Lauer emphasized that she sometimes initiated contact,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cWhat is not in dispute is that Nevils, like several of the women I\u2019d spoken to, had further sexual encounters with the man she said assaulted her. \u2018This is what I blame myself most for,\u2019\u201d she says to Farrow. \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nThat certainly presents a complicating factor, but it doesn\u2019t diminish the issue of the assault. At the time of his firing, reporters commented that it was an open secret that Lauer not only preyed on his colleagues but intimidated them into silence over it as well. Esquire reported several months later that it was also an open secret among NBC\u2019s executives. When she finally ended their sexual encounters, Nevils knew she might end up losing her career over it. That\u2019s why Nevils made sure it was no secret within NBC\u2019s executive ranks, Farrow writes:\n\nShe was terrified about the control Lauer had over her career. After her encounters with Lauer ended, Nevils said she told \u201clike a million people\u201d about her situation with Lauer. \u201cShe told colleagues and superiors at NBC,\u201d Farrow writes. She moved to NBC\u2019s Peacock Productions to be a producer, \u201cand reported it to one of her new bosses there.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, it wasn\u2019t until Nevils lawyered up \u2014 more than a month after Farrow\u2019s reports on Weinstein \u2014 that NBC fired Lauer. Not long after, they put Nevils on leave and then paid her off, attempting in the process to get her to issue a friendly exit statement:\n\nThe book also reportedly said Nevils went to NBCUniversal human resources with a lawyer at Vieira\u2019s urging in 2017. Lauer was fired the next day. The book also says that Nevils went on medical leave in 2018 before being paid seven figures and that NBC \u201cproposed a script she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue other endeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive example of sexual harassment,\u201d Variety reported.\n\nNBC News deserves some credit for covering that part of Variety\u2019s report on Farrow\u2019s book. That\u2019s almost all of the credit they deserve in this tale, however, as the new revelations force a recalculation of NBC\u2019s actions and the timeline of their dealings with Lauer. This matches up with reporting at the time of Lauer\u2019s termination. Page Six commented that Lauer\u2019s sexual predation went well beyond harassment in at least one incident, and placed it during the Olympics \u2014 although the wrong one:\n\nA source told Page Six, \u201cAn NBC staffer come forward with a claim that Matt sexually assaulted her at the Olympics. There have been rumors about Matt having affairs with subordinates at NBC for years, but those were believed to be consensual. This incident in Rio was not.\u201d Another source tells us that the decision to fire Lauer was made late Tuesday night by NBC News chairman Andy Lack.\n\nPerhaps the confusion stemmed from the Rio Olympics having been more recent (2016, the previous year). The Sochi Olympics had taken place more than two and half years prior to Lauer\u2019s firing. That would belie the analysts at the time who called NBC News President Andrew Lack\u2019s actions \u201cswift.\u201d\n\nThe revelation understandably rattled current Today hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, who called it \u201cshocking and appalling.\u201d It certainly is, and good for them for addressing it quickly and directly. The people who should be addressing it are NBC execs who knew about this and did nothing except cover it up, and then try to shut down Farrow\u2019s reporting on Weinstein over what now looks like an attempt to keep the cover on Lauer\u2019s predation.", "description": "\"This is shocking and appalling.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Matt-Lauer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
