They\u2019re also good for you \u2014 and everyone else.\n\nTiny house dwellers slashed their energy consumption by nearly half after downsizing, according to a new study by environmental design researcher Maria Saxton.\n\nNEW JERSEY HOME WAS LISTED AT JUST $10, BUT IT CAME WITH A BIG CATCH\n\nIn her doctoral thesis, Saxton surveyed 80 people who had moved from a full-sized home to a \u201ctiny\u201d home for a year or more. She then calculated their ecological footprints, or how much space they need to sustain their current behavior, including housing, transportation, food, goods and services.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHer research showed that tiny home residents\u2019 average ecological footprint was about 9.5 acres, down from about 17.3 acres for regular-sized homes.\n\nIn other words, tiny home residents reduced their energy consumption by 45 percent.\n\nBetter still, she found that moving into a tiny house had a major impact on a person\u2019s wasteful behavior generally.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cAs a whole, I found that after downsizing people were more likely to eat less energy-intensive food products and adopt more environmentally-conscious eating habits, such as eating more locally and growing more of their own food,\u201d Saxton writes. \u201cParticipants traveled less by car, motorcycle, bus, train and airplane, and drove more fuel-efficient cars than they did before downsizing.\u201d\n\nThey also recycled more and bought less consumer goods.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nHere\u2019s to the gnome life.\n\nThis article originally appeared on the New York Post.", "description": "Tiny houses are annoyingly cute and wonderfully impractical.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/iStock-978492230.jpg"}
