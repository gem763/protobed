They pulled it out, placed it on deck and returned to processing their catch. The next day, the crew fell ill with serious skin burns. Four were hospitalised. The greasy lump was a substance called yperite, better known as sulphur mustard or mustard gas, solidified by the temperature on the sea bed.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the US, British, French and Soviet authorities faced a big problem \u2013 how to get rid of some 300,000 tonnes of chemical munitions recovered from occupied Germany. Often, they opted for what seemed the safest, cheapest and easiest method: dumping the stuff out at sea.\n\nEstimates are that at least 40,000 tonnes of chemical munitions were disposed of in the Baltic Sea, not all of it in designated dumping areas. Some of these locations are marked on shipping charts but comprehensive records of exactly what was dumped and where do not exist. This increases the likelihood of trawler crews, and others, coming into contact with this dangerous waste.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t going to go away, especially as more pipelines, sea cables and offshore windfarms are installed on the sea floor.\n\nThe story of those unlucky fishermen illustrates two points. First, it is difficult to predict how future generations will behave, what they will value and where they will want to go. Second, creating, maintaining and transmitting records of where waste is dumped will be essential in helping future generations protect themselves from the decisions we make today. Decisions that include how to dispose of some of today\u2019s most hazardous material: high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants.\n\nThe red metal lift to a future disposal site takes seven juddering minutes to travel nearly 500m down. Down, down through creamy limestone to reach a 160-million-year-old layer of clay. Here, deep beneath the sleepy fields and quiet woods along the border of the Meuse and Haute-Marne departments in northeast France, the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra) has built its underground research laboratory.\n\nThe laboratory\u2019s tunnels are brightly lit but mostly deserted, the air dry and dusty and filled with the hum of a ventilation unit. Blue and grey metal boxes house a series of ongoing experiments \u2013 measuring, for example, the corrosion rates of steel, the durability of concrete in contact with the clay. Using this information, Andra wants to build an immense network of tunnels here.\n\nIt plans to call this place Cig\u00e9o, and to fill it with dangerous radioactive waste. It is designed to be able to hold 80,000 cubic metres of waste.\n\nWe are exposed to radiation every day. Public Health England estimates that in a typical year, someone in the UK might receive an average dose of 2.7 millisieverts (mSv) from natural and artificial radiation sources. A transatlantic flight, for example, exposes you to 0.08 mSv; a dental x-ray to 0.005 mSv; 100g of Brazil nuts to 0.01 mSv.\n\nHigh-level radioactive waste is different. It is, primarily, spent fuel from nuclear reactors or the residues resulting from reprocessing that fuel. This waste is so potent that it must be isolated from humans until its levels of radiation, which decrease over time, are no longer hazardous. The timescale Andra is looking at is up to 1 million years. (To put this into some sort of context, it\u2019s just 4,500 years ago that Stonehenge was constructed. Around 40,000 years ago, modern humans arrived in northern Europe. A million years ago, the continent was in the middle of an Ice Age. Mammoths roamed the frozen landscape.)\n\nSome scientists call this long-lived waste \u201cthe Achilles heel of nuclear power\u201d, and it\u2019s a problem for all of us \u2013 whatever our stance on nuclear. Even if all the world\u2019s nuclear plants were to cease operating tomorrow, we would still have more than 240,000 tonnes of dangerously radioactive material to deal with.\n\nCurrently, nuclear waste is stored above ground or near the surface, but within the industry this is not considered an acceptable long-term solution. This kind of storage facility requires active monitoring. As well as regular refurbishment, it must be protected from all kinds of hazards, including earthquakes, fires, floods and deliberate attacks by terrorists or enemy powers.\n\nThis not only places an unfair financial burden on our descendants, who may no longer even use nuclear power, but also assumes that in the future there will always be people with the knowledge and will to monitor the waste. On a million-year timescale, this cannot be guaranteed.\n\nSo, after considering a range of options, governments and the nuclear industry have come to the view that deep, geological repositories are the best long-term approach. Building one of these is an enormous task that comes with a host of complex safety concerns.\n\nFinland has already begun construction of a geological repository (called Onkalo), and Sweden has begun the licensing process for its site. Andra expects to apply for its construction licence within the next two years.\n\nIf Cig\u00e9o goes into operation, it will house both the high-level waste and what is known as intermediate-level long-lived waste \u2013 such as reactor components. Once the repository has reached capacity, in perhaps 150 years\u2019 time, the access tunnels will be backfilled and sealed up. If all goes according to plan, no one will ever enter the repository again.\n\nI have no knowledge of other places or systems where you have at the same time objects from the past and very large, concrete descriptions of how these products were manufactured, where they come from, how we considered them and so on\n\nStand in front of an unshielded source of radiation and you won\u2019t see or feel anything. However, some of that radiation will be passing into your body. Nuclear waste is dangerous because it emits ionising radiation in the form of alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. While alpha particles are too weak to penetrate the skin, beta particles can cause burns. If ingested, both can damage internal tissues and organs.\n\nIt\u2019s gamma rays, however, that have the greatest penetrating range, and therefore the potential to cause the most widespread damage to the DNA of your cells. This damage may lead to an increased risk of cancer later in life, and it is largely responsible for the set of symptoms known as radiation sickness.\n\nSome experts estimate that a dose of over 1 sievert is enough to cause radiation sickness. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, blisters and ulcers; these may begin within minutes of exposure or be delayed for days. Recovery is possible, but the higher the radiation dose, the less likely it is. Typically, death comes from infections and internal bleeding brought about by the destruction of bone marrow.\n\nFor waste buried deep underground, the major threat to public health comes from water contamination. If radioactive material from the waste were to mix with flowing water, it would be able to move relatively swiftly through the bedrock and into the soil and large bodies of water such as lakes and rivers, finally entering the food chain via plants, fish and other animals.\n\nTo prevent this, an underground repository such as Cig\u00e9o will take great care to shield the waste it stores. Within its walls, there will be metal or concrete containers to block the radiation, and liquid waste can be mixed into a molten glass paste that will harden around it to stop leakage.\n\nBeyond those barriers, the planners choose their sites carefully, so they can exploit the properties of the surrounding rock. At Cig\u00e9o, press officer Mathieu Saint-Louis tells me, the clay is stable and has very low permeability, making it hard for any radioactive material to reach the surface. After around 100,000 years, a few very mobile substances with a long half-life, such as iodine-129, might manage to migrate upwards in extremely small quantities, but at that point, Saint-Louis says, the \u201cpotential impact on humans and the environment is much lower than that of radioactivity that is naturally present in the environment\u201d.\n\nDeep geological repositories are designed as passive systems, meaning that once Cig\u00e9o is closed, no further maintenance or monitoring is required. Much more difficult to plan for is the risk of human intrusion, whether inadvertent or deliberate.\n\nIn 1980, the US Department of Energy created the Human Interference Task Force to investigate the problem of human intrusion into waste repositories. What was the best way to prevent people many thousands of years in the future from entering a repository and either coming into direct contact with the waste or damaging the repository, leading to environmental contamination?\n\nOver the next 15 years, a wide variety of experts were involved in this and subsequent projects, including materials scientists, anthropologists, architects, archaeologists, philosophers and semioticians \u2013 social scientists who study signs, symbols and their use or interpretation.\n\nScience fiction author Stanislaw Lem suggested growing plants with warning messages about the repository encoded in their DNA. Biologist Fran\u00e7oise Bastide and semiotician Paolo Fabbri developed what they called the \u201cray cat solution\u201d \u2013 cats genetically altered to glow when in the presence of radiation.\n\nQuite apart from the technological challenges and ethical issues these solutions present, both have one major drawback: to be successful they rely on external, uncontrollable factors. How could the knowledge required to interpret these things be guaranteed to last?\n\nSemiotician Thomas Sebeok recommended the creation of a so-called Atomic Priesthood. Members of the priesthood would preserve information about the waste repositories and hand it on to newly initiated members, ensuring a transfer of knowledge through the generations.\n\nConsidered one way, this is not too different from our current system of atomic science, where a senior scientist passes on their knowledge to a PhD candidate. But still, putting such knowledge, and therefore power, into the hands of one small, elite group of people is a high-risk strategy easily open to abuse.\n\nPerhaps a better way to warn our descendants about the waste is to talk to them directly, in the form of a message.\n\nAt Andra\u2019s headquarters outside of Paris, Jean-Noel Dumont, head of Andra\u2019s memory programme, shows me a box. Inside, fixed in plastic cases, are two transparent discs, each around 20cm in diameter. \u201cThese are the sapphire discs,\u201d he says. The brainchild of Dumont\u2019s predecessor, Patrick Charton, each disc is made of transparent industrial sapphire, inside which information is engraved using platinum.\n\nCosting around \u20ac25,000 (\u00a322,000) per disc, the sapphire (chosen for its durability and resistance to weathering and scratching) could last for nearly 2 million years \u2013 though one disc already has a crack in it, the result of a clumsy visitor on one of Andra\u2019s open days.\n\nIn the very long term, though, these plans also have a major drawback: how can we know that anyone living one million years in the future will understand any of the languages spoken today?\n\nThink of the differences between modern and Old English. Who of us can understand \u201c\u00d0unor cym\u00f0 of h\u00e6tan & of w\u00e6tan\u201d? That \u2013 meaning \u201cThunder comes from heat and from moisture\u201d \u2013 is a mere thousand years old.\n\nLanguages also have a habit of disappearing. Around 4,000 years ago in the Indus Valley in what is now Pakistan and northwest India, for example, people were writing in a script that remains completely indecipherable to modern researchers. In one million years, it is unlikely that any language spoken today will still exist.\n\nWhat is really interesting is the idea of people learning by themselves. Learning is important in the long term when you cannot just rely on transmission from generation to generation\n\nIn the early 1990s, architectural theorist Michael Brill sought a way to side-step the issue of language. He imagined deterrent landscapes, \u201cnon-natural, ominous, and repulsive\u201d, constructed of giant, menacing earthworks in the shape of jagged lightning bolts or other shapes that \u201csuggest danger to the body... wounding forms, like thorns and spikes\u201d.\n\nAnyone venturing further into the complex would then discover a series of standing stones with warning information about the radioactive waste written in seven different languages \u2013 but even if these proved unreadable, the landscape itself should act as a warning. To help convey a sense of danger, there would be carvings of human faces expressing horror and terror. One idea was to base them on Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream.\n\nThe drawback is that such a landscape \u2013 a strange, disturbing wonder \u2013 would probably attract rather than repel visitors. \u201cWe are adventurers. We are drawn to conquer forbidding environments,\u201d says Florian Blanquer, a semiotician hired by Andra. \u201cThink about Antarctica, Mount Everest.\u201d\n\nOr think about the 20th-century European archaeologists, people not noticeably hesitant when it came to opening up the tombs of Egyptian kings, despite the warnings and curses inscribed on their walls.\n\nAs Dumont sees it, a memory programme is necessary for three main reasons. First, to avoid the risk of human intrusion by informing future generations about the existence and contents of Cig\u00e9o.\n\nSecond, to give future generations as much information as possible to allow them to make their own decisions about the waste. They might, for example, want to retrieve the waste because new uses or solutions have arisen. Gerry Thomas, chair in molecular pathology at Imperial College London, believes that much of the waste destined for repositories may one day provide an important new non-carbon fuel source.\n\nThird, cultural heritage: a properly documented geological repository would provide a wealth of information for a future archaeologist. \u201cI have no knowledge of other places or systems where you have at the same time objects from the past and very large, concrete descriptions of how these products were manufactured, where they come from, how we considered them and so on,\u201d says Dumont.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Wellcome Images\n\nOne way that memory is transmitted is orally, from generation to generation. To study this, Dumont asked researchers to consider historical examples of oral transmission, using as a case study the 17th-century Canal du Midi between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. Here, for 300 years, the same families have worked on maintaining the canal, passing down know-how from father to son.\n\nDumont also talks about the need to ensure that as many people as possible hear about Cig\u00e9o. As part of this strategy, Andra has held a series of annual competitions asking artists to suggest ways to mark the site. For example, Les Nouveaux Voisins, winners of the 2016 prize, imagined constructing 80 concrete pillars, 30 metres high, each with an oak tree planted at the top. As the years passed, the pillars would slowly sink and the oak trees replace them, leaving tangible traces both above and below the repository.\n\nLeaving Andra\u2019s visitors\u2019 centre, I drive through a landscape patchworked with colours, from the russet of the woods to the bright limey green of a wheat field, towards Bure, a tiny village of around 90 inhabitants. The population is ageing.\n\n\u201cYoung people can\u2019t stay here if they want to study and find jobs,\u201d Benoit Jaquet tells me. A village that once supported around 10 farmers is now home to only two or three. Although not a resident of Bure, Jaquet is the general secretary of CLIS, the Local Committee of Information and Monitoring of the Bure Laboratory. It\u2019s an organisation of local elected officials, representatives from trade unions and professional bodies, and environmental associations, whose purpose is to provide the local community with information about Cig\u00e9o, host public meetings, and monitor the work of Andra by, for example, commissioning independent experts to review the agency\u2019s work.\n\nIf the repository is built, Jaquet says, French law requires that CLIS be transformed into a local commission that will last as long as the repository. \u201cSo it\u2019s also a way to pass the baton,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is a local commission there is a memory \u2013 not Andra\u2019s memory but an external memory.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Andra has set up three regional memory groups, each composed of around 20 interested locals. They meet every six months and make their own suggestions for passing on the memory of the repository. Ideas so far include collecting and preserving oral witness accounts and developing an annual remembrance ceremony to take place on the site, organised by and for the local people. A nuclear beating the bounds, a radioactive summer solstice, an atomic maypole.\n\nThis last idea resonates with the work of Claudio Pescatore and Claire Mays, former employees of the Nuclear Energy Agency, a Paris-based body that supports intergovernmental cooperation on nuclear issues. They wrote in a research paper: \u201cDo not hide these facilities; do not keep them apart, but make them A PART of the community \u2026 something that belongs to the local, social fabric.\u201d They went on to suggest that a monument celebrating the repository could be created, and argued that if it had \u201ca distinctiveness and aesthetic quality, would this not be one reason for communities to proudly own the site and maintain it?\u201d\n\nCould the repository, I ask Jaquet, one day become a tourist destination? On the contrary, he says, some members of the CLIS say that \u201cevery person living here will quit the district because of the risk, because of the image of the repository as a rubbish bin. Of course some also think the repository will create employment and that this will become a new Silicon Valley. Maybe the reality will be somewhere between the two \u2013 but a tourist attraction? I\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d\n\nAcross the road from CLIS and the town hall is a large, ramshackle stone house decorated with a banner. It translates: \u201cFree zone of Bure: house of resistance against nuclear waste\u201d. Since 2004, this has been home to a rotating group of international anti-nuclear, anti-repository protesters. By continually campaigning against Cig\u00e9o \u2013 and, presumably, by passing their beliefs on to future generations \u2013 the protesters would necessarily keep the memory of the repository alive and in the public eye, the ramshackle stone house becoming its own sort of monument for Cig\u00e9o.\n\n\u201cSo in fact the pro-repository groups need the anti-repository groups to stay alive in order to provide a good memory,\u201d says the semiotician Florian Blanquer. \u201cFortunately, we are in France \u2013 in France there are always opponents to something!\u201d\n\nRely only on the transmission of knowledge between generations and you can never guarantee an unbroken line of succession. Rely only on direct communication and you risk leaving behind a message that, even if it survives physically, eventually no one will be able to understand. So Andra asked Blanquer to research how to convey a message without written language.\n\nMany visual signs are, like languages, culturally specific. Furthermore, we know that the meanings of signs are not always stable over time.\n\nStill, Blanquer thought that there was one universal sign: an image of a human figure. \u201cAnd every human being \u2026 apprehends its body through space the same way as well. There is an up and down, a left and right, a front and back,\u201d he wrote in a conference paper. Pictographs (pictorial symbols for a word or phrase) based on an anthropomorphic figure in movement are likely to be recognised universally, he decided.\n\nNow he had the beginnings of an idea, but it wasn\u2019t enough. You might draw a cartoon strip showing a person approaching a piece of radioactive waste, touching it and falling down. But how can you guarantee that the panels will be read in the correct order? Or that touching the waste will be interpreted as a negative action? And how can a pictograph relying on the visual representation of tangible objects convey a message about radioactivity \u2013 something that can be neither seen nor touched?\n\nYou cannot say to yourself, \u2018I will forget about that.\u2019 It\u2019s like trying not to think about pink elephants. If you want to forget about it then first you have to get rid of any information about it. That would mean shutting down the web and destroying a lot of computers, a lot of newspapers, a lot of books\n\nIn response to these problems, Blanquer has designed what he calls a \u201cpraxeological device\u201d. Independent of any verbal language, it works by teaching the person encountering it a brand-new communication system created specially for this purpose.\n\nBlanquer envisages a series of passages built underground, perhaps in the access tunnels of the repository. On the wall of the first passage is a rectangular pictograph showing a person walking along the passage and a line of footprints indicating the direction of movement.\n\nAt the end of the corridor is a hole and a ladder and three more pictographs. A circular pictograph shows a person holding on to the ladder; a triangular pictograph shows a person not holding on and consequently falling off. And so it continues.\n\nIn this way you begin to establish patterns: you learn first that the figure drawn on the walls relates to a person\u2019s actions here, and second that you should copy the actions in the circles and avoid the actions in the triangles. \u201cWhat is really interesting is the idea of people learning by themselves,\u201d Dumont says. \u201cLearning is important in the long term when you cannot just rely on transmission from generation to generation.\u201d\n\nThere has been one more radical proposal about how to deal with the threat of human intrusion \u2013 hide the repository completely from future generations.\n\nSome argue that because the repositories are passive systems, most likely buried far underground in areas with no deep natural resources, the question of memory preservation is moot.\n\nCurrently, no one can conceive of a reason why anyone in the future might want to dig down 490m to reach the clay formation that Cig\u00e9o is planned for. This reduces the chances of inadvertent intrusion. And after around, say, 100,000 years, almost all surface traces and any complex above-ground markers will have vanished. The only things left behind will be some slight indentations, perhaps a gentle protuberance or two. Things that to the untrained eye may appear to be only the natural shape of the land. Eventually it will be as though no one was ever there, as though there is nothing for anyone to remember.\n\nBut Blanquer warns that forgetting is not so easy: \u201cYou cannot say to yourself, \u2018I will forget about that.\u2019 It\u2019s like trying not to think about pink elephants. If you want to forget about it then first you have to get rid of any information about it. That would mean shutting down the web and destroying a lot of computers, a lot of newspapers, a lot of books.\u201d\n\nIn his opinion, it is no longer possible that Cig\u00e9o could become, as Danish film maker Michael Madsen has said about the Finnish repository, \u201cthe place you must always remember to forget\u201d.\n\nLast summer I set out with some friends to walk part of the Ridgeway, an ancient long-distance route through the Chiltern Hills and North Wessex Downs in the south of England. On Whiteleaf Hill, the chalky white path passes near the remains of a Neolithic barrow, around 5,000 years old. You can tell immediately that it\u2019s not natural, the way the earth has been lumped up on the hillside, but today there is little to see except a low grassy mound with a view over the fields and woods of Buckinghamshire and the small town of Princes Risborough.\n\nWe don\u2019t know who built the burial chamber or the name of the person interred there, what language they spoke and what they believed the world would be like in 5,000 years. Staring at the barrow, it was not continuity with the past I felt, but distance.\n\nIn the 1930s, an archaeologist called Lindsay Scott broke open the Whiteleaf Hill barrow and discovered the remains of a human skeleton, around 60 pieces of pottery, flint shards and animal bones. And just as we enter burial chambers in search of answers, so archaeologists of the future may one day find themselves penetrating the concrete passageways and tunnels of the place we call Cig\u00e9o.\n\nPeering into the darkness, they will ask themselves, who built this place and why? Why did they come here, digging down so far below the surface of the land? What were they running from, or trying to hide?\n\nIn the light they carry, the archaeologists will see markings on the passage walls. Moving closer, they make out a series of footprints stretching away in front of them, down the passageway. In the looming darkness, it becomes clear \u2013 someone has left them a message.\n\nThis article was first published by Wellcome on Mosaic and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence", "description": "In January 1997, the crew of a fishing vessel in the Baltic Sea found something unusual in their nets: a greasy yellowish-brown lump of clay-like material.
