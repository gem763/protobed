When you use it, you look good, you feel good, you play good. It\u2019s literally like a sponge for your hair; it makes your hair look curly and gives your hair a certain texture. You can use it in the morning before you get ready, and before you go out to a game. Whenever you\u2019re about to be somewhere where you need to present yourself in a respectable manner and you need to look good, you use the sponge. Honestly, if you ask any athlete about it, I\u2019ll guarantee you they\u2019re going to know about it. It took over a couple years ago, and now it\u2019s everywhere. I guarantee you other people on the Knicks use it, too.", "description": "We asked New York Knicks forward Julius Randle about his favorite things, including a JBL Pulse Speaker, Macbook Pro, TIKA hair sponge, Louis Vuitton watch case, Air Jordan 1 sneakers, The Secret by Rhonda Byrne, Cholula hot sauce, and more.", "authors": ["Julius Randle", "Hilary Reid"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/22/wiclw-julius-randle/22-WICLW-julius-randle.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
