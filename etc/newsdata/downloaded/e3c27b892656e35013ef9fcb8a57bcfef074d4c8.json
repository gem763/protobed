I would say come up with another date for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day and leave Columbus Day alone. But, of course, there\u2019s this big date about this. I don\u2019t see why you would change a holiday that has been in place for so long.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Monday during an appearance on Fox Business Network's \"Varney & Company,\" network morning anchor Maria Bartiromo spoke in defense of Columbus Day. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bartiromo1014-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
