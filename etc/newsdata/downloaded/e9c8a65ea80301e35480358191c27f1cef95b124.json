It was really upsetting.\n\n\u2018Coleen knows it\u2019s a problem that can be fixed but it\u2019s still been massively stressful.\u2019\n\nShe is trying to get the home perfect for Wayne (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\nColeen had hoped that the property would be renovated before Wayne returned to the UK after finishing his contract with DC United.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news comes after the mum-of-four had apparently said she is determined to stand by her man rather than divorce her husband and father to their children.\n\nThe 33-year-old has been through a lot these last few months no thanks to Wayne being linked to a woman at a hotel, which he strenuously denied was anything inappropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s been claimed that Coleen is now facing a barrage of questions from people who want to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nSpeaking to heat, an insider close to the couple said: \u2018Everyone\u2019s asking Coleen whether her marriage will survive, and she\u2019s said she\u2019s decided to stay with Wayne.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s thought it through \u2013 and she knows people won\u2019t understand.\u2019\n\nThe footballer was photographed getting into a hotel lift with a mystery brunette after allegedly going on a \u2018seven-hour bender\u2019 while in Canada back in August.\n\nWayne won\u2019t be returning until January (Picture: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)\n\nWayne, 33, was earlier seen dancing with another girl in a club in Vancouver, before heading back to the hotel and getting into the lift together at approximately 5.30 am.\n\nFollowing the pictures, the footballer tweeted: \u2018 Nothing happened between me and any girl on that night in Vancouver. I did not enter the lift alone with the girl pictured in the hotel foyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The girl pictured in the club was simply one of many who innocently asked for autographs and pictures.\u2019\n\nThe source continued: \u2018She doesn\u2019t want the uncertainty of a future without Wayne, so staying in the marriage seems like the lesser of two evils.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk have contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
