The EU court sided with the German consumer group, saying EU law aimed to protect consumers from interference with their private lives.\n\n\"A pre-ticked check box is therefore insufficient,\" the court said in a press release, adding that cookie consent must be specific and explicit and that clicking a button to participate in a game or browsing a website, and through that allowing cookies, was not enough.\n\nThe Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law at the University of Oslo said in a statement that the ruling is \"likely to have a significant impact on the ongoing negotiations on the ePrivacy regulation which is set to regulate cookie usage.\"\n\nSeveral of the largest internet companies, such as Facebook and Twitter currently have implicit cookie consent, where by using the site, consent is deemed to have been given.\n\nFacebook and Twitter were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe case predates General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - the May 2018 internet privacy regulations that stipulate how companies must inform users about how their personal information is gathered.\n\nThe EU court also ruled that service providers had to fully inform users, including how long the cookies would operate for and whether third parties would have access to gathered data.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Internet users must actively consent to being tracked around the internet with cookies, the European Court of Justice has found.
