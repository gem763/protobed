The move is tied to J&J's recall of 33,000 bottles last week, after regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in a single bottle purchased online, according to the companies and media reports.\n\nJ&J shares fell $2.40, or about 2%, to $127.50 after news of the retailers' actions Thursday.\n\nFor J&J, last week's recall was the latest setback for a company combating thousands of lawsuits claiming the talc-based powder contains the cancer-causing mineral. According to the company, the voluntary recall is limited to just one lot of 33,000 bottles of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the U.S. last year.\n\nJ&J last week called the recall a precautionary measure and maintained that its baby powder does not contain asbestos.\n\n\"[J&J] has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA's own testing on prior occasions \u2014 and as recently as last month \u2014 found no asbestos,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nJohnson & Johnson still battling thousands of cases involving its baby powder\n\n\"Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos. Our talc comes from ore sources confirmed to meet our stringent specifications that exceed industry standards,\" the statement continued.\n\nAccording to J&J, independent laboratories have tested the company's talc and confirmed it is asbestos-free.\n\nJ&J said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found small amounts of asbestos in one bottle, which the company is currently investigating.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Moves follow Johnson & Johnson's recall of 33,000 bottles after trace amounts of asbestos found in a single sample", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/ff5b20b6-be16-41fc-85b1-b456a58da18d/thumbnail/1200x630/6659c603ebc7a68d7aa3eb45b18695b1/gettyimages-998003060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
