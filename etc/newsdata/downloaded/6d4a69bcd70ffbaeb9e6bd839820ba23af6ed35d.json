Warren raised $24.6 million overall in the third quarter of 2019, trailing only Bernie Sanders among candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe tech industry donors \u2014 many of whom were white-collar professionals, not warehouse workers or retail employees \u2014 gave to Warren amid the Massachusetts senator\u2019s frequent criticism of major technology firms, saying they should be broken up in order to increase fairness and competition in the marketplace. More than two dozen Amazon employees, with titles ranging \u201cvice president\u201d to \u201cengineer\u201d to \u201cmanager,\u201d gave between $28 and $615 to Warren, who does not hold private fundraising events and instead raises her money online.\n\n\"Giant tech companies have too much power.\" Warren tweeted earlier this year. Referring to Amazon\u2019s role in its store, she added: \u201cYou can be an umpire, or you can be a player\u2014but you can\u2019t be both.\u201d\n\nThis week, Warren took another step to separate herself from Silicon Valley\u2019s elite: She promised to not take any contributions over $200 from \u201cexecutives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,\u201d and her campaign said it would return donations from people who fit that mold.\n\nWarren\u2019s pointed comments about the tech industry have alarmed high-profile executives like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was caught on audio saying that his company would mount a legal challenge to any efforts by a Warren administration to break up Facebook.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\u201d Zuckerberg said, according to leaked audio.\n\nEmployees of Facebook donated $41,000 to Warren\u2019s campaign during the most recent fundraising quarter, which finished shortly before Zuckerberg\u2019s comments became public.\n\nWorkers for a bevy of other tech companies also contributed to Warren during the third quarter, including individuals employed by Dropbox, Square, Twitter, SpaceX, Ancestry.com and Microsoft. She also drew a $2,800 donation from Sam Altman, the former president of the incubator Y Combinator.", "description": "Employees of technology giants are pouring money into Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign for president, as Warren calls for breaking up the companies that sign their paychecks.
