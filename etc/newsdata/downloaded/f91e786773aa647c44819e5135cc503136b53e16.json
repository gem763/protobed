His comments drew the attention of Trump\u2019s son, and Carney responded by praising government officials on Thursday.\n\nIn a 30-minute interview at the GeekWire Summit in Seattle, Carney drew distinctions between the current administration and those of former Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush and Bill Clinton. Carney used to be Obama\u2019s press secretary and worked as a political reporter before that.\n\n\u201cVirtually with no exception, everyone I dealt with in those administrations, whether I personally agreed or disagreed with what they thought were the right policy decisions or the right way to approach things, I never doubted that they were patriots,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way now.\u201d\n\nCarney also said he never lied on behalf of the White House and \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be that standard today.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Carney added that it was \u201cdrummed into his head\u201d as a government official not to mention interest rates or decisions made by the Federal Reserve. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t get that memo in the current White House,\u201d he said. Trump has railed against the Fed this year for not cutting interest rates more.\n\nCarney, who joined Amazon (NASDAQ: ) in 2015, frequently tweets about his time in the Obama administration. But Amazon itself tries to keep out of hot-button political issues. Carney\u2019s comments on Wednesday stoked tension between Amazon and Trump\u2019s circle. The president has long denounced Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos in tweets, criticizing him for the rates the e-commerce giant pays the U.S. Postal Service to deliver packages and Bezos\u2019s ownership of what Trump calls \u201cthe Amazon Washington Post.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted news reports of Carney\u2019s comments to his 3.9 million followers and asked if this was Amazon\u2019s official stance.\n\nWithin an hour of that tweet, Carney praised government officials on Twitter: \u201cI have enormous faith in and respect for the countless patriots throughout the US gov\u2019t.\u201d\n\n(Updates with reaction from Trump\u2019s son and another statement from Carney)", "description": "Amazon Executive\u2019s Comments Draw Ire of President Trump\u2019s Son", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1607761df980de00f9fe1fb219448a98.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
