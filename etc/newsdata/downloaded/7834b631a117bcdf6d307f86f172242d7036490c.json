Which is dumb. I don\u2019t know about you lot, but I only tuned into episode 1 to watch Lindsay, an American, bullshit her way through an Australian singing competition. It\u2019s peak entertainment.\n\n\u201cShe was tricky with demands and had a complete lack of respect for time schedules,\u201d the source said. Blah, blah, blah, the story went bloody boonta.\n\nBut, speaking to news.com.au today, Channel 10\u2019s chief content officer Beverley McGarvey binned the claims completely.\n\n\u201cDespite what you may have read, we will have exactly the same judging line-up and exactly the same host,\u201d McGarvey said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that they\u2019re all coming back.\u201d\n\nMcGarvey also revealed the team are already thinking about season 2 casting.\n\n\u201cI think that the ambition for us next year would be to cast it differently so that we were surprising people in different ways and that might be that some of them are more famous or some of them are from completely different industries.\u201d\n\nSo far, the unmasked singers have been Gretel Killeen, Brett Lee, Nikki Webster, Wendell Sailor, Darren McMullen, and Adam Brand.\n\nOn Monday, Lindsay\u2019s co-judge Dave Hughes defended the actor and singer on The Hit Network\u2019s Hughesy & Kate.\n\n\u201cLindsay Lohan was an absolute pleasure to work with and will be on the second series,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s that.\n\nAs for the actual show, we\u2019re down to the final six \u2013 Monster, Spider, Unicorn, Wolf, Lion and Robot. I\u2019m not entirely sure about the first four, but I\u2019m 10/10 convinced the Lion is Kate Ceberano and the Robot is Cody \u201cPrince Neptune\u201d Simpson.\n\nWatch The Masked Singer 7.30pm, Monday and Tuesday on Channel 10.", "description": "Network 10 has taken a wrecking ball to the rumours claiming Lindsay Lohan\u00a0was to be replaced on\u00a0The Masker Singer Australia\u00a0season 2.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-10-at-10.43.38-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
