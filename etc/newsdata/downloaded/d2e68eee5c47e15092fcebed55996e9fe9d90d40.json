California\u2019s right to set stricter rules than the federal government is expected to be formally revoked as the president travels through the state for fundraisers in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley.\n\nAs Caitlin McCoy of the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program told The Independent last week, the administration is attempting to push the revocation through despite pushback from the auto industry itself.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

As with most of the current administration\u2019s sweeping efforts to roll back environmental regulations, the hope is that the rules will be harder, or impossible, to legally reinstate after they leave.\n\nFor now, the legal battle will be set. Revoking the state\u2019s waivers will force auto companies to choose whether they\u2019ll side with California\u2019s side, which seeks to slow the destruction of climate change, or the Trump administration\u2019s, which is effectively ignoring the climate crisis. As of July, four major companies have said they\u2019ll side with the state over the federal government.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A man who likes kissing and dancing with his dogs, he has 110 of them, is concerned most about the non-humans on the planet. \"If climate change should be the end of humanity, I really don't care, but if climate change is the end of any animal species who hasn't contributed anything towards the speeding up of this process, that's why I am reacting,\" he said. \"On the highway, when people slow down to look at a car crash, climate change is like that because everyone is slowing down to look at the accident but not realising that we are actually the car crash.\" Reuters/Hannah McKay 2/18 A reindeer grazes on land.
