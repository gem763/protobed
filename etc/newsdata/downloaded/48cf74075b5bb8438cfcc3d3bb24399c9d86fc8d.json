Putin of Russia and for Vladimir A. Zelensky, who ascended to the Ukranian presidency in May.\n\nMr. Zelensky called the exchange the \u201cfirst stage to unblock our dialogue\u201d and \u201cthe first step to stop the war.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Putin, the exchange could open the door to easing tensions with Europe, which imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s ailing economy after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. For the Russian leader \u2014 weakened by an ailing economy and weeks of protests calling for fair municipal elections after opposition candidates were stricken from ballots \u2014 the gesture could be a way to demonstrate to Europe that he was willing to compromise.", "description": "Two dozen Ukrainian sailors detained by Russia in the Kerch Strait last year are among those being returned \u2014 as is the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, his lawyer said.", "authors": ["Ivan Nechepurenko", "Palko Karasz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/world/07prisoner-swap-sub2/07prisoner-swap-sub2-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
