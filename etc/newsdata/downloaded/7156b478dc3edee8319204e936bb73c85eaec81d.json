Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump criticized Atkinson, whom the president appointed to the position, while seizing on reports that the anonymous whistleblower previously had a professional relationship with one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nTrump has sought to discredit the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and attack the individual, whose identity remains unknown to the president and the public, as a \u201cpartisan\u201d amid revelations about the complaint, which caused House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAtkinson has been at the center of the controversy since receiving the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. He was initially prevented by the administration from sharing details of the complaint with Congress.\n\nAtkinson testified before Congress last week behind closed doors.\n\nThe Washington Examiner and Axois both reported recently that Atkinson disclosed to Congress during that private session that the whistleblower had a previous professional relationship with one of the 2020 Democratic candidates.\n\nIn a letter from Atkinson alerting the acting intelligence chief to the whistleblower complaint in August, the inspector general disclosed that an initial review identified \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias\u201d related to the whistleblower\u2019s allegation but that Atkinson nevertheless deemed the complaint to be credible.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of Atkinson marks a new front in his efforts to dispute the allegations in the whistleblower complaint and House Democrats\u2019 ensuing impeachment inquiry.\n\nAtkinson, a former Justice Department prosecutor, was confirmed to the position in May 2018 after being tapped by Trump for the inspector general role. He has earned broad praise from members of Congress from both parties.\n\nThe whistleblower raised alarm over a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump asked Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Clinton jokes she could 'obviously' beat Trump in 2020 'rematch' Gowdy in talks to join Trump's impeachment defense team MORE, a Democratic presidential candidate.", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday lashed out at the intelligence community inspector general over his handling of a whistleblower complaint raising alarm over Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trump.border.wall_.1003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
