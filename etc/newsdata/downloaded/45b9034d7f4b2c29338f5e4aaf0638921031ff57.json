Those missions include the first-ever soft-landing of a space craft on the far side of the moon.\n\nHowever, close ties between the Chinese space program and the country\u2019s military have limited its participation in multinational efforts, including the International Space Station. China is instead building its own permanent station and has invited other countries to join in the effort.\n\nThe visa incident also comes amid a simmering trade war between China and the U.S. in which accusations that China steals or coerces foreign firms into handing over sensitive technology have played a major role.", "description": "The visa incident comes amid a trade war between China and the U.S. where accusations that China steals sensitive technology have played a major role.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT846_Chinav_ZG_20191023094955.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
