The witness describes a man believed to be Hart and telling a dispatcher that he \"looked like he's hurting.\"\n\nThe eyewitness account is part of 911 audio recordings released by the Los Angeles County Fire Department. A California Highway Patrol collision report said Hart was a passenger in a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda that went off Mulholland Highway and rolled down an embankment early Sunday.\n\nAlso in the vehicle were Jared Black, who was driving, and his fiancee, Rebecca Broxterman. The report said Black was not under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe witness also described Black as appearing to be seriously hurt. The witness also said the roof of the totaled vehicle was \"crushed\" with smashed in doors. He said he was at the accident \"with another car that pulled over to help\" adding \"only one car\" went off the highway.\n\nThe CHP said Hart, 40, and Black, 28, suffered \"major back injuries.\" Hart's wife has said the actor-comedian will be fine. Broxterman, 31, only complained of pain.\n\nThe report said Hart had left the scene to his nearby residence to get medical attention. He and Black were ultimately taken to different hospitals.\n\nIt remains unclear how the accident will affect Hart, who has emerged from his roots in standup comedy to become one a major Hollywood star. His next major release, \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" is scheduled for release in December.\n\nThe accident, which remains under investigation, occurred on a stretch of road in the hills above the city of Malibu.\n\nSeveral celebrities have expressed support for Hart on social media.\n\n\"Stop messing with my emotions brother,\" Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson wrote on Instagram on Sunday. \"We have a lot more laughing to do together. Love you man. Stay strong.\" The actor posted a silly photo of the pair riding on camels from what appears to be their upcoming film \"Jumanji: The Next Level.\"\n\n\"I've just heard that @kevinhart4real was injured today in a car accident in Los Angeles,\" wrote Bryan Cranston on Instagram. \"Let's all send him positive energy and healing thoughts. He's a good human. Get well soon, brother.\" Hart and Cranston starred in the drama \"The Upside\" together.\n\nActor Terry Crews tweeted \"Get well soon, brother\" Sunday afternoon.", "description": "It remains unclear how the accident will affect Hart, who has emerged from his roots in standup comedy to become one a major Hollywood star", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/31a78f70-06e2-427c-af15-0c0ecc1f32a5/thumbnail/1200x630/c8a7503ee74735f9d91ae4fd1a9425fa/kevin-hart-ap-19244752179570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
