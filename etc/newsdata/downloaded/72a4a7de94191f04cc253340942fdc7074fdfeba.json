Wage growth is weak and the effect of October's sales tax hike will begin to show. Consumer sentiment has been pretty gloomy, which means risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside.\"\n\nJapan rolled out a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1, a move considered critical for fixing the country's tattered finances.\n\nWhile the government has taken steps to ease the burden on consumers by offering vouchers and tax breaks, there are fears the higher tax could hurt an economy already feeling the pinch from global pressures.\n\nReal wages adjusted for inflation fell for an eighth straight month in August, raising concerns for private spending.\n\nJapan's jobless rate remains at record-low levels, but job offers are slowing in a sign the fallout from the trade tensions is broadening.\n\nUpcoming data could be hard to read as households may have made purchases ahead of the sales tax increase, which will inflate consumption data up till September and may lead to a downturn in spending from October onward, analysts say.\n\nThe strength of consumption and capital expenditure will be crucial to the Bank of Japan's decision on whether to loosen monetary policy at its rate review on Oct. 30-31.\n\nThe central bank has said while robust domestic demand is making up for the weakness in exports, it stands ready to act if risks heighten enough to derail Japan's recovery.\n\nAny sign that job growth is peaking also bodes ill for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration, which has flagged a strong job market as among its biggest policy accomplishments.\n\nAbe pledged on Friday to deliver \"all possible steps\" if risks to the economy intensified, signaling his readiness to boost fiscal spending if this month's sales tax hike triggers a sharp downturn in growth.", "description": "Japan's August household spending rises for ninth month, but wages fall", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF961RN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
