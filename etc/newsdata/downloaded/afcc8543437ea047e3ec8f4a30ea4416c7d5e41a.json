Her government must approve every firing.\n\n\u201cThen the tax code is so complicated\u2026 worth at least two or three truckloads of paper.\u201d\n\nWade started a lip balm company. Some of her ingredients are not made in Senegal, so she imports them. To \u201cprotect\u201d Senegalese manufacturers, the government makes importing ingredients expensive.\n\n\u201cSome have a 70% import tariff on them!\u201d she says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump now threatens similar taxes on imports from China. In Africa, people sometimes escape such taxes by paying bribes. We hear a lot about African corruption.\n\n\u201cPeople complain about corruption as if corruption is a root problem,\u201d says Wade. \u201cI say no. Corruption is a natural consequence of stupid, senseless, idiot laws.\u201d\n\nShe says there would be just as much corruption in the U.S. if taxes and regulations here made it as difficult to do business as Senegal does.\n\n\u201cThe only way to fix corruption is to simplify,\u201d advises Wade.\n\nWade\u2019s business has survived because she was fortunate enough to find a helpful bureaucrat who pointed out a loophole.\n\n\u201cI went to see the head of customs, and we started looking together,\u201d recounts Wade.\u201d Looking through the volumes of crushing regulations, they \u201cfound a clause in one of the binders saying if you\u2019re exporting 80% of your products, and if you\u2019ve been in business for two years, you can ask for an exemption.\u201d\n\nMost people are \u201cclueless\u201d about these obstacles, she says, especially those in academia, Hollywood and the news media. \u201cThey have such a strong anti-capitalism bias.\u201d\n\nTo raise awareness about why economic freedom creates prosperity but regulation prevents it, Wade and the Foundation for Economic Education made a documentary titled \u201cMade in Mekhe.\u201d\n\nIn it, she asks: \u201cWhy is it that a couple decades ago, China was at the same level as most African countries? Countries like Singapore made it. Hong Kong made it. Even a place like Dubai -- bare land of desert sand -- all of a sudden, Dubai (is) one of the financial centers of the world! You\u2019re like, what? What happened here?\u201d\n\nShe says booming places like those understood that they wouldn\u2019t create prosperity unless they made it easy for business to operate.\n\nBut international aid organizations have a different solution. Wade says they often make Africa\u2019s problems worse by adding rules. The U.N.\u2019s \u201cSustainable Development\u201d goals include things like \u201cinclusive and equitable quality education,\u201d \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cgender equality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have chains around our necks! No one is seeing it. Then they want to come talk to me about inequality! We need greater economic freedom!\u201d\n\nGovernments send $50 billion a year to Africa, and businesses offer Africa free goods.\n\nTOMS Shoes promotes itself by sending a pair of shoes to Africa for every pair you buy.\n\nWade says: \u201cI know it came from a good place. I get it. But can you just think further down the road?\u201d\n\nShe points out that a result of TOMS \u201ccharity\u201d is that African shoemakers go out of business. \u201cYou can\u2019t compete with free!\u201d\n\nBut donation promotion has become trendy among Western businesses, says Wade. \u201cNow you\u2019re seeing it with tampons, seeing it with soap, with everything!\u201d\n\nAfrica becomes dependent instead of self-sustaining. It would be better, says Wade, if Westerners simply encouraged African governments to stop strangling their own entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cIf I have a job then, guess what? My malnutrition problem goes poof! Even access to clean water goes poof,\u201d says Wade. Instead, \u201cthe business climate sucks so much that people like me can\u2019t do that work of creating companies and jobs.\u201d", "description": "Why does most of Africa stay poor while other parts .09/02/2019 3:14:55AM EST.", "authors": ["John Stossel", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/297/7e80d21d-1c0d-495d-b38c-31ae0658d806.jpg"}
