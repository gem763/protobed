Shipments to China, South Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner, also dropped 20%.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s exports plunge extends the gloomy outlook for the world economy after Japan\u2019s exports dropped for a 10th month in September. Higher tariffs and uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade war have probably cut South Korea\u2019s growth by 0.4 percentage point this year, Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said Oct. 18 in Washington.\n\nJapan\u2019s Exports Continue to Drop as Global Slowdown Weighs\n\nThe trade weakness is also hurting domestic demand and helped push South Korea\u2019s consumer prices index below zero for the first time ever in September. With Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy headed for the slowest expansion since the global financial crisis, the government is ramping up spending while the Bank of Korea last week cut interest rates for a second time this year to support growth.\n\nThe latest trade data indicates there\u2019s no immediate sign of the outlook improving for the economy, despite a tentative truce in the U.S. and China trade war. Considering the difference in the number of working days, daily exports value fell 13.5% on average during the first 20 days of October from a year earlier, the data from the customs office show.\n\n\u201cThe worst for exports may be over, but a meaningful rebound also appears challenging,\u201d Angela Hsieh, an economist for Barclays (LON: ) Bank PLC, wrote in a report.\n\nSemiconductor sales, which account for the largest share of exports, declined 29%. Overseas shipments of automobiles dropped 6.5%.\n\nOverall imports fell 20% in the first 20 days of October from a year earlier. Exports to the U.S. slid 17%, while imports dropped 22%.\n\nShipments to Japan dropped 21%, while imports plummeted 30%. The two neighbors are embroiled in a trade spat linked to lingering disagreements over Japan\u2019s colonial past.\n\n(Updates with new chart, Bank of Korea assessment)", "description": "Korea Export Drop Spells Another Gloomy Month for Global Economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5fdcdfed4aa3c2467f5be1c30a8afb35.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
