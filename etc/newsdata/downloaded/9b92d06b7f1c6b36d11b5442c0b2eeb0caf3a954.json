REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nIn the four days ending on Monday, voters were allowed to cast an advance ballot. Some 4.7 million people voted, an increase of 29% from 2015, Elections Canada said. Election day is Oct. 21.\n\n\u201cThe trend has been that more people take advantage of the option of advanced polling ... because they like the convenience of it,\u201d said Nick Gamache, director of media relations at Elections Canada.\n\nThere were 6,135 advanced polling stations this year, almost 1,200 more than 2015, and they were open longer each day, Elections Canada said.\n\nAdvance voting \u201chas been trending up in every federal election,\u201d Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said on Twitter. It \u201cdoesn\u2019t always mean overall turnout will be higher,\u201d he added.\n\nPolls show the two biggest parties, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives, are tied nationally though neither is positioned to win an outright majority in parliament, meaning they may need a partner to govern.\n\nThe left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) gained 5 percentage points to 20% over the past week and is in third place nationally, according to an Ipsos poll published on Tuesday, a surge that could hand NDP leader Jagmeet Singh the balance of power.\n\nTurnout is increasingly seen as crucial to the outcome of the election, especially for the Liberals. Trudeau\u2019s campaign has struggled to gain momentum after pictures of him wearing blackface emerged last month.\n\n\u201cAs advanced voting continues and is enthusiastically embraced, there is no clear-cut favorite,\u201d polling company Angus Reid said in a statement. \u201cThe final chapter of the 43rd Canadian federal election will be written next week, and the text of the story will depend largely on voter turnout.\u201d\n\nAll the candidates were campaigning on Tuesday after many took a short break for the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nSpeaking in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Trudeau urged voters to choose Liberals not only over Conservatives, but also over the rival, left-leaning NDP and the Green Party.\n\n\u201cIf you want progressive action, you need a progressive government, not a progressive opposition,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nSingh, who himself cast an early ballot over the weekend, said on Sunday that he was open to working with other parties to keep the Conservatives out of power, but on Monday adjusted his message to say his goal was to win, not enter a coalition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear the NDP would join a high-deficit, high- tax government, and it\u2019s quite clear Justin Trudeau would pay any price to stay in power,\u201d Scheer said in Quai Saint-Andre, Quebec.\n\nThough leaders are speaking to a smaller audience after more than 4.7 million people - almost a fifth of the electorate - cast early ballots, one exception may be Manitoba, which was struck by a major storm packing snow and toppling trees over the weekend.\n\nElections Canada is looking into ways to help those in the areas hardest hit to vote on election day, Gamache said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in evaluation mode. We\u2019re already looking at adding resources on the ground so that people can cast a ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an influx (on election day), we want people not to have longer lines.\u201d", "description": "Canada's federal elections watchdog said on Tuesday more Canadians voted early this year compared with four years ago, while on the campaign trail party leaders increasingly discussed the possibility that no party will win a majority in parliament.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441208237&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1PZ-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
