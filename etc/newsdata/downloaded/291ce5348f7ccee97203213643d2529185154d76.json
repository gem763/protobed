In court papers, the company said Healey's decision to sue now after a three-year investigation was simply \"gamesmanship\" to distract the oil company's lawyers from the trial in New York that began on Tuesday.\n\nHealey and her New York counterpart launched investigations into Exxon following news reports in 2015, saying company scientists determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nThose news reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.\n\nHealey, in 2016, issued a so-called \"civil investigative demand\" to Exxon seeking documents to determine whether it had violated the Massachusetts consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products.\n\nThe company fought the records request, but the state's top court in April 2018 concluded Healey had jurisdiction to seek the records. In January, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear Exxon's appeal of that order.\n\nNew York meanwhile sued Exxon in October 2018, accusing it of engaging in a scheme to deceive investors about the effect that future climate change regulations could have on its business.", "description": "Attorney General Maura Healey goes after Exxon Mobil, saying it lied to investors about climate change risks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/f3166b1826d94fc9bb58fad60bc65b18_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
