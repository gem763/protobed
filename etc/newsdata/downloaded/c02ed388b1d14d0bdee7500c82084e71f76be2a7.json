For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 This World Series is going to the Max.\n\nIn a back-and-forth Series featuring unprecedented success for the road team and the steely resolve of two clubs now far beyond proving they are championship caliber, the Washington Nationals forced a winner-take-all climax by prevailing in a battle of towering aces and redoubtable sluggers, riding their greatest hitter and most dominant pitcher one more time to set the stage for an unforgettable climax.\n\nMax Scherzer, summoning a miracle cure somewhere between a Saturday cortisone shot and a cross-country flight Monday, will take the ball in Game 7 of the World Series on Wednesday night, a championship up for grabs after a Game 6 on Tuesday night that cemented several legacies and sullied several others \u2013 including Major League Baseball\u2019s.\n\nIn the end, the burgeoning October legends of Stephen Strasburg and Juan Soto were not to be denied. Strasburg has pitched in six games in these playoffs and the Nationals have won them all, none more important than Tuesday\u2019s taut, gut-wrenching and occasionally absurd 7-2 conquest of the Astros.\n\nThe road team has now won every game in this World Series, a grim harbinger for the Astros in Game 7.\n\nAlso not great for Houston: Scherzer, taking the ball for as long as he can after hurriedly healing from nerve irritation in his neck that rendered him unable to lift his arm Sunday morning.\n\nScherzer was scratched from his Game 5 start, and the Nationals pointed toward a Game 7 with him starting, which seemed a longshot for many reasons after the Astros claimed Game 5 and a 3-2 lead.\n\nBut Scherzer pitched on flat ground before Game 6 at Minute Maid Park, told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d and then warmed up in the bullpen as if he might make a relief appearance.\n\nBut Strasburg, Soto and the Nationals both suppressed the Astros and kept Scherzer in line for Game 7.\n\nStrasburg bulled through 8\u2153 innings to beat the Astros for the second time in this Series, and his October resume sparkles even brighter.\n\nAfter striking out seven, his playoffs look like this: A 6-0 record, a 1.98 ERA, 47 strikeouts to just four walks, and most important: Dominant performances in three elimination games.\n\nJuan Soto celebrates his sole home run in the fifth inning.

Positioned the Nationals to win a decisive Game 5 in the NLDS at Los Angeles. And then Tuesday, overcoming a two-run first inning to out-duel Justin Verlander.\n\nThe Nationals even survived an objectively bad call from home-plate umpire Sam Holbrook, who called Trea Turner out on interference despite Turner\u2019s maintaining a straight line all the way down the basepaths to first.\n\nA 4 minute, 34-second replay review upheld both the call and the return of Yan Gomes to first base, and Nationals manager Dave Martinez was ejected after raging at the umpires after the inning.\n\nHe should have relaxed: Third baseman Anthony Rendon rode a Will Harris pitch and an apparent karmic wave out to left field for a two-run homer that accounted for some crucial insurance. He later tacked on a two-run double in the ninth.\n\nBut it was Strasburg who will be remembered most on this night \u2013 and probably for time eternal by Nationals fans should they win Game 7.\n\nStrasburg delivered his biggest gut-punch to Houston in the fifth, moments after he was handed a 3-2 lead. A one-out double by George Springer put the tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position, and one of the game\u2019s greatest hitters, Jose Altuve, at the plate.\n\nWhat happened next almost defied logic: Strasburg getting Altuve to chase three off-speed pitches out of the strike zone. Two outs.\n\nMichael Brantley then scorched a 102.7-mph short-hopper at shifted shortstop Trea Turner, who snagged it nimbly and threw to first. Threat over.\n\nMoments earlier, the 21-year-old Soto slugged his fifth home run this postseason and third of the World Series, a towering drive off Verlander to give the Nationals a 3-2 lead. Soto carried his bat all the way to first base, a glorious rebuke to Astros All-Star Alex Bregman\u2019s bat tote after homering off Strasburg in the first.\n\nTwo batters before Soto\u2019s shot, Verlander gave up a game-tying blast to No. 2 hitter Adam Eaton, once again failing in his seventh attempt to win a World Series game.\n\nVerlander\u2019s seven-start World Series dossier after his five-inning, three-run effort: 0-6, a 5.66 ERA and nine homers surrendered in 38 career innings.\n\nIt was the second time in three years he failed to win a Game 6 that could have given the Astros a championship. They bailed him out in 2017, winning Game 7.\n\nWednesday night, they\u2019ll have to go through a surprise nemesis \u2013 and a team that long ago proved it will not die easily.", "description": "Strasburg fought through 8\u2153 innings to beat the Astros for the second time in this Series, and his October resume sparkles even brighter.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
