They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nTrump responded to Iran\u2019s denial Monday tweeting, \u201cNow they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nMilitary escalation or diplomatic resolution\n\nIbish told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move that Iran, hurt by sanctions which limit its ability to sell oil, may have overstepped. \u201cThey have done something that affects the whole global oil market that directly challenges the United States and economy of Saudi Arabia. It is an attack on the global oil market and the global oil infrastructure. And there is the potential for a global response to Iran at the diplomatic level,\u201d he said.\n\nStability in the Middle East as well as \u201cdeterrence need to be restored,\u201d according to Ibish, \u201c and that may require some kind of military response here.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC, \u201cIt is a time for a coalition of tame and thoughtful energy-producing and energy-consuming countries to come together and put a stop to Iran\u2019s malign activity.\u201d His comments come a day before the U.N. General Assembly 2019 session opens Tuesday in New York City with high-level general debate scheduled to begin September 24.\n\nDisrupting the international oil trade is an objective of Iran\u2019s, according to Ibish. \u201cIt really is kind of an act of almost taking part of the global market hostage at least for a few days in order to make their point.\u201d\n\nIbish warns that a failure to hold Iran accountable for the attack will guarantee that it will happen again. \u201cThey are going to escalate again no question,\u201d he said.\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Iran denies any role in the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure but analysts say evidence points to Iran and they are calling for a response that may include military action against Iran.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G8e0UQuNr5VbpBB2WJ6hnQ--~B/aD0xNjQyO3c9MjU5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/499a3140-d6d9-11e9-9ffc-7cce75cfb249", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
