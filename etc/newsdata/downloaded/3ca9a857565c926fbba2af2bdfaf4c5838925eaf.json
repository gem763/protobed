First, though, you need to grow up.", "language": "en", "text": "Advice columnist\n\nAdapted from a recent online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: My wife and I separated a few months ago. I felt lonely and unsatisfied in our marriage and consequently developed feelings for another woman. My wife found out, I moved out, and I moved on with my affair partner.\n\nIt was the worst mistake of my life. Once the newness of the relationship wore off, we fought constantly and ended up breaking up.\n\nNow I'm realizing how stupid and selfish I've been. I felt lonely and trapped in our marriage because my wife was spending all her time taking care of our kids, and I had grown to resent her for it. But I wasn't helpful, I wasn't present, and I regret not communicating with her. My selfishness led to the breakdown of my marriage, and I am truly sorry.\n\nSo far, we're just separated, not divorcing, but she refuses to talk to me. I tried calling, emailing, texting, showing up at her work, getting in touch with her friends, but I'm hitting a wall. I haven't seen the kids because she refuses to talk to me. I just want to tell her I'm sorry. What's the best way to proceed?\n\n\u2014 Ex\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nEx: Showing up at her work? Oh my, no.\n\nThe best way to proceed is to get yourself well. You\u2019ve had an epiphany, that\u2019s excellent, and it seems genuine \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean your wife has any reason to think it\u2019s anything other than a matter of your affair fizzling and your wanting to get back to a warm bed again. And your efforts to talk to her have crossed some serious boundaries: not just dragging your problems into her workplace, but putting friends in a terrible position.\n\nSo stop. Stop pressuring her to talk to you, immediately. Respect her right to be furious at you and completely uninterested in hearing what you have to say. That\u2019s basic.\n\nA more sophisticated respect for her \u2014 and, more important, respect for yourself \u2014 means you stop trying to fix your marriage and instead get help for the thing that broke it. When you felt lonely and trapped, you didn\u2019t tell her, \u201cI feel lonely and trapped.\u201d You didn\u2019t invest yourself in your kids; you dumped all the work on her. When your unhappiness metastasized into anger, you didn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m angry.\u201d Instead, you sought pleasure.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make you a monster \u2014 you\u2019re human. But you\u2019re an acutely immature human, in need of remedial emotional work. So get it, please. Good therapy, spiritual guidance if appropriate, and a good hard stare-down with your frailties.\n\nI\u2019ve found this exercise useful: Scour your past for times you were dead certain you were wronged by someone and see these incidents with new eyes. Were you really so blameless? Isn\u2019t it possible you just defaulted to thinking you were right because it was you and you meant well (of course!), but in fact you were partly, if not entirely, in the wrong? Challenging yourself like this is like antiseptic on a cut \u2014 sharply painful, strangely satisfying and crucial to proper healing. Get to it.\n\nIn the meantime, you screwed up as a spouse, but you have a right to see your kids. Look up local mediation resources. You and she can talk when she\u2019s ready to talk.", "description": "You messed up, and she has every right to be furious.
