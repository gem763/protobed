Some 43 per cent disapprove, down from 48 per cent last week, when support for impeachment was 46 per cent.\n\nThe hearing stunt unfolded hours after Mr Trump demanded that his side harden up their attacks on the Democrats.\n\n\"Republicans have to get tougher and fight,\" he said, referring to impeachment. Democrats are \"vicious and they stick together\".\n\n\"It never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible!\" Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT), later adding their \"case is DEAD!\".\n\nMr Trump's growing warnings against his own side come as signs emerge of cracks among Republicans over the direction of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nJohn Thune, the second-most senior Republican in the Senate, said the \"picture\" emerging from Mr Taylor's testimony on Tuesday was \"not a good one\".\n\n\"But I would say also that, again, until we have a process that allows for everybody to see this in full transparency; it's pretty hard to draw any hard, fast conclusions,\" Senator Thune said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Trump later took to Twitter to rail against \"people within the Trump administration\" to \"stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats\".\n\nNever Trumpers are a group of conservative, often former Republicans, who refuse to support the president. The name stems from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRepublicans who entered the hearing room were criticised for bringing mobile phones into the area, compromising the so-called SCIF, or sensitive compartmented information facility.\n\n\"They're freaked out. They're trying to stop this investigation,\" Democratic representative Ted Lieu said. \"They don't want to hear from witness Cooper today. They know more facts are going to be delivered, which are absolutely damning to the President of the United States.\"\n\nRepublican representative Mark Meadows told reporters of the situation in the hearing room: \"There's about 20 members [lawmakers] down there, at least a dozen that are not on the three committees [leading the investigation]. And they're going to wait until there's a more open and transparent process.\"\n\nThe witness who saw the events said the Republican lawmakers pushed past Capitol Police personnel and started yelling, voicing their objections to decisions made by the Democratic leaders of the House to hold depositions in closed sessions and to not release transcripts of the testimony.\n\nRepublican representative Matt Gaetz, an outspoken Trump supporter who led Wednesday's action, had tried to enter the committee room last week but was turned away because he was not a member of any of the three committees leading the investigation.\n\nDemocratic representative Eric Swalwell said the effort was designed to intimidate witnesses. \"It's not going to work,\" he added. \"We're not going to be deterred.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the hearing room was stormed, dozens of House Republicans appeared before reporters, with some denouncing the impeachment process run by Democrats as a \"joke\", a \"railroad job\", a \"charade\", and \"Soviet-style\".\n\nThey complained that testimony was being taken privately rather than in public hearings and that the House did not hold a vote formally authorising the investigation.\n\n\"It is a sham, and it's time for it to end,\" Republican congressman Mark Walker said.\n\nWith Reuters", "description": "High farce in Congress as a posse of Republicans storm a closed-door Ukraine hearing involving a top Pentagon official.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7233%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1244%2C$y_575/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a721fd3b4782950edd79960ec57d690ab3773698", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
