This midnight half-marathon is not that, but this run and the others I do each Tuesday night with this group offer inspiration that doesn\u2019t exist in sanctioned races with their closed courses and participation medals but reveals another running heartbeat of New York. Sometimes there\u2019s a little prize money \u2014 $100 in a sweaty, crumpled envelope \u2014 but no one is really here for that. The prize is street cred. Being fast isn\u2019t enough to take first place.\n\nWe have to know the streets, and more important, how they work. Aim for the center point of the approaching car and look beyond it to find a line. Be ready to jump. Watch rear vision mirrors for intent. Never make eye contact with New Yorkers when you\u2019re threading through a packed cross walk \u2014 they panic and stop like prey. Never disturb the city\u2019s cadence. Use its flow. Find your line.", "description": "Running in New York City is about far more than the marathon.
