Around 127 military projects are expected to be put on hold, and construction for 175 miles of the wall could begin in over 100 days, according to CNN. Pentagon comptroller Elaine McCusker said the funds will be pay for 11 border crossing projects.\n\nSchumer\u2019s office noted the plan will \u201cdelay critical construction projects\u201d for his state and constituents, notably the United States Military Academy in West Point. The military academy educates and trains roughly 4,500 cadets to become future officers in the US Army.\n\nThe academy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration planned on reallocating military construction funds to pay for the proposed wall. Trump declared a national emergency in February, allowing him to bypass congress and fund the controversial wall at the border. Congress attempted to block Trump\u2019s declaration but the resolution was vetoed by the president.\n\nTrump previously claimed over 200 times that Mexico would fund the wall, according to an estimate from The Washington Post. He later walked back his remarks and said in January that he \u201cnever said this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never meant they\u2019re going to write out a check,\u201d Trump said, referring to Mexico.", "description": "Business Insider - Democratic Sen.
