Bernie Sanders, according to financial disclosures posted at the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 OpenSecrets.org website, has the teachers in his pocket \u2014 or, more to the truth, in his wallet.\n\nAnd that\u2019s worrisome.\n\nThat means not only are today\u2019s teachers largely ignorant of constitutional truths, but that also means tomorrow\u2019s leaders are well on their way to becoming just as ignorant.\n\nLook at this, a data set titled \u201cWhich Kinds of Donors are Funding the Presidential Hopefuls?\u201d and posted on the Open Secrets website: Sanders, by and large, has reaped his biggest whirlwind of support from the so-called educated crowd. From teachers, he\u2019s received $949,470; from professors, meanwhile, he\u2019s received an additional $361,408.\n\nThat\u2019s $1.3 million and some change from those who are supposed to be the better educated batch of the country \u2014 from those who are supposed to be schooled in history and government and civics and law \u2014 given directly to the one who is trying with every campaign step to tear down the fabric of the country. To the socialist candidate who is trying to shove his socialist views down a democratic-republic country\u2019s throat.\n\nSimply put, the Constitution and socialism cannot coexist.\n\nThat\u2019s basic Civics 101.\n\nThat\u2019s the sublime message that stares down at elementary students everywhere as they view classroom posters of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, as they gaze at the cursive text of printed copies of the Declaration of Independence, as they take fieldtrips to Washington, D.C., to look upon the rich histories, such as Statuary Hall on Capitol Hill, scattered about the National Mall.\n\nAnd bingo \u2014 that\u2019s the problem.\n\nThat was then.\n\nThis is now.\n\nAmerica\u2019s public schools used to teach American exceptionalism, American independence, American rugged individualism.\n\nAmerica\u2019s public school systems now teach America owes the world an apology \u2014 that white male Americans owe all minorities and all women apologies. And reparation dollars, too.\n\nThe result of this twisted teaching has been to bring the socialists out of the cobwebbed corners, and thrust them right smack into America\u2019s hot political scene. As if they belong.\n\nBut they don\u2019t. They don\u2019t belong in the light. They belong in the dark corners.\n\nAnd to send them scurrying back there, American parents must either insist on their local schools teaching the truthful history of America\u2019s great founding \u2014 or take on the job of teaching their children themselves.\n\nIf teachers are funding Sanders, and professors at higher places of learning are donating to socialists, then you can be sure the students they teach aren\u2019t learning anything positive about America \u2014 or negative about socialism. And this is the biggest threat facing our nation today.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
