But what I would say is this environment bill is about supporting people to make environmentally friendly choices.'\n\nAppearing on Sky News Ms Villiers was grilled by Kay Burley about her own personal environmental choices\n\nThere are approximately 220 frequent flyer clubs with an estimated total membership of 200 million across the world\n\nShe continued: 'We recognise that individual choices can't fix this issue by themselves.\n\n'We want to support carbon-friendly choices and ensure we have an effective programme across Government, across business, to tackle these key environmental problems.'\n\nThere are approximately 220 frequent flyer clubs with an estimated total membership of 200 million across the world, many of whom take additional flights to 'maintain their privileged traveller status'.\n\nThe new suggestions are aimed at reducing air travel for the 15 per cent of the UK population estimated to be responsible for 70 per cent of all flights.\n\nAmong other aviation suggestions, the CCC said all flights should advertise their emissions in a plain manner easily understood by customers, for example as a proportion of an average annual household's output.\n\nThe report: Behaviour Change, Public Engagement And Net Zero, was authored by Dr Richard Carmichael of Imperial College London.\n\nIt said that 'high impact shifts in consumer behaviours' were needed for the UK to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, rather than the 'small and easy changes' suggested to UK households in the past.\n\nIt added policy changes were required which were 'consistent with the scale of the climate challenge, build optimism and commitment, and give weight to new ambitious narratives that inspire wide public participation.'", "description": "The Environment Secretary, 51, admitted she was in 'the BA air miles group' after the\u00a0Committee on Climate Change said that points for free flight should be outlawed.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743114-0-image-a-35_1571147156828.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
