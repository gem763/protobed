He is considered to be the leader of a criminal organisation operating in the Zawyah area in north-west Libya, about 28 miles west of Tripoli.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abd al-Rahman al-Milad.

The deal, which entailed Italy providing funds and equipment, was made by Minniti, a former communist with deep connections to Italian intelligence and the levers of the Italian state, in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants to its shores.\n\nThe agreement was recently reinforced by Italy\u2019s interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, at a meeting in Malta with his counterparts from France, Germany and Malta.\n\nAccording to Avvenire, which obtained the photos from a source present at the meeting, Bija obtained a pass to enter Italy and take part in the meeting, which was also attended by north African delegates from a handful of international humanitarian agencies. Bija was presented at the meeting as \u201ca commander of the Libyan coastguard\u201d.\n\nBija had already been recognised by a number of migrants in Cara di Mineo on the day of the meeting.\n\nAccording to the Italian newspaper\u2019s source, Bija that day asked the Italian authorities for funds to manage the reception of migrants in Libya.\n\n\u201cThere had always been suspicions about the agreement between the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government,\u201d Nello Scavo, who wrote the Avvenire story, told the Guardian. \u201cIn the past, there had already been talk of the suspected involvement of traffickers in the Libyan coastguard. But now we have the evidence. It seems really strange that Italian intelligence was not aware of Bija\u2019s identity. It is difficult to believe they were distracted.\u201d\n\nLast September, detectives in Sicily arrested three men who allegedly raped and tortured dozens of migrants in a detention centre in the north-west of Libya.\n\nProsecutors in Agrigento have collected testimonies from numerous asylum seekers from north Africa, who allegedly recognised their former captors at a migrant registration centre in Messina, Sicily.\n\nThe three alleged captors, a 27-year-old Guinean man and two Egyptians, 24 and 26, are accused of torture, kidnapping and human trafficking, operated in Zawiya detention centre, the same centre where Bija operated.\n\nIn some of the migrants\u2019 testimonies, contained in the survey documents seen by the Guardian, asylum seekers talk about a man who called himself \u201cAbdou Rahman, who was in charge of transferring migrants to the beach. It was he who, in the end, decided who could embark or not. He was a violent man and armed. We all feared him.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s development came as the Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, presented a new decree regarding asylum seekers, which he said would cut the time it took for a decision on whether a migrant should be repatriated to four months.\n\n", "description": "Abd al-Rahman Milad attended 2017 talks between intelligence officials and Libyan coastguard", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c457a529198f745dec6c399d58007c123db153/0_262_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=caeb8d2618e831b68176d53f7c73ef9b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
