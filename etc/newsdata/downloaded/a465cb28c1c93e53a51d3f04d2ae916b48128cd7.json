I love you, I do. You\u2019re mine. You are. You are mine.\u2019\n\nBut when Eve rebuffed her advances, Villanelle pulled the trigger. The last viewers saw of Eve was her lying motionless, left for dead.\n\nHowever, fans have widely speculated that this may have been a ruse and she could reappear in the next series.\n\nFilming: Eve was shot (on the ground) by Jodie's character Villanelle in the season 2 cliffhanger\n\nThinking: Sandra Oh, who plays Eve, revealed that her character doesn't die in the show\n\nAnd in an interview with NET-A-PORTER\u2019s digital title, PORTER, Sandra confirmed: 'So, obviously I didn\u2019t die.'\n\n'[The next season] is basically about where you come back after that, emotionally,' she says, giving everything and nothing away at once.'\n\nSeason three will be shown on the BBC next year. Killing Eve has become an international phenomenon, claiming BAFTAs and Emmys.", "description": "The actress, 26, looked fresh-faced as she donned a black coat over a maroon top and jeans with her blonde hair pulled back in London on Friday.", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/08/19913294-0-image-a-11_1571470861008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
