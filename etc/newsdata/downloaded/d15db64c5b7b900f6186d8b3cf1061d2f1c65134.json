Australia's AGL agrees 15-year battery power supply deal with Maoneng\n\n(Reuters) - Australia's AGL Energy Ltd (AX: ) has agreed a 15-year deal to buy battery power from Australian-Chinese Maoneng Group to ensure supply and pricing security during peak periods, the companies said on Wednesday.\n\nMaoneng will develop four large-scale batteries with a total capacity of 200MW/400MWh to be operational from 2023 to fulfil the deal.\n\nAGL will be able to call on that supply, which is enough energy to power up to 30,000 homes, for a fixed price over the 15 years.\n\nThe deal comes as Australia struggles to cope with variable wind and solar power and ageing coal-fired plants that are often overloaded during the hot summer months, leading to widespread shutdowns and price spikes for consumers.\n\n\"Australia\u2019s energy market is undergoing significant changes and large-scale batteries like these will be pivotal in providing firming capacity in the shift between baseload power and renewables,\" AGL Chief Executive Brett Redman said in a statement.", "description": "Australia's AGL agrees 15-year battery power supply deal with Maoneng", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB2J0V5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
