Some people are just learning the fate of their loved ones. CBS News correspondent Nikki Battiste heard from those who made it out.\n\n\"Glad to be alive. This is the second time in my life I should have been dead,\" said Doug, a 75-year-old man who did not want to give his last name.\n\nHe lived to tell a harrowing story of survival, after his home, a boat, was swept away, leaving him in debris-filled water. He was rescued from Abaco Island Wednesday and flown to Princess Margaret Hospital, just in time, he said, to save his legs from amputation.\n\n\"I believe in God,\" he said.\n\nAbout 13 miles from the hospital, helicopters continue to fly in survivors, like 1-year-old Reign and her mother, Ostina Dean.\n\n\"What kept me going was the child, that was it. I looked at her and I was like no, my baby's not going out like this,\" Dean said.\n\nHer entire family was rescued from Abaco Island on Thursday, including 11-year-old Zion. His young eyes witnessed far more than any child should ever have to.\n\n\"My heart just stop like it... I was panicking. I opened my eyes wide. I couldn't believe what I was seeing,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Ostina Dean said they're heading to stay with family in Nassau, but their future is still unclear. \"We made it through that so we're gonna do our best to make it through this,\" Dean said.\n\nNeed for supplies\n\nSupplies arrive in Dorian's hardest hit areas\n\nCBS News correspondent Errol Barnett was on a supply ship headed from Nassau to Freeport in the Bahamas. People lined up to buy a ticket to get on the ferry to Freeport. All around are just some of the supplies families are sending to their relatives.\n\nSupplies will sit alongside 16,000 pounds of goods sent by American Airlines for its staffers. Operations agent Darcel Radon said her family is stranded.\n\n\"It's so terrifying. It's really hard, you know,\" she said.\n\nThe journey to Freeport takes nine hours. But the captain's assistant told CBS News there have been delays because they are still trying to clean up the main port on Grand Bahama Island, so it can receive aid.", "description": "One man said he was rescued from Abaco Island and flown to the hospital, just in time to save his leg from amputation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/58e39de3-80d2-4218-a10c-1c240c9f4ca4/thumbnail/1200x630/b450a3c5b2f156ac190b743eedc3bdc2/gettyimages-1166092766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
