(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos on Tuesday announced his interest in running for representative Katie Hill\u2019s (D., Calif.) seat in the House.\n\n\u201cAnnouncement soon on my interest in Katie Hill\u2019s soon to be vacant seat in the 25th district!\u201d Papadopoulos wrote on Twitter Tuesday.\n\nHill resigned on Sunday after allegations she had an inappropriate sexual relationship with campaign and congressional staffers. The House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into the matter after the RedState blog published the allegations, along with explicit photos of Hill and the campaign staffer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m smelling blood in the water now that Katie Hill has resigned,\u201d Papadopoulos wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s 25th congressional district is wide open for the taking. Someone has to step up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill,\u201d Papadopoulos continued. \u201cAll talk, no action, and a bunch of sell outs.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos rose to fame as a result of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence probe into whether Trump received help from Russian agents to win the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDuring a 2016 meeting with Australian intelligence officials, Papadopoulos reportedly bragged that the campaign had obtained dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.\n\nIn 2017 he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators regarding his contacts with Russia, and spent twelve days in prison as a result.\n\nHill\u2019s district has tended Democratic in recent years. Clinton won the district by six percentage points in the 2016 presidential elections, while Hill defeated Republican incumbent Steve Knight by 9 percentage points in 2018.", "description": "\"California\u2019s 25th congressional district is wide open for the taking.
