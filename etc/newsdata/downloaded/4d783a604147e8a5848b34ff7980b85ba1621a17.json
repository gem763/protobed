(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nNow that House Democrats have started an inquiry into whether to impeach President Trump, is all other hope for legislation like gun control, or trade agreements or prescription drug costs dead?\n\nNot necessarily. But it will take both sides acting in good faith to get bipartisan legislation done. And that\u2019s difficult in the best of times in a divided government.\n\nTo get a sense of how precarious the working relationship is right now, on Tuesday morning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had a phone call with President Trump about gun legislation. She encouraged him to support the House\u2019s already passed background check bills, according to a source familiar with the call. Later that day, she announced her support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump. They haven\u2019t talked since.\n\nPelosi has encouraged her House caucus to at least try to work with Trump on things like a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and prescription drug costs. \u201cDemocrats will continue to advance bold legislation For The People, at the same time as we prayerfully, thoughtfully and somberly pursue the facts and defend the Constitution,\u201d she said in a letter to House Democrats on Monday, specifically citing those two issues.\n\nOn Trump's end, he's served up skepticism that Democrats want to work with him while looking at impeaching him. \u201cI don't think they can do any deals,\u201d he said this past Wednesday, the day after Pelosi embraced an inquiry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if Nancy Pelosi\u2019s going to have any time to sign it,\u201d he also said of the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada needs a vote in Congress to go into effect. He went on: \u201cShe\u2019s wasting her time on a \u2014 you know, let\u2019s use a word that they used to use a lot: a \u2018manufactured crisis.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump at the United Nations the day after Pelosi embraced an impeachment inquiry. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe thing is, Pelosi and Trump have some shared priorities. A background check bill was one of the first things the House passed after Democrats got control. After back-to-back mass shootings this summer, Trump has publicly said he wants to do something on gun safety, though he\u2019s vacillated wildly on what that might be. Republicans in Congress are waiting on him to come up with a plan to offer them the political protection they need to pass something.\n\nBut after pledging to work with Democrats on gun legislation following public mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, Trump has since pivoted to blaming the impeachment inquiry push for Republican inaction on guns.\n\n\u201cYou know, we were working on guns \u2014 gun safety,\u201d he said, unprompted, at the United Nations. \u201cThey don\u2019t even talk \u2014 all they\u2019re talking about is nonsense.\"\n\nPelosi and Trump also want to find a way to lower prescription drug costs ahead of the election. And on Tuesday, both sides took the tiniest step forward on that. Top Democratic aides and top White House and Trump administration officials met so that Democrats could brief them on a Democratic bill to try to lower drug prices. The Associated Press first reported on the meeting. It sounded like a very cautious testing of the waters for bipartisan negotiation:\n\n\u201cBoth sides stressed they were not negotiating during Tuesday\u2019s meeting at the White House, but instead were exchanging information and asking questions. Joe Grogan, a top domestic policy adviser to Trump, called it \u201c'a very cordial and productive working session.'\u201d AP\n\nIf a prescription drug bill were to move despite everything, it would be a particularly unique nexus of cooperation between Pelosi and Trump. The bill allows the federal government expansive negotiating power on drug prices, something other Republicans would prefer is left to private companies. Trump, the AP reports, has notably not criticized her bill.\n\nBut that\u2019s all very aspirational. The baseline for compromise between Pelosi and Trump right now comes from finding a way to fund the government next year.\n\nCongress couldn't come to a bipartisan agreement in time for the new fiscal year, which started Tuesday, so they passed a short-term spending bill to keep the government open close to Thanksgiving. That's right around the time some House Democrats theorize they could have drawn up articles of impeachment.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that Trump is ever-anxious to get his border wall built before he is up for reelection. The New York Times on Tuesday published a report that this March, Trump suggested shutting down the entire border and shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down. (The White House didn\u2019t deny he said this). He\u2019s asked Congress for $5 billion to help build the wall, even as he uses billions of military funds under a national emergency declaration to get it started.\n\nThis was already one of the most contentious issues between Trump and Democrats, so showdowns over the border wall are almost certainly going to be heightened by an impeachment inquiry. And we\u2019ve seen what happens when things go really badly between Trump and Pelosi: a 35-day government shut down last December into January.\n\nOne option to avoid all that drama even under the umbrella of an impeachment inquiry is to just skip having to do any negotiations. Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) told The Post\u2019s Erica Werner maybe Congress could just keep passing short-term spending bills if House Democrats and Trump can\u2019t agree on what to spend money on next year.\n\nThat would seem like a failure to compromise, since funding the government for a whole year is Congress\u2019s most basic job. But in the middle of a historic impeachment inquiry, nearing an election year where both sides have something at stake, it\u2019s possible that avoiding a government shut down all the compromise we\u2019re going to see.\n\nJM Rieger contributed to this report.", "description": "Compromise on other stuff isn't impossible, but it just got much harder.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RRLo2TjzdcKrlUd79da4lpm2XJ4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LJO5FIXAQQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg"}
