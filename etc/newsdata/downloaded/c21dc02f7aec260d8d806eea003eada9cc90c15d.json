In the dressing room you know that, you feel that and you breathe that,\u201d Mourinho said.\n\n\u201cThe difference between losing at home or not to lose at home against the biggest rival makes a huge difference.\u201d\n\nUnited took the lead through Marcus Rashford in the first half, after VAR agreed with Martin Atkinson\u2019s on-pitch decision that Victor Lindelof had not fouled Divock Origi in the build-up.\n\nHowever, Adam Lallana\u2019s late equaliser denied United a precious victory and saw Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side maintain their unbeaten start to the Premier League season.\n\n\u201cDisappointed on behalf of the players and the fans for the effort they put in,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cThey deserved more than the one point I felt, and it feels worse because it was towards the end of the game.\n\n\u201cYes, they put us under pressure towards the end but I don\u2019t think they created too many chances and we soaked the pressure up well. One lack of concentration and it\u2019s a goal. That\u2019s the level we are at.\u201d", "description": "Roy Keane claimed he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Manchester United and Liverpool\u2018s players \u201chugging and kissing\u201d in the tunnel prior to Sunday\u2019s\u00a01-1 draw at Old Trafford.", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/08/Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
