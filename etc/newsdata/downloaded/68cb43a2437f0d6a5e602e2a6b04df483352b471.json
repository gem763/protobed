Kendell Williams was competing in heptathlon. Devon Williams was in the decathlon.\n\nTrying to keep tabs on all the action were their parents, who were watching from the stands at the world championships.\n\nKendell finished fifth overall on Thursday night. Devon no-heighted in the pole vault, skipped the final two events and didn\u2019t earn a place.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome and stressful at the same time,\u201d Kendell said of sharing the stage with her older brother.\n\nAwesome because the men\u2019s and women\u2019s multi-event competitions aren\u2019t typically contested at the same time at worlds (one is usually at the end and the other at the start of the championships). Stressful because she would glance over and see her brother on the giant monitor in the stadium.\n\n\u201cI get too nervous watching him,\u201d Kendell said. \u201cIt\u2019s nerve-wracking because I want him to do so well.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get nervous watching his sister, though.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this our whole lives and we know what we\u2019re doing and what we\u2019re capable of,\u201d said Devon, who went to University of Georgia along with his sister. \u201cShe just has to go out there and compete.\u201d\n\nMom charts all their performances and Dad nervously paces.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re such track parents,\u201d Kendell said.\n\nSomeone else getting a workout was their college coach Petros Kyprianou, who went from one end to the other to keep up.\n\nRUSSIANS\u2019 LUCKY HAIR\n\nRussian athletes are rocking a lucky hairstyle at the world championships.\n\nMariya Lasitskene isn\u2019t just the three-time world champion high jumper, she\u2019s also the unofficial hair guru for Russia\u2019s team of neutral athletes.\n\nLasitskene has styled elaborate braids for her own successful bid for gold and for two teammates.\n\nHer husband Vladas Lasitskas said on Twitter that Lasitskene styled Anzhelika Sidorova, the surprise winner of the women\u2019s pole vault. She branched out into men\u2019s hair by braiding decathlete Ilya Shkurenyov before she flew back to Moscow on Wednesday. He finished fourth Thursday, narrowly missing out on bronze.\n\nBraids and plaits have a centuries-old significance in Russian culture. In the Czarist era, unmarried peasant women traditionally wore a single braid, parting it into two for marriage. Lasitskene and her two styling clients at the world championships all wore two braids.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of team solidarity among the Russians, who are competing as neutrals because their track federation remains suspended for past doping violations.\n\nMAYER\u2019S PAIN\n\nThose were angry tears from decathlon world record holder Kevin Mayer after suffering not one but two injuries.\n\nThe defending champion from France was leading after seven of 10 events Thursday despite an Achilles tendon to tender he could barely walk that morning.\n\nBut as Mayer said, \u201cwhen you have one pain, another comes,\u201d and his hamstring flared up during the pole vault. Mayer tried to carry on but couldn\u2019t jump and withdrew in tears.\n\n\u201cI knew I was stronger than last year. I knew I had little injuries, but I knew too that I didn\u2019t have to do my best to be first. And we saw it,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the injuries I was first I was first after the discus. I had to do the pole vault and after I would have won it, but that\u2019s life and I was finished.\u201d\n\nAs his focus now shifts to the Olympics in Tokyo, Mayer has not completed a full decathlon since breaking the world record last year.\n\n\u201cI prefer that happens here than at the Olympics,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "This was not your typical family get-together.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/qatar_athletics_worlds_47783_c0-1040-2978-2776_s1770x1032.jpg?4574b7964a49b7c46d73471b061d7d3d18077b7e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
