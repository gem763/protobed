Devers\u2019 hit caromed off shortstop Richie Martin\u2019s glove, causing Wilkerson to hesitate in right. Betts beat a late throw by Wilkerson to give the defending World Series champions a celebratory cap to a disappointing season.\n\nWilkerson made a late entry for catch of the year in the eighth. He chased Jackie Bradley Jr.\u2019s fly ball to the edge of the visitors\u2019 bullpen, leaped over the short wall and pulled back Bradley\u2019s would-be homer while nearly tumbling into the seats.\n\nBrandon Workman (10-1) pitched one inning and struck out three to pick up the victory. Dillion Tate (0-2) got the loss for Baltimore (54-108), which was denied its first sweep of the season.\n\nRodriguez pitched three-run ball for seven innings and was pulled with Boston leading 4-3, putting him in line for a career-high 20th win.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Hanser Alberto reached on an error by shortstop Xander Bogaerts leading off the eighth and scored the tying run when Jonathan Villar singled off Matt Barnes.\n\nBoston finished 84-78 a year after winning a franchise-record 108 games during the regular season. The Orioles made a six-game improvement from 2018.\n\nThe Red Sox are the 10th team since 2000 to win the World Series and not qualify for the postseason the following year. No team has repeated as champions since the New York Yankees won three straight titles from 1998 through 2000.\n\nWhile this season is something for the Orioles to build on, the Red Sox trudge into an offseason that promises to bring several changes.\n\nThere will be a new leader in baseball operations following the firing of Dave Dombrowski. All-Star slugger J.D. Martinez must decide whether to exercise a player option. Starter Rick Porcello is a free agent.\n\nControlling owner John Henry has also vowed to cut back after having baseball\u2019s highest payroll for two straight seasons. Boston is on track to pay a $13 million luxury tax this year on a payroll of $243 million.\n\nManager Alex Cora, who ownership said will return for a third season no matter who replaces Dombrowksi, said identifying what went wrong in 2019 isn\u2019t hard to put his finger on.\n\nCora said inconsistent pitching, inflated offensive numbers and an eight-day stretch from July 28 through Aug. 4 that saw Boston lose eight straight games - five to the Yankees and three to the Rays - will gnaw at him.\n\nBoston was eight games out of first place in the AL East before that stretch and 14 1/2 out by the end of it.\n\nThere were some flashes of last year\u2019s success at times, but that on far too many instances the consistency wasn\u2019t there offensively or defensively. The Red Sox hit more home runs and scored more runs than in 2018, but poor baserunning and injuries on the pitching staff doomed the club in close games.\n\nOn the mound, starters Chris Sale and David Price made only 25 and 22 starts, respectively, as Sale battled elbow issues and Price dealt with elbow and wrist problems.\n\nFirming up the starting rotation and bullpen are areas that ownership has also said will be addressed this summer.\n\nSOME CATCH\n\nRed Sox analyst Dennis Eckersley told reporters that Boston\u2019s eight-time Gold Glove Award-winning right fielder Dwight Evans texted him during the game to say Wilkerson\u2019s robbery was the best catch ever by a right fielder at Fenway Park.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: Cora said Sale (left elbow inflammation) will head to their spring training facility in Ft. Myers, Florida, in the next few days to begin his rehabilitation program.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOrioles: Opening Day for next season is set for March 26 against the Yankees.\n\nRed Sox: Begin 2020 regular season March 26 at Toronto, with home opener set for April 2 against the White Sox.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eduardo Rodriguez missed out on a 20-win season when Boston's bullpen blew a late lead, but the Red Sox overcame a soaring home run robbery by Stevie Wilkerson to beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-4 in the regular season finale Sunday on Mookie Betts' ninth-inning dash home.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/orioles_red_sox_baseball_07338_c0-126-3026-1890_s1770x1032.jpg?7cb931272509f1b31ff834fd56a47ab989eae23d", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
