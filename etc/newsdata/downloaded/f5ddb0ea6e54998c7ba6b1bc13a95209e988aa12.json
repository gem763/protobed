Work on that section is expected to be completed later this week, weather permitting, and the other steel supports will be placed at different locations along the pipeline.\n\n\u201cEnbridge believes that the tunnel project is the best long-term solution for Line 5 moving forward. Placing the pipeline inside a tunnel, 100 feet below the lakebed, would eliminate any span issues, and the need for supports,\u201d Duffy said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "The state of Michigan is suing Enbridge in a bid to have the underwater portion of Line 5 shut down and decommissioned", "authors": ["Nia Williams"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/line-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
