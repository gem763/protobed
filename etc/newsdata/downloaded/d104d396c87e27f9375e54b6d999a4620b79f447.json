Last week, shares of the Canadian medical marijuana grower plunged 16.36%, extending the stock\u2019s 12-month loss to over 63%.\n\nSome that tumble is attributable to Hexo (NYSE:HEXO), which slid after issuing slack revenue guidance. Hexo forecast fourth-quarter sales of $14.50 million to $16.50 million and full-year revenue to be between $46.50 million and $48.50 million. Basically, Hexo sneezed and other cannabis stocks caught colds last week.\n\nThese days, there aren\u2019t places to hide in the cannabis space. It\u2019s either hold on tight or get out. There is no in between. Last Friday, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) tumbled, dragging Aurora Cannabis stock and other rivals down with it after Jefferies downgraded Canopy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn a note, the Jefferies analysts said \u201cthat a number of negative headlines have impacted the sector in the past six months, as well as few signs of profitability. Still, they feel greater risk and volatility is priced in for many stocks,\u201d reports Connor Smith for Barron\u2019s.\n\nThe Jefferies analysts added that the next 12 months will be pivotal for the fortunes of many cannabis companies as markets continue separating the winners from the losers. The analysts bring up a point I\u2019ve frequently mentioned regarding marijuana companies: the ability to execute.\n\nSure, there are some reasons to consider holding onto Aurora Cannabis stock, despite a dubious record of execution. Investors with high risk tolerance or the extremely patient that are waiting for increased liberalization of the Canadian recreational market and other fundamental factors can hold this name.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond Canada, forecasts suggest medical and recreational markets will continue to open up worldwide, providing ample opportunity for long-term growth if these companies can ramp up their supply quickly and build compelling brands,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nACB Stock Problems Remain\n\nAt last Friday\u2019s close of $3.68, Aurora Cannabis stock is cheap in price tag only. The shares still trade at a whopping 500x forward earnings. However, the company isn\u2019t profitable, though management is trying to get there.\n\n\u201cAs a result of its focus on profitability, adjusted EBITDA losses narrowed to $12 million in the quarter, down from $37 million in the third quarter,\u201d said Morningstar. \u201cNonetheless, full-year adjusted EBITDA losses widened by $100 million versus 2018 to $156 million for the full year, reflecting higher overhead expenses to support growth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s fine and dandy, but some channel checks suggest Aurora\u2019s inventories are increasing, indicating management didn\u2019t properly forecast demand. Remember that when the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter results last month, it said revenue was up in its medical and Canadian consumer businesses, but it also said \u201cproduction volume increased 86% sequentially to 29,034 kgs.\u201d\n\nFor Aurora Cannabis stock, two of the bright spots include a 3% margin on revenue increase to 58% and, perhaps more importantly, declining production costs. In the fiscal fourth quarter, \u201ccash cost to produce per gram sold declined 20% sequentially to $1.14 per gram in Q4 2019,\u201d according to the company.\n\nBottom Line: Making Good South of the Border\n\nOne of the keys for Aurora Cannabis stock, though its more of a medium- to long-term story, is the company\u2019s ability to establish some hold in the fast-growing U.S. market. This is a reoccurring across the Canadian cannabis space and one investors must be mindful of.\n\nThe company has some presence in the U.S. via a marketing deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), but as price action in Aurora Cannabis stock suggests, investors are demanding more.", "description": "It may sound like a familiar refrain, and it is, but cannabis equities are imperiled at the moment and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock is not immune to that theme.
