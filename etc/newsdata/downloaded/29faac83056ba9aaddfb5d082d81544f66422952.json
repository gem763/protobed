Any rain we see is much needed.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Mostly cloudy, chance of patchy light rain. Highs: 72 to 77.\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy. Lows: 60 to 65.\n\nTomorrow: Partly sunny. Highs: 82 to 86.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nWe catch a break from the heat today, but it surges back into the area Tuesday and especially Wednesday and Thursday when it could set records. But by Friday and the weekend, it turns much cooler as fall finally takes control. Aside from some patchy showers today, there\u2019s little hope for rain this week.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Skies may brighten a bit late in the afternoon, with highs in the mid-70s. Winds are light from the east and southeast. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: Skies remain mostly cloudy so temperatures don\u2019t move much overnight. Lows mostly settle between 60 and 65, with very light winds from the southeast.

Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): We may have a good deal of cloud cover in the morning but should see sunshine eventually break out. It\u2019s a warm and moderately humid (dew points in the low to mid-60s) afternoon, with highs in the low to mid-80s. Winds are light from the south. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: It\u2019s a partly cloudy, warm and somewhat muggy night \u2014 not unlike what you would expect in midsummer. Lows range from the mid-60s in our cooler spots to near 70 downtown. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nWednesday and Thursday are both partly sunny, moderately humid (dew points in the mid- to upper 60s) and unseasonably hot \u2014 with the possibility of record heat. Highs range from near 90 to the mid-90s (the best chance of mid-90s is Wednesday). Lows Wednesday night and Thursday morning are very mild \u2014 only near 70 degrees. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFall leaves little doubt it has arrived on Friday and especially over the weekend. Cool breezes from the northwest lower humidity Friday, and high temperatures range through the 70s. By Saturday and Sunday, highs struggle to do much better than 70 degrees despite a good deal of sunshine. Overnight lows dip into the 40s in our cooler spots and 50s elsewhere.
