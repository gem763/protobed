Fighting one more time with this guy? I don\u2019t feel like fighting this guy one more time,'\u201d Fernandes told MMA Junkie. \u201cBut in the end, I told myself, \u2018Bibi, you have to go fight this guy one more time.\u2019 The reason is the way the last fight ended, it wasn\u2019t a good end. I don\u2019t want to end that way. I won, but not the way I wanted to win. I\u2019m very thankful that I won, but I don\u2019t like the way the result was earned.\u201d\n\nFernandes submitted Belingon in the pair\u2019s initial 2016 encounter. The second fight was Belingon take home a split-decision victory, though Fernandes still doesn\u2019t agree with the call.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about the second one, but that\u2019s OK,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cWe have two ways for it to go in there: Try to finish this guy, or sometimes the fights go to the judges. When it goes to the judges, I don\u2019t control that.\n\n\u201cI will do my best to try and finish. I will try to win the fight.\u201d\n\nThe November 2018 result was close enough that ONE officials decided to run it back four months later, though the result of that trilogy contest was no less satisfying: What was shaping up to be a good contest was halted in the third round, when Belingon elbows to the back left Fernandes unable to continue and declared the winner via disqualification.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in there with any emotion or angry, but the way he fought, I didn\u2019t agree,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cI always try to fight clean in the fight. I don\u2019t kick people in the groin. I don\u2019t elbow people in the back of he head. I don\u2019t have emotions. This is my job. The day of the fight, I will step in there, and I hope I can get I get the knockout. But I don\u2019t have any hard feelings.\n\n\u201cI know he will try to do anything he can to win the fight \u2013 like, anything. He doesn\u2019t want to lose. He has a fear of losing, and he\u2019ll do anything to avoid it.\u201d\n\nFernandes and Belingon meet at \u201cONE Championship 100: Century \u2013 Part 2,\u201d which takes place Sunday at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. It\u2019s the penultimate matchup on a full day of MMA that features two complete cards from the promotion.\n\nDespite being such familiar foes, Fernandes insists it\u2019s not grudge match.\n\n\u201cFor me, because I come from jiu-jitsu, there are guys I\u2019ve had to face seven times,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cSometimes you just have to fight the same guys over and over, but you go in there, and you do your job. But you have to control your mentality \u2013 I\u2019m good, he\u2019s good, so that means we have to compete. I\u2019ll fight him every time I have to fight.\u201d\n\nStill, there are real stakes in the matchup, both personal and professional, and \u201cThe Flash\u201d knows there\u2019s only one way to ensure there\u2019s no controversy this time out.\n\n\u201cFor me, I want to go out there and win by knockout or by finish,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d", "description": "Bibiano Fernandes and Kevin Belingon have spent more than 40 minutes together inside a cage, but \"The Flash\" insists it's not personal.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/bibiano-fernandes-kevin-belingon-one-championship-92-5.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
