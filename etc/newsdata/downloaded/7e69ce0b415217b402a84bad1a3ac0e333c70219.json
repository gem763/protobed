I was bloated from steroids and carb cravings, bald from chemo and boobless from surgery.\n\nI was heartbroken when I saw myself getting out of the shower\u2026who the bloody hell was that looking back at me?\n\nPeople would sometimes say (with the best of intentions), \u201cbut at least you\u2019re still here Ro\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d feel almost guilty for feeling sorry for myself sometimes.\n\nI\u2019d considered trying out the cold cap but I was told it would probably still fall out anyway and my younger brother had tried it for his Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma years ago.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nHe\u2019d told me it felt like eating 10 ice-creams at once. So I just thought, sod it, whip the hair off.\n\nOne of my friends who was a hairdresser whopped it off in a pub filled with family and friends and it was actually a really bloody lovely night- emotional but lovely.\n\nWe raised money for CRUK and donated my hair to The little Princess Trust who make real hair wigs for children affected by cancer.\n\nIt felt good to do something good out of something so utterly shit.\n\nOne of the good things about hair loss is literally NO HAIR. Not good for dry eyes and drippy nostrils but amazing for legs, arms and undies. I was so bloody smooth.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nEventually, my hair started to grow back, I was like a dandelion.\n\nMy little babe, Ivy and me competed for who\u2019s hair could grow the quickest - she won.\n\nI was so protective over my precious hair, winced when the hairdresser trimmed it but in the end, I just wanted to try every style I could as it grew out.\n\nAdmittedly, it was burned by bleach and colour but eventually, I almost had a bob.\n\nWoooohooo, I love the feeling of my hair blowing in the wind and it felt amazing.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nThen came the recurrence and I knew I had to do it all again.\n\nI felt so sad that Ivy was three this time and she\u2019d see the difference in mummy.\n\nWe explained that I had a naughty lump and I had to take some medicine which would make my hair fall out to get rid of it.\n\nWe asked if she\u2019d like to cut it off for me and she did. Our little dreamboat.\n\nI mastered the turban this time and found an absolutely brilliant wig and in all honesty, it wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nI think the worst part for me is growing it through all the awkward stages again - the dandelion, the mullet, the Worzel.\n\nThis time, I\u2019m taking super precious care of my hair. I\u2019ve not had any colour on it yet - and I\u2019m amazingly not grey.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the super whoop ass Dyson hairdryer and OMG, I love it.\n\nIt is pricey - but there\u2019s lots of different attachments on it - one for a sensitive scalp. yay.\n\nIt also dries mine and Ivy\u2019s hair faster than lightning. I love it.\n\nMy advice for people growing their hair back is - shave it twice when your fluff starts to appear.\n\nI know, I know, it\u2019s precious hair but it grows back so much thicker and shinier.\n\nThere are so many lovely wigs and headscarves out there now.
