The Astros lost at least 100 games in three straight seasons from 2011-13.\n\nThe Astros (100-53) have a one-game lead on the New York Yankees, who lost 3-2 to the Los Angeles Angels, for the best record in the majors. Houston can clinch the AL West as early as Friday with a win and loss by Oakland.\n\n\u201cIf you like winning, 100 three years in a row is a lot,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said. \u201cI love it for this team and for this organization. It\u2019s a big accomplishment. It\u2019s one step along the way for us and what we\u2019re trying to accomplish this season. I don\u2019t want that to be the high note by any means.\u201d\n\nCole (18-5) allowed two runs on six hits in earning his 14th straight win. He hasn\u2019t lost since May 22 against the White Sox, a span of 20 starts. Cole struck out 10 or more for the seventh straight start, tying the club record set earlier this season by Justin Verlander.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s incredible,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019s a special player; he\u2019s a special person. It was a big night for him. That\u2019s a big accomplishment. He did it in a win. . He\u2019s been a workhorse for us the entire year. These performances that he just rattles off is not easy. He makes it look a lot easier than it is.\u201d\n\nCole, the major league leader in strikeouts, became the third Astros pitcher to reach 300 strikeouts in a season, joining J.R. Richard, who had 313 in 1979 and 303 in 1978, and Mike Scott, who struck out 306 in 1986.\n\nCole struck out Shin-Soo Choo to end the sixth for his 300th of the season. After the strikeout, Cole leapt off the mound and was given a standing ovation as he walked to the dugout. Cole waved to the crowd with his glove hand and touched his chest with his throwing hand.\n\n\u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t know that was the one,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThen, it became pretty obvious, and I just wanted to spend a minute with the fans and thank them for the ovation and all the support.\u201d\n\nRoberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 35th save.\n\nGurriel gave the Astros a 2-0 lead in the fifth with a two-run homer to left. Altuve hit a solo home run to lead off the seventh make the lead 3-1.\n\nWillie Calhoun scored on a throwing error by Mart\u00edn Maldonado in the seventh to cut the lead to a run. Ronald Guzm\u00e1n cut the lead to 3-2 with a solo home run in the eighth.\n\nKolby Allard (4-1) allowed two runs on four hits with four walks and two strikeouts in five innings.\n\n\u201cI think there were a few times when I pitched myself out of jams and made some pitches when I had to,\u201d Allard said. \u201cI thought there were a few times where I was trying to be a little too cute or nibble a little bit, and that\u2019s where I was falling behind.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers have lost five straight.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRangers: OF Joey Gallo (wrist surgery) is uncertain to return to the Rangers by the end of the week and might not return this season, manager Chris Woodward said. Gallo has been working out and playing in games at the Rangers instructional league in Arizona, but has been experiencing soreness.\n\nAstros: RHP Ryan Pressly (knee) could return as soon as this weekend, manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nTUCKER\u2019S GREAT PLAYS\n\nKyle Tucker robbed Scott Heineman of a home run in the third, reaching over the right field wall and bringing it back to lead off the inning. Tucker made a great throw to get Willie Calhoun out at second in the fourth. Calhoun was initially called safe, but after Houston challenged, the call was overturned.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers: LHP Mike Minor (13-9, 3.33 ERA) starts a three-game series in Oakland against the Athletics on Friday. Minor was tagged for seven runs in his last start on Saturday against the Athletics.\n\nAstros: After a day off on Thursday, RHP Zack Greinke (16-5, 2.95) starts the opener of a three-game series against the Angels on Friday. Greinke is 6-1 since being traded to Houston at the deadline.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gerrit Cole wanted to get his milestone strikeout at home, and accomplished the feat in an important win for the Houston Astros.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/rangers_astros_baseball_57837_c0-220-4316-2736_s1770x1032.jpg?4413fab8251e68d42822455c5220508a3c5e302e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
