The attacks were carried out while the victims were asleep.\n\nA fifth person was hospitalized with critical injuries, according to the New York Times, quoting NYPD spokesman Lt. Thomas Antonetti.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Saturday morning, Deputy Chief Inspector Michael Baldassano said a 24-year-old male \u201cperson of interest,\u201d who is also homeless, is in custody. He said the attacks appeared to be \u201crandom\u201d rather than motivated by race or age.\n\nThe police have not yet released the names of the victims, or the suspect, who the New York Post reports had 14 past arrests, including an assault charge from earlier this year.\n\nThe attacker, who was wearing black pants and a black jacket, was apprehended with a metal pipe suspected to be the weapon used in the attacks.\n\nBaldassano asked the public to call in if they had seen a man fitting this description in the days before the deadly attacks, or if anyone had witnessed similar attacks on homeless people in recent weeks.\n\nThe first deadly attack took place around 1:40 a.m. in Manhattan's Chinatown after first responders were called to a scene with a victim with \u201csevere trauma to the head.\u201d\n\nPolice were then called to a scene on the Lower East Side for a victim with a similar head injury, and found two additional victims down the block and a third victim across the street. One of those men survived his assault but is in critical condition at New York-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital.\n\nThis story is developing.", "description": "A fifth victim was hospitalized in critical condition after the alleged 24-year-old assailant attacked the homeless men in New York City\u2019s Chinatown district.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570274255/RTR34QV3_ahxwfs", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
