The monsoon normally begins in June and ends by September, but its delayed retreat this year has sparked floods that have killed more than 100 people. Collapsed homes and drowning were responsible for many deaths. Sixteen districts in Bihar and 14 in Uttar Pradesh were affected. Thousands of people in flood-hit regions were evacuated by the disaster relief authority.\n\nIn Patna, Bihar\u2019s capital, heavy rains over three days caused severe waterlogging and brought activities to a halt. Residents were marooned on top floors of their homes as water and electricity supplies were hit. Six teams of the national disaster relief force were deployed in the city along with two air force helicopters. Four heavy pumps were flown in to help relieve flooding, as the administration stepped up rescue and relief efforts. Among those rescued in inflatable rubber boats were the state\u2019s deputy chief minister, Sushil Modi, and his family.\n\n\n\nHouses are inundated with floodwaters in Prayagraj, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019.
