Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard.\n\nFriday's ruling comes in a lawsuit filed days after Trump took office in January 2017. The plaintiffs included a New York hotel owner, an events booker in Washington and a restaurant trade group that allege lost patronage, wages and commissions from clients who now prefer Trump's businesses over theirs because of the ability to gain the president's favor.\n\nThe plaintiffs cite examples of foreign government entities, including the Embassy of Kuwait and a delegation from Malaysia, choosing Trump's properties, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington, over other venues.\n\nThe Justice Department had urged the appeals court to bury what it called a \"manufactured lawsuit\" because the plaintiffs cannot show that the harms they incurred can be traced to Trump's financial interest in his businesses rather than other reasons.\n\nTrump also faces a similar case brought by a group of more than 200 Democratic Party lawmakers.\n\nA third \"emoluments\" case, brought by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, was tossed by an appeals court in July.
