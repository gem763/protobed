They were followed by Aly Goni-Natasa Stankovic. In the end, Prince-Yuvika and Anita-Rohit were on stage for the final announcement. Given their journey on Nach Baliye 9, it was surprising when Prince and Yuvika were announced as the winner. However, it\u2019s a voting reality show and fans\u2019 love definitely makes a difference.\u201d\n\nIt's destiny that Prince Narula and Yuvika Chaudhary's journey as friends also began on a popular reality show. They appeared together on the 9th season of Bigg boss and Prince had instantly fallen in love with Yuvika but she took time to make up her mind.\n\nCo-produced by Salman Khan, the show had A-lister judges including Raveena Tandon and Ahmed Khan. The show was hosted by Maniesh Paul and Waluscha De Sousa. The show received a lukewarm response from fans. The grand finale episode was shot on Tuesday and will be aired this weekend.", "description": "Defeating their fellow contestants, Popular television couple Prince Narula and Yuvika Chaudhary have won Nach Baliye 9.
