The payment plan was drafted with Cogta's assistance and is deemed affordable by the department given the municipality's financial obligations.\n\n\"It was absolutely crucial that the power supply to Newcastle should remain uninterrupted as the opposite would have been devastating for the local economy and prospects for future investment. We also believe that the judgment, which forces Newcastle to pay up, is good for the municipality because it imposes a degree of financial responsibility,\" said Hlomuka.", "description": "The power supply for embattled Newcastle Municipality will stay on for now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9341/cb6724953cda48f193dc50201e875b61.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
