You know, we learned last night that President Trump wanted to dig a ditch at the border and put an alligator in the ditch, shoot migrants in the leg.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThe depths of the cruelty and the inhumanity towards migrants, towards people of color, LGBT community, women is not the America that I want my kids or Abby\u2019s kids or kind of any of our kids and grandkids to grow up in. I will do everything I can to ensure that is not the America that they grow up in.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of ABC's \"The View\" Chelsea Clinton described President Donald Trump as some whose \"whole life has been a scam.\" | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/SafariScreenSnapz004-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
