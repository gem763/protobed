They\u2019re also notable for their design. These are two conventionally styled sedans that largely keep their eco-credentials hidden from view.\n\nEven better, both come well-equipped at a starting price of around $24,000. Edmunds compares the Insight and the Corolla Hybrid to find out which one is the superior fuel sipper.\n\nFAMILIAR UNDERPINNINGS\n\nToyota has redesigned its Corolla sedan for model year 2020. Compared to the old Corolla, it features an improved interior and more refined driving characteristics. The hybrid version uses the same powertrain as the Toyota Prius, which is why it achieves similar fuel economy.\n\nAs for the Insight, a more appropriate name would be \u201cHonda Civic Hybrid.\u201d The Insight is essentially a high-tech Civic sedan. It shares the same underlying structure but is modified to accommodate an electric motor and battery.\n\nBoth the Corolla and the Insight seat five and have approximately the same exterior size and weight. And unlike some hybrid sedans that have space-reducing trunk-mounted hybrid batteries, each model has its battery pack located underneath its rear seat.\n\nFUEL ECONOMY\n\nFortunately, fuel economy doesn\u2019t need to be part of your comparison shopping. The Insight and the Corolla share the same 52 mpg combined EPA fuel economy rating at their base prices. In our testing, both vehicles easily matched, and sometimes exceeded, their ratings.\n\nOne wrinkle is the Insight\u2019s fully loaded Touring trim level, whose additional weight reduces combined fuel economy to 48 mpg. While getting less than 50 mpg may seem like a big deal, a 4-mpg difference at this level is negligible. The difference in annual fuel cost is only about $50, according to the EPA.\n\nSUBTLE INTERIOR DIFFERENCES\n\nWhile the basic designs of the Corolla Hybrid and the Insight are the same, you will notice some comparative differences. The Insight offers a larger trunk and a more spacious interior. It also makes smarter use of its additional space with a deep and configurable center console. We also like the Insight\u2019s cellphone cubby, which is big enough to hold plus-sized devices with larger cases.\n\nThe Corolla\u2019s interior layout is adequate. It offers the pockets and cubbies you\u2019d expect along with space for a phone under the dash, but the overall functionality isn\u2019t as clever as in the Insight\u2019s.\n\nTHE DRIVING EXPERIENCE\n\nWhile neither car is particularly quick, the Corolla is less powerful and nearly 2 seconds slower to 60 mph in our testing. That\u2019s a difference you\u2019ll feel when you need a burst of speed to enter a highway or merge into traffic.\n\nBecause the transmission in each car lacks traditional gears, their engines tend to hang on to a fixed rpm speed while the car accelerates. The audible experience is a little bit like listening to a motorboat, with a fair amount of noise during acceleration. At least you don\u2019t have to listen as long in the quicker Insight.\n\nThe Corolla has another annoyance when it comes to the braking. Hybrid vehicles can use their electric motors to slow down and recharge their batteries in a process called regenerative braking. In the Corolla, the handoff between regenerative and the traditional brakes makes the pedal\u2019s responsiveness hard to predict, especially at low speeds. Smoothly coming to a stop in a parking lot can be difficult for the driver and annoying to passengers.\n\nOPTIONS AND FEATURES\n\nEach model starts at around $24,000 and comes with extensive active safety features, including adaptive cruise control, forward collision mitigation and lane keeping assist. At this base price, the Corolla Hybrid offers a few features the Honda doesn\u2019t have, most notably support for Apple CarPlay smartphone integration.\n\nHowever, Toyota offers the Corolla in just one trim level, the LE. In contrast, Honda offers the Insight in three trim levels. These additional trims provide shoppers the option to get more comfort and technology features.\n\nCompared to the Corolla Hybrid LE, an equivalently outfitted Insight EX costs $1,210 more. Yet it also comes with a few more features that aren\u2019t available in the Corolla such as Android Auto smartphone integration and blind-spot monitoring. Go for the top Insight Touring and you\u2019ll enjoy even more exclusive features such as a sunroof, leather upholstery, heated seats and a premium sound system.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: The Corolla is a compelling hybrid thanks to its array of standard features at an affordable price. While an equivalently optioned Insight costs slightly more, it delivers a more functional interior, a stronger array of features, and a superior overall driving experience, making it worth the difference.\n\n___\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.
