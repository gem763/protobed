Online videos and news reporting show the police severely beating nonresisting protesters, making arbitrary arrests and attacking innocent passersby, firing rubber bullets at point blank distance and in one instance, allegedly standing by while pro-Beijing gang members wantonly attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station.\n\nThe youngsters on the front lines, clad in black and wearing gas or face masks, cannot match the police\u2019s weapons or lethal power, so they have responded by actively engaging in arson, vandalism, road blockades, brick and petrol-bomb throwing and destruction of public property. Their resistance is not sporadic, but systematic and organized.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 trashing of Hong Kong\u2019s metro stations has now become routine. About half of the city\u2019s 91 stations have been damaged. On Oct. 1 alone, China\u2019s National Day, 20 stations were subject to vandalism and arson. The entrances of prominent stations such as Central and Wanchai (think Times Square and Grand Central) were set aflame.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ying Ma", "Nbcnews.Com Think Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
