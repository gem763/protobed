This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. Reticulated giraffes themselves number fewer than 16,000 individuals. Scientists are now undertaking major studies to better understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done to stop it.

We are going to very loudly, very clearly, very respectfully say that if a government is taking its people towards extinction, it is not a government anymore that we respect.\u201d\n\nAnother spokesman, 21-year-old Robin Boardman, said the upcoming round of protests could be five times bigger than that which brought major disruption to London in April and saw more than 1,100 arrests. As many as 30,000 people could be involved this time, he claimed.\n\nMajor events are also planned around the world in Australia, in Europe \u2013 in Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam \u2013 and in the US in New York and Washington DC. The global action follows similar worldwide demonstrations by children \u201con strike\u201d from school on Fridays, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is calling on the government declare a climate and ecological emergency, act immediately to halt wildlife loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. They also want a citizens\u2019 assembly on climate and ecological justice to lead government policy.\n\nEarlier in the year, Parliament declared a climate and environment emergency and the government has passed a law to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\nMr Boardman said: \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at a disastrous situation which demands so much radical action. It doesn\u2019t demand the piecemeal action we\u2019re currently seeing across the world.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Extinction Rebellion plans to bring roads around Westminster to a standstill with tens of thousands of protesters, and stage a sit-in at City Airport in London as part of environmental demonstrations\u00a0in the next fortnight.
