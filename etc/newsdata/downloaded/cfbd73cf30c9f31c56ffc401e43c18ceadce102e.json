And lives could have been saved.\n\nBut the local organ collection agency said no. It gave no reason, no explanation to his family, though the Connecticut man appeared to be a well-qualified donor despite advancing age: He died in a hospital, on a ventilator, previously healthy until a car crash that led to a stroke.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating to be told there was nothing they considered worthy of donation. Nada. Not a kidney, not a liver, not tissue,\u201d recalled Henry\u2019s daughter, Donna Cryer, president of the nonprofit Global Liver Institute and herself a recipient of a liver transplant.\n\nHenry\u2019s case illustrates troubling uncertainty in a transplant system run by government contractors that are under fire for letting potentially usable organs go to waste.\n\nThe Associated Press took a close look at that system and calculated that some of those agencies are securing deceased donors at half the rate of others - even as 113,000 people linger on the nation\u2019s transplant waiting list, and about 20 die each day.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is broken. We know it is costing people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Seth Karp, Vanderbilt University\u2019s transplant chief.\n\nUnder U.S. transplant rules, the country is divided into 58 zones, each assigned an \u201corgan procurement organization\u201d in charge of donation at death. Those OPOs are matchmakers with a tough job: get donation consent , collect organs quickly and get them to the right transplant center before they deteriorate, even if a hospital calls with a possible donor at 3 a.m.\n\nHow well are they doing? It\u2019s almost impossible to tell. OPOs self-report to the government a subjective measure, one even they call flawed. That standard offers little way to directly compare OPOs and learn which could do better, or to hold poor performers accountable for missed opportunities.\n\n\u201cNobody comes behind them and says, \u2018You actually could have recovered 20 to 30% more and you didn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Kevin Longino, a kidney transplant recipient who heads the National Kidney Foundation.\n\nThat may be about to change. The Trump administration is planning a major overhaul , stricter standards to make it easier to compare OPOs and push them to improve. One measure under consideration: Using federal death records to determine the entire pool of potential donors each OPO can draw from.\n\nA study published this summer in the American Journal of Transplantation called that approach more fair and verifiable than today\u2019s standard. The AP modeled its own analysis of OPO performance on that research, and found that in 2017, even comparing regions with similar pools of acceptable donors, disparities were large. Philadelphia outperformed New York City, for example. The OPO serving parts of Kentucky lagged nearby Missouri.\n\nMore important, the analysis shows the biggest impact would be in places with large populations of potential donors. For example, OneLegacy in Los Angeles recovered 487 donors in 2017, second only to Philadelphia\u2019s Gift of Life. However, the Los Angeles OPO also had the highest number of potential donors. If OneLegacy had matched Gift of LIfe\u2019s higher donor rate, the AP calculated it would have secured 866 donors, instead.\n\nOneLegacy CEO Tom Mone cautions that measure overestimates potential donors, including people who are disqualified after scrutinizing their medical records.\n\nIt also counts less-than-perfect donors - older donors, or those with certain medical conditions - that can be hard for OPOs to handle, Mone added. Those organs can be life-saving for the right patient but too often transplant centers won\u2019t take the chance, a disincentive for OPOs to collect them.\n\nStill, with the organ shortage so severe that transplant centers are fighting over scarce livers in court, a growing number of OPOs say the death record-based standard will spur more aggressive pursuit of donors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a denominator that can\u2019t be manipulated,\u201d said Ginny McBride, executive director of OurLegacy in east-central Florida. She was one of 17 OPO leaders who recently wrote Medicare, which regulates the nonprofits and reimburses costs of organ acquisition, to push the change.\n\n\u201cIt might tell us, \u2018Hey, we need to kick it up a notch.\u2019 And it might tell the government who they should and shouldn\u2019t be certifying\u201d to collect organs, she added.\n\nWHO CAN DONATE?\n\nOnly about 2 percent of Americans die in circumstances that allow for donation. Die before reaching a hospital, and organs can\u2019t be preserved. Illnesses such as cancer or infections also can rule out donation.\n\nWhile young donors tend to be healthier, there\u2019s no upper age limit: Studies show healthy organs from seniors like Henry, who was 78, and even octogenarians still can work well, especially if given to an older recipient.\n\nLast year, out of about 2.8 million deaths, there were 10,721 deceased donors. Their organs led to 29,680 transplants.\n\nBut a 2017 study led by University of Pennsylvania researchers examined deaths, donations and health records and calculated that a better-functioning system could produce up to 28,000 more donated organs a year.\n\nObjectively evaluating OPOs is one key to that goal but even if the estimate is too high, \u201cevery single donation we recover is another life saved and makes it worth it,\u201d said Greg Segal of the transplant advocacy group Organize, whose father waited five years for a heart transplant.\n\nSPURRING CHANGE\n\nThe recent spike in drug overdose deaths has increased donors. Some OPOs are aggressively looking for additional boosts.\n\nLifeCenter Northwest - which serves Washington state, Alaska, Montana and northern Idaho - has doubled the number of organs transplanted from area donors to 878 last year, up from 440 in 2009, before CEO Kevin O\u2019Connor arrived.\n\nIt focuses on organs often considered too difficult to recover - not those taken from brain-dead donors, which are most common, but from people who die when their heart stops beating. O\u2019Connor staged \u201cmock donations\u201d to train donor hospitals and his own employees to handle those complex cases. Nationally, they make up about 19% of donations; at LifeCenter, they\u2019re 29%.\n\nAt LifeGift in Houston, where donors are up about 40 percent since 2013, CEO Kevin Myer has hired dozens of new employees to reach far-flung hospitals faster. Increasing donation \u201ccomes down to how good your staff are and how many people you have to get to the hospitals and take care of people who are losing somebody,\u201d Myer said.\n\nAnd in Hawaii, where lung transplants aren\u2019t offered so donor lungs often go unrecovered, Legacy of Life is testing a new incubator to preserve the organs for shipping long distances. The first pair was successfully transplanted in North Carolina more than 20 hours after donation.\n\nHOW TO MEASURE SUCCESS\n\nToday, OPOs report to Medicare how many deaths they classify \u201celigible\u201d for donation, the baseline. That\u2019s supposed to include hospital referrals of brain-dead patients 75 and younger without disqualifying diseases. Comparing that denominator with the OPO\u2019s actual donors measures its success.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always stunned at the variability\u201d in how many eligible deaths OPOs of similar sizes report, said Diane Brockmeier, director of Mid-America Transplant Services in St. Louis, who supports the death record-based standard.\n\nBut different OPOs can define eligibility differently. There are disincentives to pursuing every organ.\n\nAnd sometimes there are breakdowns. Dr. Dorry Segev, a Johns Hopkins University transplant surgeon, described \u201ca very depressing and disappointing case\u201d where several patients were promised a young donor\u2019s organs only to have the offers rescinded a few hours later. The OPO, in another state, couldn\u2019t find a local surgeon to recover the organs - and didn\u2019t give the recipients\u2019 surgeons a chance to fly in and do it themselves.\n\nThen there\u2019s the role of transplant centers, which are graded on how well their patients recover after surgery without taking into account how many die on the waiting list. When local transplant centers refuse less-than-perfect organs, OPOs can be reluctant to collect them because they may not find a recipient elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe metrics are driving the wrong behaviors,\u201d said the kidney foundation\u2019s Longino, who says transplant centers must be held accountable, too. \u201cIf 60-year-olds are not being given a 60-year-old kidney that\u2019s in good working order, not being given that choice, that\u2019s a problem. And they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nA recent study suggests U.S. transplant centers are too picky. Surgeons in France regularly implant lower-quality kidneys from older donors than their American counterparts, with success. Medicare recently took a small step to counter transplant center reluctance.\n\nOn the donation side, many OPOs and patient groups see value in reform that bases OPO success on the largest possible pool of donors, an easy-to-track number.\n\nBut some OPO leaders are lobbying for a different measure, one whittled down to just people on ventilators. Some Midwestern OPOs are testing that approach.\n\n\u201cWe are troubled by some of these broad-based, easy-to-calculate numbers not portraying a picture of what potential donation might be,\u201d said Susan Gunderson, CEO of LifeSource Upper Midwest OPO in Minneapolis.\n\nPATIENTS LANGUISH ON THE WAITING LIST\n\nMore donors can\u2019t come quickly enough for waiting patients, especially those caught in a legal battle over how to distribute scarce livers. For nine days earlier this year, a new national policy meant hospitals that once got first dibs for livers donated nearby instead saw the organs shipped to sicker patients up to 500 miles away, with pediatric donations earmarked for sick children. Then a federal judge put the new rules on hold .\n\nIn Pennsylvania, toddler Evelyn Yargar got a new liver during that window, from a teen who died several states away. A few days later and the organ might have gone to an adult instead. And because University of Pittsburgh surgeons knew 14-month-old Evelyn needed just a small piece of that liver, which can grow into a fully functioning organ, an adult in still another state got the rest.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why a child can\u2019t have a part of any donor\u2019s liver,\u201d said Evelyn\u2019s mother, Bobbi Yargar of Charleroi, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever the court fight turns out, only a bigger supply will ease struggles over organ distribution. And if Medicare changes performance standards, that won\u2019t make OPOs collect more organs overnight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another 30,000 organs out there lying around to get transplanted,\u201d cautioned Brockmeier, the Mid-America chief. Still, she knows her own OPO could improve, and she called on others to \u201cstop battling over what the metric is and decide what we\u2019re going to do to maximize donation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP\u2019s analysis used a mortality database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to calculate deaths involving hospital in-patients under 75 from causes consistent with donation for every OPO except Puerto Rico\u2019s. Dividing the actual number of donors by those counts yields a comparable success rate.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
