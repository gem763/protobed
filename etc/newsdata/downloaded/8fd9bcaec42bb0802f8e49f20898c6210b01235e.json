Laudato S\u00ec is not a green encyclical; it is a social encyclical, which is based on a \u2018green\u2019 reality, the custody of Creation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Amazon, Francis said, is a \u201crepresentative and decisive place,\u201d which explains why it was chosen for this year\u2019s synod.\n\n\u201cTogether with the oceans, it contributes decisively to the survival of the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of the oxygen we breathe comes from there. That is why deforestation means killing humanity.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome.", "description": "Indigenous leaders of the Amazon offered up prayers for the Earth in the Vatican gardens on Friday with Pope Francis.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
