Gyude Moore, a former Liberian minister of public works now at the Center for Global Development, tells Axios that few African leaders will have worried much about U.S. reaction to their presence in Sochi.\n\n\u201cThat is simply a reflection of the decline of American influence on the continent,\u201d he says.\n\nFor a number of African countries, he adds, America has already been surpassed by China as the most important external player.\n\nAs for Russia, while they \u201cdon\u2019t have the checkbook of China or the United States,\u201d he says, \u201cthey have specific competencies a number of African countries need.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Mali, you\u2019re dealing with insurgencies in your country. And seeing what Russia has done in Syria, maybe it makes sense to have a relationship with Russia on that front.\"\n\n\"If you are Rwanda, if you are South Africa, you have significant problems with power. Russia is selling nuclear power.\"\n\n\"If you\u2019re Egypt, the price of bread and cereals is a national security issue. Well, 27% of Russia\u2019s exports to Egypt are cereals.\u201d\n\nRussia is also willing to provide diplomatic support, and even mercenaries, to regimes treated as pariahs by other powers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really, really savvy at positioning themselves as not the U.S., not the EU \u2014 as treating you as equals, responding to your needs as they are and not imposing their own ideas of what your country should do.\"\n\n\u2014 W. Gyude Moore\n\nThe flipside: Russia simply doesn't have the economic might to match the investments and trade coming from China, the U.S., \"and even many lesser powers,\" Stronski writes.\n\n\"It's deepest inroads are in highly troubled countries, such as the Central African Republic, or pariah states such as Sudan and Zimbabwe that are often under UN sanctions.\"\n\n\"Limited resources and risk appetite have left Russia falling back on tools like sending Kremlin-connected mercenaries to conflict zones or offering consulting services to autocratic regimes on election manipulation.\"\n\nHowever, the summit shows African countries clearly think the benefits of engaging with Russia outweigh the costs.\n\nIt's one thing to write about and debate these issues from Washington, Moore says. But when you're in office, \"you have to deliver.\"\n\n\"Usually, wherever you can get resources to be able to deliver, that's what you do.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Moore says that's part of why America's declining influence in Africa is so \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"American involvement comes with American values: protection of minorities, freedom of speech, open societies, free trade. And so when the U.S. engages with a country, those are the terms on which it engages.\"\n\nThe bottom line: \"Russia is not going to advocate for those. Neither will China.\u201d", "description": "Russia is already Africa\u2019s top arms supplier and is deepening relationships in mining and security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/YwFKyvJgRT3-NY3d-HfLUCoekC4=/0x0:4782x2690/1920x1080/2019/10/24/1571959528403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
