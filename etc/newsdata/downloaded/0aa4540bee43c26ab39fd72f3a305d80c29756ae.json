Not only has he cooked for Fabio Trabocchi at Fiola and Fiola Mare, he knows Bajaj well, having worked for him earlier at the Oval Room near the White House. Modena, says Melfi, is a chance to start from scratch and \u201cmake a splash.\u201d\n\nSplashes \u2014 of flavor and color \u2014 are everywhere in the new dining room, reconsidered in a blue palette and featuring an antipasti cart up front.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImported from Italy, the walnut trolley displays more than a half-dozen salads and other snacks, offered as three, five or seven tastes for $15, $18 and $21, respectively. Everything I\u2019ve sampled (beets bolstered with Gorgonzola and walnuts, artichokes tossed with tomatoes and garlic) has been worth repeating, but the standouts are the silken roasted peppers, brilliant with lemon and basil, and the sheep\u2019s milk ricotta tart featuring a changing vegetable (spinach on my visit) and a dusting of pecorino that looks like fresh snow.\n\nFalls Church is lining up for Thompson Italian. You should, too.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to keep ordering from the cart \u2014 unfortunately stationary when it\u2019s busy \u2014 and make a meal from the spread alone. Forge on. Among the stellar first courses is a stuffed squid, which Melfi says he learned to make from his late grandmother in Upstate New York. His version slips spicy, finely ground sausage into the tender body, arranged in a bowl with crisp fried tentacles, meaty periwinkles (sea snails) and dots of avocado puree. The creamy green accent underscores the chef\u2019s approach: Italian-leaning, but not beholden to any region \u2014 or even the borders of Italy, for that matter.\n\nFirst among equals amid the pastas is the agnolotti. Pierce the delicate noodles with fork or teeth and the prize is a warm rivulet of pureed corn, butter and fresh thyme: a rush of summer that lingers on the tongue. Diners ask Melfi if there\u2019s meat hidden in the dish. What they\u2019re tasting, he says, is \u201cthe essence\u201d of sopressata, from an oil he infuses with fennel seeds, garlic and other enhancers. The flesh-free trick makes for heady eating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are a lot of exceptional lamb dishes playing around the city right now. (Fans, get thee to Bresca for the lamb shoulder, glazed with beet and black garlic molasses, stat.) Melfi\u2019s contribution is lamb loin that benefits from a days-long sit in black garlic, olive oil, cumin and fennel. Add to the finished dish some caramelized cipollini onions and fairy tale eggplant and what\u2019s to stop the applause?\n\nOh, the bread could be a better and the gianduja mousse could taste more of chocolate, but those are minor quibbles in the face of so much diverting food.\n\nUnder Melfi, there\u2019s no missing what came before Modena. Instead, there\u2019s only anticipation: How soon can I come back for more?\n\n1100 New York Ave. NW 202-216-9550. modenadc.com.
