This weekend was a reminder of just how crucial the region remains.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s forced shutdown of over half of its crude production, some 5% of world supply, should be short but shocking. Energy traders had become complacent about geopolitical risk in part because massive shale plays, particularly the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, have driven growth in world oil production.\n\nThe region pumps some 4.4 million barrels of oil a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Growth over the past 10 years has helped make the U.S. a significant exporter of petroleum products. Since the 2014 collapse in oil prices at the tail end of an earlier boom in shale output, which was later surpassed in volume, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with nonmember Russia, have struggled to support prices and to adapt to the shale era.\n\nReinforcing the impression that traditional oil producing heavyweights were no longer as important is shale\u2019s nimbleness. Part of what supported prices after the 2014 price collapse was a reversal in U.S. output by the middle of 2015. Unlike voluntary cutbacks from OPEC producers, this reflected hundreds of individual, commercially-driven decisions by drillers. Shale\u2019s short drilling cycle meant that a pullback in investment soon translated into a drop in output.\n\nThe flip side of that has seen a surge in output to record levels since prices recovered, much to OPEC\u2019s frustration. This feeds the impression that shale can save the day. But Saturday\u2019s attack should serve as a reminder that this isn\u2019t the case.\n\nShale simply can\u2019t respond to an attack on the artery of the world oil market. It can\u2019t even make much money these days. Drillers have been under pressure from shareholders to bolster returns and cut back investment. Permian-focused companies like Pioneer Natural Resources are doing just that. Investment has showed signs of slowing\u2014active U.S. rigs hit a 17-month low in July. The most recent reading from Baker Hughes shows the number of drilling rigs down 16% from last year.\n\nPrices would have to remain high for a long time as a result of the attack to spur a rebound. Yet the orders of magnitude are instructive: Shale can make up for a slow decline in output from, say, once major producer Venezuela, but even a million incremental daily barrels a year from now makes little difference compared with five million barrels lost overnight.\n\nAnd such projections ignore reality on the ground. Even if more rigs were to come online quickly, the region continues to be hampered by infrastructure bottlenecks. Fracking shale wells requires massive amounts of sand and water and procuring and moving it is expensive. Shipping the oil out and capturing the associated natural gas is even more challenging. Neither small drillers nor supermajors Exxon Mobil and Chevron , both of which have invested heavily in the region, can solve these issues quickly or alone.\n\nThe shale revolution has been a boon to the U.S. economy and to energy consumers everywhere. Markets should adapt to this weekend\u2019s disruptions, but West Texas simply can\u2019t ride to the rescue in the event of a more lasting disruption.", "description": "Booming U.S. oil production has altered the world energy landscape, in part because it is so nimble, but it can\u2019t plug a hole of the size created by the weekend attack on Saudi Arabia.", "authors": ["Lauren Silva Laughlin", "Lauren.Silvalaughlin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107299/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
