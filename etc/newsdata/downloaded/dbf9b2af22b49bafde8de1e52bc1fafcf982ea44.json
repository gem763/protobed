Two reasons - Saurav Ganguly was declared the new President of BCCI and Abhijit Banerjee won the Nobel Prize for Economics.\n\nAfter winning the coveted prize, now Abhijit Banerjee has given Bengalis and the rest of the country another reason to be proud of him.\n\nA video of him speaking in impeccable Bengali, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge on October 14, is going viral on the Internet. The speech was delivered after his Nobel prize was announced.\n\nThe part where he is speaking in shuddh Bangla is a separate video that is being shared on different social media platforms. Even radio jockey Agni shared it with the caption, \u2018Nobel laureate MIT-te dnariye Banglay katha bolchhen. Gaaye kaanta, chokhe jol, hall-e seeti (Nobel laureate is addressing MIT in Bengali. Goosebumps, teary eyes and people whistling in the hall)\u2019.\n\nFor many of us who are not fluent in Bengali and cannot understand a word, Banerjee even transplanted that part of his speech.\n\nDon't Miss 3 K SHARES 1 K SHARES\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the numbers that just came out is the National Sample Survey which comes out every one and a half years or so and it gives you the average consumption in urban and rural areas in India and the fact that we see in that is that between 2014-2015 and 2017-2018, that number has slightly gone down. And that's the first time such a thing has happened in many, many, many years. So, that's a very glaring warning sign. There is enormous fight going on in India about which data is right and the government has a particular view of all data that is inconvenient to it is wrong.\n\nBut nonetheless, I think that this is something that even the government is increasingly recognising that there is a problem. So the economy is slowing very, very fast. How fast we don't know because there is dispute about data. But, I think fast.\n\nAFP\n\nEkhon er byapare ki kora jaabe. What can we do about this? I'll say the whole thing in Bengali and then translate. Er byapare ki kora jaabe. Shotti kotha bolte gele ami jaanina tobe joto tuku bolte pari, ekhun kaar moton, ei je amader monetary policy regime jeta ache, jekhaane chaar percent er beshi, shaare teen percent er beshi deficit hobena, eishob niye matha ghamiye laabh nei. Ekhuni economy te khaanekta aaro poyesha aante hobe. Ebong goreeb er haathe poyesha dite hobe. Boro lok er haathe poyesha dewa na. Goreeber haathe aaro beshi taaka aante hobe.\n\nSo, I don't know exactly what to do. The government has a large deficit but right now, it is sort of at least, aiming to please everybody by pretending to hold to some budgetary targets and monetary targets. And my view is that this is the economy going into a tailspin, is the time when you don't worry so much about monetary stability. You worry a bit more about demand. I think demand is a huge problem right now in the economy.\n\nNo wonder the country is basking in pride.", "description": "The day was October 14th and Bengalis went gaga.

Obviously one needs to remember that Abhijit Banerjee was born in Mumbai so not all the credit should be taken by Bengalis for producing genius genes.", "authors": ["Shreya Chauhan"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/nobel_prize_1571215636_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
