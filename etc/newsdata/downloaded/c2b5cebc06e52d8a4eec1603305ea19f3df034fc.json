The 29-year-old actually scored his third goal of the season following the injury, but Toronto will be without its leader for at least the next six games.\n\n\"It didn't feel like it was too bad waking up [Thursday],\" Tavares said. \"I was a little surprised by the circumstances, but it could be a lot worse.\n\n\"This is what you work for, this is what you play the game for ... missing time sucks.\"\n\nWATCH | Tavares introduced as Leafs' 25th captain:\n\nTavares took the ice during the pre-game introductions with a 'C' on his jersey for the first time in Toronto. 0:33\n\nIt also swings the door open for some of his teammates.\n\nAcquired from the Colorado Avalanche with defenceman Tyson Barrie in this summer's Nazem Kadri trade, Kerfoot has two goals and four points in his eight games with Toronto as the team's third-line centre.\n\nMoving into the Leafs' top-6 alongside Marner and Mikheyev is, however, a much bigger challenge.\n\n\"I don't think anybody's going to replace J.T.,\" Kerfoot said. \"We've got to do it as a collective group.\"\n\nPositive early impression\n\nQuiet off the ice, the 25-year-old has made an early impression in Toronto because of his willingness to go into dirty areas.\n\n\"He's feisty,\" Marner said. \"He's got a lot of fight.\"\n\n\"He's gotten really comfortable,\" Matthews said. \"He's been a good addition to our team \u2014 a guy everybody really enjoys having around.\"\n\n\"Kerf's a way better player than we expected,\" Babcock added. \"He's way grittier. He's got more grease to him. We think he's going to make way more plays as time goes on.\"\n\nKerfoot, who had a brief chat with Babcock right before Friday's practice, said he can't afford to change his approach.\n\n\"Marns is one of the best players in the league,\" Kerfoot said. \"When you get the opportunity to play with him, you know there's more responsibility and you've got to do a good job.\"\n\nSpezza back in action\n\nAlso getting a shot to stake a claim is Spezza, who skated with Kasperi Kapanen and Trevor Moore as part of Toronto's new third line.\n\nThe 36-year-old has been a healthy scratch for five of Toronto's eight outings after signing for the league minimum in free agency, but he sees an overall silver lining with Tavares out of action.\n\n\"It's difficult when you lose your top guy that you rely on for a lot of things,\" said Spezza, who has mostly been limited to fourth-line minutes when suited up. \"It gives different guys opportunities and puts pressure on guys.\n\nWATCH | Tavares injured in loss to Capitals:\n\nWashington edges Toronto 4-3, scores three goals in a span of one minute and 18 seconds in the second period. 1:54\n\n\"If you can keep winning when you go through injuries, it just builds the belief in your squad.\"\n\nThe game against the Bruins might only be a Saturday in October, but after Toronto suffered a seven-game defeat to Boston in the first of playoffs for the second time in as many years back in April, it should also serve as an early measuring stick.\n\n\"They've eliminated us two years in a row,\" Babcock said. \"So you know them pretty good.\"\n\nGearing up for Bruins\n\nWhile both post-season losses stung the Leafs, the most recent series was especially painful.\n\nToronto led the series 1-0, 2-1 and had the Bruins, who would go onto to make the Stanley Cup final, against the ropes up 3-2 in Game 6 at home before losing that one 4-2 and then falling 5-1 in Game 7 at TD Garden.\n\nWithout their captain and his ability to chew up big minutes against other teams' best players, the line of Matthews, Nylander and Andreas Johnsson should see a lot of Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak at Scotiabank Arena.\n\nThe trio has scored 14 of the Bruins' 19 goals in 2019-20, with Pastrnak finding the back of the net six times in the last two games to sit tied for the NHL lead with eight heading into Friday's action.\n\n\"Probably the top line in the league,\" said Matthews, whose team was just 1-3-0 against Boston last season. \"It's usually a pretty intense game, a pretty physical game.\n\n\"We've just got to make sure we're ready to go.\"\n\nOnly this time, it will be without Tavares.", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs host the Boston Bruins on Saturday night, but the team will be without captain John Tavares, who is out at least two weeks with a broken finger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5326101.1571412946!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tavares-leafs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
