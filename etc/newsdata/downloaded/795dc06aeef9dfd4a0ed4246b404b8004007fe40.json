Among the worst, beyond a player he discarded like Angel Di Maria doing so much damage, was that the Argentine ensured Paris Saint-Germain didn\u2019t even need Neymar or Kylian Mbappe.\n\nThat\u2019s what would have been particularly humiliating for Perez. He\u2019d made that duo such subjects of attention going into this game because of how much he wants to buy them, that their very absence then made the defeat feel all the more emphatic.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They were just so directionless, so lacking in focus.\n\nIt won\u2019t have escaped Perez\u2019s memory, either, that Zidane never really wanted Neymar. That was just one of many issues that arose between the pair over the past few months, and that has fed into this simmering situation, creating problems for the team as well as doubts about Zidane\u2019s job.\n\nIt is true that the Frenchman wasn\u2019t able to complete the scale of the rebuild he felt was essential. He badly wanted Paul Pogba, for one.\n\nHe didn\u2019t get him, and hasn\u2019t got anywhere near the extent of control over transfers that he insisted upon in the terms of his March comeback. This is what he was worried about.\n\nThe fear among many at the top levels of Madrid is that they\u2019ve just wasted \u00a3300m this summer, that they haven\u2019t made any tangible improvements beyond a currently unfit Eden Hazard. All that money spent, and the side still looks so jaded. It wasn\u2019t so much as a reboot as a mere rebadging. Throw in the Alan Partridge reference here if you like.\n\nIt\u2019s also true, however, that Perez might have expected a bit more identity and football idea to this team. The Madrid president is said to be infamously ignorant of the exact mechanics of football, but you don\u2019t need to know too much to know how bad that 3-0 defeat to PSG was; how far behind the former European champions looked.\n\nThis is why some have dismissed Zidane as a \u201cclap your hands manager\u201d. The accusation has been that he just facilitates teams rather than driving them. Many of the current players are now complaining about a \"total lack of plan\", with sources close to one saying it is a \"fiasco\".\n\nThis is why the figure of Jose Mourinho hovers again.\n\nThere are admittedly many influential Madrid figures who would advise Perez against that appointment again. The Bernabeu president was very close to the decision in March, only to back away, due to the counsel of many who insisted Mourinho is yesterday\u2019s man.\n\nAs regards the manager long considered Madrid\u2019s next man, in Mauricio Pochettino, that has now cooled.\n\nThere is first of all the complication that he is very legally ring-fenced at Tottenham Hotspur, and it would be close to impossible to get him out mid-season. There is secondly the fact that Perez has had some of his favoured players send out a few feelers regarding the Argentine, and some doubts have arisen. There is now more debate over whether Pochettino would actually suit Madrid.\n\nThe grand issue with a club like that, though, is that so much can change so quickly. Nothing completely banishes debate like a run of bad results.\n\nThat is why we\u2019re now entering a very interesting month. It could greatly change the view that Zidane's history has bought him at least a year in this role. He is right to be \"disturbed\". Perez has sacked managers for less.", "description": "In the lower levels of the Parc des Princes, in the same low tone as he always speaks, Zinedine Zidane declared himself \u201cdisturbed\u201d with Real Madrid\u2019s display.
