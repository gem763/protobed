Over a long night of violent clashes, police fired two warning shots skyward, and rolled out a water cannon for the second time this summer. Protesters threw petrol bombs and other objects.\n\nAt least 51 people were arrested in the streets and in the subway, police said on Sunday. Video footage from Prince Edward subway station in Kowloon showed officers chasing and hitting individuals with batons as they made the arrests. Arrestees have been accused of \"participating in unauthorized assembly,\" \"criminal damage,\" and other charges.\n\nThe police response was quicker and fiercer than in past weeks, perhaps in a sign of waning patience, and clashes continued until the very early hours of Sunday morning local time, where angry crowds gathered outside of Mong Kok police station. Hundreds could be heard shouting and jeering, and across the street, cars honked to show their support for the protesters.\n\nEarlier in the day, thousands had taken to the streets for a series of wildcat protests.
