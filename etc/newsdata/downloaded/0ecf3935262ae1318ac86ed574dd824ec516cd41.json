(Courtesy: Apple Inc.)\n\nAnalyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities told Market Watch that his analysis of pre-order data shows extended delivery times \u201cacross a number of models with many iPhones now slated for delivery two to three weeks after the Sept. 20 official release date.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201csome variants of the 256GB iPhone 11 Pro\u201d were showing strength alongside some space gray and gold models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIves also noted that a key market for Apple is in China. He estimated that about 60 to 70 million iPhones in China are eligible for an upgrade. Whether Apple can convince these customers to upgrade will be a hurdle the tech company has to face, and the task may be difficult as the U.S. and China continue an embroiled trade war. Ives\u2019 analysis said Apple needs to convince about half of these users to buy new phones to be successful.\n\nDespite these concerns, he rates the stock to outperform expectations with a $245 price target.\n\n\"The Apple-designed A13 Bionic sets a new bar for smartphone performance and power efficiency,\" Apple said about its new iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. (Courtesy: Apple Inc.)\n\nOn the other hand, Jeffrey Kvaal, managing director of communications equity research at Nomura Securities\u2019 Instinet told Market Watch he is encouraged by the longer shipment times seen in the three iPhone 11 models.\n\nAccording to his findings, the premium iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max had shown shipment times of about 17 days on Sunday, whereas the iPhone XS and XS Max of last year had shipment times around 11 days.\n\nThe mass market-friendly iPhone 11 had shown a shipment time of about 12 days for delivery, which is roughly three days more than last year\u2019s iPhone XR.\n\nKvaal drove his point that longer wait times correlate with higher demand.\n\n\u201cWhile shipment times reflect the balance of supply and demand, our supply chain work indicates supply is flat year over year,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe interpret that to mean the 11 is off to a healthy start in the U.S.\u201d\n\nHis analysis has a neutral rating and a $185 target on shares.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nConversely, Amit Daryanani of equity research and sales agency Evercore ISI reportedly said in a note to a client that he sees an \u201cinherent upside\u201d to Apple\u2019s third quarter earnings estimates, according to Market Watch.\n\nHe explained he drew this conclusion based on the company not staggering the launch of its three new models.\n\n\u201cThis we think will have a positive impact to revenues and EPS in the September quarter, though depending on the reception of these products, it may be more of a pulling in of revenues from December quarter,\u201d Daryanani said.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe think Apple will likely be more aggressive with their trade-in programs to further incentivize customers to purchase the new phones.\u201d\n\nBased on his analysis, Daryanani rates Apple\u2019s stock to outperform and raised his price target to $247. Previously he had the tech giant at $238.\n\nApple shares gained 0.5 percent Monday during midday trading and reached a market capitalization threshold slightly lower than $1 trillion according to data from NASDAQ.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 percent.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg AAPL n.a. 219.90 +1.15 +0.53%\n\nApple stock has increased 14.1 percent in the past three months, which is significantly larger than the 3.8 percent gain in the Dow within that same timeframe.\n\nMarket intelligence provider International Data Corporation compiled a smartphone market share projection that expects phone sales to dip 1.9 percent for 2019.
