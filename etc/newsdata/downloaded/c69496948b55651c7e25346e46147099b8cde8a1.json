Add together the 288 Tory MPs, 35 Nationalists and 19 Lib Dems, and you\u2019ve got 342 \u2013 a comfortable win.\n\nThe Lib Dems also have nearly 100 votes in the House of Lords, which could prove useful if peers decide they want to stand in the way of an election.\n\nIn making their offer, the two minor parties are not trying to help Mr Johnson, but are acting out of cynical self-interest.\n\nToday Mr Johnson will have another go, but Labour MPs have seen the polls \u2013 including one yesterday putting the Tories 16 points ahead \u2013 and are reluctant, as veteran Frank Field put it yesterday, to be the turkeys voting for Christmas\n\nThe SNP are ahead in the polls and keen to secure an election before the trial of their former leader Alex Salmond on charges of sexual assault \u2013 which he denies \u2013 goes ahead next year.\n\nMeanwhile Jo Swinson, who has been assiduously positioning the Lib Dems as the anti-Brexit party, will hope to appeal to Remain voters unconvinced by Mr Corbyn.\n\nIf they vote for the Bill and refuse to back \u2018killer\u2019 amendments such as one extending the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds, then we could be heading for a December election for the first time since 1923.\n\nFor Mr Johnson, this could hardly have come at a better moment. In the next 48 hours, EU leaders will decide how long Brexit will be delayed beyond Thursday night.\n\nAt that point, Leave voters will see that Mr Johnson has failed to fulfil his \u2018come what may, do or die\u2019 pledge of getting us out on October 31.\n\nBut instead of blaming him, No 10 strategists hope they will blame this obstructive, Remain-dominated Parliament, and look to take their frustrations out at the ballot box.", "description": "JACK DOYLE: For weeks the Prime Minister has been asking for a General Election to break the Brexit deadlock, and now there's every chance his dearest Christmas wish could come true.", "authors": ["Jack Doyle For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20258650-0-image-a-39_1572216684468.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
