Paranormal investigator's 5 signs you have a ghost", "language": "en", "text": "Haunted houses may not just be Halloween attractions: Forty-three percent of people claim they have possibly lived in a home with ghosts, due to evidence such as hearing strange noises, spotting shadows and seeing objects move on their own, according to a new Realtor.com poll.\n\nAnd while bunking with a spirit of the deceased would terrify most people, it\u2019s precisely what makes a dream home for paranormal investigator Cory Heinzen. That\u2019s why, in June, Heinzen and his wife moved from Maine to Harrisville, Rhode Island, where they purchased the actual farmhouse that inspired the scary 2013 film The Conjuring (its third installment will be released in September). The movie is based on the Perron family, who, in the 1970s, experienced horrifying paranormal activity during their nine-year residency: levitating furniture, ghostly apparitions and whispers of \u201cdead soldiers buried in the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you buy a home like this?\u201d Heinzen, 40, asks Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nHere's how to know if you're about to have your own personal ghost story.

One night, a black mist floated into the master bedroom, then disappeared, says Heinzen, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s not an evil presence. But there\u2019s something here.\u201d\n\nRetired from the military, Heinzen offers his ghost-busting services free of charge, visiting homes to identify and document activity using digital recorders, video cameras and thermal detectors. If he detects energy, Heinzen recommends that shamans, psychic mediums or local clergy step in, depending on whether clients wish to communicate with or evacuate entities.\n\nCurious as to whether you have any revenant roommates? Here are the signs you\u2019re not alone at night.\n\nYour belongings move or go missing\n\nKeys and jewelry are easily overlooked when people are tired or in a rush, but if an item moves locations (behind your back or, hmmm...right in front of you) and you know for certain where you left it, you might have a ghost. \u201cWe call these spirits \u2018tricksters,\u2019\u201d Heinzen tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThey\u2019re not malevolent \u2014they\u2019re just mischievous.\u201d\n\nThe objects eventually resurface, says Heinzen, but entities get a kick out of watching people frantically search for them. Spirits are usually attached to their homes and \u2014 just like you\u2014 feel entitled to stay, he says. As long as no one is getting physically hurt, he advises tolerating the ghosts, who are expressing themselves as they might during life. If you had a playful personality while alive, you\u2019ll be equally as impish after death.\n\nHeinzen regards his own spirits as he would slightly irritating roommates \u2013 with a bit of acknowledgment, even a verbal hello, then some distance. On one occasion, a spirit threw a spatula into a corner of the kitchen and they have been known to frequently slam doors \u2014 but Heinzen is unfazed.\n\n\u201cAt night, we stay on one side of the farmhouse,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared, but we give the ghosts their space.\u201d\n\nCory Heinzen and his wife Jennifer, pictured with their son Kyler and daughter Madison, bought the haunted Rhode Island home that inspired the film \"The Conjuring.\" (Photo: Katie Heinzen) More\n\nA child in the house seems to have identified a spirit\n\nKids are creative, but if a child in your home appears to be communicating with someone (and you\u2019ve ruled out an imaginary friend), a ghost may be trying to connect. Heinzen says young children are susceptible to the spiritual because of their anything-is-possible mindset.", "description": "Ever wonder whether your home is haunted?
