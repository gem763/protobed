The average UK house price was \u00a3230,000 in June, about \u00a32,000 higher than a year ago.\n\nAssessing the impact of a no-deal Brexit on local economies, KPMG said house prices in Northern Ireland and London could fall by as much as 7.5% and 7% respectively, because of their greater connectivity with EU trade.\n\nDespite the value of the average home in the capital potentially falling to \u00a3422,000 next year as a result of no-deal Brexit \u2013 down from \u00a3453,000 if an agreement is reached \u2013 KPMG said it would still have the highest cash prices in the country.\n\nThe impact of a no-deal scenario would be least felt on the property markets in Wales and the east Midlands, where prices could drop by as much as 5.4% in 2020.\n\nJan Crosby, the UK head of housing at KPMG, said Britain leaving without a deal would probably lead to a sharp drop in sales volumes as wary homeowners wait for the turbulence in the property market to clear. This in turn would \u201cmake government housing delivery targets impossible to achieve and slow new building across the sector\u201d, he said.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of falling owner occupation in Britain as first-time buyers find it difficult to get on the housing ladder, the government has promised to deliver 300,000 homes a year by the mid 2020s.\n\nShould Johnson strike an agreement to leave the EU with a deal on 31 October, KPMG suggested house prices would continue to rise next year, growing by about 1.3%. The north-west would be expected to record the fastest growth in 2019, of 1.6%, while Yorkshire and the Humber would take the lead in 2020 with growth of 2.4%.\n\nYael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said 2020 would be a delicate year for the housing market. \u201cEven if Brexit can be resolved relatively smoothly, the travails of the global economy will impact growth in the UK, making prospects for house prices relatively subdued,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.", "description": "Analysis suggests nationwide decline of about 6% in 2020", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a53bc095add7233726c71f74bb8783c851f74838/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f296bdffd232cbf96d25e194e002110"}
