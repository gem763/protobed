She began her campaign in the low single-digits, awkwardly apologizing for trying to prove her Native American ancestry with a DNA test, and suffering from possibly sexist speculation that she lacked \u201clikability.\u201d As her crowds grew into the thousands, and as her selfie lines became tests of endurance, she was presenting visual evidence that many people liked her, and then some. In the view of political scientist Rachel Bitecofer, big crowds are a way to measure a candidate\u2019s charisma. \u201cIn fact, it may be the only way to quantify charisma,\u201d Bitecofer says. \u201cAnd charisma matters.\u201d\n\nStill, Bernie Sanders\u2019 big crowds weren\u2019t enough for him to win in 2016, nor were Howard Dean\u2019s in 2004. The question for Warren and her crowds in 2020 is whether she can turn enough of her rallygoers into effective campaign workers who can get out the vote, in the places where she needs the most help. Not every rallygoer is positioned to do that. Warren may continue to have the biggest crowds. The more important question is: Compared to her progressive insurgent predecessors, will she have better crowds?\n\nIn a tight race, a strong get-out-the-vote operation is essential, and that requires a field operation that is intimately familiar with the local terrain.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bill Scher"], "top_image": ""}
