This time around he can be the main attraction, and Foster believes he can thrive amid top billing \u2013 and underpin New Zealand\u2019s drive for a record third-straight World Cup crown.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He\u2019s a key part of our strategy group, the way he prepares. I know how focused he is on playing well, but there\u2019s a few others like that too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s helping Richie (Mo\u2019unga) grow into the position he\u2019s in too. He\u2019s a part of encouraging and giving them confidence too.\u201d\n\nGeorge Bridge and Scott Barrett scored the tries that ultimately saw New Zealand home, in a match where Springboks speed king wing Cheslin Kolbe dazzled throughout a stellar second-half.\n\nAll Blacks boss Steve Hansen admitted his side had to toil hard before finding their rhythm, before insisting South Africa can still go on to win the competition.\n\nNo side has ever lost a pool match and progressed to become champions, but Hansen believes records only exist to be expunged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one for one, so that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cWe won didn\u2019t we? So you\u2019ve got to be happy with that. Were we perfect? No, but you\u2019re never going to be at this stage of the tournament.\n\n\u201cThat was the interesting thing about this game right from the get-go. We\u2019ve come out on top of it and very happy that we did but there\u2019s plenty of stuff we can work on.\n\nIt was really hard for us early in the game in the scrum. The boys adjusted through the game, and got more fluid. But it\u2019s always going to be a titanic struggle.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Beauden Barrett has been backed to boss New Zealand\u2019s latest bid for World Cup history in Japan.
