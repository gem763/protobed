In places where the seasons are always shifting, it can be a bit of a gamble when you\u2019re getting ready to leave the house and you have to pick the right outerwear for the day ahead. What if the coat you throw on is too heavy, and you\u2019re already sweating by the time you climb the stairs to your train platform? What if it\u2019s too light and you are going to freeze on the way home from the grocery store after work? Or, what if you had just the right coat for every cool weather situation? It\u2019s possible! It can take a little bit of investment over the years, but when you build up a nice collection of the right coats, you can achieve the absolute nirvana of stocked-up-ed-ness that lends you an undeniable air of style and ease and cozy-but-not-too-hot-warmth that you\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n\nThe Breathable Shield\n\nTemperature: 65 - 55 degrees\n\n65 - 55 degrees Timing: Labor day through November and April - June\n\nThis is the coat you want for when it\u2019s still warm at midday but often cool in the morning and evening (or if it\u2019s threatening to rain). Sometimes a sweater or cute hoodie will cut it in regards to keeping warm, but nobody likes a soggy sweater, so throw a denim jacket or trench over your shoulder. They\u2019re great layering-friendly coats that can protect you from the elements without feeling too stuffy. The classic colors and fabrics they\u2019re available in provide the most cross-outfit versatility, but there are infinite iterations on these shapes to play with, including jackets that take advantage of the current chic workwear trend.\n\nMadewell x Dickies Workwear Jacket, $128 at Madewell\n\nOriginal Trucker Jacket, $80 at Levi's\n\nASOS DESIGN Trench Coat, $79 at ASOS\n\nThe leather/faux leather\n\nTemperature: 55-40 degrees\n\n55-40 degrees Timing: October - December and March - May\n\nThe key to dressing in most seasons is smart layering, and the leather/faux leather jacket is the ultimate item to get from those extra-cool late-September evenings all the way through to the more mild days of December. A blanket scarf paired with a cozy sweater works WONDERS with these bad boys when it gets a little chillier. With the added benefit of being water and wind resistant, they are truly the perfect outerwear for a big chunk of the year. Real leather is an investment but it will last you many years, and luckily the styles are often timeless. Faux leather options are also high quality and durable, and provide a bit more style flexibility at a lower price point.\n\nCOLLUSION Oversized Leather Look Biker Jacket, $45 at ASOS\n\nAllsaints Conroy Quilted Leather Biker Jacket, $550 at Bloomingdale's\n\nThe Lightweight Pugger/Casual Wool\n\nTemperature: 40 - 30 degrees\n\n40 - 30 degrees Timing: November - March\n\nFor when it's legitimately cold outside, a light or medium weight puffer or wool coat (ideally one that\u2019s on the longer side) is the play. This would be your daily-wear coat for a majority of the cold months, so it\u2019s important you have a good, slightly roomier fit for sweaters, but still stylishly cut for warmer days when you don\u2019t want to feel too bulky. Do try to look for quality of material in either of these kinds of coats - for example, wool is naturally water resistant, and both down and wool possess properties that make them very breathable materials. This will help you regulate temperature comfortably as you go from office to cold commute and back indoors.\n\nColdControl Lightweight Longline Hooded Puffer Jacket, $128 at GAP\n\nA New Day Women's Wool Duffel Coat, $65 at Target\n\nClassic Lambswool Peacoat, $219 at L.L.Bean\n\nThe Nice Overcoat\n\nTemperature: 50-30 degrees\n\nTiming: December - April\n\nEvery winter there are a few times where you realize you\u2019ve got to pull yourself together and look real nice. Think a winter wedding, a holiday party, or a job interview, and you realize you don't want to wear the very loved but sort of casual everyday coat with such a jazzed up ensemble. This is a great opportunity to get something into your collection like a cape/capelet, or a nice cashmere menswear-style wool overcoat.\n\nDouble-Breasted Topcoat in Wool Cashmere, $398 at J.Crew\n\nSoft Wool Hooded Cape, $695 at Cuyana\n\nThe warm coat for the extreme cold\n\nTemperature: 30-0 (or below)\n\nTiming: December - February\n\nWhen temperatures are consistently below freezing for several weeks at a time, the time for being cute is over and the time for the extra warm coat is here. A good temperature-rated waterproof down or quality down substitute coat is truly life changing in these times, the depths of winter, when the air outside makes your face hurt but you still need to walk to the grocery store. This kind of coat has even been fashionable in the last few years with the popularity of the Canada Goose brand. However, there are plenty of options without the price tag. This is an item where it\u2019s worth investing a little. You may not use it as frequently, but a good, very warm coat will be there for you when it matters, winter after winter.\n\nUltrawarm Coat, Three Quarter Length, $239 at L.L.Bean\n\nThe North Face Arctic Down Parka II, $299 at The North Face\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
