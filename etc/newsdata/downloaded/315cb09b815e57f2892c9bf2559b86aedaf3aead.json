Whilst no arrests have yet been made, we are working around the clock to make arrests and are continuing to search relevant places.'\n\nA woman whose son was at the same party in the peaceful neighbourhood says one of the boys 'died in his arms'.\n\nPolice are pictured scouring the area in Buckinghamshire today as they search for murder weapons following the deaths\n\nDominic Ansah (left) and Ben Gillham-Rice were named as the teenagers who were killed on Saturday at a house party in Milton Keynes\n\nForensic offices were pictured leaving the property and blood was seen on the door of the property yesterday\n\n'They were his friends,' she told The Telegraph. 'It's gang-related. Those boys were lured there and targeted.'\n\nOfficers from Thames Valley police are continuing their investigations today after police and paramedics were called to the house in Archford Croft, Buckinghamshire.\n\nOne of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital. A 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were also hurt and were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe next of kin of both teenage victims have been informed and are being supported by officers.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said there had been around 15 to 20 people at the party and that 'the people directly involved in this incident are all likely to have known each other'.\n\nHe also revealed that everyone at the party was an invited guest and that there were no gatecrashers.\n\nIt was understood that a fight broke out inside the party and that Ben Gillham-Rice and Dominic Ansah were fatally stabbed in the ensuing melee.\n\nTwo tearful cousins of one of the boys attended the site of the killing to lay flowers on Sunday.\n\nOne of the cousins, who did not wish to give her name, said: 'He's come here with his long-time best friend since childhood, comes to a party and both of their lives just got ripped away from them.\n\n'He was just so respectful to, like, his family and friends. Many, many people's hearts are broken.'\n\nA police car was stationed on the outside of the cul-de-sac yesterday as officers closed it off to the public\n\nOne neighbour, who lives in an adjacent cul-de-sac, said that she knew the boys but declined to give their names.\n\nShe said: 'This gang of kids have been hanging around Archford Croft - it's all gang-related.\n\nAnother neighbour said she heard a 'commotion' involving screaming, shortly before midnight, but did not see what happened. 'The police were here pretty quick,' she said.\n\n'We do know that there was a house party at the time, not here but another part of Emerson. I think it's just because there was a house party and then the trouble started from there.'\n\nA spokesman for Thames Valley Police said in a statement yesterday: 'Clearly this is a dreadful incident and we are in the very early stages of the investigation. We have deployed significant resources and it is, and will continue to be, a fast-moving investigation led by our Major Crime Unit.\n\nPolice say that everyone at the house party was invited and Dominic Ansah (left) and Ben Gillham-Rice (right with mother Suzie) died after a fight broke out on Saturday night\n\n'Our thoughts go out to the families of the victims and we have deployed specially trained officers to support them.\n\n'We remain on the scene at Archford Croft in Emerson Valley and a scene has been cordoned off while the investigation continues. This scene is likely to remain for several days.\n\n'I fully appreciate the concern that this will cause in the local community and beyond, but at this early stage, I believe the people directly involved in this incident are all likely to have known each other.\n\n'There will be an increased police presence in Emerson Valley and if you have anything you wish to raise, or any concerns, please don't hesitate to speak to officers.\n\n'It is important that our investigation team receive all relevant information so I urge anybody who can help, no matter how insignificant you think this may be to come forward. We also want to hear from anyone who was in the area of Emerson Valley between 11pm last night and 1am this morning.'\n\nDCS Hunter added that detectives were keen to speak to anyone who was at the party or who saw events before and afterwards at the house to contact officers if they had not already been spoken to.\n\nForensic teams were pictured outside the property yesterday after the two teenagers were stabbed\n\nClose relatives of the dead and injured men were being comforted by specially trained police liaison officers at their homes yesterday and neighbours said they had been told not to speak to the media.\n\nOne woman, whose home overlooks the property's garden, said she did not see or hear anything and described the neighbourhood as 'peaceful'.\n\n'It's just a nice peaceful part of Milton Keynes. There's never been any incidents, not since I've been here, which is quite a while now,' she said.\n\nNeighbours in the area claimed a house party was being held at the \u00a3600,000 home.\n\nPolice officers and ambulance crews were called to the property in the Emerson Valley area just before midnight.\n\nCrews attended a property in Archford Croft after reports of a stabbing taking place. On Sunday, what appeared to be blood was smeared across the front door of the house.\n\nTwo males, one 17 and one 23 were also injured in the incident and have been taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.\n\nNo arrests have yet been made following the incident and police said the victims' next of kin has since been informed.\n\nIt is not yet known how many assailants were involved in the double murder but they fled from the scene after inflicting the horrific injuries.\n\nA full forensic investigation team was at the scene today, carrying out a detailed search of the house and the garden in a bid to find clues to the attackers.\n\nNeighbours in Emerson Valley told of the horror at hearing about the double murder, with one even saying a 'Happy Birthday' banner had been draped over the door.\n\nOne man, who did not want to be named, said: 'Apparently there was some sort of party going on at the house and a group of young people arrived and got into the house. I don't think the boys knew each other.\n\n'Soon after midnight loads of police cars and ambulances arrived in the road and there were blue lights everywhere. I have been told that the boys who died were not related in anyway and that the murders look a bit like gang violence.\n\n'This is normally a nice quiet neighbourhood and hardly anything ever happens here. I just can't believe that two teenage boys have been viciously murdered in our street,' said the neighbour.\n\nOther neighbours in Archford Croft said said that the four bedroomed homes in the road where the killings happened were currently selling for \u00a3360,000 and not the \u00a3600,000 originally estimated.\n\nAnother added: 'It is really unusual in this road to hear any noise in the evening so when I heard what sounded like a serious altercation taking place, I decided to call the police immediately.\n\nAmbulance and police crews attended Archford Croft (pictured above) after reports that a stabbing had taken place\n\n'The police and ambulances were here within minutes of my call and I saw a couple of dozen young people coming out of the house as the police went in. It was a very ususual scene for this place which is normally so quiet'.\n\nA Home Office pathologist was due to carry out post mortem examinations on the bodies of both boys at the mortuary at Milton Keynes Hospital although police confirmed that both had stab wounds.\n\nOfficers refused to say which hospital the stabbed adults had been taken to because of fears for their safety. Head of Crime Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said the force was in the early stages of a double murder investigation after the 'shocking incident'.\n\n'Our priorities at this time are to conduct a thorough investigation and to support those who have been affected. Officers are currently at the scene which has been cordoned off and members of the public are asked to avoid the area.\n\n'I would like to speak to anyone who has any information which could help with our enquiries or anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Archford Croft at around the time of the incident around midnight.\n\n'Even if you think details may be insignificant, please come forward and speak to police.'\n\nOfficers are appealing for information and have urged people to get in touch by contacting police via the 24-hour 101 number, quoting URN 1761 19/10.
