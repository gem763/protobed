Darling, dethroned Liam Gallagher on Friday, buoyed by the release of a special anniversary edition featuring unheard material.\n\nThe record was previously held by Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, often considered the band's best work, which had a gap of 49 years and 125 days.\n\nAbbey Road, however, ended its initial 17-week run atop the charts on January 31 1970 - meaning it now holds a winning gap of 49 years and 252 days.\n\nLike Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper's returned to number one on the 50th anniversary of its release in June 2017.", "description": "The Beatles have broken their own record for the album with the longest gap between topping the charts as Abbey Road hit the top spot 50 years after its original release.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2019/09/26/TELEMMGLPICT000210715873-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0lSoGCnyPmfxNe19sU2FvlVse9JsN00kzbUr3IXHaGo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
