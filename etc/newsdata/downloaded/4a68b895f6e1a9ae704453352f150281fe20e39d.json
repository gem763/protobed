So now it makes a doozy.\n\nThe 2020 Telluride is the largest vehicle Kia has ever made. The Georgia-built, three-row SUV matches up against the likes of the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer. It\u2019s a size larger than the Kia Sorrento and offers seating for seven to eight passengers with room for an adult or two in the reclining wayback row and plenty more behind it for cargo.\n\nPricing starts at $32,785 for a front-wheel-drive Telluride with a 291 hp 3.8-liter V6 and 8-speed automatic transmission, while $2,000 adds an all-wheel-drive system that has settings for a variety of slippery surfaces and is good for 21 mpg combined. That's on the low side for this class, but only by a couple of mpg.\n\nIF LOOKS COULD KILL: ELECTRIC KIA CONCEPT FEATURES CUTTING EDGE TECH\n\nFour trim levels are available and all of them feature the same powertrain, including the top of the line SX I tested that goes for $46,535 when equipped with the Prestige Package. It adds Nappa leather, a suede-like headliner, rain-sensing wipers, climate-controlled second-row seats, 110-volt outlet and a head-up display to the Telluride\u2019s already extensive feature set.\n\nThe Telluride\u2019s styling is impressive all around. It has a burly, handsome body that wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a Jeep lot and an interior that punches well above its weight with the quality of its wood, metal and soft-touch trims.\n\nThat cabin is an inviting and quiet place to be, aided by the silky operation of the engine and transmission and a ride quality that needs no improvement. It\u2019s great on pavement and, although it doesn\u2019t have the suspension articulation of a true off-roader, you could comfortably drive it down a bumpy gravel road all day.\n\nThe Telluride isn\u2019t overpowered, but it\u2019s not lacking, and switching it to Sport mode noticeably livens everything up. It\u2019s not quite as engaging as the Pilot, but it doesn\u2019t get sloppy on a twisty road. I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to test its 5,000-pound tow rating, but it feels strong enough to handle it and there\u2019s a $795 Towing Package that adds a hitch and self-leveling rear suspension if you\u2019d like to give it a shot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs with most utility vehicles these days, the Telluride is optimized as a family car and has several pieces of tech aimed directly at this, although a WiFi hotspot is oddly not among them. They include a motion sensor that sets off the alarm if you forget anyone in the back seats, an intercom to make it easier to speak to the rear passengers and a system that keeps the rear doors locked if a car is about to pass by.\n\nFOLLOW FOX NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE\n\nThe list of available electronic driver aids is even more extensive. Along with the expected automatic emergency brakes, adaptive cruise control and 360-degree camera system, the feed from a blind spot camera is displayed between the speedometer and tachometer when you engage the turn signal. The Telluride can also be ordered with a Highway Driving Assistant that self-steers it in the middle of a lane and can automatically match the vehicle\u2019s speed to the posted limit. It\u2019s not technically a hands-off system, and will deactivate after about 45 seconds if you\u2019re not touching the wheel, but you wonder if it really has to because it\u2019s so good.\n\nAs is the Telluride, overall. It's more than competitive in its segment, and even makes a strong argument against some luxury SUVs.\n\n----------\n\n2020 Kia Telluride\n\nBase price: $32,785\n\nAs tested: $46,535\n\nType: 7-passenger, 4-door all-wheel-drive SUV\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V6\n\nPower: 291 hp, 262 lb-ft\n\nTransmission: 8-speed automatic\n\nMPG: 19 city/24 hwy", "description": "Kia knows what Americans like.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
