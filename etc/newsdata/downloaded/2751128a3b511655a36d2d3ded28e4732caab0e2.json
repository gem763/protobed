You\u2019d feel sorry for them and buy them a cup of tea. Now they are in big gangs, it\u2019s quite threatening.\n\n\u201cI had one lady, about 60, and she said it would be her last time as she felt frightened walking in the centre.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of reasons for moving, but the problems with these gangs was a big factor. I employ young girls. They come in early every \u00admorning when groups are hanging around.\u201d\n\nAnother trader who packed up is coffee van man Gwyn Williams.\n\n(Image: Pictures by Darren Casey / DCima)\n\nHe said thugs threatened him with acid, bleach and knives \u2013 and even vowed to rape his partner.\n\nHe said: \u201cSoon after I started I was visited by two thugs, demanding free coffee. I turned them away politely. That, in their eyes, was a big mistake on my part.\n\n\u201cI would be met by these two thugs between half six and seven in the \u00admorning telling me to get out of the city centre. I\u2019m on their patch.\u201d\n\nExtra patrols have been seen \u2013 along with armed officers \u2013 although police stressed they were routine and not linked to spice problems.\n\n(Image: Darren Casey / DCima)\n\nJohn Trott, manager of Brookes Menswear, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the chief of police come in. He said he didn\u2019t realise it was as bad as this.\n\n\u201cYou see them dealing drugs, taking drugs, shouting, arguing, using the \u00adalley as a toilet.\n\n\u201cPeople are reluctant to say anything because of the abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been building slowly for the last few years. Since they \u00adpedestrianised it all there are more places to congregate. To be fair, the police have been taking notice. Now things are better.\u201d\n\n(Image: Pictures by Darren Casey / DCima)\n\nIt is not only the \u00adshopkeepers who are affected. Former serviceman Pete Underwood, 64, said the druggies ruined a Battle of Britain memorial march in Hull last month \u2013 with one filmed slumped among poppy wreaths at the cenotaph.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey were coming up to us asking for money, out of their heads while we were marching with a band in front of us.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two or three times when we have had to move spice heads on. I don\u2019t know how I keep my temper.\n\n\u201cWe had to move sleeping bags from the cenotaph and put them over the wall.\n\n\u201cWe have even caught them urinating there.\n\n\u201cIt is disrespectful for us. We have fought for \u00adpeople like that.\u201d Another shopkeeper said; \u201cHull is a great city but all of this doesn\u2019t help on top of other economic factors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s putting people off coming into the centre because they don\u2019t want to be bothered by a beggar who might be on drugs.\n\n\u201cI suspect it\u2019s also a factor in other people not wanting to take up all the empty shop units.\u201d Police tackling anti-social behaviour in the city have \u00adarrested 400 people and issued 700 dispersal orders since June last year.\n\nAnd locals say things have improved since they installed a pop-up police pod in the centre.\n\n(Image: Pictures by Darren Casey / DCima)\n\nInspector Jules Hart said: \u201cHull is a fantastic city with a lot to offer to \u00adresidents and visitors alike and we are committed to working with the local community to make sure that it stays that way.\n\n\u201cLike all cities, there are issues and we continue to deal with anti-social behaviour, working with businesses and other agencies to try and find long term solutions.\n\n\u201cWe have set up a new city centre group with our local partners which will help us to improve the centre for businesses, traders, shoppers and residents.\n\n\u201cWe have also brought the new Humber Talking Pod to Jameson Street where it remains open for business.\n\n\u201cEveryone is invited to drop in to talk to police, fire service and council about any concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have had a brilliant \u00adresponse from the public so far with people coming to chat to us. We have already seen a difference since the pod has been in place, with a reduction in anti-social behaviour in the city centre, and we are now looking at extending its original two-week tenure until after Christmas.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make arrests and issue dispersal notices. However this is a complex issue that cannot be solved by arrests alone.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHull beat Leicester, Dundee and Swansea to become the UK\u2019s second City of Culture after Derry in Northern Ireland was the first in 2013. The \u00adhonour lasts for four years.\n\nHull City Council said: \u201cWe have outreach workers engaging with \u00adsubstance misusers on a daily basis and work exhaustively on an ongoing basis with our partner agencies who offer drugs and alcohol support services to those whom will take them up.\n\n\u201cIn addition we take every opportunity to engage with \u00adpeople who may need support, such as upon arrest in police custody and following hospital admission for drug misuse.\n\n\u201cResidents in Hull were \u00adhugely receptive to a campaign to stop giving money to those who approach them as they may be unintentionally enabling \u00adpeople to buy drugs and alcohol. Our work will continue.\u201d\n\nInvented by mistake\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\nSpice is a plant-based mix of herbs laced with synthetic chemicals meant to mimic cannabis\u2019s psychoactive substances.\n\nVideos of users slumped in town centres, parks or prison cells have been posted on social media.\n\nThe drug was made illegal in May 2016 when the Psychoactive Substances Act came into force, aiming to restrict production, sale and supply. There is pressure to upgrade spice from a Class B drug to Class A.\n\nSpice, aka K2 and black mamba, is believed to have been accidentally made in 2006 by a chemist searching for a new way of developing anti-inflammatory medication.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Shops forced to shut by gangs, armed police on 'routine patrols', traders have had death threats - Hull is being blighted by 'zombie' drug hell", "authors": ["Phil Cardy", "Image", "Pictures Darren Casey", "Dcima", "Darren Casey", "Pa", "Manchester Evening News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565854.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Pictured-is-so-called-Spice-Street-in-Hull-City-Centre.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
