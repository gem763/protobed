She was also the first female security chief, or prefect, of Milan.\n\nHer appointment should mark a break from the era of Salvini, whose hardline immigration measures included the closure of Italian ports to NGO rescue vessels and the abolition of key protections for asylum seekers.\n\nThe coalition assembled by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) also includes Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister.\n\nThe new government is expected to be sworn in on Thursday.\n\nDuring the coalition negotiations, the PD repeatedly asked the M5S to abandon the migration policies of the previous government, in which it was in coalition with the League. The key was the abolition of a Salvini-drafted security decree that provided for the seizure of NGO rescue boats and fines for vessels that brought migrants to Italy without permission.\n\nDozens of captains of rescue boats and volunteers subsequently ended up under investigation, with at least eight in the last three months.\n\nProsecutors in Ragusa on Tuesday placed the German captain and the mission chief of the Eleonore rescue ship, operated by the NGO Mission Lifeline, under investigation on suspicion of encouraging illegal immigration. The captain had declared a state of emergency onboard and defied the entry ban, landing more than 100 migrants in Pozzallo, Sicily.\n\nLast week Italian officials handed a \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3270,000) fine to the Mare Jonio, operated by the Italian NGO Mediterranea, which saved more than 100 migrants, including 22 children under the age of 10.\n\nAlthough the number of migrant arrivals in Europe has practically halved in the last two years, hundreds of asylum seekers continue to attempt the crossing from north Africa. Last week, at least two known shipwrecks were registered, according to aid groups, with a total of almost 70 people drowned, while at least two boats have been completely lost.\n\nIn recent weeks, NGO vessels have saved more than 600 people in total. A French passenger ferry headed to Marseilles from Algiers on Monday rescued 18 people off the Balearic Islands.\n\nCampaigners and aid groups hope that, with the new government and above all with the new minister of the interior, Italian policy on the migration crisis can finally change.\n\nGraziano Delrio, the PD leader in the lower house, said on Wednesday that a new immigration law has been included in the new government\u2019s political agenda.\n\nCarlotta Sami, a spokesperson for the UNHCR in Italy, said: \u201cThere is a humanitarian crisis for which everyone must feel responsible: the search and rescue at sea and the common management, at European level, of landings.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance to carry out inclusion policies towards refugees, policies that consider them a resource and not a problem. There is a lot to do, but we hope Rome will resume the central and crucial role it deserves in these issues.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn Tuesday M5S members overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the PD in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes.\n\n\u201cThis turning point is good. Now it\u2019s time to change Italy,\u201d said the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti. \u201cWe have stopped Salvini and the mere announcement of this phase is making Italy a protagonist again in Europe.\u201d\n\nSalvini, who pulled the plug on Conte\u2019s last government on 8 August seeking snap elections he hoped would boost his party, described the new pro-European coalition as \u201ca government born between Paris and Berlin and from the fear of leaving their posts, without dignity and without ideals, with the wrong people in the wrong place.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to dodge the judgment of the Italians for too long. We\u2019re ready \u2026 in the end it is us who will win.\u201d\n\nThe new ministers will face confidence votes starting on Monday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches.", "description": "Pro-European government seeks to draw line under crisis sparked by far-right leader", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112b215e93614838cfbe7d87d9c9f4913db273df/274_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8207dad4d71a2db4365a00353c23327"}
