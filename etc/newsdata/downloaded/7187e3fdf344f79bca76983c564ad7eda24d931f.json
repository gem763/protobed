The media should focus on the children\u2019s personal stories, not on the rival political agendas, Pick told the Daily Beast.com:\n\nWhen the lives of transgender youth are sensationalized and treated like political footballs, the reality of their personal struggles and needs is lost in the shuffle.\n\nSo far, the pro-transgender groups and the establishment media are following the script suggested by Pick.\n\nThe transgender ideology has hit a landmine in the form of 7-year-old James Younger.\n\nHis mother's insistence that James really is a girl named \"Luna\" forces voters to debate whether declared 'gender' will be deemed more important than science & biology. https://t.co/c9cU01MXGd \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 24, 2019\n\nThe divorce court\u2019s dramatic testimony and trial have been almost universally ignored by pro-transgender groups, including groups that loudly champion claims of transgender youth. Progressive media outlets have also minimized coverage, aside from a Washington Post article which downplayed the drama of a child facing the threat of sexual sterilization by his mother:\n\nexperts on health care for transgender children told The Washington Post that Georgulas\u2019s approach to the child would not involve any kind of surgery or hormones for years. \u2026 \u201cThe only interventions for young children is affirmation and acceptance for who they are.\u201d\n\nThe calm-down pitch was boosted by an article in the New York Daily News, which used a female name, \u201cLuna,\u201d for the boy: \u201cThe headline-generating controversy, which has been highly politicized, was seen as damaging not only to Luna, but to the transgender youth community as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe many pro-transgender groups have kept the issue off their Twitter feeds and their websites. They are instead posting low-drama events about \u201casexual\u201d people, \u201ctrans-competent health care providers,\u201d or \u201cOur program associate Mariah and friend Tristan are dressed to dismantle transphobia.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News could not find any coverage by ABC, CBS, or NBC. The New York Times disdained coverage, and even the Washington Blade \u2014 a D.C. newspaper that effectively covers gay and lesbian issues \u2014 kept the dispute off its website.\n\n\u201cThe left will always will always try to shut down debate,\u201d said Jane Robbins, an attorney and an expert on the transgender trend at the Witherspoon Institute.\n\n\u201cIt is always unwilling to engage with ideas, and it shuts down debate in this case by [promoting professional expertise], saying \u2018The experts agree, there\u2019s a consensus, this is what you\u2019re supposed to do,\u2019 and [by saying] the parents who don\u2019t get on board are either backward or bigoted,\u201d she said.\n\nBut ordinary Americans are using the Internet to share their own expertise and to debunk progressive claims, Robbins said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that [progressive] \u2018reality\u2019 can be preserved forever, and the more people, the more doctors and therapists [and] parents\u2019 rights activists who get on board with this [pushback], then we have a better shot at getting something done about it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mainstream effort to save the child has already cracked the progressives\u2019 wall of silence. For example, Pick at the Trevor Project spoke out to urge silence, and the National Center for Transgender Equality offered its supporters the opportunity for moral preening:\n\ngood morning only to people who know that all trans kids deserve love and support \ud83d\udc97 \ud83d\udc99 https://t.co/LyuFKu9yFJ \u2014 National Center for Transgender Equality (@TransEquality) October 25, 2019\n\nCharlotte Clymer, a pr manager at the Human Rights Campaign, swatted at commenters who oppose the boy being forced to undergo a lifetime of medical treatments:\n\nIt's too bad the following medical authorities think you're wrong: American Medical Association\n\nAmerican Psychological Association\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\u2026and on and on and on. https://t.co/xQuKX77yv0 \u2014 Charlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) October 24, 2019\n\nSeven year-olds are not taking hormones, you absolute goddamn clown. If you bothered to take two minutes to talk to a trans person, you would know this. But instead, like an asshole who shows up to class without doing the reading, you expect others to account for your laziness. https://t.co/KhJFGiyuzL \u2014 Charlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) October 24, 2019\n\nClymer\u2019s group has recently shifted its focus from gays and lesbians over to transgender advocacy. The group has made that shift even though there is growing evidence that some parents are sending their effeminate boy and tomboy girls \u2014 who may grow up to be gays and lesbians \u2014 back into the medical industry for surgery, hormones, and \u201ctransition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a terrible medical scandal,\u201c said Natasha Chart, a co-founder of Women\u2019s Liberation Front, a feminist group that argues that politics must be based on the capabilities and needs of women\u2019s and men\u2019s bodies.\n\nThat focus on the practical needs of human bodies is very different from transgender activists, who believe that human expertise can help liberate people from the limits of their own bodies. So without safety data and long-term studies, the transgender industry \u201cis experimenting with kids and I don\u2019t think that should be allowed,\u201d said Wolf.\n\nWhen progressives talk about crime and jail, they understand that children cannot be held fully responsible for crimes they commit, she said.\n\nBut when considering whether young children should be sent back to make life-changing medical decisions, she said, \u201cthe logic should be exactly the same as the [idea of the] \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 \u2026 [where children] are recognized as minors under someone else\u2019s guardianship [and] they cannot be making decisions like this.\u201d\n\nAlso, many progressives dare not engage in a debate, said Chart, because they fear fellow programs will ostracize them.\n\nBut progressives\u2019 extreme emphasis on fairness for marginalized groups \u2014 and their trust in their peers\u2019 professional expertise \u2014 means they feel little cause to worry about the medical risks within the transgender promise of personal liberation via medical technology:\n\n\u201cThe federal government and state governments are going to have to confront this issue,\u201d responded Robbins, adding:\n\nWhen you start to connect with people\u2019s kids, it becomes something a lot deeper than just, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t I agree with this particular economic policy\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t agree with this interpretation of history,\u201d or whatever. It becomes personal, and this issue shouldn\u2019t be a liberal or conservative thing \u2014 this is about the health and wellbeing of children.\n\nConservatives & (some) feminists agree biology shapes our personalities & politics. They're uniting to stop the progressives' ruthless \"transgender\" demand that we deny biology's impact on people & politics despite the known hazards to adults, teens & kids https://t.co/gND8VfyMOl \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 9, 2019", "description": "Progressives are trying to block the heated debate over James Younger, the seven-year-old, supposedly transgender boy in Texas.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1052957432-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
