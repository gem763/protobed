You can form your own view.

Welcome mats made from life vests salvaged from the shores of the Mediterranean, which have been hand-stitched by women in detainment camps in Greece, are also on display.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mr Stephens said that the card company, who he refused to name, allegedly initiated the legal proceedings about 12 months ago.\n\nAlthough people will be able to visit the store for the next two weeks, its doors will never open and the lights will remain on 24 hours a day. Items on display in the shop, which are only available to buy online, range in price from a \u00a310 signed spray paint can to a handbag made from a house brick.\n\n\u201cThe proceeds from these products will go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace the one confiscated by Italian authorities,\u201d Banksy said.\n\n\u201cSo you may well be committing a criminal offence by purchasing them. Sometimes you go to work and it\u2019s hard to know what to paint, but for the past few months I\u2019ve been making stuff for the sole purpose of fulfilling trademark categories under EU law. It\u2019s not a very sexy muse.\u201d\n\nOther items for sale include disco balls made from used police riot helmets and a toddler\u2019s counting toy where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck.\n\nBanksy said that despite trying to defend his artistic rights in this particular case, he has not changed his position on copyright.\n\n\u201cI still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal and amend my art for amusement, academic research or activism. I just don\u2019t want them to get sole custody of my name,\u201d he said.\n\nAmongst the crowds gathered outside the shop on Tuesday was Janet Jones, 62, who lives locally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible. The shop has been empty for a long while,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was empty yesterday, It\u2019s just happened so quickly.\u201d\n\nFour security guards, dressed in brown trench coats, were stood outside the store. They told the Press Association that they did not know who they were working for or how long the job would last.\n\nOliver Lewis, Croydon council\u2019s cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting, there\u2019s a lot of people out here generating a lot of interest.\n\n\u201cIt just popped up overnight. That\u2019s one of the great things about street art, it\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by The Independent, the Banksy installation was spotted on Tuesday in south London. Located in a formally derelict site beneath a PureGym in Croydon, and displays a number of different \u201crooms\u201d including one showing a baby\u2019s crib with CCTV cameras pointing at it.\n\nThe \u201cStormzy vest\u201d is accompanied by an explainer that reads: \u201cA version of the \u2018John Bull\u2019 English gents waistcoat updated for modern times. This customised body armour is capable of stopping bullets up to .45 calibre and is fully stab proof.\n\n\u201cAs worn by Stormzy at Glastonbury festival (because it\u2019s very dangerous there). Yet not machine washable [sic]. Signed. Edition of 5 plus 2 A/P.\u201d\n\nEast Croydon-based music therapist Fraser Moyle, 29, was on his way to work when he spotted the installation, and said a friend who works nearby told him that work appeared to begin on Saturday 28 September. The downstairs part of the building had reportedly been derelict for months.\n\n\u201cI immediately thought it could be a Banksy work due to the nature of the style, layout and political statements made in each window,\u201d Mr Moyle told The Independent. \u201cI spent the next half an hour staring in awe at the display! It\u2019s amazing to have this artwork on show so close to home, and as a musician I think having Stormzy\u2019s vest from Glastonbury in Croydon is special.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Banksy has confirmed that he\u2019s the person behind a new store featuring his merchandise \u2013 saying he had to open it\u00a0following\u00a0a legal dispute involving a greeting cards company.
