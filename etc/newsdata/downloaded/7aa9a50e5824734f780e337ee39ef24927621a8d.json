I am not authorized to answer any further questions to any reporter about Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Bloom told The Daily Beast, never mind that until last week, she had been voluble on the subject, telling BuzzFeed that her decision to aid the disgraced studio chief was \u201ca colossal mistake\u201d and lamenting to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI feel very bad, because so many people have said that they really looked up to me as this champion for women\u2026 and it\u2019s hurtful to them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nIt is extremely unusual, several lawyers told The Daily Beast, for an attorney to publicly quit a high-profile client, as Bloom did two weeks ago, and then repeatedly critique that client in the media.\n\nThe revelations around Weinstein\u2019s private life would not have been wholly surprising to Bloom.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, according to prominent litigator Thomas Ajamie, Weinstein had boasted at a breakfast meeting of the sex he had had with Hollywood actresses. (The encounter is related in full at the end of this piece.)\n\n\u201cLook I\u2019m a famous movie producer, everyone wants an Academy Award, I can really help their careers,\u201d Weinstein reportedly told Bloom and Ajamie.\n\nBloom said to Weinstein, \u201cWait, wait, wait, Harvey, you\u2019re married. Are you saying you had sex with these women while you were married?\u201d\n\nWeinstein responded, \u201cYes, Lisa, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\nTo which Bloom responded, \u201cBut your wife [Georgina Chapman] doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nWeinstein replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t tell her.\u201d Bloom said, \u201cYou\u2019re cheating on your wife, right?\u201d\n\nWeinstein said, \u201cWell, yeah, Lisa, this is Hollywood and this is what happens.\u201d\n\nBloom replied, \u201cOK, I\u2019m just a little taken aback by this. But I\u2019m not judging you or anything. I\u2019m not judging.\u201d\n\n\u201c You wanted a shortcut to fame. \u201d\n\nIn recent days Bloom, the daughter of feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, has been struggling desperately to salvage her carefully crafted\u2014and now shattered\u2014image as a crusader for women\u2019s rights.\n\nEspecially damaging was a New York Times report that after the newspaper published its Oct. 5 blockbuster about the now-fired studio chief, Bloom had contacted the board of TWC, according to leaked emails, to suggest releasing \u201cphotos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct.\u201d\n\nSoon after her secretive role as one of Weinstein\u2019s high-priced attorney/enablers was unmasked by the Times\u2014but not before she attempted to rationalize her choice of clients (\u201cAs a woman\u2019s rights advocate, I have been blunt with Harvey and he has listened to me,\u201d she claimed. \u201cI found Harvey to be refreshingly candid and receptive to my message\u201d)\u2014Bloom resigned with a flourish and embarked on a media apology tour amid a firestorm of condemnation.\n\nMcGowan, for one, was not impressed.\n\n\u201cYour very name makes my stomach clench with a stressed tightness that takes my breath away. As does your mercenary act of depravity,\u201d the actress wrote on her Facebook page in an 1,100-word indictment of Bloom. \u201cDid you think of how it would affect victims to see you champion a rapist? How it felt to those you once \u2018fought for,\u2019 for them to know that you used them. You remember them right? They were the victims of assaults, women you\u2019d previously helped. You lied to those hurt women and hid your true character. You wanted a shortcut to fame.\u201d\n\nEven Bloom\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t resist taking a shot.\n\n\u201cHad I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,\u201d Allred declared in a press release. \u201cI only represent those who allege that they are victims of sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nFarrow was initially open-minded but wary of Bloom\u2019s communications 10 months ago, according to people familiar with their contacts. The calls started when Bloom phoned him out of the blue early this year, ostensibly to offer leads for an investigation she heard he was pursuing for NBC News.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re working on a story involving NDAs in Hollywood,\u201d Bloom said, according to the sources. \u201cI know a lot about that,\u201d she added, mentioning that she could put Farrow in touch with several of her actress-clients including Angela White, aka the model and reality-television star Blac Chyna, who was preparing a tabloid-ready lawsuit against ex-fianc\u00e9 Rob Kardashian and his notorious TV family.\n\nFarrow, who didn\u2019t take advantage of Bloom\u2019s offers of help and began to suspect that she was simply trying to milk him for clues about his investigation, was initially tight-lipped concerning the real nature of his project, an expos\u00e9 of Weinstein, which was eventually published by The New Yorker after NBC executives pulled the plug.\n\nBloom was equally unforthcoming. For weeks, she didn\u2019t disclose to Farrow that she was hardly a disinterested party: She had been strategizing behind the scenes on Weinstein\u2019s legal team\u2019s behalf since the fall of 2016, according to a person with knowledge of the arrangement who spoke on condition of not being further identified.\n\nMonths before contacting Farrow in January, according to the same person, Bloom had worked to counter a New York magazine investigation of the movie mogul's misconduct that ended up not being published.\n\nFarrow, himself an attorney and a member of the New York Bar, knew none of this when he ultimately acknowledged to Bloom that he was looking into Weinstein and swore her to secrecy, thinking he could count on their mutual respect for confidentiality as fellow officers of the court. After all, he had considered the self-styled civil-rights attorney, author, and ubiquitous cable TV guest a professional friend and ally.\n\nBloom had appeared more than once on his short-lived MSNBC show, Ronan Farrow Daily, and she had been a vocal defender of Farrow\u2019s sister, Dylan, and his mother, Mia, in February 2014 when Dylan Farrow published an open letter in The New York Times alleging that Woody Allen had sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old.\n\nYet no sooner had Farrow divulged to Bloom his interest in Weinstein than executives at NBC and Hollywood\u2019s Creative Artists Agency, Farrow\u2019s professional representatives, began to receive a barrage of calls and letters, as the movie mogul (a longtime pal of NBC Universal Vice Chairman Ron Meyer and others at the company he\u2019d done business with) sought to wield every ounce of leverage to stop Farrow\u2019s investigation.\n\nWeinstein attorney Charles Harder, Hulk Hogan\u2019s former lawyer who famously helped bankrupt Gawker Media, was especially aggressive, threatening to sue Farrow personally, in what one recipient of Harder\u2019s letters (which listed Bloom as his co-counsel) described as a campaign to discredit the messenger.\n\nAccording to sources who have read them, the letters claimed Farrow was unfairly biased against Weinstein\u2014and brainwashed\u2014because of his own family history involving sexual-assault allegations.\n\nAfter NBC shut him down in August, Farrow took the Weinstein project to The New Yorker. In a belligerent screed to the magazine, a demand letter which also listed famed litigator David Boies as co-counsel, Harder continued his onslaught on Farrow\u2019s journalistic integrity.\n\nThe chagrined Boies, a longtime attorney for TWC but not for Harvey Weinstein personally, called New Yorker Editor in Chief David Remnick to dissociate himself from Harder\u2019s overheated language.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with their exchange, Boies told Remnick (who declined to comment) that he had advised Harder not to send such a letter\u2014that a legitimate publication would not be intimidated or persuaded by a personal attack on one of its writers\u2014and explained to Remnick that Boies\u2019 only goal was to give Weinstein sufficient time to respond to the allegations against him.\n\nMeanwhile, back in March, Hollywood trade publications and the Times had reported that Bloom\u2019s 2014 book on the Trayvon Martin case had been optioned by The Weinstein Company for a television docu-series to be co-produced by JAY-Z.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of Harvey\u2019s people,\u201d Bloom finally acknowledged to Farrow, who had already suspected as much.\n\nIn recent weeks, troubling questions have surfaced about Bloom\u2019s practice as an attorney\u2014notably her misleading attacks on public-radio host and Hollywood Reporter Editor at Large Kim Masters on behalf of a second wildly off-brand client, accused sexual harasser, and former Amazon Studios head Roy Price.\n\nBloom, along with her co-counsel Harder, aggressively tried to discredit Masters, whose reporting on Price\u2019s sexual harassment of producer Isa Hackett ultimately forced Price\u2019s resignation on Oct. 17.\n\nDespite being advised that her assertions were false, Bloom repeatedly claimed to a series of media outlets that considered publishing Masters\u2019 story about Price\u2019s alleged misconduct that the respected journalist had tried to shake down her client for advertising money for her weekly radio show, The Business. (The Daily Beast considered publishing Masters\u2019 story about Price.)\n\nA brief exchange of emails between Masters, Price, and Amazon Studios public-relations executive Vicky Eguia in late January and late February of 2017, well before Masters commenced her investigation, shows that Masters was simply trying to book guests involved with Amazon Studios film and television projects for interviews on her radio program.\n\nIn other words, she was doing her job.\n\nYet, in emails to editors at The Hollywood Reporter, Bloom repeatedly accused Masters of unethical behavior and conflicts of interest, suggesting the journalist was vindictively going after Price because he didn\u2019t financially support her radio program.\n\n\u201cBloom claimed to have smoking-gun evidence, but she could not produce any, because there was none,\u201d said Masters (who, full disclosure, is a longtime friend and colleague of this reporter). \u201cI thought it was pretty reprehensible.\u201d\n\nBloom declined to comment on her representation of the disgraced Price, who in July 2015, during a business trip to San Diego, allegedly propositioned Hackett, the executive producer of Amazon\u2019s The Man in the High Castle and the daughter of the late Philip K. Dick, whose novel inspired the series.\n\n\u201cYou will love my dick,\u201d Price allegedly told Hackett, a married lesbian with children, while whispering in her ear, \u201cAnal sex!\u201d\n\n\u201c Why do I need a media representative? I am in the media. \u201d\n\nSeveral unhappy former Bloom clients such as comedian Kathy Griffin, former Fox News commentator Tamara Holder, and others have come forward to claim that the lawyer seems more interested in scoring big paydays, going on television, and mingling with celebrities than in toiling on the feminist and civil-rights causes that first brought her to public attention.\n\nAfter Holder formally complained last fall to Fox News that Fox News Latino Vice President Francisco Cortes had sexually assaulted her in February 2015\u2014trapping her in his office and trying to force her to perform oral sex before she escaped\u2014Bloom led a legal team that ultimately won Holder a settlement reportedly approaching $3 million along with Fox News\u2019 public acknowledgement of the alleged incident, including the firing of Cortes (who is now suing Fox for $48 million).\n\nBloom, whose initial retainer agreement with Holder called for her to take an unusually high 40 percent of the total\u2014plus a $10,000 non-refundable fee, and various expenses including hotels and first- or business-class airplane seats \u201cat our election\u201d\u2014ultimately agreed to take one-third.\n\nGloria Allred, whom Holder also considered hiring, would only have taken her cut on an amount above the $300,000 that Fox News had already offered Holder as a severance payment. Allred\u2019s daughter, on the other hand, included the severance money in her portion.\n\nHolder, herself an attorney, had a fraught relationship with Bloom, as did Holder\u2019s business manager Michael Sanchez. Holder objected when Bloom suggested she fly to Los Angeles to hold a press conference, even though Holder lived in New York, where the alleged assault occurred.\n\nShe was further irked after Bloom left an important New York mediation session on Jan. 19 that Holder was paying for, in order to catch a train to Washington for the women\u2019s march protesting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, and again, in mid-February, when she departed for an African adventure with her husband, Braden Pollock.\n\nThe result, Holder argued, was thousands of dollars in unnecessary expenses for her as the mediation process dragged on and what she considered sloppy lawyering.\n\nHolder said Bloom was so focused on receiving her own nearly million-dollar payout that she pressured her client to sign an agreement that would have required strict non-disclosure of the sexual assault, when, from the beginning, Holder had made clear that she had already spoken to The New York Times and Wall Street Journal about the incident, before she hired Bloom, and public disclosure of the Fox News culture was far more important to her than money.\n\nBloom essentially fired Holder as a client in March after an acrimonious exchange of emails and angry phone calls.\n\nBloom declined to respond to Holder\u2019s complaints on the record, but Sanchez, who is not a lawyer and thus not bound by attorney-client confidentiality, stoutly defended Bloom in an email to The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cLisa was Tamara\u2019s hardworking champion throughout the process. This was no slam dunk and took a huge amount of effort from Lisa and me, including many weekends and all-nighters. In the end, the New York Times reported that we secured a multimillion-dollar financial settlement, including Fox News\u2019 unprecedented public statement acknowledging her sexual assault.\n\n\u201cThis was far beyond Tamara\u2019s expectations, especially when you consider she was \u2018this close\u2019 to signing a $300,000 settlement with iron-clad confidentiality prior to our representation. Bottom line: I question the priorities of someone who just won a huge, unprecedented, public victory, and instead of focusing on her abusers and helping other victims, she attacks the attorney who fought so hard to secure her victory.\u201d\n\nHowever, Sanchez\u2019s full-throated endorsement of Bloom contradicts comments he made in emails to Bloom\u2019s client, provided to The Daily Beast by Holder.\n\nOn March 2, Sanchez wrote: \u201cWe are going to use Lisa Bloom\u2019s cowardice to elevate you and destroy her. I will thank God until the day I die for her greed and all of the emails we have!!!!!\u201d\n\nOn March 1, Sanchez wrote: \u201cYou won\u2026 It is unprecedented and remarkable, even if grandstanding egomaniac negligent coward Lisa Bloom rained on our parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a dog in this fight,\u201d Sanchez told The Daily Beast by email. \u201cMy respect for Lisa Bloom, before I put her and Tamara together, was real. Today, my respect for Lisa, personally and professionally, is greater than ever. Trust me, it would be a huge mistake to cherry-pick things I said about anyone at a moment in time when I was angry at them, especially from emails leaked to a reporter.\u201d\n\nFox News contributor Jehmu Greene, a longtime Democratic operative and former Rock the Vote president, briefly considered hiring Bloom in April as Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual-misconduct scandal was heating up.\n\nGreene, an African American who\u2019d had her own unpleasant encounters with the Fox News star (he\u2019d told her to show more cleavage on the air, and lewdly suggested that he\u2019d like to, as she put it, \u201cbreak my back\u201d), recalled that she was weighing going public with her O\u2019Reilly experiences, and contacted Bloom at the suggestion of a New York Times reporter who advised that having Bloom as her attorney would enhance her credibility.\n\nAt a two-hour-long breakfast meeting at the Grey Dog coffee shop in Manhattan\u2019s West Village, Greene recalled, they discussed how Bloom could help her as an attorney, and Bloom \u201cwas eager, very available and very persistent\u201d; the lawyer pressed Greene to sign an agreement (which Bloom let her skim on her iPhone) which called for Bloom to exercise total control over Greene\u2019s media interviews, and to receive one-third of any income she earned from telling her story.\n\n\u201cWhy would I give you a percentage of anything I got from me telling my story? Why do I need a media representative? I am in the media,\u201d Greene recalls telling Bloom, who quickly agreed to remove the money clause from Greene\u2019s draft of the agreement, which\u2014much to Greene\u2019s surprise\u2014covered only media representation, not legal services.\n\n\u201cI was really turned off by just how deceptive she was being,\u201d said Greene, who didn\u2019t hire Bloom. \u201cHer whole presentation was from a legal-representation standpoint, and then she sent me over a draft agreement that basically says \u2018I\u2019m not representing you legally, I\u2019m your media representative.\u2019\u2026 It was like I was dealing with a predator\u2014and she is doing this in the environment of sexual assault and harassment to women who are vulnerable? Wow.\u201d Greene added: \u201cIt\u2019s greedy. Just greedy.\u201d\n\n\u201c The vast majority of our clients are delighted with our work. \u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast provided Bloom with a detailed summary of these criticisms. With the exception of Griffin, who gave The Daily Beast a lengthy account of her unhappy experience with Bloom after hiring the lawyer to help her navigate last summer\u2019s Donald Trump/severed-head controversy, Bloom has declined to address the specific complaints of ex-clients.\n\nInstead she offered a general defense of her record.\n\n\u201cAs a lawyer for the last 31 years (litigating for 23), I have fought hard for many men and women, mostly ordinary people in discrimination and harassment cases against powerful entities,\u201d wrote Bloom, whose eponymous law firm boasts nearly a dozen lawyers. \u201cMost of my clients come to me in great distress. We treat them with sensitivity and fight their cases aggressively.\n\n\u201cOpponents who receive my firm\u2019s letters and phone calls are often not pleased with us,\u201d Bloom continued in an email. \u201cLitigators don\u2019t win popularity contests. But the vast majority of our clients are delighted with our work and the tremendous victories we achieve in case after case. They send me beautiful thank you notes, and refer their friends and family to us.\u201d\n\nBloom also provided a list of some of her \u201chappy clients,\u201d one of whom is Nathalie Gosset, who\u2014after complaining that her boss was sexually harassing her\u2014was fired from her senior position at the University of Southern California\u2019s Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering.\n\n\u201cMy experience with Lisa is of an expert attorney who uses her life for the greater good of promoting /defending women\u2019s rights,\u201d Gossett emailed. \u201cMy story illustrates this as I am not a celeb. The legal journey is arduous with no sensational dimensions, and the fight is against a Goliath university that enforces the secrecy of arbitration. Lisa is a hero in my book.\u201d\n\nAnother satisfied customer is Blac Chyna, who\u2014after berating this reporter for several minutes for failing to say \u201cgood morning\u201d to her (\u201cIt\u2019s mean, malicious, and rude,\u201d she argued. \u201cApologize to yourself!\u201d)\u2014said this about Bloom: \u201cI respect her. She\u2019s, like, the best lawyer. She\u2019s respectful, kindful [sic], tasteful\u2014anything that you can positively expect from a person.\u201d\n\n\u201c I\u2019m a famous movie producer, everyone wants an Academy Award, I can really help their careers. \u201d\n\nWhen Ajamie met with Bloom and Harvey Weinstein during this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, Bloom was nothing if not diplomatic, according to Ajamie\u2019s account.\n\nAjamie had recently completed a damning confidential report to the board of amFAR concerning Weinstein\u2019s use of the AIDS charity in a byzantine scheme to funnel $600,000 to himself and other investors in the Broadway-bound Finding Neverland.\n\nThe Houston lawyer was understandably reluctant to have breakfast with the mogul, who had somehow gotten a copy of the report and was also angry that he\u2019d heard that Ajamie had been asking questions about allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nUnaware of Bloom\u2019s under-the-radar relationship with Weinstein, Ajamie recalled that he\u2019d reached out to her in late 2016 to ask if she\u2019d ever heard about such things; he recalled that she said she hadn\u2019t, but would he please keep her informed. At the time she told Ajamie that she\u2019d never met Weinstein.\n\nThe two lawyers developed a friendship, and Ajamie, a patron of the arts in Houston and a regular at the film festival, invited Bloom and her husband to be his guests at his Park City, Utah, condo.\n\nIn the end, Ajamie said Bloom had accompanied him to Weinstein\u2019s suite at the Main & Sky hotel.\n\nOver a two-hour breakfast, at which Ajamie said Bloom mostly listened, Weinstein alternated between venting angrily at Ajamie (\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t fuck with my art\u2014I\u2019m so passionate about my art\u201d) and reminiscing about his upbringing, his late mother Miriam, and his love of film.\n\nAt one point the conversation became particularly heated, Ajamie recalled, and Bloom chimed in: \u201cOK guys, I think what we really need here is some type of mediation between you two, and I\u2019ll be very glad to be a mediator, because you both seem to have some issues with one another, and I think it would be very constructive if we worked this out in a very civilized way. You guys are both pretty good guys. You\u2019re just seeing things differently, you have different perspectives on the world.\u201d\n\nBut Bloom seemed especially focused when Weinstein started listing the various actresses he claimed to have had sex with. \u201cLook I\u2019m a famous movie producer, everyone wants an Academy Award, I can really help their careers,\u201d Ajamie recalled Weinstein boasting.\n\nAccording to Ajamie, Bloom jumped in, saying, \u201cWait, wait, wait, Harvey, you\u2019re married. Are you saying you had sex with these women while you were married?\u201d\n\nWeinstein responded, \u201cYes, Lisa, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d To which Bloom responded, \u201cBut your wife doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nWeinstein said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t tell her.\u201d\n\nBloom said, \u201cYou\u2019re cheating on your wife, right?\u201d\n\nWeinstein said, \u201cWell, yeah, Lisa, this is Hollywood and this is what happens.\u201d\n\nBloom said, \u201cOK, I\u2019m just a little taken aback by this. But I\u2019m not judging you or anything. I\u2019m not judging.\u201d\n\nGiven this account, Bloom told The Daily Beast, \u201cI have no comment on Tom Ajamie.\u201d\n\nA representative for Weinstein has yet to respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\nUPDATE 11:32 a.m.: This story has been edited to clarify Lisa Bloom\u2019s comments to Ronan Farrow and impact on a New York magazine story.", "description": "To some clients Lisa Bloom is a passionate advocate.
