Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing ones. (You can learn more about our rating system and how we pick each item here.)\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve written about lots of games before \u2014 including the best adult board games, the best two-player board games, and the best four-player board games \u2014 here, we\u2019ve rounded up the best family board games, as praised by the most enthusiastic reviewers on Amazon.\n\nBest-rated family board game\n\nExploding Kittens Card Game 4.4 stars, 13,021 reviews \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say you\u2019ve never played a game like this before,\u201d writes one of the over 9,500 five-star reviewers of Exploding Kittens. One customer describes it \u201clike Russian roulette,\u201d while another reviewer writes, \u201cThe cards are hilarious and the pictures are completely inappropriately awesome.\u201d And lots of reviewers appreciate that the cards are as \u201crandom\u201d as Cards Against Humanity, but less crude and more family-friendly. A mother who regularly brings this game on family camping and hiking trips says, \u201cKids can play on the same level as adults and they love that.\u201d She also says that it\u2019s the perfect antidote to holiday small talk with extended family: \u201cinstead of listening to Uncle Fred\u2019s latest MAGA rant, or worse, I can bring on the Exploding Kittens.\u201d And another parent who bought it for their teenage daughter, call is \u201ca quirky, funny and flexible game that provides actual interaction in a light and funny way.\u201d $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest-rated (less expensive) family board game\n\nSpot It! $11 (was $20, now 45% off) 4.9 stars, 4,070 reviews The consensus among over four thousand reviewers is that Spot it! is \u201cgreat for all ages,\u201d and many appreciate its portability and price, as well. In fact, many adult reviewers describe this game as \u201cfun\u201d and \u201csurprisingly challenging,\u201d sharing that they keep the little tin of cards in their purse or carry-on bag to entertain impatient children on flights or in restaurants. \u201cMy son loves this game! The price was right and the tin comes in handy,\u201d one mom writes. Another reviewer says, \u201cIt\u2019s a very inexpensive game that\u2019s really easy to learn.The cries of \u2018Again! Again!\u2019 will keep you playing for hours.\u201d And this parent of 4-year-old twins calls this matching picture game \u201csimple, cheap, versatile, and durable \u2014 definitely worth checking out.\u201d $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnd now for some micro-picks of every type of family board game you might be looking for.\n\nTicket to Ride 4.8 stars, 4,542 reviews \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find a game that everyone in the family loves. This is that game,\u201d writes a satisfied parent whose kids usually have very different tastes but all agree when it comes to playing Ticket to Ride. Over 1,500 people called this a \u201cfamily game\u201d in their reviews and just over two hundred positive reviews say that it\u2019s good for \u201call ages.\u201d One grandmother who has played Ticket to Ride with people between ages 8 and 65 says that it\u2019s a favorite game in her family. \u201cThere\u2019s enough strategy in it that you can win on your own merits, but also enough of an element of chance that younger kids will enjoy,\u201d another reviewer writes. And a mother of a son who loves maps and trains, calls it a \u201cwin-win,\u201d saying, \u201cThis is a well-made game and should be in every game-loving family.\u201d $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest board game for fine motor skills\n\nMelissa & Doug Suspend Family Game (31 pcs) $16 (was $17, now 6% off) 4.6 stars, 3610 reviews When you mention fine motor skills, small children come to mind. But nearly four hundred positive reviewers confirm that this game is \u201cseriously great fun for all ages.\u201d Several reviewers also describe it as a \u201clearning tool,\u201d with one explaining, \u201cIt takes a steady hand and a careful eye for balance.\u201d A parent of three boys says \u201cmy 14-year-old can enjoy with his friends, my seven-year-old is doing very well with it, and even my five-year-old is happily focusing on his fine motor skills.\u201d She continues, \u201cThe quality and durability of it make it last in a house full of boys.\u201d And a classroom teacher writes, \u201cIt encourages players to think about weight and balance, because they have to carefully place the pieces to make sure they don\u2019t knock anything over.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest spooky board game\n\nBetrayal at House on the Hill $37 (was $50, now 26% off) 4.5 stars, 2,261 reviews \u201cThis is a good spooky board game to play with a small group of friends on a stormy night,\u201d says one five-star reviewer who describes the game as \u201cincredibly immersive and detailed.\u201d Over 200 five-star reviewers use the words \u201cspooky,\u201d \u201cscary,\u201d or \u201chorror\u201d to describe the game\u2019s vibe. And lots of reviewers say they like that each time they play Betrayal At House on The Hill is always a little bit different. One reviewer who leads a group game night says that it\u2019s the most fun he has ever had and that the artwork and design elements are nice and spooky, while keeping a fun playful atmosphere.\u201d He says it would be \u201cgreat for a Halloween game night, obviously.\u201d And another gamer writes, \u201cIf you like horror movies or general spooky stuff, this is definitely the game to get.\u201d $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest cooperative board game\n\nPandemic Board Game 4.8 stars, 2,534 reviews Over 500 positive reviewers like Pandemic because it gives players the chance to team up against the game. Several mentioned the \u201cbond\u201d they form with other players, as well as how much fun the actual game is to play. One parent who plays with his family calls it \u201ca good introduction to cooperative gaming, where all the players work together rather than competitively trying to beat each other.\u201d Another fan of Pandemic says, \u201cThis is the first cooperative game we\u2019ve owned, and we love it. None of us is particularly competitive, so we find this a really nice change from the usual.\u201d And a man whose wife is apparently crazy competitive writes, \u201cI thought to myself, it might be better if we face things together \u2014like an extension on how couples are supposed to be.\u201d $36 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest board game for music lovers\n\nSpontuneous - The Song Game $30 (was $35, now 14% off) 4.5 stars, 1,803 reviews Of the more than 1,800 reviewers, over 200 used either the phrase \u201clove music\u201d or \u201cmusic lovers\u201d in their reviews. One such reviewer who rated the game a five out of five says, \u201cI was a bit skeptical when my wife (the family music lover) brought this game up. But we found it can be played by anyone. The rules are simple and it provides lots of laughs and opportunity for interaction across generational lines.\u201d Another couple, who call themselves \u201cbig music lovers\u201d as well as \u201cfolks who love to sing,\u201d say they enjoyed both naming and \u201cbelting out songs\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t wait to play again.\u201d And a family whose youngest child is 12-years-old writes \u201cit was a blast seeing what kind of music everyone likes to listen to and racing to the punch when everyone knew the same song!\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest board game for toddlers and preschoolers\n\nWonder Forge Richard Scarry\u2019s Busytown, Eye Found It 4.7 stars, 1,174 reviews \u201cIt is so gripping that after playing it FIVE times, my toddler cried when we finally said we would have to pack it up,\u201d says a five-star mom reviewer. Other parents and grandparents report loving this six-foot-long puzzle game because \u201cit doesn\u2019t tax a toddler\u2019s attention span or patience levels\u201d and \u201cthe quality and design is excellent.\u201d Reviewers like that it\u2019s engaging for kids and not annoying for adults. And this mom says, \u201cSo far, it has been the most enjoyable board game to play with my toddler.\u201d Another appreciative reviewer who works as a speech pathologist writes, \u201cThe game presents many opportunities for conversation, counting practice, and event sequencing.\u201d $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest board game for parties\n\nCodenames $13 (was $20, now 35% off) 4.8 stars, 2,804 reviews More than 400 Codenames positive reviewers say they love breaking it out at parties. That group includes this guy who calls it \u201cthe best game to have in your arsenal,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fun for all ages and all group sizes, it is small and portable. I\u2019ve been buying copies for everyone\u2019s birthday this year!\u201d Another reviewer, says a reviewer with a family of 9 that ranges in age from 8 to 60, writes \u201cWe really like it! It\u2019s a great game that can be played with a large variety of people.\u201d But you don\u2019t have to be family to play. In fact, this reviewer who runs a board game club calls it \u201ceasily the best party game out there.\u201d And compares it to another wildly popular party game saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Codenames is that it can be quite difficult and requires creative thinking in contrast to common \u2018party games\u2019 like Cards Against Humanity.\u201d $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest team board game\n\nScattergories Game $15 (was $17, now 12% off) 4.7 stars, 1,401 reviews Scattergories reviewers call the game a \u201ccrowd pleaser\u201d and \u201calways good for a laugh.\u201d And over 700 of the positive reviews we scrolled through include the word \u201cfun.\u201d One reviewer who recommends playing on teams of kids mixed with adults says \u201cThere was no fighting because some nights one team would win and the next night because of the change in subjects another team might win. It was just an all out fun time playing together.\u201d the same reviewer also appreciated the reprieve Scattergories affords from social media and other \u201cdigital interruptions.\u201d A mother who gave the game five stars calls it \u201cGreat fun for bonding with my kids!\u201d She adds, \u201cMy teenage son was my team mate and he came up with some answers that I totally would have missed.\u201d And a woman who discovered the game while on vacations writes, \u201cNo one even missed the television!

One reviewer says \u201cThe best part of the game is making fun of your friends and family for their poor guessing and drawing skills.\u201d Another five star reviewer writes What makes this game extra special to me is you get to actively participate the whole time. Also awful drawers aren\u2019t really a drawback because their attempts add a whole new level of hilarity.\u201d And this father who wasn\u2019t sure he would enjoy a drawing game says \u201cI could describe this as \u201cTelephone\u201d with a drawing twist. But that is a serious undersell. By the time I was done with my first game, I was crying from laughing so hard.\u201d $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest strategy board game\n\nBlokus Strategy Game $15 (was $20, now 25% off) 4.8 stars, 2,678 reviews Over 450 positive reviewers reported loving this simple but competitive game because of the element of \u201cstrategy.\u201d And a ton of them called it \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201caddictive.\u201d A parent of two says \u201cOften, the games that they want to play don\u2019t have enough strategy and mental work to be interesting to an adult. But Blokus is simple and intuitive to learn, and also very much a strategy game that relies on skill so it\u2019s great for kids and adults.\u201d A reviewer who played Blokus with a 5-year-old and lost writes \u201cit can be a really fun strategy game for just about everyone.\u201d And another satisfied parent says \u201cMy son is always excited to play anyone in a quick game of Blokus, and the amazing part is that he definitely beats us more than we beat him. It gets all of us super competitive and thinking about game strategy.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
