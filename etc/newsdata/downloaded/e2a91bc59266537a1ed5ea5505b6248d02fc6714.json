It was turned down by all the major studios and financed, as a labour of love, by its ballsy British director Matthew Vaughn who was prepared to risk everything to get it made. It grossed over $500 million worldwide, proving that \u2013 contra Hollywood \u2013 audiences do have an appetite for product that isn\u2019t oppressively and relentlessly woke.\n\nWe conservatives are very good at complaining about the culture\u2019s leftist bias and of course we\u2019re right: Hollywood, TV, the publishing industry, the mainstream media do indeed all swing horribly to the left.\n\nWhat we\u2019re not so good at is doing anything to counter it.\n\nAs conservative blogger, broadcaster and former U.S. naval intelligence officer Jack Posobiec puts it:\n\n\u201cAll the Hollywood money is flowing from Beijing to Burbank which is why all we end up with is woke garbage. And if we keep consuming our entertainment in the traditional way \u2013 throwing money at whatever woke garbage Hollywood serves up \u2013 then woke garbage is all we\u2019re going to get because woke garbage is the only thing the liberal entertainment industrial complex wants to finance.\u201d\n\nI totally agree. Which is why I think we should all do our bit to support the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for Jack\u2019s comic book project Agent Poso.\n\nHere\u2019s a rough synopsis:\n\nSet ten years in the future a global threat has arisen, and the President must turn to those he can trust. An off-the-books team that works directly for him, in the shadows. For the most sensitive missions, he calls upon Agent Poso and TASK FORCE AEGIS\n\nJust like in Kingsman (which started life as a comic by Mark Millar), the bad guys are environmentalists. (And jihadists \u2013 another category of villain that the liberal-left culture industry generally prefers to play down, if it can\u2026)\n\nThat\u2019s because this is a shamelessly conservative product for a conservative readership starved of conservative culture.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe projected comic reunites many of the team involved in a previous successful crowdfunded project, Trump\u2019s Space Force.\n\nThis team includes creative director Brett Smith (who also worked on Thump: The First Bundred Days; and Clinton Cash Graphic Novel) and comics legend Chuck Dixon (the creator of Bane).\n\nYou should support it for at least three reasons: first because the product is going to be good; second because it will annoy the hell out of liberals; third because as Andrew Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture \u2013 so if we don\u2019t take winning the culture wars seriously we\u2019ll probably lose the political wars too\u2026", "description": "The real scandal about that Donald-Trump-in-shoot-out-with-the-media meme isn't that it's \"an incitement of violence against journalists\"...", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/agent-poso-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
