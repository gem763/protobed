In that decade, I\u2019ve watched failure after failure at international climate talks, rampant Republican climate denial and climate protests that built to something half-formed, clay tossed on the potter\u2019s wheel but never quite shaped.\n\nA decade into watching the climate crisis unfold and a year into watching youth activism sweep the globe, I feel comfortable saying something feels different right now.\n\nThe global strikes on Friday drew an estimated four million people into the streets, including 250,000 in New York alone according to an emailed release from climate advocacy group 350. There have been big marches before, sure, but the energy around this one was different.\n\nThe big reason was that teens were the driving force behind it. They\u2019re tragically well positioned to understand the intergenerational injustice they face. Climate change is the weight of past generations being foisted upon their shoulders, and the decisions made by adults today will determine just how much weight they have to bear.\n\nFriday\u2019s strike made that clear, and there was plenty of anger to go around at adults who have done next to nothing on climate change despite knowing the ways it could harm their children.\n\nBut the march also brought together families. In some cases, parents brought kids to be a part of it. In many other cases, it was the other way around. That represents a tectonic shift in the climate movement as well. And while the shifting plates of activism don\u2019t guarantee everything turns out fine, they do show the building blocks of a better world.\n\nWe spent the day talking with kids and their parents at the New York strikes to gain a glimpse of what\u2019s possible when we work across generations and why parents were at the strike supporting their kids. The answers below have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nMaria Ortiz and Victoria\n\nPhoto: Brian Kahn, G/O Media\n\nMaria: \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t look her in the eye and tell her I did nothing when she was born.\u201d\n\nKristin Hogue\n\nPhoto: Brian Kahn, G/O Media\n\nKristin, strike organiser Alexandria Villase\u00f1or\u2019s mum: \u201cThe climate crisis is the greatest issue humanity has ever faced. I think that the children are the moral voice of humanity right now. I think that they have it right, and adults need to be here backing them up.\n\n\u201cMy message to other parents [about whether to support their children] is to say yes.\u201d\n\nJenna Roche, Tatum Roche and Madison Encinia\n\nFrom left to right, Madison, Tatum and Jenna. (Photo: Brian Kahn, G/O Media)\n\nTatum, Jenna\u2019s daughter: \u201cOnce you believe, the rest follows. Once you believe strongly, there\u2019s nothing that can stop us from saving the planet.\u201d\n\nMadison, Tatum\u2019s friend: \u201cMy mum tells me a lot about climate change and how we can help support climate activists. When Tatum told me they were going to a march, I was like, \u2018Oh, I want to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nJenna, Tatum\u2019s mum: \u201cOur generation has proven, we can\u2019t do this. We do not have enough people in the parents generation to get behind this cause and make something happen. And children are ignited. They have a huge stake in this. It\u2019s our responsibility to really respect that mindset and really give them the wings that they need to take this planet back.\u201d\n\nChris Salata and Donette Van Cleve\n\nPhoto: Brian Kahn, G/O Media\n\nChris, Donette\u2019s son: \u201cI think in most lenses, I\u2019m the black sheep of my family. I know that what we\u2019re doing is leading to some really beautiful things. I\u2019m doing things that I think even if they\u2019re not seen have very important benefits, and I feel much more supported having my mum here.\u201d\n\nDonette: \u201cI\u2019m a very traditional mother. I\u2019ve grown up in a very traditional lifestyle, and this is completely new thinking. But I believe that we need visionaries, we need people that have, you know, that are looking ahead, that aren\u2019t just focused on just this moment, so I\u2019m really proud of him.\u201d\n\nKristian Nammack, Zayne Cowie and Solomon Beckler\n\nFrom left to right, Solomon, Kristian and Zayne. (Photo: Brian Kahn, G/O Media)\n\nKristian, \u201ceco dad\u201d but not related to Zayne or Solomon: \u201cThis is a youth march, and so I\u2019m trying to take the backseat and just trying to be supportive. I\u2019m thinking of myself as like an eco dad. I\u2019m not their dad but just a general eco dad. I have a bag full of snacks, water, sunscreen and Band-Aids. And I\u2019m trying to take the back seat and facilitate them doing their thing.\u201d\n\nZayne, climate striker and Greta Thunberg protector: \u201cYou have snacks?\u201d\n\n[after passing on a Kind bar] \u201cI\u2019m not a planner, but all I know is I definitely would not have a bunch of speeches. It\u2019s boring right now because it wasn\u2019t actually organised by the youth.\u201d\n\nSolomon, climate striker: [in response to what he would tell parents if their kids asked to strike] \u201cLet them.\u201d", "description": "I\u2019ve reported on or otherwise worked in the climate field for 10 years.
