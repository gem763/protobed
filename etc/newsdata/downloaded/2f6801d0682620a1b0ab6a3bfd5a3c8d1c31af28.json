The Park Service proposal to charge for security, announced in August 2018, would have added a hefty price tag for organizers of larger events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf someone called me to say, \u2018I want to have a protest,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Cool, the Park Service is going to charge you $150,000 for security,\u2019 they would hang up the phone,\u201d Samantha Miller, an organizer with DC Action Lab, a company that helps plan demonstrations in Washington, said recently. \u201cThere are already a lot of preexisting fees that organizers get asked to pay. Add in something like a security fee, and there\u2019s just no way most people or organizations would be able to afford it.\u201d\n\nAbout 750 First Amendment demonstrations converge on the Mall annually. The largest rallies often require additional support from Park Service personnel and Park Police to ensure safety and to limit harm to federal land, which prompted the agency to seek ways for recouping those costs.\n\nThe Park Police has requested hundreds of thousands of dollars in emergency funding over the past two years to support such events. In a statement, the Park Service said the volume and complexity of permit requests has increased substantially in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMara Verheyden-Hilliard, executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, said her organization was ready to file suit had the new proposals gone through.\n\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary victory for the people of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it says, without question, to this administration that the people of the U.S. will not be silent. They will not accept any effort to shut down their ability to speak out and to stand up for what they believe in.\u201d\n\nCivil rights organizations on both sides of the political spectrum had voiced opposition to the proposal. A coalition of eight organizations \u2014 led by the American Civil Liberties Union and composed of organizations that include the left-leaning Public Citizen and the NAACP, as well as the conservative Charles Koch Institute and the March for Life Education and Defense Fund \u2014 sent a letter to members of Congress in April to oppose the proposed changes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe ACLU expressed satisfaction with Monday\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThe National Park Service\u2019s retreat should serve as a reminder that if the administration tries to come after our right to protest, it will have to get through thousands of ACLU members and supporters first,\u201d senior legislative counsel Kate Ruane said in a statement.\n\nPark Police budgets obtained by The Washington Post through the Freedom of Information Act earlier this year show the \u00adanti-gun-violence March for Our Lives in 2018 cost Park Police about $153,596 to secure. Park Police spent about $77,508 on security later that year for the Unite the Right 2 rally, in which a small group of white nationalists gathered near the White House as thousands of counterprotesters took to the streets to meet them.\n\nAD\n\nThe Park Service said it received more than 140,000 comments about the proposal. The agency also had weighed limiting the number of people who can gather without a permit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn response to the feedback we received from the public, the National Park Service has decided to make no changes to the regulations,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate that so many people are engaged and interested in the management and care of their national parks.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Opponents said the plan would have curtailed public demonstrations.", "authors": ["Michael E.
