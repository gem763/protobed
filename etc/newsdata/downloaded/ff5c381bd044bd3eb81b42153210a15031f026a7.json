Unfortunately, smart blinds are very expensive. I know this, because five years ago I paid way too much for a professionally installed pair. That\u2019s all about to change now that Ikea has launched its first blinds in a bid to democratize the smart home.\n\nIkea\u2019s Fyrtur and Kadrilj smart blinds are much cheaper than the incumbents, and they don\u2019t require professional installation. I recently installed the Fyrtur Blackout roller blinds on a single window in my house. They\u2019re slightly more expensive (starting at $129) than the Kadrilj blinds, but the Fyrtur model offers greater privacy and light control \u2014 the two are otherwise identical.\n\nWe first heard about Ikea\u2019s smart blinds in January. Since then, they\u2019ve had a couple of false starts. They were promised for a US release on October 1st but they\u2019ve since been delayed again, even though they\u2019re now available in Canada. Whenever they do arrive, I can assure you that they\u2019ll be worth the wait.\n\nOur review of Ikea Fyrtur Blackout blinds Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Relatively inexpensive\n\nFlexible control options including timers\n\nGood privacy and light management Bad Stuff No sunset or sunrise options for timers\n\nIkea\u2019s frustrating Tradfri gateway and Home smart app\n\nOnly Google Assistant support at launch Buy for $129.00 from Ikea\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to cover one particular window with a smart blind for years but the cost was too prohibitive. See, the window in question lights a stairwell during the day but lets a rather nosey neighbor peer directly into my office at night. It\u2019s already fitted with an Ikea blind that I usually forget to lower to the delight of the creep across the way. No more.\n\nIkea\u2019s smart blinds come in a variety of fixed widths, from 23 inches to 48 inches in the US, or 60 cm to a wider 140 cm in Europe. All are 77-inches (195-cm) long. The blinds ship with a pre-paired up/down wireless remote that can control the blinds right out of the box. You\u2019ll need Ikea\u2019s $30 Tradfri gateway installed on your network, however, to integrate the blinds into your smart home. The package also includes a signal repeater to extend the Ikea Zigbee network beyond the reach of the gateway. The repeater is fitted with an empty USB port to charge (with included Micro USB cable) the removable battery that inserts into the front-left of the blind assembly.\n\nThe blinds are completely cordless, and can be controlled via two dedicated buttons built directly into the front-left corner of the blind mechanism. The blinds can also be controlled via the Ikea Home smart app where you can define timers for regular routines and assign blinds to groups for coordinated control. The blinds are compatible with Ikea\u2019s burgeoning lineup of \u201cHome smart\u201d devices, including Symfonisk speakers, and Tradfri smart outlets, lights, switches, dimmers, and motion sensors.\n\nI was able to add the blinds to my Google Home for voice control. Alexa and HomeKit failed to discover them, however, though Ikea says that Amazon\u2019s and Apple\u2019s smart home platforms will eventually be supported. That could explain the delay of the US launch which had previously been pegged to the availability of all three voice assistants.\n\nRequires the patience of a saint\n\nAdding the blinds to the Tradfri gateway is frustrating. As I said with the review of Ikea\u2019s little Sonos remote control, the overall experience is plagued by dropped connections, failed pairings, and resets. It eventually works, but getting all the pieces to fall into place requires the patience of a saint. I did find that the Home smart app on Android is more stable than iOS, with far fewer dropouts when communicating with the Tradfri gateway.\n\nMounting the blinds to the window is much easier. They\u2019re heavier and bulkier than the typical Ikea blinds but the two-pronged mounts are essentially the same (just deeper).\n\nOnce installed and joined to the gateway, the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is set the max length of the blinds (they can not be cut). This can be done using the buttons embedded near the corner of the blind assembly (next to the battery). Hold the lower button until the blinds reach to the bottom of the window, release it, and then click the button twice. The blinds will do a little dance to signal the new maximum length. Now, when you lower the blinds to 100 percent they\u2019ll only drop to the bottom of the window, not unfurl to the floor.\n\nThe in-app timers are perfect for something like a morning alarm, allowing you to raise the blinds just a little to help you wakeup. Not that you\u2019ll likely sleep through the noise the blinds make if they\u2019re installed in your bedroom. They\u2019re loud, but not any worse than my professionally installed smart blinds.\n\nFor my needs, the timers fall just short of ideal because they don\u2019t allow me to set local sunrise and sunset times as triggers to raise and lower the blinds. As such, I\u2019ll have to find a workaround, or manually adjust the timings throughout the year if I want optimal light and privacy control in my stairway window. There\u2019s also no easy, out-of-the-box ability to make the blinds respond to third-party light or temperature sensors \u2014 but with Zigbee, anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort.\n\nFitting a home with Ikea\u2019s Fyrtur or Kadrilj blinds won\u2019t be cheap, but it\u2019ll be far less costly than smart blinds from brands like Somfy or Luxaflex. I just hope you like grey or darker grey, because those are the only colors available at launch.\n\nIkea\u2019s Fyrtur and Kadrilj smart blinds are rolling out slowly around the world. In some countries they can be delivered directly to your home, in others, they\u2019re only available for in-store purchase.", "description": "I recently installed the Fyrtur Blackout roller blinds on a single window in my house.
