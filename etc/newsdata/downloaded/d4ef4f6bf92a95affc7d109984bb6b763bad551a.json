The vote fell completely along party lines and was killed in a 218 to 185 vote. Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican turned Independent, sided with Democrats, CBS News reported.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) slammed Democrats for failing to hold Schiff accountable.\n\n\u201cEach member of Congress must uphold a high standard of honesty and integrity. When it comes to matters of our national security, that responsibility is even greater. Chairman Schiff has fallen short in his duty. From claiming he had evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign to covering up his committee\u2019s relationship with the whistleblower, he has demonstrated a pattern of lying to the American people on matters of intelligence,\" McCarthy said in a statement. \"The grave missteps of Chairman Schiff call for the necessary response of the full House of Representatives to vote to censure. Today\u2019s vote only further illustrates the Democrats\u2019 ignorance to Chairman\u2019s Schiff\u2019s reckless behavior and underscores their blind determination to damage this country.\u201d\n\nSchiff took to Twitter to slam Republicans for their \"lack of courage.\"\n\nIt will be said of House Republicans,\n\n\n\nWhen they found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history,\n\n\n\nThey consoled themselves by attacking those who did. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) October 21, 2019\n\nEarlier in the day, President Trump tweeted his support of the measure.\n\nAdam Schiff is a Corrupt Politician! https://t.co/16aSrqjwu2 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2019\n\nThe measure was introduced by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and had 184 co-sponsors. The bill laid out numerous reasons Schiff should no longer lead the impeachment inquiry. One of the biggest issues Republicans had with Schiff's leadership was telling his own version of the call that took place between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Schiff's story was entirely made up and not based on the unredacted, unclassified transcript.", "description": "This just in..10/22/2019 9:26:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
