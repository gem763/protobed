Purdy also ran for 102 yards and two touchdowns for the Cyclones (3-2, 1-1), who beat the Horned Frogs for just the third time in 11 tries.\n\n\u201cI think Brock is really special. I don\u2019t know if I have any different feeling for the words I can use for to describe Brock,\u201d Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who gives us an ability (as) a dual threat football player.\u201d\n\nTCU (3-2, 1-1), down 35-10 after three quarters, made things interesting by getting a touchdown run from Darius Anderson and a 22-yard TD grab by Jalen Reagor to make it a 35-24 game with nine minutes left.\n\nBut Purdy\u2019s fourth TD of the day, a 9-yard run, put the Cyclones ahead by 18 with 6:27 left. Purdy now has 10 TD passes, five TD runs and just two interceptions - and he finished with at least 300 combined yards for the fourth straight game.\n\n\u201cHonestly I just kept telling the guys to have fun. And that was like the theme going into this game, because we\u2019ve been playing uptight and things like that the past couple of games,\u201d Purdy said. \u201cWhen they scored and made it close again nothing changed. We decided to just keep having fun.\u201d\n\nEyioma Uwazurike\u2019s 1-yard scoop and score on a fumble put the Cyclones ahead 14-3 early in the second quarter. Purdy then made it 21-3 on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Kolar, and his 10-yard TD run put Iowa State up 28-3 early in the third quarter.\n\nFreshman Max Duggan got TCU within 28-10 on a short TD pass to Reagor. Iowa State answered by going 75 yards in just five plays, and Johnnie Lang\u2019s 3-yard touchdown run pushed the Cyclones back ahead by 25.\n\n\u201cThey kicked our butts,\u201d TCU coach Gary Patterson said.\n\nDuggan was 17 of 25 passing for 219 yards and two TDs for TCU. But Anderson ran for just 49 yards, snapping his streak of 100-yard games at three.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa State: This was the breakout game the Cyclones were searching for. Iowa State\u2019s offensive line played its best game in recent memory and its defense largely took away Anderson, forcing the Horned Frogs to become one dimensional. \u201cI thought we played in a really good rhythm,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe were aggressive on both sides of the game early. When things got a little awkward there late in the game and we needed to make a play, we made a play.\u201d\n\nTCU: After a rough start, Duggan settled in and brought the Horned Frogs back into the game - albeit briefly - in his return to his home state. The upcoming bye week should only help Duggan\u2019s progress moving forward.\n\nLANG\u2019S TIME\n\nWhile Purdy continues to be Iowa State\u2019s best threat running the ball, Johnnie Lang might be inching closer to becoming the Cyclones\u2019 starting running back. Lang had 72 yards on a team-high 16 carries. \u201cI really thought Johnnie Lang played a great game, his best game to date. That\u2019s really exciting. He\u2019s practicing great and he showed it on the football field,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cWe say it all the time. You can\u2019t beat yourselves. You\u2019ve got to take ballgames when you\u2019re on the road playing in somebody else\u2019s house,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWe did not do that.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa State plays at West Virginia on Oct. 12\n\nTCU has a bye next week. The Horned Frogs play at Kansas State on Oct. 19\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iowa State's offensive strategy this season has been to let quarterback Brock Purdy try to make as many plays as possible.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/tcu_iowa_st_football_86576_c0-164-3912-2444_s1770x1032.jpg?c6747fa06dec7716c62598690afcbda329fd5429", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
