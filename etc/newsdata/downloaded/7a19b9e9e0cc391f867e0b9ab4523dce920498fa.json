They are a lit by an electronic glow from within, just to intensify their lustre. For gymnasts Becky and Ellie Downie, it is a fitting touch, since the prizes brought back from this month\u2019s world championships in Stuttgart count as the most precious they have ever won. The sisters might be 7\u00bd years apart in age, and scarred by recent injury ordeals, but on the same day, in the same city, they each seized their reward with the same gloriously defiant flourish.\n\nA silver for Becky on uneven bars, and a bronze for Ellie on vault: it is the type of medal haul that British gymnastics would once have hardly dared target for an entire team, let alone two siblings. For Becky in particular, the satisfaction is all the richer for the anguish that has gone before. At last, after her non-selection for the London Olympics and her failure to qualify for the Rio final four years later, she has scotched preconceptions that she would always shrivel on the global stage.\n\n\u201cNo one has any idea what goes into each day in the life of a gymnast,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time off, ever, and there are far more lows than highs. After Rio, I thought, \u2018How many more disappointments do I have to keep taking? Eventually, I decided I had one more Olympics left in me. By Tokyo next summer, I\u2019ll be 28. That is significantly old for a female gymnast, and this is the hardest cycle I have ever done. I\u2019d like to write a book soon. I often wondered if it would have a happy ending. The fairytale doesn\u2019t always come.\u201d", "description": "At the family home in Hucknall, a peaceful Nottingham suburb, the medals are still shimmering in the hallway.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213395022-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
