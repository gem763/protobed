For one British author, it saved her life.", "language": "en", "text": "Ella Risbridger\u2019s new cookbook opens predictably enough: \u201cThere are lots of ways to start a story, but this one begins with a chicken.\u201d Here is the universal emblem of home cooking in the West \u2014 the poultry for every pot.\n\nThe second sentence is a little more ambiguous. \u201cIt was the first story I ever wrote about food, and it begins with a chicken in a cloth bag hanging on the back of a kitchen chair.\u201d\n\n[On the anniversary of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s birth, it\u2019s time we talk about depression]\n\nAnd then the third. \u201cIt was dark outside, and I was lying on the hall floor, looking at the chicken through the door, and looking at the rust in the door hinges, and wondering if I was ever going to get up.\u201d\n\nSpoiler alert: As the British writer promises, \u201cthis is a hopeful story \u2026 a story about wanting to be alive.\u201d But before she wanted to be alive, she didn\u2019t. What she thought about, in the hospital, after attempting to step in front of a London bus, was baking pie. \u201cI remember the pie, and I remember the way I worked through each ingredient, step by step, and how, when the duty psychiatrist asked me why, I could only think of short crust and soften the leeks in Irish butter until translucent and rub the butter into the flour and bind with milk,\u201d she writes. It\u2019s one of the only things she remembers about that hospital. And it was all she could think about until she went home and, with some assistance, made that pie. It was a small triumph that helped her begin to see that she had survived, that maybe she would \u201cstop crying all the time\u201d and, perhaps, \u201ccarry on cooking.\u201d She did.\n\n\n\nElla Risbridger, author of \u201cMidnight Chicken,\u201d right. (Gavin Day and Bloomsbury Publishing)\n\n\u201cMidnight Chicken (& Other Recipes Worth Living For)\u201d is the record of Risbridger\u2019s learning to cope: \u201ca kind of guidebook for falling back in love with the world, a how-to of weathering storms and finding your pattern and living, really living.\u201d\n\nShe might have written a memoir with recipes, the format followed by Nora Ephron, Madhur Jaffrey, Nigel Slater and Ruth Reichl, to name a few. But Risbridger has instead given us a cookbook she hopes we get full of crumbs and sticky with sauce and syrup.\n\nShe didn\u2019t intend to write a cookbook at age 21, when she set out on what would be a five-year project. But cooking saved her life, and she hoped to pass that along in an actionable way. \u201cI wanted the book to be useful. Actually, I think that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s a cookbook, not a memoir,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s things in there that are helpful.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, \u201cMidnight Chicken\u201d turns out to be a double departure; Risbridger dares to share her experience with depression while also offering recipes as prescriptions for happiness. In addition to roasting chicken, preparing Uplifting Chilli & Lemon Spaghetti, Stuck in a Bookshop Salmon & Sticky Rice, or Life Affirming Mussels can be a path to a better state of mind.\n\nIt is cooking as self-help and, as the book\u2019s introduction presents it, \u201ca kind of framework of joy on which you could hang your day.\u201d Cooking is also, she emphasized in an interview, a \u201cbroad church\u201d with \u201croom for everybody,\u201d and this is especially important because, for her, it is \u201calways bound up with mental health and self care, but in a very basic sense,\u201d which, she distinguishes, is not the same as \u201cbubble baths and shopping.\u201d\n\n\n\nRuby Tandoh, author of \u201cEat Up!\u201d (Leah Pritchard and Serpent\u2019s Tail)\n\nDiscussions of maintaining physical and psychic equilibrium that revolve around food have tended to adhere to one of two tropes: those endorsing the health benefits and balancing properties of particular ingredients or types of dishes, and those justifying indulging in \u201ccomfort food.\u201d The first is tinged with obligation and virtuousness, while the second often seems to bear the taint of guilt. Neither implies pure, unfettered enjoyment. Both are fixated on eating. Before \u201cMidnight Chicken,\u201d cooking itself had mostly been left out of the conversation, at least in cookbooks.\n\nBeyond cookbooks, a number of writers have touched on the positive psychic effect preparing food has had on them. Ruby Tandoh\u2019s recent book \u201cEat Up! Food, Appetite and Eating What You Want\u201d wields pleasure as a weapon against the restrictions of the health food and diet industries. It\u2019s aimed at eaters, but she doesn\u2019t leave out cooking altogether. She says her own relationship to cooking corroborates the results of a 2016 study that found young people who participated in quotidian creative hobbies \u2014 such as cooking untried recipes \u2014 saw a more noticeable \u201cupward spiral\u201d in their well-being, inventiveness and positive energy than those who hadn\u2019t. \u201cJust taking a half an hour out of the day to be in the kitchen cooking, experimenting, tasting and feeling can be enough to drag me out of the slump of my depression,\u201d Tandoh writes.\n\nLike Tandoh, David Leite, founder of the blog Leite\u2019s Culinaria, has been open about his struggles with mental health. In \u201cNotes on a Banana: A Memoir of Food, Love, and Manic Depression,\u201d he recalls his first professional culinary job, as the family cook for a college professor. He found that arranging his ingredients in the right order (what the pros refer to as mise en place, or \u201cput in place\u201d) provided a \u201ckind of pleasure,\u201d in that it allowed him \u201cto impose control and order on something\u201d even when he couldn\u2019t do the same for himself. \u201cAt times, rare and unexpected, I\u2019d feel small, almost imperceptible shivers of happiness,\u201d he writes.\n\n\n\nAnn Yang, co-founder of Misfit Foods. (Morgan West)\n\nAnn Yang, co-founder of Misfit Foods, sees her relationship to cooking as \u201cnot about control at all.\u201d In July, she penned an essay for Bon App\u00e9tit in which she disclosed she had been diagnosed with depression and, at 25, decided to step away from the successful business she built to take care of her mental health. Making meals for friends is one of the activities she has identified as a productive way of managing stress and a sense of alienation.\n\nDistinct from baking, she said in an interview, cooking involves \u201cbeing very comfortable with ambiguity\u201d and \u201cthe idea that things might not turn out as you expected them.\u201d The feeling of achievement that comes with the completion of a task \u2014 and one she can execute in a set amount of time \u2014 helps her. \u201cIt has the same sort of creative satisfaction of painting, but on top of that there\u2019s this additional gratification, sense of accomplishment and peace around taking care of people you love,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing able to really feel like you can express to someone that you care about them in a different way that\u2019s not verbal, or like physical touch, is also really powerful and therapeutic.\u201d\n\nLeite agrees. When he\u2019s \u201ccooking for family and friends, it is still a source of joy,\u201d he said via email. \u201cI feel a sense of self-care by caring for others.\u201d And he still reaps the centering rewards of preparation. \u201cAny repetitive task seems to help me. Chopping vegetables, stirring risotto, whipping cream. I kind of flip into kitchen hypnosis, if you will. It keeps me very much in the moment \u2014 mindful.\u201d\n\nCooking can also serve as a powerful and restorative way to handle loss. In July, former criminal barrister Olivia Potts released \u201cA Half Baked Idea,\u201d her memoir about baking her way out of grief and lawyering after her mother died. Along the way, the British author discovered that cooking could be \u201cmeditative\u201d (setting marmalade to simmer), \u201cenlivening\u201d (toasting spices in a dry pan), \u201cexhilarating\u201d (flambeing crepes suzette) and \u201cpure joy\u201d (\u201cthe moment that honeycomb billows\u201d). \u201cThere was something calming about recipes \u2014 a set of instructions that, if followed properly, would result in a predictable outcome,\u201d she writes. \u201cEverything around me was dissolving into uncertainty, but here, consequences followed neatly, from actions.\u201d Nigella Lawson has posited that cooking can be a form of keeping the deceased present and said that writing her first book, \u201cHow to Eat,\u201d allowed her to continue her relationship with her mother, who died when Lawson was 25.\n\n\n\nDavid Leite, author of \u201cNotes on a Banana\u201d (Bob Carey and Dey Street Books)\n\nThat same book helped fellow British cookbook author Diana Henry through her postnatal depression. Similarly, in Chrissy Teigen\u2019s second cookbook, \u201cCravings: Hungry for More,\u201d she opened up about her postpartum depression and acknowledged the role cooking played in getting her back into her normal routine. In Henry\u2019s case, it was less about the actual cooking and more about the anticipation of it. \u201cI contemplated the lunches I would make when I felt more up to it. Things were going to be all right,\u201d she wrote in an essay for the Telegraph last year. \u201cMany \u2014 mostly women \u2014 have used \u2018How to Eat\u2019 not just as a cookbook but as a balm during periods of depression, divorce or illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMidnight Chicken\u201d seems poised to emerge as a balm for a new generation of cooks. And it might be the first of many. Next month, \u201cThe Art of Escapism Cooking\u201d by Taiwanese-born, Hong Kong-based food blogger Mandy Lee will be published in the United States. Lee records her agonizing displacement \u2014 and the cooking that helped her endure it \u2014 when she moved from New York to Beijing for her husband\u2019s job.\n\nFor Risbridger, the key to encouraging a restorative approach to cooking is not to enforce it as another avenue for achieving perfection. That makes \u201cMidnight Chicken\u201d an antidote to so much current recipe-driven food content, either reproachful (in the BuzzFeed manner of \u201cThings You\u2019re Doing Wrong\u201d articles) or competitive (the quest to have the most photogenic, correctly finished dish on Instagram). She assures readers that her recipes can be executed while tipsy, left on the stove too long and made with ingredients you can be careless in measuring.\n\nMost of her repertoire is for people who are short on time and cash. Because, as Tandoh points out in \u201cEat Up!,\u201d that\u2019s where reality can put a pin in this otherwise positive premise: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that the narratives around cooking for pleasure \u2014 as opposed to cooking for sustenance or money \u2014 are all rooted in bougie rituals of going to the farmers market, traveling the world for recipe ideas, or spending an eternity making cute jars of jams.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlackened Broccolini and Bittersweet Almonds on Toast. See recipe link, below. (Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n[Make the recipe: Blackened Broccolini and Bittersweet Almonds on Toast]\n\nIn an email interview, she confessed her own \u201cinconsistent relationship with cooking.\u201d Making a quick weeknight dinner for one doesn\u2019t readily present itself as the desirable option. What she does relish are the more lavish, time-consuming productions, and for her, that means baking. \u201cThe fact that the food I cook in these moments isn\u2019t daily fare, isn\u2019t just nutrition, doesn\u2019t fulfill any real purpose aside from pleasure \u2014 that\u2019s precisely what makes it feel good,\u201d she noted. \u201cI\u2019ve still got some work to do when it comes to practicing what I preach and rediscovering the special moments in the everyday.\u201d\n\nShe might start with toast. Risbridger\u2019s is heaped with blackened broccoli and almonds and asks so little of us; it all comes together in one roasting pan (or baking sheet), crisping of the bread included. Making toast hardly seems like cooking at all. But that\u2019s the point, and this one is quite the satisfying gateway; you get some meditative chopping in there, the rush of the heat, and the dramatic, risky business of charring. Still, you\u2019re just making toast. No big deal.\n\nFor some, toast may be too much. Yang emphasized that depression is different for everyone. Taking to the kitchen isn\u2019t a universal panacea. But even if we haven\u2019t all been diagnosed, we do face worry, despair and estrangement, and we have to eat to survive; it\u2019s as good as any endorsement to at least try cooking. It might just save a life.\n\nDruckman is editor of the upcoming book \u201cWomen on Food.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nAntoni Porowski is more than \u2018Queer Eye\u2019s\u2019 avocado hunk.
