He says that crowding means risks are rising.\n\nStill, he said market bears were going to be disappointed because a steep immediate drop in the broad S&P 500 index is unlikely.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nUS stocks are stuck in neutral, and Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, is telling investors they won't get unstuck soon.\n\nWilson has taken a downbeat stance on the market based on forecast recession in company earnings, as S&P 500 profits are essentially flat this year, while smaller companies are reporting a decline. And he said there was reason to expect further weakness, since profit estimates will soon fall as well.\n\nMeanwhile, he thinks the risk of a recession is increasing as the trade war with China lingers, and that there are signs the economy is losing steam, with growth falling short of what investors hoped for. So investors are making broadly similar trades, meaning that much of the market's risk is concentrated in just a few areas.\n\n\"Returns have come from a narrower group \u2014 defensives, high quality, and secular growth \u2014 while cyclical or low quality stocks have lagged,\" he wrote in a recent client note.\n\nHe added that trying to figure out when the situation would change has been \"frustrating and unprofitable\" for investors.\n\nWhy the next downturn will defy expectations\n\nWilson said fading earnings and worsening growth would hurt stocks, but he thinks a market slump may not look like investors expect. In the end, he expects bearish investors to be disappointed.\n\nThat's because the S&P 500 itself has turned into a defensive asset during times of turmoil, as it attracts a lot of passive investment that supports prices. He also said that its transparency, quality, and liquidity were all high relative to other indexes around the world.\n\nStill, based on the challenges he is anticipating, Wilson says it's time for investors to unwind some of their trades. He advises investors to go long on those companies and short secular-growth companies, as well as firms with high valuations and negative cash flows.\n\n\"We are moving from the perception that this is late cycle to end of cycle, and, when that happens, defensive stocks outperform growth stocks,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Late 2015/2018 growth scares saw defensives outperform secular growth by ~25% and recent moves only put us halfway there.\"\n\nWays to play a downturn\n\nInvestors looking for basic broad exposure to defensive stocks can gain it through exchange-traded funds like the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF.\n\nWilson added that he was also shorting semiconductor makers because the stocks have traded higher relative to some recent manufacturing data, and they're vulnerable to cuts in earnings estimates.\n\nIn his view, Wall Street struggles to predict corporate earnings that are more than a year away and just assumes that whatever trend is current will continue. The result, he said, is that the stock market is forecasting decent growth even though results are getting worse.\n\n\"We think the market (at the index level) has generally ignored the poor results to date simply because the 12 month forecasts have yet to fall,\" he said in a note to clients. \"That should put downward pressure on the index like it has for the small and mid cap indices all year.\"\n\nHe shows those falling earnings projections in this chart, saying the S&P 500 could follow the small cap Russell 2000 and S&P 400 MidCap indexes lower.\n\nMike Wilson of Morgan Stanley says earnings forecasts for larger companies are likely to drop, following the lead of smaller and mid-size companies. Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley Research\n\nThat means that even if the S&P 500 were defensive, there's little hope for major improvement in an environment of weakening growth and earnings.\n\n\"Even with this inherent advantage, the S&P 500 has delivered subpar returns over the past 12 months with increasing volatility,\" Wilson said.", "description": "Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley says investors should get defensive in response to falling earnings but that a sharp market sell-off is unlikely.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d935aeb2e22af5aff1a5e85?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
