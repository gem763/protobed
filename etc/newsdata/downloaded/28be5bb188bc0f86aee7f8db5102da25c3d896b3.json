Erica Smith and former state Sen. Cal Cunningham.\n\nAt the same time, Tillis is facing a primary challenge from retired Raleigh businessman Garland Tucker, and there are signs that he\u2019s already beginning to take the contest seriously. He unveiled a $2.2 million television and radio ad buy on Monday touting his work with Trump. That ad campaign is slated to run through North Carolina\u2019s March 3 primary.\n\nTillis\u2019s critics say the ad campaign is a sign of growing concern about his standing among the state\u2019s conservative primary voters. One North Carolina Republican official familiar with the Senate race said that many core GOP voters in the state are \u201cdisaffected\u201d by Tillis.\n\n\u201cThe base is indifferent on him,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey don\u2019t love him, but they don\u2019t hate him.\u201d\n\nThe price tag for the ad buy is substantial, accounting for more than half of the $4.3 million in cash on hand Tillis reported at the end of June.\n\n\"You don\u2019t spend half your cash on hand this early on a primary challenger that you\u2019ve been trying to dismiss as not a threat up to this point,\u201d one Democratic official familiar with Senate races said.\n\nTillis\u2019s campaign said that it\u2019s always been their plan to ramp up campaigning after two special House elections in North Carolina\u2019s 3rd and 9th districts concluded. The ad buy, the campaign said, is intended to draw an early contrast between Tillis and his eventual Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nThe senator\u2019s allies are also quick to dismiss concerns about his record, pointing to his voting record in the Senate \u2014 he\u2019s voted in line with Trump\u2019s position 93.3 percent of the time, according to an analysis by the data website FiveThirtyEight \u2014 and his past work as a state representative.\n\n\u201cI think [his primary opponents] are going to have to define the issues where Thom Tillis wasn\u2019t far enough on the right because I haven\u2019t found them,\u201d Pat McCrory, a Republican who served as governor while Tillis was Speaker of the North Carolina state House, told The Hill.\n\n\u201cWhen he was Speaker of the House and I was governor \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know what specific issues you can go after him for.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican officials and operatives said that the criticism of Tillis from the right \u2014 and the boos at Trump\u2019s rally last week \u2014 stem from his early opposition to Trump\u2019s emergency declaration allowing construction to begin on a wall along the United States' southern border.\n\nTillis, who initially outlined that opposition in an op-ed in The Washington Post, eventually reversed course and voted against a Senate measure disapproving of the declaration. But his chief primary opponent, Tucker, has sought to capitalize on that about-face to cast Tillis as insufficiently conservative, only willing to embrace Trump when convenient.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTucker began airing television ads attacking Tillis almost immediately after announcing his candidacy in May, knocking the senator for opposing Trump\u2019s plan to cut foreign aid spending and his initial resistance to the emergency declaration.\n\n\"[Republican primary voters] follow politics pretty closely and they\u2019re familiar with Tillis\u2019s record on spending, on immigration, on the flip-flop on the wall,\u201d said Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican consultant in North Carolina and an adviser to Tucker. \u201cHe\u2019s got a problem in that he\u2019s seen as not in step with Republican voters.\u201d\n\nAndrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Tillis\u2019s campaign, dismissed the Tucker campaign\u2019s criticism of the senator, insisting that, as Tillis ramps up his campaign, Republican voters will coalesce behind him.\n\n\"Garland Tucker has spent over a $1 million with false attacks on Senator Tillis in order to cover up for his anti-Trump, pro-swamp record,\u201d Romeo said. \u201cAs North Carolinians become aware of the real Garland Tucker, the commitment Senator Tillis has to advancing President Trump's agenda, and the support President Trump has shown for Senator Tillis, primary voters will overwhelmingly support our campaign.\u201d\n\nTillis and his allies have acknowledged that the Senate race is likely to be close \u2014 and exceedingly expensive.

Tucker, meanwhile, has raised far less from outside contributors \u2014 just under $190,000 \u2014 but has padded his campaign\u2019s finances with nearly $850,000 in loans and donations from his own fortune.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Cunningham has benefited from a strong fundraising start, bringing in more than $520,000 in the two-week period between his June 17 campaign announcement and the Federal Election Commission\u2019s second-quarter fundraising deadline on June 30. He also loaned his campaign an additional $200,000.\n\nDemocrats view flipping Tillis\u2019s seat as crucial to capturing a majority in the Senate. They need to pick up either three or four seats, depending on which party wins the White House in 2020, to gain control of the chamber. And after Colorado and Arizona, where Republican incumbents are facing the battles of their political lives, they see North Carolina as perhaps their best bet.\n\nOn Friday, the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election handicapper, moved Tillis's race from the \"likely\" Republican column into the \"lean\" Republican column, noting that he is torn between competing political realities: Many Republicans in the state believe he is not conservative enough, while Democrats see him as too conservative.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are hoping that having Trump on the ticket next year will buoy Tillis and drive voter turnout among the conservative and rural voters that they see as critical to their coalition in the state.\n\n\u201cUltimately Republican voters come home,\u201d one Republican operative familiar with Senate races told The Hill. \u201cThese people are going to turn out in very high intensity for the president and they\u2019re going to vote for Thom Tillis.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on a radio show hosted by McCrory on Tuesday, Tillis said that North Carolina is \u201cground zero\u201d for the GOP\u2019s efforts to hold on to its Senate majority and the White House.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is at the center of the bullseye because the Democrats know that if they defeat me, if they defeat the president, then we\u2019ll have a Democrat president, we\u2019ll have a Democrat majority in the Senate and they will take this country in a direction the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Tillis said.\n\nWhile Tillis\u2019s allies insist that they\u2019re not nervous about his prospects, several political strategists and operatives noted North Carolina\u2019s long history of booting its incumbent senators from office. In fact, Tillis won his first Senate bid in 2014 after narrowly defeating the incumbent Hagan. And Hagan took office after ousting her predecessor, Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R), in 2008.\n\nMcCrory said that it may be Trump\u2019s presence on the ballot that makes all the difference for Tillis.\n\n\u201cI think Trump\u2019s coattails will have a big impact,\u201d McCrory said. But, he added, \u201cOur Senate seats have flipped an awful lot.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8:18 a.m.", "description": "Sen.
