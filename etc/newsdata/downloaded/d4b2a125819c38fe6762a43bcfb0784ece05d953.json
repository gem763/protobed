Under Brown, the Treasury had the political clout to square up against No 10, setting up for furious rows between their teams.\n\nTensions existed to a lesser extent between Theresa May and Philip Hammond, perhaps because the former prime minister was notorious for trusting no one but her very closest allies.\n\nBut Hammond was still a powerful force, keeping tight control over the purse strings throughout his tenure \u2013 to the fury of some cabinet ministers.\n\nThe unusual pairing was David Cameron and George Osborne, who shared a close political partnership during their years in power.\n\nThe No 10-No 11 relationship between Johnson and Javid is in its early stages but it is clear that Johnson\u2019s Downing Street is a powerful force, perhaps at the expense of other departments.\n\nIn an early blow to Javid\u2019s authority, one of his top aides was unceremoniously sacked by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, and marched out of Downing Street by police.\n\nJavid was said to have not been informed about the decision to fire Sonia Khan \u2013 a popular adviser with pro-Brexit leanings \u2013 until after the incident had taken place.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But it may have proved an unsettling incident so early into his time in No 11.\n\nJohnson then spent the summer touring the country and making big-ticket spending pledges, which were believed to be part of an unofficial election campaign. But where this left his chancellor was unclear.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

blow to the chancellor, Javid\u2019s spending round in September was overshadowed by the fallout of Johnson\u2019s decision to sack 21 Tory MPs for rebelling against a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIt also fell on a blockbuster day in parliament where backbench MPs passed a law preventing a crash out on 31 October \u2013 known as the Benn Act \u2013 and then thwarted the prime minister\u2019s first attempt to secure an early election.\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to push for a Christmas election meant Javid was forced to scrap plans for a Budget on 6 November, less than a day after he insisted it would go ahead.\n\nThe chancellor had insisted the financial statement was on track, despite suggestions from No 10 it could be scrapped \u2013 setting tongues wagging in Westminster.\n\nAsked explicitly whether he had become \u201cchancellor in name only\u201d on Friday, Javid insisted he was supportive of the prime minister\u2019s plans.\n\nHe told the Today programme: \u201cIt is important to have a budget, of course for any chancellor it is important to have a budget. But what\u2019s more important right now is to get this deal through parliament.\n\n\u201cI think the vast majority of people would agree with that and also want to get a new parliament elected.\u201d\n\nBut in the same broadcast round, Javid claimed that the 31 October Brexit deadline was dead. He was contradicted by Johnson in an interview hours later.\n\nIn many ways, Javid is a victim of circumstances \u2013 rather than a lack of competence \u2013 caused by the roiling Brexit chaos and the blaze of Johnson\u2019s star.\n\nSenior Conservatives know they have to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d to have a hope of keeping power, so they are prepared to take it on faith for now that Johnson and Cummings can deliver.\n\nBut this leaves little room for anyone else to shine at the top of government.", "description": "After losing\u00a0the Tory leadership race to Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid\u00a0barely missed a beat before becoming the\u00a0chancellor.
