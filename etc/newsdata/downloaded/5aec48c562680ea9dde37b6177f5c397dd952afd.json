Many of the buildings, built from mud bricks, date back to the 16th century.\n\nAs Yemen struggles with a violent civil war between the government and Houthi rebels, Shibam's future is uncertain.\n\nThe war has been going on for five years, resulting in 6,000 deaths and putting 22 million people in a position where they need assistance \u2014 for food, water, shelter, or sanitation.\n\nFor Shibam, things have been tenuous since 2008. Flooding, terrorist attacks, the Arab Spring Revolt, and the civil war have all put pressure on the city.\n\nShibam's tourism industry has died, and funding for maintaining buildings has been cut. Now cracks are appearing across the buildings.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAfter surviving wars, floods, and a harsh climate for hundreds of years, Shibam, one of the world's most remarkable cities, could soon be in ruins.\n\nShibam is known as the \"Manhattan of the desert,\" because it's made up of mud brick skyscrapers that shoot up in the middle of the Arabian peninsula's longest valley. It was dubbed that in the 1930s by Freya Stark, an English traveler.\n\nIn October 2019, The Guardian's Beth McKernan took a look at the cost Yemen's civil war is having on its ancient cities. Shibam is no longer getting funding to preserve its mud brick buildings, and faces threats from flooding, and potential airstrikes.\n\nAlmost all of the houses in the city have eroded, and cracks can be seen across the buildings, Asia Times reported.\n\nHere's what the city is like.", "description": "Shibam is the oldest skyscraper city in the world, but Yemen's civil war is putting it at risk.
