Buck had previously been charged in Moore\u2019s death after his arrest last month.\n\nCLINTON, OBAMA SILENT ON ED BUCK DONATIONS\n\nFederal prosecutors said Buck, 65, preyed on vulnerable gay black men and pressured them to let him inject them with drugs as part of a sexual ritual.\n\nBuck also is charged with providing meth to three more men, including one who overdosed twice in a week last month before escaping Buck's home to get help and another man who said Buck threatened him with a power saw in December if he didn\u2019t leave his apartment\n\nFamily members of the victims had criticized local prosecutors for not charging Buck in the deaths. Moore\u2019s mother and her supporters have said Buck got favorable treatment because of his status and reputation and that the victims were ignored because they were gay black men, drug users and often sex workers.\n\n\u201cIf white gay men had been dying in a black man\u2019s house or anybody\u2019s house, rather, this case would have been taken a lot more seriously,\u201d said Jasmyne Cannick, a communications strategist who spearheaded the effort to get justice for Moore. \u201cEd Buck knew who he was preying on, and he knew that people would not care. Or he thought that people would not care.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department reopened the case after Dean\u2019s death Jan. 7. In July, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office took the case after sheriff\u2019s detectives approached a federal task force investigating opioid overdoses.\n\nBuck was arrested Sept. 17 and hit with state charges of operating a drug house. Two days later, federal prosecutors charged him with distributing methamphetamine resulting in Moore\u2019s death.\n\nThe federal charges bring a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years if Buck is convicted. A defense lawyer has previously said Buck, 65, denies a role in both deaths.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBuck has donated tens of thousands of dollars to California candidates, including Democratic Gov.
