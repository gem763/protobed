They said she is \u2018devastated\u2019 and has expressed a desire to meet with the teenager\u2019s family, who have arrived in New York in their quest for justice.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, (pictured) was killed after Sacoolas, 42, crashed her Volvo SUV into him near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nHarry\u2019s parents are planning to give a series of interviews with America\u2019s main TV networks to heap pressure on the US government to hand Mrs Sacoolas over.\n\nSacoolas (pictured) initially claimed diplomatic immunity to avoid potential prosecution over the case\n\nThey will then travel to Washington DC to meet senior figures in the US government to express their outrage at the handling of the case.\n\nTheir lawyer Radd Seiger told the Mail: \u2018Harry\u2019s parents want to look the US President in the eye and ask him to resolve this painful situation. He needs to understand they are utterly heartbroken.\n\n\u2018We will not rest until we have Mrs Sacoolas back in the UK. That\u2019s the only way they can get closure.\u2019 Mr Seiger said Mrs Sacoolas, 42, has been asked four times if she would be willing to return to the UK, and on each occasion she failed to respond to the question.\n\nHe added: \u2018Harry\u2019s family just want a direct answer as to whether she will to back to the UK and continue to help the police with their investigation.\n\nMrs Charles (pictured) said: '\u2018The letter from the FCO was amazing, we felt like we finally had a breakthrough, we finally had confirmed that the immunity that we didn\u2019t think she had has been confirmed, that she doesn\u2019t have it'\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve asked the same question four separate times and on each occasion this question is ignored. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u2019\n\nMrs Charles, Harry\u2019s mother, said that Mrs Sacoolas\u2019s response to the crash \u2018just doesn\u2019t cut it\u2019.\n\n\u2018My opinion on Anne Sacoolas now wanting to come forward and say sorry... is not really quite enough,\u2019 she told Sky News.\n\n\u2018But I\u2019m still really open to meeting her, as are the rest of us. I can\u2019t promise what I would or wouldn\u2019t say, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t be aggressive.\u2019 Harry\u2019s parents are reluctant to meet the mother of three unless she gives some sort of assurances that she is willing to be extradited to the UK.\n\nPolice have CCTV of Sacoolas driving on the wrong side of the road (pictured are new signs that have appeared outside the RAF base) but she claimed diplomatic immunity, meaning detectives could not launch a criminal investigation\n\nBut the matter may now be taken out of her hands if the Crown Prosecution Service applies to the US to extradite her. As the wife of a US intelligence officer, Mrs Sacoolas initially claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK after the crash just outside the military base.\n\nOn Saturday evening the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Harry\u2019s family and said: \u2018The UK Government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas\u2019s case, because she has returned home.\n\nMrs Sacoolas\u2019s lawyers released a statement at the weekend describing the death of Harry (pictured) in August as a \u2018tragic accident\n\n\u2018The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\u2019 Although grateful for the letter, Harry\u2019s family want to know why the Foreign Office only reached this conclusion on the eve of their trip to the US \u2013 weeks after Mrs Sacoolas left the country.\n\nMr Seiger said: \u2018The family could have been told weeks ago that she no longer had diplomatic immunity. The failure to do so has put needless and unnecessary stress on a grieving family.\u2019\n\nHarry suffered horrific injuries in the crash and died later in hospital. Mrs Sacoolas had pulled out of the base, a US spy hub, on the wrong side of the road and collided with the teenager\u2019s motorbike on the brow of a hill.\n\nNew road markings and a sign have appeared outside the base. Arrows indicating the direction of travel have been painted on each side of the road and a yellow \u2018Please Drive on Left\u2019 sign has also been placed on the roadside.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel yesterday played down suggestions that Mrs Sacoolas could be extradited from the US.\n\nAsked on BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show whether this could happen, she said: \u2018It very much seems that the lady in question wants to start co-operating with the discussions and the investigations and I think that we should support that.\n\n\u2018We need to ensure that justice is done but obviously that co-operation with this investigation takes place. That is absolutely right.\u2019", "description": "Harry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn hailed a 'breakthrough' after learning US citizen Anne Sacoolas no longer has diplomatic immunity from potential prosecution over the case.", "authors": ["Arthur Martin", "Andy Dolan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19666820-0-image-a-2_1571000997638.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
