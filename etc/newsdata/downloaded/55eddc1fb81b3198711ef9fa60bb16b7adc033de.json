Reliance has hit trouble in three main geographic areas. Supplied\n\nHe also stepped down as chairman and Stuart Crosby, a former chief executive of share registry business Computershare, took over in early March. Reliance has been regarded as one of the few Australian businesses capable of becoming a big global powerhouse because of its innovation. Its products have been increasingly popular with younger plumbers embracing new technology and saving time in the US, rather than soldering traditional brass fittings, which plumbers have done for generations.\n\nReliance warned on Monday it now expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for financial 2019 to be in the $260 million to $270 million range and not between $280 million and $290 million as previously forecast. This has stemmed from specific problems in the US and the UK, and the weak residential housing construction market in Australia that has crimped demand.\n\nReliance warned on Monday that the usual ''modest freeze'' in the south of the US, which leads to more demand for the group's Sharkbite branded push-to-connect plumbing fittings as water pipes burst, simply hadn't happened.\n\nThis had resulted in sales in the US being $12 million to $15 million lower than expected.\n\nSome US retail stockists of the Sharkbite brand of push-to-connect fittings had also been cutting the amount of stock they have on hand in a deliberate strategy to reduce inventory, which had also put pressure on the business.\n\nSeries of blows\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there has also been some fall-out in the UK from Reliance's big $1.2 billion acquisition of the John Guest plastic plumbing fittings business.\n\nWhile Reliance said on Monday the John Guest business was ''on target'' to achieve sales growth in line with expectations, there had been a decision to back off from selling some Reliance products in the UK. One of those main products was Thermal Interface Units. Once Reliance had told its main customers it was exiting those product lines in the UK, demand had dropped much faster than anticipated, leading to a $6 million to $7 million fall-off in sales.\n\nThe Reliance business had also suffered a slowdown of up to $5 million in sales in Spain because of fierce competition from rivals.\n\nA third blow had come from the weaker Australian housing construction market. Reliance told the ASX that Australasia made up only 13 per cent of sales but the sharper than forecast decline in new home construction in Australia had triggered a downturn of up to $15 million in sales, compared with original forecasts.\n\nReliance also warned that while the increase in US tariffs on imports from China from 10 per cent to 25 per cent wouldn't hurt the 2019 results, it could potentially have a negative impact in 2019-20 because of the higher cost of raw materials and manufactured components imported from China to the US by the company.\n\nReliance shares were at $6.21 in late August 2018.\n\nReliance substantially lifted its exposure to the British economy last year with the $1.2 billion acquisition of John Guest. It was designed to replicate the Reliance strategy in the United States where it is making steady headway with the Sharkbite push-to-connect plumbing fittings made with copper, although the penetration of its products still remains relatively low.\n\nPrior to the 2016 float, the Munz family owned the entire company, acquiring it in 1986 when it had $14 million in annual revenue and was primarily focused on Australia.", "description": "Reliance Worldwide had $569 million wiped from its sharemarket value in a day and Rich Lister Jonathan Munz was ahead of the game in his exit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_56/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1a658c46f1dcf2b58b4f1a194ea107d764e37830", "published_at": "2019-05-13"}
