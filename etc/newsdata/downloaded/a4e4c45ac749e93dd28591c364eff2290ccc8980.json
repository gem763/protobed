A 2018 report from the Institute for Family Studies found that about half the people who cheated on their spouses were still married to that person.\n\nWhile it certainly isn't easy, there are steps couples can take to properly repair a relationship post-cheating, according to the psychotherapist and Tribeca Therapy founder Matt Lundquist. He told Business Insider what they were.\n\nThe couple should seek out a couples therapist\n\nThe first step involves a trip to a couples counselor \u2014 and neither partner should be dragging their feet.\n\n\"People who are able to say, 'I need to go through a process here,' are more likely to do successful work to recover from [cheating],\" Lundquist said.\n\nRead more: How to know if someone is a serial cheater or if they've actually made a mistake, according to a therapist\n\nTherapy can help both a cheater and the person who was cheated on understand the reasons infidelity occurred, which is a key to repairing lost trust and forgiving each other. But that's only one of many steps a couple must take to repair a relationship broken by infidelity.\n\nThe cheater must also be remorseful about their actions\n\nThe person doing the cheating needs to be somewhat unsettled, Lundquist said.

It needs to hurt a little in order to grow and change.\"\n\nIf the cheater brushes off their actions, however, it could be a sign the relationship is ultimately doomed. If, for example, a cheater blames their infidelity on alcohol or an inability to control themselves rather than taking responsibility, it could mean the relationship is beyond repair, Insider previously reported.\n\nThe couple must address the conditions that led to the cheating\n\nAfter cheating occurs, it's understandable for the person who was cheated on to feel betrayed and, in turn, lose trust in their partner. Although there isn't one surefire way to rebuild that trust, Lundquist said \"giving a credible understanding of how the cheating happened\" could help. \"If the conditions that produced cheating aren't addressed, it will happen again,\" he added.\n\nRead more: 7 traits most cheaters have in common\n\nOften, those \"conditions\" are more about the person who committed the act than the person who was cheated on.\n\n\"Many times, people who stray are also hoping to reconnect with lost parts of themselves, with the lives unlived, with the sense that life is short and there are certain experiences \u2026 that they are longing for,\" Esther Perel, a sex and relationship expert, previously told Business Insider.\n\nA person might also cheat because they're afraid of getting older, feel stressed out, or are unhappy with their lives, Insider previously reported. Lundquist said family history or childhood insecurities could play a role in infidelity too.\n\nOnce the cheater determines why they cheated and shares that information with their partner, they can discuss whether they want to resolve the issues.\n\nThe person who was cheated on shouldn't feel rushed into forgiving their partner. Shutterstock\n\nBoth parties have to reflect on where their relationship went wrong\n\nTypically, the cheater has to do the majority of the work to understand their motivations and rebuild the broken relationship. \"Is there some trauma or trouble with commitment? Is this relationship for you?\" Lundquist asked.\n\nBut the person who has been cheated on plays an important role too.\n\nRead more: If you're the victim of an affair, you might want to revenge cheat. A therapist says the move could ruin your relationship for good.\n\nA person's dissatisfaction with their sex life, for example, can cause them to stray from the relationship, Lundquist said. Or maybe the victim was a workaholic who unknowingly neglected their partner, leading the cheater to look for fulfillment elsewhere.\n\nWhile these aren't excuses for infidelity, they're situations that are important for both parties to understand so they can support each other and move forward.\n\nThe victim should be given time to forgive\n\nLastly, the person who was cheated on shouldn't feel rushed into forgiving their partner. \"Most couples we see in therapy are wanting to forgive and might want to do it too quickly as to not hurt the other person,\" he said.\n\nOffering immediate forgiveness, however, can result in resentment and perpetuate issues with the relationship. Instead, both parties must take time to heal.", "description": "It won't be easy to rebuild trust, but taking an honest look at your relationship can help you recover from an affair.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93684b2e22af38765fc94e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
