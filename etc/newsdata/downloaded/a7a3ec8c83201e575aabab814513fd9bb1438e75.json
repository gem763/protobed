The five-day period, which began on May 1st, beats the 90-hour record that was set earlier this year. The UK intends to phase out coal power completely by 2025.\n\nThis new record comes just over two years after the UK achieved the milestone of going one day without coal. However, the makeup of the country\u2019s energy sources has changed significantly in that time. The biggest increase has come from wind power, which is up to as much as 27 percent from 12.2 percent, but the proportion of nuclear power also increased from 21.2 percent to 24 percent. Meanwhile, the proportion of the country\u2019s energy from natural gas decreased from just over 50 percent to 25 percent.\n\nNot including \u201cconsumption emissions\u201d\n\nWhile this a step in the right direction for the UK\u2019s climate emissions, the country\u2019s domestic power consumption isn\u2019t the whole story. With a relatively small manufacturing sector, the UK\u2019s contribution toward greenhouse gas emissions is far higher when you count so-called \u201cconsumption emissions,\u201d which include the emissions created in the manufacturing and transportation of the UK\u2019s imports.\n\nStill, the UK\u2019s transition away from coal is in a far better state than in the US, where President Trump declared that his administration was \u201cputting an end to the war on coal\u201d back in 2017 as he signed an executive order to roll back Obama-era environmental protections.", "description": "UK power plants have just gone over five days without burning any coal, their longest coal-free streak since the Industrial Revolution.
