REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\nSAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tim Cook\u2019s charm offensive is coming just at the right time. The Apple boss has Washington and even Beijing on his side, while Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg can barely speak without annoying someone in power \u2013 and his company\u2019s apps are blocked in China. Yet since D.C. pressure ratcheted up a year ago, Facebook\u2019s stock has performed better.\n\nZuckerberg has proved a poor advocate for his company. His assertion of nonpartisanship has fallen on deaf ears, both Republican and Democratic. He has been summoned to testify before Congress twice in the last two years. Last week, his defense of Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project failed to allay skeptics\u2019 fears.\n\nMeanwhile, Cook has successfully managed a mercurial Donald Trump. He has met the U.S. president and won tariff exemptions for Apple amid growing import taxes on Chinese goods. Despite accusations that the company\u2019s App Store has anti-competitive elements, Cook hasn\u2019t had to testify in Congress since 2016. Pulling an app used by Hong Kong protestors to track police movements curried favor with Beijing yet didn\u2019t do much damage to the iPhone maker\u2019s reputation.\n\nBut Apple\u2019s huge, mature and complex business \u2013 worth over $1 trillion in market capitalization \u2013 means it has to play more defense. Over the last year, Apple\u2019s stock has underperformed the Nasdaq 100 tech index. In the July to September quarter, Apple reported only 2% growth in its top line, and a 2% decline in Greater China sales. IPhone sales in the People\u2019s Republic fell to their lowest level in five years in the period, according to Canalys, while rival Huawei Technologies gained a record 42% market share.\n\nAt one time Zuckerberg was besotted with gaining access to China but he has changed his tune. In a recent speech at Georgetown University, he cited Beijing\u2019s censorship policy as a reason. For the time being, he may have lucked out in political terms. The social network still pulled in $5 billion in revenue from Chinese ad sales in 2018, according to Pivotal Research.\n\nMore broadly, the $540 billion Facebook\u2019s advertising juggernaut keeps throwing off sales growth. It reported a 29% year-on-year rise in third-quarter revenue to nearly $18 billion, almost all ads. A $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine imposed in July is a distant memory and its shares have outperformed the Nasdaq benchmark over the last year. Luckily for Facebook, it doesn\u2019t need diplomatic skills like Cook\u2019s as much as Apple does.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Tim Cook\u2019s charm offensive is coming just at the right time.
