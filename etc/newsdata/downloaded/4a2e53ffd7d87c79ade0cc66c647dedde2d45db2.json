The closing price on Friday was $175.\n\nIn other words, as the trade war has hung over Alibaba stock, the shares have gone nowhere. Alibaba stock has been volatile, but it\u2019s been flat. The big question now is: how long will it continue on that path?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe answer is, not much longer. In fact, I believe there are ten reasons why investors should be bullish on Alibaba stock over the next few months and over the next few years. Those ten reasons can be divided into two segments: the five most important reasons to buy BABA stock and the five less important reasons to buy BABA stock.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s jump into looking at those ten reasons.\n\nThe 5 Most Important Reasons to Buy Alibaba Stock\n\nIn no particular order, here are the five most important reasons to buy Alibaba stock.\n\n1. The Overall Outlook of Alibaba Group Remains Favorable. Throughout China and Southeast Asia, internet penetration, per capita income and consumer spending remain well below the averages of developed nations. But the,internet penetration, per capita income and consumer spending of China and Southeast Asia are grinding higher. They will move still higher over the next several years as the Chinese government continues to support the expansion of its technology industry. That means that Southeast Asia\u2019s digital economy will also continue to expand at a rapid rate for the foreseeable future. Alibaba Group finds itself at the epicenter of that digital economy, so its days of strong growth are just beginning.\n\n2. China\u2019s Consumer Economy Is Turning Around. Multiple data points suggest that China\u2019s consumer economy, which slowed meaningfully in 2018 and early 2019, is accelerating in mid-2019. These data points include the improvement of a composite leading indicator and of a consumer confidence index, an acceleration of retail-sales growth, and the stabilization of the nation\u2019s manufacturing activity and trade data.\n\n3. Trade Tensions Should Ease Going Forward. This trade war follows a rather predictable cycle. Trade tensions escalate, causing markets to sell off. Then, the two countries come back to the negotiation table, easing tensions and causing markets to rally. We are currently in the \u201ccoming back to the table\u201d part of the cycle. So tensions should ease over the next few weeks to months. Markets should rally, pushing Alibaba stock higher.\n\n4. Alibaba\u2019s Margins Are Improving. A big knock against Alibaba stock over the past few years has been its lack of profit growth. This situation has persisted because its margins have dropped as the company has spent an arm and a leg to fuel its strong growth. Now Alibaba Group is reducing some of that spending. As a result, its margins are moving higher. In Q2, for the first time in two years, Alibaba\u2019s profit margins over the previous 12 months actually were higher than in the 12 months preceding the previous quarter.\n\n5. The valuation of Alibaba Stock Is Attractive. Last quarter, Alibaba\u2019s revenue growth came in at over 40%, and its profit growth, excluding some items, was over 50%. BABA stock trades at just 25 times Alibaba\u2019s expected 2019 earnings. That\u2019s a pretty reasonable multiple, considering the company\u2019s profit growth. As a result, Alibaba stock can rise meaningfully.\n\nThe 5 Less Important Reasons to Buy BABA Stock\n\nHere are five less important reasons to be bullish on Alibaba stock in both the near-term and the long-term.\n\n1. Alibaba Is Adding New Revenue Streams. Alibaba Group is so much more than an e-commerce company. It\u2019s a cloud company, a media company, and more recently, it\u2019s become a data-as-a-service company. By diversifying its revenue streams, Alibaba has increased its exposure to the continuous-growth Southeast Asia digital economy. The higher BABA\u2019s exposure to that sector becomes, the higher its growth can be in the long-term.", "description": "As the U.S.-China trade war has ebbed and flowed over the past year, so has Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock.
