State television broadcast images from the Sabiti's deck, saying they were taken after the attack but showing no visible damage. The ship's hull was not in view.\n\nNo claim of responsibility for attack\n\nThe incident, yet to be independently confirmed, is the latest involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf region, and may ratchet up tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, long-time regional adversaries fighting a proxy war in Yemen, which lies at the southern end of the Red Sea.\n\nThe United States, embroiled in a dispute with Iran over its nuclear plans, has blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the Gulf in May and June as well as for strikes on Saudi oil sites in September. Tehran has denied having a role in any of them.\n\n191011160852019\n\nThe US Navy's Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of the reports but had no further information.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the reported incident.\n\nPolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group said it did not have firm evidence about who may have been behind the incident.\n\n\"The proximity of the tanker at the time of the attack to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jeddah port might imply that the missiles could possibly have been launched from the kingdom.\n\n\"Another plausible theory is that it was an Israeli sabotage operation...The purpose would be to disrupt Iranian tanker activity in the Red Sea corridor as it heads towards the Suez Canal. A third possibility would be that the attack was conducted by a terrorist group,\" Eurasia said in a statement.\n\nThe Red Sea is a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal.\n\nCrude prices jumped briefly on the news of the alleged attack and industry sources said it could drive up already high shipping costs.", "description": "Iran says will respond appropriately after investigation into the 'cowardly' attack on its oil tanker in Red Sea.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/fd23828791e241dcbe26e867ad49986c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
