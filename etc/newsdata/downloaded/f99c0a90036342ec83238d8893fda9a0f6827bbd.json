We have to adjust to those conditions.\u201d\n\nAustralia will look to extend their lead in Brisbane on Wednesday, with the third and final match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday.", "description": "Opener David Warner thumped a maiden Twenty20 international century as Australia kicked off their home summer with a ruthless 134-run thrashing of Sri Lanka at Adelaide Oval on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
