They said they represented some half-million people who have received mental health services over the years via a charity, the U.S.-based Carter Center.\n\nSuch private aid is not enough to assure that every Liberian receives assistance, they said.\n\n\"Mental health care continues to be seriously sidelined,\" said Bill Ballah, a spokesman for the group. \"Each of us needs good mental health to ... pursue our life goals and meet our responsibilities as responsible citizens.\"\n\nCritics say Liberia's president is not interested in creating a war crimes court because his political support base includes some elements who committed atrocities. Weah has rejected that accusation and his supporters dismiss it as untrue.\n\nIn this Oct. 9, 2019, photo, a mentally ill woman sits on the streets in Monrovia, Liberia.

About 60% said they had lost confidence in human beings and society.\n\n\"This can have a severe consequence on one's mental function,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nThe need for mental health care in Liberia is so great and complicated that no government has been able to tackle the issue, and none has taken the initiative, Harris said.\n\nGovernment authorities acknowledge the mental health problem is enormous but blame the country's inability to raise enough revenue to address such issues.\n\nThe chairman of the senate committee on health and a former health minister, Dr. Peter Coleman, said the funding allotted to the health sector in the annual budget is negligible because there are competing priorities.\n\n\"When it comes to mental health right now, it's collaborations with agencies such as the Carter Center that is helping us to at least do the rudimentary things in mental health,\" he said.\n\nDr. David Henderson, chairman of the psychiatry department at Boston University's medical school, said mental health could be tackled more rigorously in places like Liberia if global health funding paid more attention to psychiatry. If those resources were provided, \"we can really build capacity very quickly.\"\n\nHe cited the success story of Ethiopia, which went from just three psychiatrists to about 100 over 15 years.\n\nFor now Liberia has just one overcrowded and underfunded mental health hospital, an annex of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in the capital, Monrovia. Patients are charged the equivalent of $10 for 21 days of treatment, a cost many cannot afford.\n\nMeanwhile the Catherine Mills Rehabilitation Center, a facility set up in pre-war Liberia as a home for people with mental illness, was ransacked and looted during the civil war and has never reopened. Officials have tried in vain to persuade people now living amid its ruins to leave.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa", "description": "MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - More than a decade after back-to-back civil wars ravaged Liberia its people still await justice for countless abuses, and many say...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/10/wire-19622628-1570872531-647_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
