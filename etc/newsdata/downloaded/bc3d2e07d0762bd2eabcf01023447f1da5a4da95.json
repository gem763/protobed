Silver also said the NBA has been in touch with Houston Rockets great and Chinese Basketball Association President Yao Ming, with the commissioner saying the Basketball Hall of Famer \u201cis extremely upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nSilver wants to meet with Chinese officials when he gets to Shanghai on Wednesday, saying he wants Morey\u2019s tweet and the NBA\u2019s comments that followed in context.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a realist as well,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd I recognize that this issue may not die down so quickly.\u201d\n\nBefore his news conference in Tokyo, Silver released a statement Tuesday saying the league \u201cwill not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAt the same time, we recognize that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world.\u201d\n\nSilver also said he hopes basketball can continue to be something that unifies the countries. It\u2019s not a new stance for Silver; he\u2019s referenced how basketball now can be similar to the phenomenon known as \u201cpingpong diplomacy\u201d \u2014 when table tennis players from the U.S. and China played in the early 1970s and essentially began a major mending of relations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nSilver said in an interview with Kyodo News on Monday that the NBA supports Morey.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet has provoked a wave of censure from Chinese companies, including a major sports merchandise retailer and news site that have halted its partnerships with the Rockets.\n\nA schedule of CCTV programming on its website shows two NBA preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers - one in Shenzhen and another in Shanghai - were no longer slated for broadcast. An NBA Cares event in Shanghai with the Nets was canceled Tuesday, though the Nets participated in other events as scheduled. The Lakers were arriving there on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHow can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China\u2019s public opinion?\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press briefing Tuesday. \u201cNBA\u2019s cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chinese state broadcaster CCTV announced Tuesday it will no longer air two NBA preseason games set to be played in the country.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Yanan Wang"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/rocket_china_spat_basketball_70223_c0-0-3000-1749_s1770x1032.jpg?4ec8ef4b5df28140b7ab4a06fbd1165bdd086b07", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
