The hard work starts now.'\n\nThe 44-year-old Yorkshireman is well liked and respected by the senior core of current internationals.\n\nIn contrast, Kirsten - lauded as a technical coach and with a CV that saw him take both India and his native South Africa to new heights - has a poor Twenty20 record.\n\nSilverwood was England's bowling coach for two years and is seen here with James Anderson\n\nHis casual approach to coaching is well known and may have counted against him, particularly when up against the well-organised Silverwood, who coached Essex to their first championship title in 25 years in 2017 just 12 months after promotion to the top flight.\n\nCapped six times at Test level, he will be upgraded to his new role in time for England's tour of New Zealand starting later this month.\n\nThe appointment also meets Giles' desire to promote English coaches.\n\nOn the appointment, Giles said: 'I believe he is what we need to take our international teams forward.\n\nDirector of men's cricket Ashley Giles was keen to replace Bayliss quickly after the Ashes\n\n'He is somebody we know well, but it is his intimate understanding of our structures and systems and his close relationships with Test captain Joe Root and white-ball captain Eoin Morgan that will help us develop our plans for the next few years.\n\n'Chris demonstrated in his interview a clear understanding and strategy of how both the red and white ball teams need to evolve. He has some detailed thoughts on what it will take to win the Ashes in Australia and win major ICC white-ball tournaments.\n\n'Ultimately, his highest quality is that he is a winner and that will be an important part of the job as we look to strive to become the most respected team in the world across all formats.'", "description": "Silverwood - who has spent the past two years in charge of England's fast bowlers - emerged from the recent interview process ahead of the South African Gary Kirsten.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19386386-0-image-a-26_1570438876780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
