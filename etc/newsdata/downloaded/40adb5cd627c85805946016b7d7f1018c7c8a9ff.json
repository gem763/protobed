It\u2019s all in place. They\u2019ve got a great group of players. It\u2019s some squad, if you go through it, I don\u2019t care what anybody says I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot between that squad and Liverpool\u2019s and Man City\u2019s squad, I really don\u2019t.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re as good as your players. Graham Taylor once said \u201cyour manager is never as good as you think he is and he\u2019s never as bad as you think he is, he\u2019s somewhere in between\u201d and that is football management.\n\n\u2018If you put Pochettino, or you put Pep [Guardiola] or [Jurgen] Klopp and let them go and manage Brighton or manage Norwich or Sheffield United, they\u2019re not gonna go and put them in the top six, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about the players. He [Pochettino] has got the good players but at the moment there\u2019s been hiccups \u2013 one of two of them are not playing to their real potential or as good as they can.\u2019\n\nSpurs are back in action at home to Watford on Saturday in a match Pochettino desperately needs to win to halt their recent slide in form.\n\nThe Hornets are bottom of the table and the only side in the division without a league win so far this season, if they were to get a result in north London then pressure would be heaped on Pochettino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Tottenham shouldn\u2019t fall into Jose Mourinho trap, says Dimitar Berbatov\n\nMORE: Jose Mourinho eyes return to Premier League to manage Tottenham", "description": "Harry Redknapp has backed Totttenham to come good after a shaky start and finish third in the Premier League this season.
