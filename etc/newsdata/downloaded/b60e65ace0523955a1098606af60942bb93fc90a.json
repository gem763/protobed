Democrats, don\u2019t mess that up.", "language": "en", "text": "The list had caused some controversy because the staunchly conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation had both helped compile it. But the outsourcing was hardly surprising for a future president who had no ideological anchor or moral compass, not to mention any familiarity with the judiciary or its constitutional underpinnings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump continued to receive guidance after his election and ultimately nominated Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, the latter of whom Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) called \u201cthe most qualified nominee in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nNow, a new shortlist has emerged, this time from a liberal group called Demand Justice. Apparently seeing the influence of the Federalist Society \u2014 and the election that resulted \u2014 the group has compiled its own list of suggested nominees to pressure Democratic candidates into releasing their own, thus giving primary voters a sense of their commitment to progressive principles. The banner leading the liberal organization\u2019s website direly declares that the Supreme Court \u201chas been hijacked, democracy is at stake, and it\u2019s time for progressives to fight back.\u201d\n\nSuch hysterical claims seem misplaced in light of a new Marquette University Law School study, which found that the judiciary is the most trusted of the three branches of government \u2014 by a large margin. The study also found that those who pay greater attention to current events have more confidence in the high court, as do those more familiar with the Supreme Court and its justices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot surprisingly, the Marquette poll also showed that highly partisan respondents see the court as either too liberal or too conservative. But between the extremes, Americans are comfortable with the court\u2019s more-or-less even makeup. Nearly two-thirds of those polled said the Supreme Court justices base their decisions on the law rather than politics. To that description, I would add \u201cfacts.\u201d The facts of a given case guide a judge\u2019s deliberations and conclusions.\n\nThe poll also asked whether the number of justices on the high court should be increased, as some Democratic candidates have suggested, obviously to outweigh the influence of the current conservative majority. Fifty-seven percent of respondents were opposed.\n\nThis past July, opposition to \u201ccourt packing\u201d was articulated by none other than progressive heroine Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. During an interview with NPR, she said that increasing the number of justices would be damaging to the court and the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf anything would make the court look partisan,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be that \u2014 one side saying, \u2018when we\u2019re in power, we\u2019re going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who would vote the way we want them to.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGinsburg\u2019s comments speak to the importance of an independent judiciary, which, in the Supreme Court\u2019s case, is further safeguarded by the justices\u2019 lifetime tenures and the fact that Congress can\u2019t reduce their salaries, potentially in retaliation for a ruling it doesn\u2019t like. These protections are enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nNevertheless, the Marquette study found that 72 percent of respondents prefer term limits to lifetime appointments. Any such change would require a constitutional amendment, which doesn\u2019t worry Ginsburg. During the same interview, she said: \u201cOur Constitution is powerfully hard to amend.\u201d Indeed, an amendment would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate and House and three-fourths of state legislatures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the relatively high level of trust in the Supreme Court \u2014 and the majority view that the court rules by law rather than by politics \u2014 Demand Justice\u2019s shortlist seems way off base. Only eight of the 32 people listed are currently judges, and the group opposes nominees with any corporate experience. The list is heavy with activists \u2014 public defenders, public-interest lawyers, academics and plaintiff lawyers.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: When people have a judicial background, there\u2019s a record by which to judge their philosophy and judicial temperament, roughly defined as respect for the law, for other judges and for the litigants. And while the folks at Demand Justice don\u2019t seem to share these concerns, they\u2019re right to want to see the Democratic candidates\u2019 lists. One would hope the Democratic nominee would favor experienced judges whose records can be assessed \u2014 and whose philosophy closely reflects the wisdom of the notorious RBG.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The importance of an independent judiciary cannot be overstated.", "authors": ["Kathleen Parker", "Columnist Covering Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ThEfVn66aU2kRoVmTRttOIUfgYw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FOVMZVCFGAI6TFFL2LO2HQG7KI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
