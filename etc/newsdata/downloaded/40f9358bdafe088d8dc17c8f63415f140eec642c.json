Hours before appearing on Fox News, The Washington Post reported that Giuliani was a key player in the escalating political conflict over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine \u2014 a scandal that has rocked the White House and prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to initiate impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nGiuliani pursued shadow Ukraine agenda as key foreign policy officials were sidelined\n\nOn Fox News, Giuliani vigorously defended himself and Trump. He argued that he only contacted Ukrainian officials at the request of the State Department, called for investigations of \u201ccorrupt\u201d Democrats, and repeatedly alleged that former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter had done wrong in Ukraine. The allegation about the Bidens, which Trump has also voiced, has not been backed up by any official evidence thus far, The Post\u2019s Fact Checker reported.\n\nAfterward, Giuliani took to Twitter into early Wednesday morning to double down on his earlier claims.\n\n\u201cDemocrat party is covering up a pattern of corruption involving high level members of the Obama cabinet,\u201d Giuliani tweeted around 1 a.m. \u201cThe multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play is mind boggling.\u201d\n\nDemocrat party is covering up a pattern of corruption involving high level members of the Obama cabinet. The multi-million and billion dollar pay-for-play is mind boggling. Biden Family sale of office to Ukraine was not the only one or the most egregious. Slimy Joe is not alone. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 25, 2019\n\nThe former New York mayor first appeared on Fox News on Tuesday for a one-on-one interview with Ingraham to address The Post\u2019s report about his involvement in Ukraine and the impeachment inquiry. The saga began unfolding last week when The Post reported that a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden. Tuesday\u2019s report revealed that Giuliani was heavily entangled in Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings, which also involved the president reportedly withholding almost $400 million in military aid for the country, while national security officials were sidelined.\n\nWhen Ingraham asked whether he inserted himself into Ukrainian discussions, Giuliani confirmed that he did. Then, he repeated a past assertion that the State Department had enlisted his help.\n\n\u201cI never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it and then I reported every conversation back to them. I\u2019m a pretty good lawyer, just a country lawyer, but it\u2019s all here, right here,\u201d he said, holding up his cellphone to suggest that call records would provide confirmation.\n\nFor most of the roughly 13-minute interview, Giuliani sought to shift the focus from himself back to Democrats and Biden. At one point, he even suggested that Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who went to Ukraine this month, should be impeached instead of Trump.\n\nGiuliani argued that Democrats have been \u201ccovering up for what will turn out to be massive corruption in the Obama administration,\u201d highlighting allegations that then-Vice President Biden had pressed the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating a natural gas firm that employed Hunter Biden. According to The Post\u2019s Fact Checker, that investigation was shelved before Biden\u2019s attempts to oust the prosecutor. Additionally, Hunter Biden, who sat on the company\u2019s board for five years, was never accused of wrongdoing during the investigation.\n\nGiuliani later added that he had gotten involved rather than leaving the investigation to officials with the Justice Department or the FBI because of his role as Trump\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m defending him,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe\u2019s my client. I don\u2019t know, only Donald Trump is not entitled to a defense in America.\u201d\n\nAs he pointed fingers at Democrats and a \u201ccrooked press corps,\u201d Giuliani also spouted claims, without evidence, that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and an FBI agent assigned to investigate the Hunter Biden corruption allegations were both part of a conspiracy organized by liberal billionaire George Soros \u2014 talking so much that his voice became hoarse.\n\n\u201cSorry to cut you off,\u201d Ingraham said following several attempts to let Giuliani know that he was out of time. \u201cYou gotta get your voice back.\u201d\n\nAfter a few minutes of rest, Ingraham brought Giuliani back on the show to join a panel made up of Hahn, the liberal radio host; and former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy. Hahn had just accused Giuliani of \u201cmaking things up\u201d about the Bidens, and the lawyer was raring to go.\n\n\u201cI should sue you for libel,\u201d Giuliani told Hahn. \u201cYou actually usually say incredibly stupid things.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the segment turned into a screaming match. Giuliani called Hahn an \u201cidiot,\u201d demanding that Ingraham tell the radio host \u201cto keep his mouth shut.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump watched Giuliani\u2019s interview or the heated exchange, but it appeared he was glued to Fox News on Tuesday night. The president tweeted six videos of Fox segments, thanking hosts and guests who suggested he was free of wrongdoing in the Ukraine affair.", "description": "For most of a roughly 13-minute interview, Giuliani shifted focus from himself to Democrats and Biden, arguing that they have been \u201ccovering up for what will turn out to be massive corruption in the Obama administration.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xMiALQraBsGgGa08TEyG27Y1zhs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DYLPPIXGVVETXH3YPGEVSBUBSA.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
