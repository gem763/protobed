Yet that is the skill headmistress Nina Gunson is encouraging her pupils to learn, offering them an eight-week course of stand-up classes.\n\nHard-pressed parents who scrimped and saved the \u00a313,359-a-year fees for her establishment, Sheffield High School For Girls, must think she\u2019s having a laugh.\n\nIn fact, though, there is a brilliant logic to Mrs Gunson\u2019s apparent lunacy. What do almost all young women suffer from? Lack of confidence, especially in a public forum.\n\nIn an age when teenagers are judged on looks and by their selfies and \u2018likes\u2019, there is great sense in empowering girls with the ability to just stand up and be who they are.\n\nMrs Gunson says the point of the course is to take teenagers out of their comfort zone by having them perform in front of each other, so they can be assessed on ingenuity, humour and the ability to think on their feet.\n\nWe all have a funny side, it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know it. And as Mrs Gunson says, the course \u2018teaches students to not take themselves too seriously, to improvise, to take risks and be a little bolder\u2019.\n\nIt also provides lessons in how to cope with terrifying social situations \u2014 dealing with an audience when the jokes fall flat, heckling, a rising sense of panic in the public glare.\n\nThe head\u2019s view is that if you can learn to handle all this, you\u2019ll be better able to manage stressful situations in work and life.\n\nAnd remember, some girls make scintillating comic performers. That\u2019s how Phoebe Waller-Bridge started out, before creating Fleabag and Killing Eve, and contributing to the script for the next James Bond movie.\n\nWe can\u2019t all be Fleabags but that doesn\u2019t matter. Nina Gunson\u2019s point is that you just have to learn to be confident in yourself.\n\nPaul has been \u2018liking\u2019 lissom Lithuanian actress Bria Vinaite, 26 (pictured) on Instagram \u2014 though he stresses he is only expressing admiration for her baking!\n\nA baker's fancy\n\nFinally divorced this summer, Paul Hollywood, 53, first had an affair with Marcela Valladolid, his fellow judge on a U.S. version of Bake Off, then moved on to 24-year-old bar-maid Summer Monteys-Fullam, who dumped him last month.\n\nNow he has been \u2018liking\u2019 lissom Lithuanian actress Bria Vinaite, 26 (pictured) on Instagram \u2014 though he stresses he is only expressing admiration for her baking!\n\nIs there no nubile woman for whom podgy Paul won\u2019t rise to the occasion?\n\nThree cheers for Doreen\n\nFist-pumps for twicewidowed Doreen Jones, 81, who fought off a cashpoint robber trying to steal her pension money.\n\n\u2018No, you\u2019re not having my money. I\u2019ve worked hard for that,\u2019 the former factory worker told the young female thief, before grabbing her by the collar and flinging her across the pavement.\n\n\u2018I was brought up in the War,\u2019 she said. \u2018I learned how to fight in the air-raid shelters. They picked the wrong one when they picked on Doreen.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m just glad she didn\u2019t hit out with her walking stick, or she\u2019d be in court facing assault charges.\n\nLaunching a book of his late wife Linda\u2019s photos, Paul McCartney waded into the Brexit debate, revealing that he thinks the EU referendum was \u2018probably a mistake\u2019.\n\nJust let it be, Paul. We can work it out.\n\nBetraying our boys\n\nA double murder charge has been brought against a former British paratrooper over alleged atrocities on Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland in 1972.\n\nNow in his 60s, he is known as Soldier F. Every Prime Minister from Blair to May vowed we would end the hounding of our former soldiers.\n\nEach one of those Prime Ministers should hang their head in shame.\n\nWith the disposable fashion industry creating a great deal of pollution, Strictly is doing its bit to save the planet. Bruno Tonioli is pictured above\n\nWith the disposable fashion industry creating a great deal of pollution, Strictly is doing its bit to save the planet.\n\nThe live audience are urged to use public transport, and its stars will stay in a \u2018green hotel\u2019.\n\nPerhaps, to prevent any more hot air contributing to the greenhouse effect, they should also sack Bruno Tonioli (right).\n\nDoes Ma'am love Wham?\n\nForget her annus horribilis in 1992. This is fast becoming the Queen\u2019s hebdomas horribilis (that\u2019s Latin for disastrous week).\n\nYesterday, there were more Epstein allegations about Prince Andrew.\n\nThrow in David Cameron blurting out that he\u2019d asked Her Maj to help him over the Scottish referendum \u2014 and finally add the indiscretion, in the memoirs of the manager of Wham!, that she \u2018asked\u2019 for an audience with George Michael, as she was a fan. Don\u2019t these people know one doesn\u2019t care for careless whispers?\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he didn\u2019t realise in 2001 that \u2018blacking up\u2019 for an Arabian Nights fancy- dress party was racist.\n\nCrikey, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. When I nabbed Dad\u2019s black shoe polish back in Australia in the Sixties to complete the Aladdin\u2019s genie outfit Mum had made from some old Terylene curtains, he chided me for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the Aboriginals with whom his mother had shared a waterhole would be offended. And second, that was his last tin of shoe polish.\n\nJustin Trudeau dressed as Aladdin in 2001 to attend a party at West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver. He was 29\n\nWestminster Wars\n\nAhead of his party\u2019s conference, Jeremy Corbyn confesses that he finds the thought of becoming Prime Minister \u2018daunting\u2019. For most of us, it\u2019s a good deal worse than that.\n\nBuoyed by polls putting her party ahead of Labour, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson ended her conference speech with arms outstretched, proclaiming that before her audience stood the country\u2019s next Prime Minister.\n\nCalm down, dear. You have as much chance of becoming PM as you do of modelling the autumn collection for Victoria\u2019s Secret.\n\nA truly shameful day for Corbyn\u2019s party as its conference begins this weekend. Labour Friends of Israel \u2014 formed in 1957 \u2014 has withdrawn its promotional stand over fears for the safety of staff.\n\nGreta's green army\n\nRemarkable that it is little more than a year since Greta Thunberg, 16, staged a solitary protest outside the Swedish parliament, given the millions of young people across the globe who took her lead and walked out of school yesterday to protest against climate change.\n\nWell done them. Yet one wonders how many realise their perfect world would mean never driving a car or catching a plane, never eating a Big Mac with fries and no more disposable fashion \u2014 just bicycles, vegan wraps and endless yards of sackcloth and ashes.\n\nOr would the last of those get them in trouble with the CO2 police?\n\nOne wonders how many realise their perfect world would mean never driving a car or catching a plane, never eating a Big Mac with fries and no more disposable fashion \u2014 just bicycles, vegan wraps and endless yards of sackcloth and ashes\n\nTomorrow we\u2019ll see England\u2019s rugby team play Tonga in the World Cup. How odd that so many players feel the need to cover themselves in tattoos.\n\nAt least half the squad have them \u2014 and Jack Nowell and three of his teammates are inked almost all over. Poor lads.\n\nIn middle age, their arms will look as if they\u2019re covered in varicose veins.\n\nListening to John Humphrys\u2019s final appearance on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme brought a tear not just to his eye but to mine.\n\nI realised that, over the past 30 years, he has been the one constant man in my bedroom every morning. I suspect I am not alone in saying, Lord, I\u2019ll miss him.", "description": "AMANDA PLATELL: Headmistress Nina Gunson (pictured above) is encouraging her pupils to learn comedy, offering them an eight-week course of stand-up classes", "authors": ["Amanda Platell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/21/01/18742784-0-image-a-98_1569024705941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
