Barrere auditioned at the time as a bassist but eventually joined the band three years later as a guitarist. \"As a bassist, I make an excellent guitarist,\" group members recalled him saying. He stuck with the band since joining in 1972 but sat on the sideline for Little Feat's current tour, which is scheduled to end Sunday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, for medical treatment.\n\n\"He promised to follow his doctor\u2019s orders, get back in shape, and rock on the beach at the band\u2019s annual gathering in Jamaica in January 2020,\" the statement reads. It says Barrere advised fans, \u201c \"Keep your sailin\u2019 shoes close by \u2026 if I have my way, you\u2019re going to need them!' \u201d\n\nBarrere also recorded and performed with Bonnie Raitt, Carly Simon and Robert Palmer, according to his official bio.\n\nRaitt mourned the musician's death early Sunday on Twitter, calling Barrere a \"brilliant guitarist, singer and songwriter\" and a \"cornerstone of one of the greatest bands of all time.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm glad he is free of pain and may he rest in peace. I send my deep love and condolences to his family, bandmates and friends. We will hold him in our hearts and celebrate his life and music always.\"\n\n(2/2) I'm glad he is free of pain and may he rest in peace.

We are grateful for the time we have shared.\"\n\nJosip Elic: The actor carried Jack Nicholson in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' dies at 98\n\n'It\u2019s a very, very sad story': Barbara Walters, 'View' hosts grieve former employee dead at 39\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Paul Barrere, Little Feat guitarist, singer, dies at 71", "description": "Paul Barrere, guitarist and singer for the band Little Feat, has died at 71, the band has announced.
