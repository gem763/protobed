I, too, fail to see compelling evidence to support Trump\u2019s charge.\n\nThere is, however, that other problem of Hunter Biden landing a windfall contract with one of Ukraine\u2019s most corrupt figures after his father took charge of potentially billions in U.S. loans and aid for Ukraine. That is what no one seems to want to discuss.\n\nIndeed, the Biden campaign has been remarkably open in demanding that news organizations stop airing interviews or publishing articles about the allegations. Instead of calling it \u201cfake news\u201d (which is virtually copyrighted by Trump), the Biden campaign calls such coverage \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Turley", "Thehill.Com Opinion Campaign"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
