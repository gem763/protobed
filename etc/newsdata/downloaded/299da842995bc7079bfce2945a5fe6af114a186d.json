Every week, along with other interesting facts, they work in a declaration of something that doesn\u2019t exist. (Last week\u2019s episode was No Such Thing as a Banana with Wifi.) Perhaps they could look into the current activities of the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee for an upcoming show. They could call it No Such Thing as an Impeachment Investigation.\n\nAnd yet that\u2019s exactly what the committee claims to be kicking off this week. Their first guest star will be Corey Lewandowski.\n\nAs they investigate President Donald Trump, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will hold their first official hearing in what they are calling an impeachment investigation. Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s outspoken former campaign manager, is scheduled to appear Tuesday to discuss former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. But it\u2019s unlikely that Democrats will get much new information. A devoted friend and supporter of the president, Lewandowski isn\u2019t expected to elaborate much beyond what he told Mueller\u2019s investigators last year. Mueller himself testified this summer, with no bombshells.\n\nLewandowski is showing up because he\u2019s legally obligated to do so but it\u2019s already been made clear that he doesn\u2019t have much to say beyond what he already told Mueller last year. (And we all know how that ended.)\n\nThe Democrats also wanted two former Trump aides, Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter, to come testify, but they\u2019re not going to show up. They have immunity from congressional investigations due to their former positions. Unless they\u2019re just planning their own do-over of the Mueller probe, what precisely do they hope to achieve here?\n\nI\u2019ve got a possible answer to that question. First of all, as noted above, there\u2019s no such thing as an \u201cimpeachment investigation.\u201d You\u2019re either moving forward with impeachment or your not. This is just an investigation, and a rather dubious looking one at that.\n\nBut the name is really the important bit here, isn\u2019t it? They need to get the networks and the newspapers talking about this. You see, the Democrats spent more than two years talking about Russia, Russia, Russia seven days per week. It was their way of keeping the story in the news in the hopes that it would eventually bring down Trump. Now that the Russia thing has blown up in their faces, they need to trot out a new totem to raise against the President and the magic word is impeachment.\n\nNevermind the fact that they don\u2019t even have enough Democrats to move forward with any attempt at impeachment. And ignore the reality that the Senate would quickly find in the President\u2019s favor if they managed to somehow get that far. This isn\u2019t about actually impeaching Donald Trump. This is a strategy to have people hearing the word impeachment associated with Trump on a daily basis to give the impression that he\u2019s going to crumble any day now. And they need to keep that going until next November.\n\nThis dog and pony show is for the cable news networks and most of them will eat it up. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they should just move forward and try to impeach the president right now if they\u2019re serious about it. But they won\u2019t, because they know it would blow up in their faces and they\u2019d be left looking like Wile E. Coyote yet again.", "description": "You could just call it a media stunt if you like", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lewandowski.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
