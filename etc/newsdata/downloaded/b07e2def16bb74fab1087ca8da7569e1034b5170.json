Those same outlets which reported the story were also quick to point out this supposed incident occurred at the same Christian school where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen, teaches parttime. But, shame on those reporters and media for failing to investigate the story before running salacious headlines and tweeting condemnation. If these journalists had done their jobs, they would have discovered the story to be a fake. Instead, they smeared a good school while also dragging elementary school kids through the mud.\n\nOn Monday, the little girl behind the story revealed she lied and made it all up. Her grandparents also issued an apology on her behalf. But, the fault lies not with this little girl but in the pathetic leftist media who nationalized the story in an errant attempt to villainize white boys and Karen Pence.\n\nHere's what the Washington Post reported on Monday:\n\nThe sixth-grade girl at a private Virginia school who accused three classmates last week of forcibly cutting her hair now says the allegations were false, according to statements from the girl\u2019s family and the principal at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield. School officials met with the girl and her family Monday morning before releasing the statement. The 12-year-old, who is African American, said three white boy students held her down in a school playground a week ago during recess, covered her mouth, called her insulting names and used scissors to cut her hair.\n\nThe grandparents' apology seemed sincere.\n\n\u201cTo those young boys and their parents, we sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused,\u201d the grandparents wrote in a statement sent to The Washington Post by the school. \u201cTo the administrators and families of Immanuel Christian School, we are sorry for the damage this incident has done to trust within the school family and the undue scorn it has brought to the school. To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust. \u201cWe understand there will be consequences and we\u2019re prepared to take responsibility for them,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.\u201d\n\nHere's what leftist blue check-marked Twitter user and one time candidate for Congress had to say when the original story ran:\n\n\"At the school where @KarenPence teaches, 3 white boys assaulted Amari Allen by pinning her hands, covering her mouth, & cutting her hair...while they called her names. This needs daylight. #media #journalism ,\"\n\nAt the school where @KarenPence teaches, 3 white boys assaulted Amari Allen by pinning her hands, covering her mouth, & cutting her hair...while they called her names.\n\n\n\nThis needs daylight. #media #journalism https://t.co/zfE7W6ZEKU \u2014 Jess Phoenix ??????????

One covered her mouth. Another pinned her arms down behind her. The third one cut her hair. What will they do to another girl in five years? In 10?\"\n\nI honestly care less about what Karen Pence has to say about this than the fact that three boys held a girl down.\n\n\n\nOne covered her mouth.

And detail buried in the story: THIS IS THE PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL WHERE KAREN PENCE TEACHES.\"\n\nAuthor Steve Silberman said, \"This should be a national story: At the Christian school where Karen Pence teaches, 3 boys pinned down a black girl and cut off her 'ugly, nappy' hair. This is the kind of \"religious liberty\" championed by this administration of bigots.\"\n\nThere were dozens if not hundreds more just like those tweets. These slanderers should issue apologies. Of course they will not, but what a shame that reporters can run such garbage and still maintain their jobs.\n\n\"Wondering if there'll be an apology from progressives who bought this obviously bogus story and used it to smear Christians, white boys and Karen Pence. I'm assuming not.\"", "description": ".09/30/2019 20:09:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/302/d6193516-7bda-4399-8a41-000583d656e0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
