The university has seen a drop of six per cent in applications from international students to its MBA degree\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus. Elite US MBA programs have suffered declines in international students as more apply to Canadian, Asian and European courses\n\nTightening US visa rules for international students has discouraged many who would want to find employment near their university after graduating from enrolling at American business schools.\n\nRising costs of the MBA degree has also scared off students from the US as well as abroad, according to Forbes.\n\nSome MBA program heads fear this trend has been made worse by President Trump's trade war with China, which is one of the biggest sources of overseas students for US business schools.\n\nThe reported stated: 'A growing number of AsiaPacific candidates opted to stay either in-country or in-region, and internationally minded candidates sent more applications to Europe and Canada and fewer to the United States.\n\n'Weak international demand paired with a strong economy left most US programs with smaller applicant pools this year. The steepest declines were to large, highly ranked full-time two-year MBA programs.'\n\nHarvard University students walking through the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The university has also seen drops in overseas applicants to its business school\n\nFor the third consecutive year, more Canadian programs reported total application volume growth than declines, the survey states.\n\nInternational applications were down 13.7 per cent for graduate programs at US business schools for the 2019 to 2020 academic year, according to the GMAC report.\n\nPaul Oyer, Stanford's dean of MBA programs, said he heard 'a big 10 school' considered closing its MBA course, before mooting the idea.\n\nHe told the Financial Times: 'Immigration and visa issues are just more complicated now. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more closures. They cannot get the numbers.'\n\nLast year MBA programs nationally saw a drop of 6.6 per cent in applications.\n\nAt the same time, the number of applications to international business schools in Asia increased 8.8 per cent in Asia, 7.7 per cent in Canada and 3.2 per cent in Europe.", "description": "Harvard University, Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have all seen drops in interest from international students this year, with some as much as six per cent.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/13/20280976-0-image-a-51_1572269599870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
