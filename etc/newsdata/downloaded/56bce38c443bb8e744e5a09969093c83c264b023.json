We are not superhuman.\u201d\n\nBefore becoming editor-in-chief, Welteroth was serving as the beauty director for Teen Vogue, making her the first ever black beauty director at a Conde Nast publication.\n\n\u201cSeeing my race in a headline next to my name in 2012 put a lot of things in perspective for me,\u201d Welteroth said. \u201cIt helped me realize that no matter how much I code switch, no matter how much I attempt to assimilate and slick my hair back my race will always walk into the room before I do.\u201d\n\nWhen she realized she was making history, she also realized the weight of responsibility being added to her new role.\n\n\u201cIf my race is going to walk into the room before I do I better start embracing that and figuring out how to use that as my superpower. What are the stories that only I can tell? Who are the kinds of voices that I can amplify?\u201d Welteroth said. \u201cAnd it really shifted my whole mission and reframed the significance of this opportunity for me.\u201d\n\nWhile Welteroth was making history with each step in her career progression, she said that being the youngest in charge took its toll on her. She even concealed her age from coworkers and went as far as covering her assistant\u2019s eyes when she filled out her date of birth.\n\n\u201cI very much felt the pressure to work ten times as hard as my counterparts for equal respect,\u201d Welteroth said. \u201cThis is something we don't really talk about often but ageism strikes in both directions.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Welteroth made the decision to step down as editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, two months after the publication announced they would no longer run print editions.\n\n\u201cThat was both a very hard decision to make and one that I absolutely knew I had to make,\u201d Welteroth said. \u201cMy ultimate bucket list of goals had all been checked off and I was ready and eager and yearning for more.\u201d\n\nWhile Welteroth battled her decision on whether to leave, she said her mentor, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, made her realize she had accomplished her goals at Teen Vogue and was being called to \u201cbe braver.\u201d\n\nTaylor Dunn\n\nDuVernay is just one of Welteroth\u2019s impressive and wide-ranging mentors. The list also includes her former boss at Ebony Harriette Cole and marketing executive Bozoma Saint John.\n\n\u201cYounger people who are looking for a mentor need to remember that the best mentee mentor relationships are mutually beneficial, and the best mentors I've had have actually been bosses that I worked for, for a good chunk of years,\u201d Welteroth said.\n\nBut mentors don\u2019t have to fall into the category of bosses or older individuals whose careers you aspire to one day have. Welteroth said she also looks to her left and right when seeking guidance.\n\n\u201cLook at people who are in your peer set,\u201d Welteroth said. \u201cI call my friends my colleagues because there isn't a single business decision I make without checking in with certain friends of mine to say can you help me gut check this? Do you think this rate is good? Would you negotiate this differently? It's the best mentorship that I have and we're all the same age.\u201d\n\nSince leaving Teen Vogue, Welteroth has gone on to publish a part-manifesto, part-memoir titled More Than Enough: Claiming Space for Who You Are (No Matter What They Say), landing her on The New York Times bestseller list, and taking the reality television world by storm as a judge on Project Runway alongside fashion icons Karlie Kloss and Christian Siriano.\n\n\u201cI have always been a hustler, a really hard worker and what I've learned is that's never going to change. Just because you reach a certain level of success that you define for yourself\u2026there's no finish line.\u201d\n\nHear more from Elaine Welteroth on episode #127 on \u201cNo Limits with Rebecca Jarvis.\u201d", "description": "Elaine Welteroth, the youngest and first black editor of Teen Vogue, on ageism in the workplace, friends that double as colleagues and the itch for a multi-faceted career", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/elaine-welteroth-gty-j190611_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
