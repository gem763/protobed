Both sides have threatened tariffs after the Geneva body found neither adhered fully to its findings.\n\nWashington sought permission to impose tariffs up to 100 per cent on European goods worth US$11.2 billion a year. Those include aircraft and aerospace parts from Airbus host nations - Britain, France, Germany and Spain - as well a range of goods including wine, cheese and luxury goods from across the EU.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe scope of the tariffs depends on an arbitration tribunal expected to announce both a value and a methodology next week.\n\nThe people said the tribunal had approved US tariffs on goods with an annual trade value of around US$7.5 billion - lower than the US request, which is typical in such cases, but still what one person close to the case called a significant amount.\n\nBloomberg News reported the figure close to US$8 billion.\n\nNone of the governments or companies agreed to comment.\n\nWashington has drawn up a list of goods worth a total of US$25 billion from to choose items to target if it goes ahead with the tariffs.\n\nOne person close to the case said Washington was likely to go ahead, opening a new front in global trade tensions, after informal overtures from both sides failed to end deadlock.\n\nThe EU cannot retaliate immediately to any tariffs as it did following what it considered to the United States' unlawful imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in 2018.\n\nIts counter-case at the WTO against US support for Boeing, in which it seeks about US$10 billion in tariffs, is not expected to reach the same stage for six months - meaning Washington is free to fire the first shot in any potential tariff war.\n\nOne option being mooted on the EU side is to use an existing war chest of retaliation left over from an earlier case.\n\nIn 2002, the WTO granted the EU the right to hit US$4 billion of US imports in a dispute over US tax breaks for sales of exported goods. The two sides reached a settlement in 2006, ending the sanctions and notifying the WTO of their agreement. However, US compliance was never formally tested at the WTO.\n\nThe US would contest such a move, sources said.\n\nThe EU has also moved to reopen hearings on whether it complied with previous WTO findings, but US sources insist all the procedures on that case have been exhausted.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [PARIS] The United States has been granted approval to impose tariffs on European Union goods with an annual trade value around US$7.5 billion over illegal government support for European planemaker Airbus, people familiar with the matter said. .
