Yes or no?", "language": "en", "text": "Once and for all, are millennials really different from 1) older generations like Baby Boomers, and 2) previous generations of younger people?\n\nI have to say the answers seem pretty obvious to me, yet for some reason folks feel the need to endlessly opine on this. I guess it\u2019s kind of a timeless debate probably going back to when we all lived in caves.\n\nMake no mistake though, billions of dollars, never mind the future of the biggest companies on the planet and more are at stake. How is that? Attracting and retaining a younger demographic is of course critical to the sustainability and success of all our institutions. Think of all the attention placed on and strategies crafted to addressing the wants and needs of young people, whether they\u2019re customers, employees or of course voters.\n\nSo the stakes are high.\n\nI delved into this a bit a few months ago, but recently had the opportunity to get top business leaders to give us their take at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Generational Opportunities.\n\nNaturally, the biggest change agent when it comes to cleaving the young from the old or from previous generations is technology.\n\nTechnology affects behavior which affects society and commerce. Former star basketball player and current ESPN host and commentator Jay Williams spoke about how it isn\u2019t just professional or college athletes who are looking to monetize themselves, but even younger people. \u201cI think you are going to see a lot of kids in high school start thinking about themselves as brands as well, he said. \u201cIt's going to push the envelope.\u201d None of this would be even conceivable without mobile phones and Instagram for instance.\n\nParadoxically perhaps, young people seem to demand authenticity (a favorite term) from that virtual world. Listen to a practitioner, Mark D\u2019Arcy, chief creative officer of Facebook, \u201c...younger consumers are looking for purpose in the brands they connect with, that they invest in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to know the story. They want, increasingly sustainability and environmentalism. These are not trends. These are core principles of branding in the brands that are really connecting. And that story behind the brand is an integral part of that.\u201d\n\nModerator Andrew Serwer and president of NASDAQ Adena Friedman attend the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West Events on October 10, 2019 in New York City.

Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, spoke about the influence of the young, \u201c...our clients are changing. So their expectations of the markets are changing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're much more focused on ESG [environmental, social, and governance.] It's not just how well the company does financially, but how well they do in serving their communities around them. Are they doing the right thing while they are driving to the right financial results? That is changing investing in many ways, and that is all being driven by millennials and \u2014 and Gen Zers. And I think that's going to have a lasting impact on the markets and on the companies and how we operate.\u201d\n\nDan Houston, CEO of Principal Financial Group, notes that the average savings rate of younger Americans \u201chas increased by 25% since the [2008/2009 financial] crisis.\u201d\n\nAll this has huge implications for the workplace too.\n\n\u201c[Younger workers] are quite focused on making sure that their employers have a social conscious,\u201d said Ray McGuire, vice chairman of Citigroup and a veteran investment banker. \u201cWe went through a cycle in the dot com era where for the incoming workforce we had to have concierge services. Today is different. The demands that our workforce are placing on us today are actually quite constructive. They are demanding that we be more socially conscious.\n\n\u201cAnd so while there clearly is the imperative of generating shareholder value, there is the imperative to creating social value and be socially conscious.\u201d", "description": "The biggest change agent when it comes to cleaving the young from the old or from previous generations is technology.", "authors": ["Andy Serwer", "Editor In Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o.GZfAPkESxbAZJAkWXs8w--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/4ac93600-e7dd-11e9-bbfd-500060265e43", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
