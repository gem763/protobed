McCarthy said that, despite a reduction in opioid abuse and overdose deaths, it is not enough to sufficiently address the issue.\n\n\u201cDemocrats should stop wasting time and resources on impeachment and instead work with Republicans to tackle the real issues,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nGood news for ALL Americans \u2926\n\n\u2b2b Opioid abuse and overdose deaths are down.\n\n\u2b2b Treatment for opioids is up.\n\nBut it's not enough. Democrats should stop wasting time and resources on impeachment and instead work with Republicans to tackle the real issues. https://t.co/Q9Oma5gg4o \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 12, 2019\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s office said Wednesday that Republicans have been fighting for legislation to address the opioid crisis for years.\n\nHouse Republicans helped the bipartisan Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act pass through Congress, which President Trump signed last Congress. The SUPPORT Act helps advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, and bolster efforts to fight deadly illicit drugs such as fentanyl.\n\nThe House GOP majority also helped pass the 21st Century Act, which was signed into law in 2016.\n\nHowever, despite the Congress that Republicans made last congressional term with their majority, efforts to address the opioid crisis have stymied while Pelosi has moved to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Democrat majority in the House has siloed all of their attention and resources into impeaching President Trump \u2014 a goal they\u2019ve had since the day he was inaugurated. Meaningful, bipartisan legislation has been thrown to the wayside,\u201d Rep. McCarthy\u2019s office said.\n\nThey said, \u201cIn their attempt to remove from office the duly elected President of the United States on purely political grounds, Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat caucus have blatantly ignored or purposely politicized most other issues that matter to the American people, like combating the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve more from those they lend their voices to in Congress. Instead of wasting their majority on their impeachment fixation, House Democrats should join Republicans to end the opioid crisis in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d McCarthy\u2019s office added.", "description": "Kevin McCarthy said Saturday that Democrats should \"stop wasting time\" on impeachment, and \"tackle\" real issues such as the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Kevin-McCarthy-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
