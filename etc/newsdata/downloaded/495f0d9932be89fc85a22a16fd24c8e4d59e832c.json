A new study purports to show how much a single payer health system will really cost, and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is getting pushback on his plan to solve surprise medical billing.\n\nWe'll start with drug pricing:\n\nHouse Democrats change drug pricing bill in bid to address progressive concerns\n\nGet ready for a long day of drug pricing markups tomorrow...\n\nAhead of the markups in the House Energy and Commerce and House Education and Labor committees, Democratic leaders made some changes to the bill, shifting it slightly to the left in an effort to address progressive concerns.\n\nThe main changes:\n\nIncrease minimum number of drugs to be negotiated from 25 to 35 drugs.\n\nRequire negotiation on some newly launched drugs if their prices are more than the median U.S. household income.\n\nBig picture: The measure is expected to pass the House later this month or early next month, though there are still concerns from some lawmakers on both the progressive side and centrist side. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump again vetoes resolution blocking national emergency for border wall Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey MORE (R-Ky.) has vowed to kill the bill in the Senate, calling it \"socialist.\"\n\nSplits among progressives: Not all progressives reacted in the same way to the changes.\n\nRep.

MORE (D-Texas), who has been one of the most outspoken in pushing the bill in a more progressive direction, is not satisfied.\n\n\"Congressman Doggett is still vigorously pursuing substantial improvements to strengthen the bill,\" a Doggett spokesperson said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTop Republican rejects Dem chairman's approach to stopping surprise medical bills\n\nThe effort to protect patients from surprise medical bills is not exactly smooth sailing right now.\n\nThe latest twist: Rep. Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyAmerica's workers and small business owners need the SECURE Act CBO: Pelosi bill to lower drug prices saves Medicare 5 billion Democratic chairman proposes new fix for surprise medical bills MORE (R-Texas), the top Ways and Means Republican, rejected a proposal from Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014 Buttigieg targets Warren, Sanders on health care ahead of debate | Judge overturns ObamaCare transgender protections | Poll sees support drop for 'Medicare for All' America's workers and small business owners need the SECURE Act CBO: Pelosi bill to lower drug prices saves Medicare 5 billion MORE (D-Mass.).\n\n\"I think we ought to go back to the drawing board rather than pursue that,\" Brady told reporters.\n\nNeal proposed late last month to essentially punt the problem to a committee of stakeholder groups and administrative agencies to come up with a solution. That proposal drew criticism even from some Democrats as not addressing the problem directly, but Neal said at the time that he was \"optimistic\" Brady would support it.\n\nNow, Brady is rejecting Neal's idea.\n\nWhat now? The surprise billing effort seems stalled. While all sides say they agree the problem should be addressed, there are a range of rival proposals on how and no clear path forward at the moment.\n\nRead more here.\n\nVaping industry group launches Fox News ad campaign\n\nThe Vapor Technology Association is launching an advertising blitz to try and convince President Trump Donald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top? MORE not to move ahead with his proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nThe organization is placing a one-week, six-figure buy that covers Fox News programming throughout the day, including Fox & Friends, which the president has been known to watch and tweet about.\n\nLast month, President Trump announced from the Oval Office that he was instituting a total ban on all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco until the companies can clear the Food and Drug Administration's strict regulatory requirements.\n\nHowever, the ads don't fault Trump at all. Instead, they praise Trump for keeping his promises on making sure government agencies follow the law, and blame nameless \"bureaucrats\" for the proposal.\n\n\"Despite President Trump's efforts, bureaucrats are considering a huge new overreach: they're considering banning flavored vapor,\" the narrator says in the 30-second ad. \"Vaping is at least 95 percent safer than smoking. But if the government bans flavored vapor, 150,000 jobs -- gone. Millions will resort to cigarettes or the black market.\"\n\nThe ads, which will also run online, are expected to begin Thursday.\n\nNew study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs $32 trillion over 10 years\n\nAfter a fierce Democratic debate on health care on Tuesday night, there's some new numbers on the issue.\n\nFrom the Urban Institute:\n\nFull scale Medicare for All costs $32.01 trillion over 10 years, saves households $886 billion and covers 32 million more people.\n\nA public option available to all would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Uninsured would fall from 32.2 million to 6.6 million people. All of the remaining uninsured would be people in the country illegally.\n\nPolitics: The full-scale plan is close to what Sens.
