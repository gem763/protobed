The company said it did it because of dangerous wind forecasts but acknowledged that its execution was poor.\n\nIts website frequently crashed, and many people said they did not receive enough warning that the power was going out.\n\n\u201cWe were not adequately prepared,\u201d Johnson said at a press conference last week.\n\nPG&E spokespeople did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment on the sanctions.\n\nIn addition to restoring power faster, the PUC said the utility must work harder to avoid such large-scale outages, develop better ways to communicate with the public and local officials, get a better system for distributing outage maps and work with emergency personnel to ensure PG&E staff are sufficiently trained.\n\nShe ordered the utility to perform an audit of its performance during the outages that began Wednesday, saying the utility clearly did not adopt many of the recommendations state officials have made since utilities was granted the authority to begin pre-emptive power shutoffs last year. The review is due by Thursday, and she ordered several PG&E executives to appear at an emergency PUC hearing Friday.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has also criticized PG&E for its performance during the outage, blaming what he called decades of mismanagement, underinvestment and lousy communication with the public. On Monday the Democratic governor urged the utility to compensate affected customers with a bill credit or rebate worth $100 for residential customers or $250 for small businesses.\n\nNewsom said the shutoffs affected too many customers for too long, and it is clear PG&E implemented them \u201cwith astounding neglect and lack of preparation.\u201d\n\nBatjer\u2019s letter also said that PG&E\u2019s service territory, design of its transmission lines and distribution network and \u201clack of granularity of its forecasting ability\u201d mean it can\u2019t do pre-emptive power shut-offs as strategically as some other utilities, but she said it must work harder to reduce the number of customers affected by future outages.\n\nIn a separate filing with the PUC on Monday, Mendocino, Napa and Sonoma counties and the city of Santa Rosa complained about PG&E\u2019s communications with local governments and emergency management agencies ahead of planned outages. For instance, attorneys wrote, the weather forecasting website that it uses to communicate with local agencies and emergency services is inadequate and not aligned with commonly used public emergency standards.\n\n\u201cIt appears never to have occurred to the utility to confirm with its local public safety partners that the tool would meet their needs, nor did PG&E show the website to the local governments who had long been asking for situational awareness information before launching the website publicly,\u201d attorneys wrote.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 California's top utility regulator blasted Pacific Gas and Electric on Monday for what she called \"failures in execution\" during the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/a58ece_california-power-shutoff-worth-it-87463-in-nov-2018-file-photo-smoke-billows-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
