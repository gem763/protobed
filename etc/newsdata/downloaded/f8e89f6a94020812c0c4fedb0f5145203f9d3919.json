The Israeli military said two rockets had been launched from Gaza, both of which were intercepted by its aerial defence system.\n\nDespite the implications for a future two-state solution, Arab states would be under significant pressure not to escalate if the annexation went ahead, analysts said.\n\nThe fate of the Palestinians has diminished as a priority in many Arab capitals as the geopolitics of the region has shifted. Saudi Arabia and Israel share an interest in combating Iranian influence in the Middle East. Jordan and Egypt have long ago signed peace treaties with Israel, easing the flow of American aid and military equipment on which both depend.\n\nSignificant implications are likely to be felt across the border with the West Bank in Amman. \u201cJordan has real existential fears with any outcome other than a two-state solution,\u201d said Osama al-Sharif, a Jordanian analyst and columnist.\n\nRoughly 2 million Palestinians live in Jordan, most of them naturalised but barred from certain jobs on the basis they will one day be able to return to their own state. Jordanians living in the East Bank also fear that Israeli consolidation of its occupied territories could push new waves of refugees into Jordan, at a time when the country is already hosting an estimate 1.4 million Syrian refugees.\n\nWhy Netanyahu\u2019s election threats could become reality this time Read more\n\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, built on land confiscated from Palestinian families. Extending Israeli sovereignty over such a large area would also be seen as putting an end to fading hopes for a Palestinian state, as there would be little unbroken land on which to create it.\n\nTrump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital early in his term further damaged the two-state ideal. The Palestinians regard the occupied eastern section of Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, and cut contact with Washington after the declaration.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict and annexed in 1981. The move broke from the international consensus following the second world war that forbids territorial conquest during war.\n\nIn Israeli politics, annexation is a popular position. Israel has long stated it would want to keep the 2,400 sq km (927 sq mile) Jordan Valley to maintain control over the international border.", "description": "Israeli prime minister\u2019s proposal would \u2018kill all chances of peace\u2019, says Jordan", "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Oliver Holmes", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593885edf55947b880c7bb88bbe5fa86aac1fe40/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=098ca720a206004ac3b4e94868d5b227", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
