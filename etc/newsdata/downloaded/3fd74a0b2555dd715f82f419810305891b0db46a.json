He had 23 people show up in Mount Ayr (pop. 1,666) in Ringgold County, one of the most rural and hard-pressed in the country. Ten came in Ida Grove (pop. 2,066). Another 20 or so stopped by in Keosauqua (pop. 923).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe turnouts might not sound like much. But they are revealing when you consider that candidate John Delaney attracted just four people when he spoke in the flesh in Sac City this summer. Besides, no other campaign is doing quite what Warren is doing out here in the rural reaches. She has money, staff, a clear populist message, and she came here early and has returned often.\n\nWarren has at least 65 staffers with a dozen offices in Iowa, says aide Jason Noble, in part because she was able to lasso much of the state\u2019s core political talent early on, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\u2019s caucus director from 2016. Noble, a former political reporter for the Des Moines Register, said that one-on-one campaigning is the key to winning this caucus state, where personal relationships matter and hours of time together over the previous year tend to cement commitments when the three-hour caucuses get underway on a cold night next February. \u201cYou have to generate support everywhere,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause the caucuses are all about volunteers. We need people in every precinct advocating for Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where Russell comes in. Earlier this year, he moved from eastern Ohio into an apartment upstairs from a biker bar in downtown Webster City (pop. 8,000), about an hour north of Des Moines. He throws down a few with the locals after a hard day of canvassing. Russell said: \u201cThey aren\u2019t shy about telling you they like Trump. But I bought a couch, table and four chairs from one of them for $25, and he helped me haul it all in. I think I can still get him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHailing from Trump Country himself, Russell is not afraid to engage. \u201cI come from a place where they never see a Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s personal to me. We have to fix this face-to-face.\u201d\n\nTwenty-two people showed up to hear about Warren in Sac City. Democratic County Chair Tonya Ramsey was tickled. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she asked Russell.\n\nRussell just worked the problem. He and a colleague had spent two weekends canvassing the town, knocking on the doors of every likely caucus-goer. He papered the convenience stores with fliers announcing the meeting, both in town and at villages elsewhere in the county. He talked it up with the cashiers. Staff emailed residents, then texted and called.\n\nAD\n\nThe 22 people who came were well informed about all the candidates and their positions. They were picking through Medicare-for-all, trying to understand what it would mean for them. They were a bit long in the tooth, but that\u2019s normal for around here; only one person was under 20. Socialists they are not.\n\nAD\n\nRussell talked up Warren\u2019s 2 percent wealth tax on those with more than $50 million in the bank, money that she would use to buy down student debt and keep rural hospitals open. Russell claims these little gatherings directly inform Warren\u2019s plans for agriculture, rural America and climate change; as voters react and make comments to what he says, Russell takes notes and shoots them to Warren\u2019s headquarters in Des Moines and Boston. \u201cEverybody recognizes the current system isn\u2019t working for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThat sort of talk \u2014 that those at the top need to leave a share for those at the bottom \u2014 appeals to Tonya Ramsey, who works part-time at a grocery store 30 miles away, having just earned her college degree online.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had way more contact with me than anybody else,\u201d Ramsey said of the Warren campaign, stressing that she remains neutral.\n\nAD\n\nIt's a measure of Warren\u2019s strength that all 22 who came to hear Russell stuck around for two hours. By the end, a Biden supporter had agreed to another visit with Warren\u2019s staff. So did a man with a gray ponytail, who strolled in uncommitted to any candidate. If they join up, they will bring neighbors along.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how caucuses \u2014 and nominations \u2014 are won: one voter at a time.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: There\u2019s a reason Elizabeth Warren is surging\n\nJennifer Rubin: Why isn\u2019t Warren connecting with these two key constituencies?\n\nEd Rendell: I like Elizabeth Warren.
