All the adventures, the power of them is sharing them. It's not just us two on the bike. It's much bigger than that.\n\n\"World Rugby are always talking about respect, discipline, integrity, passion, solidarity. These are things you can tangibly use in life-skills education.\"\n\nRutland and Owens cycle on the Long Bien Bridge in Hanoi.\n\nThe pair set off from England's Twickenham Stadium on February 2 and were tasked with delivering the official whistle for the opening match between Japan and Russia which they handed over to referee Nigel Owens.\n\nThe two cyclists, who have been supported on their journey by DHL (CNN's coverage of the Rugby World Cup is sponsored by DHL), were only introduced to one another because Rutland's doctor is James Owens' father.\n\nDespite only meeting five days before setting off and having spent 230 consecutive days together, South African Rutland insists they haven't got sick of one another's company.\n\n\"There was a big risk for both of us, I think,\" the 45-year-old said. \"We didn't know each other, and we got on a bike and spent the next 230 days, every single day hip-to-hip and we still talk to each other so that's a good sign.\"\n\nThis trip isn't the first or even the longest distance Rutland -- general manager for business development for Hong Kong Rugby Union -- has cycled to be at a Rugby World Cup.\n\nFor the 2015 tournament in England, Rutland cycled 41,843 km over two years and three months in the world's first unsupported solo cycle through Africa to watch his beloved South Africa.\n\nWhen he got there, he witnessed his country lose to Japan in one of the biggest shocks in rugby history, but as a result of that game, Rutland developed a love for Japanese rugby.\n\nJames Owens holding the whistle for the opening match of the Rugby World Cup 2019.\n\n\"That night in Brighton was a night I'll never forget,\" the 45-year-old remembers.\n\n\"Obviously losing was a shock but within hours of that, after taking off my green and gold glasses, and as a sports fan and as a rugby fan, witnessing history is just so special.\n\n\"We met a young guy in China who said he heard about rugby because of that match.\"", "description": "Long journeys to major sporting events are not uncommon, but the odyssey of two cyclists to the Rugby World Cup in Japan takes some beating.", "authors": ["Ben Morse", "Alex Thomas", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925141443-bike-to-tokyo-james-owens-ron-rutland-rugby-world-cup-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
