But the 10 Democrats who participated in the seven-hour series of climate change forums on CNN didn\u2019t shrink from making sweeping promises to reshape the American economy in service of what their party\u2019s grassroots supporters see as the paramount goal of averting global warming\u2019s most devastating effects.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris pledged as president to ban the oilfield production method known as hydraulic fracturing and take other steps to cut fossil fuel emissions, regardless of whether Republicans cooperated. Harris said she would eliminate the Senate filibuster, if necessary, to get liberal Democrats\u2019 sweeping Green New Deal proposal passed with a simple majority vote \u2014 a significant move from a candidate who had previously stopped short of such a vow to change congressional procedure.\n\nIn targeting oil and gas and coal production, \u201cthis is a fight against powerful interests,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s lead, follow or get out of the way ... starting with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAll 10 candidates have proposed plans starting at $1 trillion for investment and research designed to wean the U.S. economy off oil, gas and coal by mid-century, with varying focuses on sharp emissions cuts and technological solutions, among other measures. Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro led off the town halls, fielding questions from nurses, teachers and a high school student, who asked why Castro had failed to call for banning hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking.\n\nCastro responded that natural gas \u2014 some of it from fracking \u2014 had served as a bridge while the economy moves to renewable energy sources like solar and wind.\n\nHe cited the extreme weather over the summer to illustrate the urgency of the moment.\n\n\u201cWe see that now with Hurricane Dorian,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Arctic ice caps melting. The Amazon on fire. We don\u2019t need climate scientists to tell us what we see with our eyes.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump began tweeting almost as soon as the forums kicked off, calling Democrats\u2019 proposals to address climate change unnecessary and costly.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 destructive \u201cenvironmental\u201d proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump,\u201d Trump warned.\n\nDemocrats spent the run-up to the event burnishing their environmental credentials, with five candidates releasing in-depth proposals to slash carbon emissions. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders went further, challenging his rivals for the party\u2019s presidential nomination to join him in supporting a full ban on fracking, which is strongly opposed by most environmentalists who view it as an unmanageable risk to local water and air quality as well as the broader climate.\n\nBut while Sanders worked to differentiate himself from former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 who has held an early lead in the Democratic primary and has pledged to regulate, though not abolish, fracking \u2014 the Republican National Committee was criticizing both Sanders and Biden for \u201cradical climate policies.\u201d\n\nAnother top Republican went after Democrats for proposing climate platforms that he said were too aggressive to earn any bipartisan support in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe gap between rhetoric and reality among Democrats has gotten out of hand,\u201d said Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Walden contended that nuclear power must remain part of any workable climate plan. Nuclear currently generates an estimated one-fifth of U.S. electricity.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s plan leaves room for nuclear to remain a power-generation option, Sanders would seek to eliminate it outright.", "description": "Top Democratic presidential contenders talked tough Wednesday on cutting climate-damaging emissions from oil, gas and coal, turning their focus to global...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC551_kamala_ZG_20190124001706.jpg"}
