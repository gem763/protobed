Digital rights non-profit organisation Fight For The Future launched a website and Discord to kick off its organising efforts, and a \u201cProtestBlizzCon\u201d subreddit is gaining serious steam as well.\n\nTake one look at the internet right now, and it\u2019s pretty apparent that people aren\u2019t happy with Blizzard. After it suspended Hearthstone pro Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai and stripped him of his prize winnings at the Asia-Pacific Grandmasters for wearing a mask and saying \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age,\u201d fans and industry pros alike have been vocal about their disapproval of the move, which they see as Blizzard backing down in the face of Chinese economic pressure. This week, Blizzard partially reversed its decision, returning Blitzchung\u2019s prize money and cutting his suspension down to six months. However, it still intends to forbid players from speaking about politics at its events.\n\nBlizzCon is Blizzard\u2019s annual fan convention dedicated to beloved game series like Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Overwatch, and Hearthstone. Last year, it was attended by over 40,000 people, with hundreds of thousands more tuning in to panels and esports events online. It\u2019s also a place where Blizzard developers to go to both make announcements and interact with fans. It is, in many ways, a focal point of Blizzard\u2019s year.\n\nPhoto: Joe Scarnici, Getty\n\nFight For The Future\u2019s protest will take place outside the Anaheim Convention Centre at noon on November 1, the first day of BlizzCon. The organisation is asking protesters to bring umbrellas as a sign of solidarity with protesters in Hong Kong\u2014who\u2019ve adopted umbrellas as a symbol\u2014or to cosplay as their favourite Blizzard characters.\n\nThe digital rights group decided to take up the protest banner because its central priority is to build an internet \u201cfree of interference or censorship and with full privacy,\u201d according to its website, and Blizzard\u2019s actions this past week fly in the face of that goal. Plus, the organisation has its fair share of game-likers among its ranks, and they couldn\u2019t just sit back and do nothing.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of gamers at Fight For The Future, so it was on our radar,\u201d product director Dayton Young told Kotaku over the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re passionate about digital rights, and we thought this was a very clear example of censorship that was very disturbing to all of us. So we wanted to promote it to people in our community and let everyone know this was taking place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe heart of the matter is, they still censored a man and punished him for speaking out and abdicating for his own political freedom, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re continuing to do.\u201d\n\nFight For The Future\u2019s goal is twofold: to get developers and publishers to make a public commitment to supporting the rights of players, employees, and fans across the world, and to get Blizzard to fully reverse its decisions surrounding Blitzchung.\n\nWhile Young believes that Blizzard\u2019s statement and partial scaling back of Blitzchung\u2019s punishment on Friday evening is a promising testament to the power of overwhelming public pressure, he doesn\u2019t think Blizzard\u2019s move solves the core issue, and the protest is currently set to proceed as planned.\n\n\u201cThe heart of the matter is, they still censored a man and punished him for speaking out and abdicating for his own political freedom, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re continuing to do,\u201d said Young. \u201cThey\u2019re saying this because they don\u2019t want to upset people, but I think people are already upset by their decisions... If Blizzard\u2019s true goal is to ensure that every player always feels safe and welcome when competing in tournaments and playing Blizzard games, then Blizzard should let players, fans, and employees know that they can advocate for their own rights without fear of reprisal.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Joe Scarnici, Getty\n\nAlthough organising efforts only just began in earnest, Fight For The Future has already reached out to numerous subreddits and various other involved parties via Twitter and other platforms, Young said. He\u2019s happy to work with other groups organising protests at BlizzCon, which will likely benefit them, seeing as Fight To The Future has helped organise digital and physical actions including the 2012 SOPA/PIPA internet blackout and physical protests against San Francisco-based company Salesforce\u2019s support of ICE.\n\n\u201cI think hopefully we\u2019ll be able to use that experience to help these gamers who are interested in getting their voices heard actually find a way to effectively protest,\u201d said Young. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for us to make tweets, it\u2019s fantastic for us to make statements, but also putting something together, collaborating with each other, showing that we\u2019re all together on this\u2014I think that will be very successful in grabbing Blizzard\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nThe two moderators of the ProtestBlizzCon subreddit come from a very different background. Neither of them have experience organising protests, but they felt like something needed to happen, and they were worried it wouldn\u2019t otherwise.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like one would happen,\u201d said one of the moderators, \u201cTheStableBoy,\u201d whose first name is Adrian. \u201cFor me it\u2019s been a personal experience in a sense. Both my parents grew up in San Francisco and told me stories about times they went protesting,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the right person, but who does in most situations? I just want to make sure something at least happens, regardless of it\u2019s just me alone standing outside. Basic human rights should be a given.\u201d\n\nThe subreddit\u2019s other moderator, Mel \u201cKazemel89\" Thomspon, had been watching things unfold in Hong Kong for months and didn\u2019t like what they saw from U.S.-based companies like Apple, Google, and the NBA. For Thompson, Blizzard was the last straw.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening are horrible human rights violations and suppression,\u201d Thompson told Kotaku in an email. \u201cWhen Blizzard, whose games and mottos support heroes and freedom, and [who] has stated on their company grounds [that] every voice matters, took away Blitzchung for simply saying he supports Hong Kong as the revolution of our times, I was shocked... He never used any foul or extreme language about China. It shows how companies are willing to say they support diversity and heroes until it doesn\u2019t pay.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Joe Scarnici, Getty\n\nAlready, the subreddit is awash with sternly worded condemnations of Blizzard and the Chinese government, as well as creative protest ideas. Adrian and Thompson are planning to adopt some of those, many centering around the Overwatch character Mei, who has become a symbol of resistance in Hong Kong. Thompson said the protest will likely feature \u201cshirts, banners, and flyers that have memes, images, and art of Overwatch\u2019s Mei supporting Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have one Mei cosplayer we are trying to support and get to BlizzCon to protest Blizzard and support Hong Kong outside the Anaheim Convention Centre,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking into ideas on how to donate or fund her into getting there.\u201d\n\nAdrian and Thompson are aware, though, of how zealous some video game fans can get (and allegedly already have gotten, in this case) when it comes to companies making moves they\u2019re ardently opposed to. They do not want their subreddit or the ensuing protest to devolve into a movement of hate, harassment, or racism.\n\n\u201cWe also don\u2019t want this to become a subreddit of hate against Chinese people; lots of mainland Chinese suffer under the CCP government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure it\u2019s on point and polite, because not everyone knows yet or doesn\u2019t have all the facts on the situation, and lots of misinformation is out there,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cWe also don\u2019t want this to become a subreddit of hate against Chinese people; lots of mainland Chinese suffer under the CCP government, such as Uighur Muslims who have lost their rights because of their religion... So far this subreddit hasn\u2019t become extremist, and I\u2019m glad that most people who have joined support protesting Blizzard in legal and well thought-out plans to gain awareness.\u201d\n\nFight For The Future\u2019s Young said that his organisation, too, will do everything it can to \u201cdiscourage\u201d poor behaviour during BlizzCon protests. The staff of the Anaheim Convention Centre have also been paying attention to these nascent organising efforts, and they believe they\u2019re prepared to facilitate both the convention and nearby protests.\n\n\u201cAs a major visitor city, we have significant experience hosting high-profile events,\u201d a spokesman for the convention centre told Kotaku in an email. \u201cThe Anaheim Convention Centre works closely with event organisers and the Anaheim Police Department to ensure a safe experience for both attendees and those who may want to peacefully express themselves.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Joe Scarnici, Getty\n\nMore than anything, Adrian wants \u201ca peaceful protest\u201d that raises awareness of the recent actions of both Blizzard and other companies that have similarly turned a blind eye to China\u2019s handling of Hong Kong. Despite the number of people who\u2019ve already rallied to their cause, though, they aren\u2019t certain there\u2019ll be much of a turnout when the time comes.\n\n\u201cI say that because the Area 51 [event] had about two million people, and it turned out to be 100-ish?\u201d Adrian said. \u201cI know people joined the sub for the memes and shitposts, but me personally, I hope for it to at least inform others of what\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany have posted of already deleting their Blizzard accounts to show their protest and that they support Hong Kong,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo hopefully in the coming days, as more people become aware, we can have enough members to have a big enough protest to make a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this wave over the past couple days of people making games, people doing cosplay, people making their own parody Hearthstone cards,\u201d said Young. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see people exercising their freedom of expression. It\u2019s very important for them to do that. Activision-Blizzard and other game companies need to know that this isn\u2019t going to just go away.\u201d", "description": "Multiple groups are in the process of organising protests set to take place outside BlizzCon, the annual convention held by game developer Blizzard, in response to its suspension of a Hearthstone player for expressing support for Hong Kong during a live event.
