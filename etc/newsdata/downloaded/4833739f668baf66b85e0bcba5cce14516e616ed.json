Activity is expanding throughout the country and in most sectors. The strong performance of the Norwegian economy is expected to continue,\u201d the Finance Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe country\u2019s growth is fuelled by large investments in its offshore oil and gas production, and the central bank has raised interest rates four times in the last year.\n\nUnder its 2020 draft budget, cash spending from the fund will decline to 243.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($26.79 billion) next year from 246.2 billion crowns in 2019, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nUnemployment is now expected to decline to 3.4% next year, below the government\u2019s previous prediction of 3.6% and down from 3.8% in 2018.\n\nThe so-called budget impulse, which measures the spending plan\u2019s impact on economic growth, is anticipated to be minus 0.2 percentage points in 2020, down from a positive 0.5 in 2019 and below the 0.1 boost predicted by Norges Bank, the central bank, last month.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit of a surprise, we had expected the budget indicator to increase by 0.2 while it actually fell by 0.2, so the budget is tight, and it\u2019s even tighter than Norges Bank had expected,\u201d Nordea Markets economist Erik Bruce said.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the government is really holding back on spending. If anything, it argues for a lower rate path - not that much, but it\u2019s slightly tighter than Norges bank had expected,\u201d he added.\n\nUnlike most other nations, which must take on debt if they seek to spend more than they earn from taxes and other revenues, Norwegian governments can instead use up to 3% each year of the saved-up wealth fund to plug deficits.\n\nThe 2020 budget would spend 2.6% of the estimated Jan. 1 value of Norway\u2019s wealth fund, down from 2.9% in 2019.\n\nThe crown currency weakened slightly against the euro, trading at 9.9864 at 0629 GMT against 9.9825 just ahead of the 0600 GMT budget release.\n\nBuilt since 1996 to save petroleum revenues for future generations, the size of the sovereign wealth fund has grown to almost three times that of Norway\u2019s annual gross domestic product, far exceeding original projections.\n\nThe government\u2019s forecasts for economic growth in 2019 and 2020 remain unchanged from May, when it predicted expansion of 2.7% and 2.5% for the two years respectively.", "description": "Norway plans to spend less money next year from its $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, as economic growth remains strong and unemployment declines, the centre-right majority government said on Monday.", "authors": ["Victoria Klesty", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
