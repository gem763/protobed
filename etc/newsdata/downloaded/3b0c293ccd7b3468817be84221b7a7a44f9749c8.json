Then her video about it went viral.", "language": "en", "text": "Savannah Cristina\u2019s self-care skip day didn\u2019t exactly go as planned.\n\nThe Florida native decided to play hooky from work recently. The singer and songwriter was \u201cgoing through a lot\u201d so she put her mental health first and went to the beach with her equipment, performing a song in front of the crashing waves about the importance of self care.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was neglecting myself. I felt like as a woman, as a person, I was neglecting my feelings [and] my responsibilities that I had to myself. I was worried about my responsibilities as a lover, as a friend, as a daughter, as a sister, as an older sister, as a worker, as a student \u2018cause I\u2019m in college as well,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle of her motivation to prioritize her feelings over work. \u201cBut I was neglecting my responsibilities as an individual.\u201d\n\nThe video on Twitter received nearly 2 million views, validating her decision. \u201cMusic is my life. Music is my priority. I don\u2019t care what else is on hold; I have to do what I have to do and that\u2019s exactly what I did and it actually ended up getting more traction than my last video, which also went viral and I was like \u2018wow.\u2019 I made a sacrifice and the timing was perfect and now here I am,\u201d she says.\n\nI called out of work and wrote a song at the beach instead....\n\n\n\nSelf-Care pic.twitter.com/CirsFYVYhA \u2014 Savannah Cristina (@saveannah) October 16, 2019\n\nMany social media users were touched by Cristina\u2019s music and some even expressed their appreciation for her sacrifice. One user thanked her for taking a day off from work to create the song and another proclaimed that Cristina was going to be her \u201cnew obsession.\u201d\n\nWhere is the Spotify link because you sound like my new obsession !!\ud83e\udd15 \u2014 Boba Queen\ud83d\udc9a (@JayySierra) October 17, 2019\n\nGirl I needed this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc9bI love you and your voice \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9bthank you for calling out of work to make this magic \u2014 M \u0251 \u027e i \u0251 \u0570 \ud83d\udc33 (@MarMar_416) October 16, 2019\n\nThis couldn\u2019t have came at a better time. I NEEDED this. This give my soul peace & tranquility. And my mind balance. When you\u2019re productive on your days off. Thank you queen for taking a day off from work to bless our eardrums with your sweet sound of bliss. \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \u2014 TamekaDakhil (@DakhilTameka) October 17, 2019\n\nI love this \u2014 amanda \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf9 (@AdoreAmanda_) October 16, 2019\n\nDamn girl this is awesome I love ur voice \u2014 \u2728Trash Dork of ur life\u2728 (@Aelithaaaaseur) October 19, 2019\n\nIt was quickly apparent that her song \u201cSelf Care\u201d was touching more people than she could have imagined. For Cristina, that was the whole point.\n\n\u201cThe message I wanted to get across in my video and the rest of my music is just showing people that you can just find a place to be at peace and create,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you are in life and the video is metaphorical. So, it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, you can still sit down and process your feelings [letting] them out in a productive way.\u201d\n\nWith viral fame comes IRL attention and needless to say, it was not long before word of Cristina\u2019s self-care day got back to her boss and she was called into the office to speak to her supervisor about her video. She said that management was not upset, but she did feel like it was time to take an important step to go after her dreams.\n\nSafe to say one of my co-workers sent this to our supervisor\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/drztrIelzR \u2014 Savannah Cristina (@saveannah) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming with that job and they know what I do,\u201d she admits. \u201cThey were, I felt, trying to stifle my creativity, or be too involved in my personal life like \u2018You don\u2019t know when I shot that. You don\u2019t know anything. So you\u2019re way too in my grill,\u2019 which is only more confirmation to not work here anymore. So you can imagine, after that conversation they were waiting for me to have like our main manager come in, but I just never went back, so they won\u2019t be seeing me.\u201d\n\nWith more free time on her hands, Cristina plans to release more music.\n\n\u201cI just want people to follow me, follow my music and follow my journey,\u201d she says. They\u2019ll definitely be learning more about me in the upcoming months as I get more shine. But you know, I\u2019m just a regular girl from Florida [and] I\u2019ve overcome a lot of things. The only way I\u2019ve been able to overcome the day-to-day stupid jobs, stupid boyfriends, annoying co-workers and all the regular things, school and student loans all that stuff is through music. And I just want to show [people] that I made it out of mental boundaries, depression, anxiety and just the things we go through as young millennials. And I\u2019m a minority, so it\u2019s just being an inspiration and showing people you can channel your pain into positivity, productivity and profit because you profit emotionally from putting yourself out there.\u201d", "description": "Savannah Cristina has been \"going through a lot\" lately so she decided to play hooky.
