The stock market didn\u2019t care.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Trump tried to threaten Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son. Trump denied the allegations and said he applied \u201cno pressure.\u201d It was also alleged that a transcript of the call was moved off one computer network and onto another.\n\n\n\nThe market once again shrugged off the political drama. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 76.26 points, or 0.3%, to 26,894.45 on Thursday, after being down well more than 100 points. The S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 2977.77, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.6% to 8030.66.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just Thursday. The S&P 500 has dipped 0.5% so far this week, while the Dow is 0.1% despite the launch of an impeachment inquiry against the president. It is likely investors will continue not to care.\n\nPart of that is history: During the impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton the market simply continued to follow the trend it was already on. Also, the odds that Trump will be removed from office are tiny. Even if the House votes to impeach\u2014still no sure thing\u2014two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote for Trump\u2019s removal. That\u2019s highly unlikely given the fact that the Senate is controlled by the Republicans, the president's party.\n\nIn fact, the market seems to be worrying more about China and the state of the U.S. economy than impeachment, according to Sevens Report\u2019s Tom Essaye.\n\n\u201cU.S./China trade remains the singular most important issue facing this market, and as long as markets have \u2018hope\u2019 of a U.S./China trade \u2018truce,\u2019 it\u2019ll be hard to sustain any material downside in stocks,\u201d he writes. \u201c[That] \u2018hope\u2019 is based on the idea that a lasting U.S./China trade truce (so different than the past two we\u2019ve had) will reduce pressure on the U.S. and global manufacturing sectors, and combined with coordinated global easing (so rate cuts from the ECB/PBOC/Fed) will cause a 2016 style reflation, and an extension of the economic expansion...if we ignore hope for a second and look at the facts, it remains difficult to see how a trade truce revives the global manufacturing sector.\u201d\n\nAnd impeachment? \u201c[The] impeachment drama, which will certainly continue to dominate the headlines, likely won\u2019t impact markets in the near or medium term unless there is a big surprise lurking,\u201d Essaye writes.\n\nAnd maybe not even then.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "The market is once again shrugging off the political drama, as investors stay focused on things like China trade and the U.S. economy.", "authors": ["Ben Levisohn"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111370/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
