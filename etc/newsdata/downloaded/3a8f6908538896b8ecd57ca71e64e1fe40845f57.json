The Defence Department added that Turkish aircraft had been removed from daily air operations by the US and allies above southern Turkey and northern Syria.\n\nThe US urged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to invade Syria or to attack US-allied Kurdish forces AP\n\nTrump seemed to adjust his message as well, saying Turkey would be held responsible for reining in Islamic State terrorists - and that he'd \"totally destroy and obliterate\" Turkey's economy if it did anything he considers \"off limits\".\n\nBlaming his predecessor Barack Obama for sending US troops into Syria in the first place, Trump told reporters that \"we have only 50 people in all that area\" where Erdogan has threatened an invasion, and \"I don't want those 50 people hurt or killed or anything.\"\n\nThe whipsaw of bold warnings followed by soothing reassurances is familiar from episodes like Trump's shift from threatening \"fire and fury\" against North Korea to extolling his friendship with Kim Jong-un. Or pursuing peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan, only to call them off at the last minute.\n\nAccording to two senior State Department officials, Trump hadn't even planned on weighing in on Syria on Sunday night. They said he had a phone call with Erdogan to discuss the continuing dispute over his decision to buy a Russian missile defence system. Erdogan shifted the conversation to northeast Syria at the very end of the call, they said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Erdogan announced his intention to invade, Trump made what one State Department official described as a tactical decision to move a small number of soldiers out of harm's way. He also wanted to move the troops, the official said, because he feared their continued presence would suggest tacit support for an incursion.\n\nA senior administration official said Trump's decision was discussed with senior officials, including at the State Department and Pentagon. The official scoffed at suggestions Trump's move blindsided advisers, saying that that false impression was probably spread by lower-level officials who didn't need to be in the loop.\n\nBut the assurances didn't dissuade critics.\n\n\"In a nutshell, Trump threw the Kurds under the bus,\" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. \"Pressed to choose between the Turks and the Kurds, he sided with the former.\" He said the decision \"delivers a blow to US credibility worldwide. No one can trust the US to provide protection.\"\n\nThe day's briefings were familiar for anyone who has covered the Trump administration: The president says - or tweets - something that everyone thinks is a policy decision and then staff members fan out to suggest that he actually meant something rather different.\n\nThe practice has become so common that some State Department staff have privately joked that they've become like comic-book writers who have to provide \"retroactive continuity\" - a literary device that changes a superhero's previously established narrative - to Trump's declamations.\n\nPart of the problem, according to a former senior administration official who sometimes briefed Trump, is that he shrugs off formal preparations in advance of phone calls with foreign leaders because he thinks sitting still for such prepping makes him look weak and ill-informed.\n\n\"This president and this administration from Day One has demonstrated a frenetic foreign policy with not much of a clear strategy to it,\" Representative Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat and former CIA operations officer, said.\n\n\"This is just one more example of a place where there does not appear to be a strategy. And it's worse than that: We are potentially upending a strategy that has been successful in years past.\"\n\nBloomberg", "description": "The US President's surprise announcement that US forces would stand aside if Turkey invaded Syria sowed chaos in his administration and drew criticism from his allies in Congress and left Kurdish fighters feeling betrayed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4946%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_275%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/83f850012dbf3e525bf2b2285664c53ea5247f5f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
