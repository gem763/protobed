Only I know when it's best for me to take that role. I'm not going to do that in a situation where I still know my capabilities and what I can do.\"\n\nHe has changed his tune in that regard, telling ESPN's Stephen A. Smith he just wants to play and is willing to take a backup role.\n\nSince most teams have their rosters set leading into training camp at the end of the month, Anthony may have to keep waiting until an injury occurs or teams want to add a scoring presence off the bench.\n\nMelo averaged 13.4 points and 5.4 rebounds in 10 games with the Houston Rockets in 2018-19. The 35-year-old owns a career scoring average of 24.0 points per game in 16 seasons.", "description": "As  Carmelo Anthony 's search for a new home in the  NBA  continues, at least one executive believes the 10-time All-Star's game doesn't fit in today's game...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/853/hi-res-0d62f203a22ddd4faaae092b26693b68_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
