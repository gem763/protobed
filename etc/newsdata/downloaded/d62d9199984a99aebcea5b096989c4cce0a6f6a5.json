In days when the nation needs a bit of cheering up, maybe we all need to be more Dante.\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror)\n\nSeeing him beaming and working hard to spread happiness to others through his work as an ambassador for children\u2019s charity Variety, despite his own debilitating illness, inspires everyone he meets.\n\nHearing him remind people of his motto: \u201cThere are no disabilities, just abilities\u201d lifts them out of any gloom and reminds us to focus on the special things we can all do.\n\nDressed in a tiny white tuxedo that was the envy of star Ashley Banjo, Dante zoomed around in a wheelchair covered in wrestling stickers.\n\nHe was a pocket rocket of positivity, taking to the stage with a loud: \u201cWhat\u2019s up London?\u201d like a rock star.\n\nDante, 11, from Liverpool, has endured much more than most.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror)\n\nHe had 16 broken bones in his mum Rachael\u2019s womb and was born with brittle bone disease and scoliosis.\n\nHe has broken 92 bones in his life \u2013 as a sneeze or high-fiving one of his siblings can injure him \u2013 and has endured 17 separate operations to insert rods in his limbs. Rachael says: \u201cI don\u2019t stop Dante doing anything \u2013 he just gets on with it.\n\n\u201cHe hates seeing other children sad. If I take him to hospital he is more bothered about the child in the bed opposite who is crying and tries to reassure them. I am so proud of him.\u201d\n\nDante is so grateful for his new yellow wheelchair that had been donated by Variety. He said: \u201cMy message to anyone with a disability is, \u2018don\u2019t give up\u2019.\u201d\n\nA huge fan of Coronation Street the lad was invited on to the cobbles to be surprised by Jack P Shepherd who plays David Platt. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t have the words to describe how much I love David Platt. He has the same personality as me.\n\n(Image: Roland Leon Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cI was so shocked to see Jack I had to go away and have a little cry.\u201d\n\nPresenting his Child of Courage award, Jason Manford asked if he\u2019d like to be a comedian \u2013 and Dante told him he never stops laughing.\n\nJaydee-Lee is a special little seven-year-old from Fochriw, South Wales.\n\nShe might not be the first to shout out in class, but she listens so intensively in class that she learned an important and life-saving lesson.\n\nWhen Wales and West Utilities visited her school to give a talk on gas safety, she remembered not only the warning signs of odourless carbon monoxide poisoning but even the emergency phone number.\n\nThree weeks later, Jaydee-Lee went to bed as usual but woke in the middle of the night to find her four-year-old brother Laylan acting strangely and disorientated.\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nShe recognised the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, alerted mum Lindy and urged her to call for help.\n\nLindy said: \u201cJaydee-Lee came out on the landing and said \u2018Mam, what\u2019s that red light?\u2019 So we went to look at it and she said, \u2018Mam that\u2019s the carbon monoxide alarm\u2019\u201d. Jaydee-Lee added: \u201cI told Mummy to call. I knew the number \u2013 0800 111 999.\u201d\n\nA gas engineer was soon with them and praised Jaydee-Lee\u2019s quick-thinking \u2013 and even offered her a job.\n\nWithout Jaydee-Lee her family would have been among the 50 people in the UK killed by carbon monoxide poisoning this year.\n\nThe Pride of Britain Awards gives us all a chance to say, to the small wonders who make a big difference across the county: thank you.", "description": "While Dante Marvin danced on stage at Pride of Britain 2019 ceremony, Jaydee-Lee Dummett accepted her award with a sweet smile", "authors": ["Julie Mccaffrey", "Image", "Andy Stenning Daily Mirror", "Daily Mirror", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746117.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_POB-Awards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
