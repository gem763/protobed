While home lending surged 5.1 per cent in July, led by new mortgage commitments to owner-occupier borrowers, new dwelling approval figures for the same month - a leading indicator of future activity - recorded a 9.7 per cent decline.\n\nIn such an environment, smaller home builders are suffering more than the larger ones. The latest Housing 100 report shows the big got bigger in Australian home building as the largest players took a greater share of a market hit by credit curbs and weaker confidence.\n\n\"The market pulled back 15 per cent over the last 12 months. Those in the largest 100 reduced by half of that,\" HIA Principal economist Tim Reardon said.\n\n\"Smaller builders are wearing a disproportionate amount of pain from that contraction. The volume builders tend to be better at managing slowdowns... and tend to gain a bit of market share at this point in the cycle.\"\n\nThe combined market share of the country's 20 largest home builders rose to 35 per cent from 33 per cent a year earlier and the largest share since 2014.\n\nNew housing starts of the top 20 home builders in NSW fell 4.2 per cent to 15,688 from 16,384. In Victoria, by contrast, the total was hardly changed at 21,837 in the year to June compared with 21,847 in 2018.\n\n\"Home building businesses in Sydney have experienced a sharper contraction in the number of new home starts than other jurisdictions,\" the HIA said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelbourne-based detached home-builder Metricon held its position at No. 1 with 4473 housing starts, down 6.1 per cent from the previous year's 4764. While Meriton was second, Perth-based ABN Group rose to third place from fourth even as its total starts fell 7.9 per cent to 2987 from 3243 a year earlier.\n\nMultiplex was Australia's third-largest home builder in 2018 with 3267 apartment starts, but the company dropped off the top 20 in the latest report after chalking up just 467 starts, reflecting concerns voiced by Multiplex's Victorian head Graham Cottam in March about the shrinking apartment pipeline.\n\nOne source of demand for new housing in the current year was coming from the emerging demographic of young families - the first grandchildren of baby boomers to have their own children - who were leaving the apartments they had been living in and looking for middle-ring suburban townhouses suitable for raising their own families, Mr Reardon said.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to see a little bubble of young families coming through \u2013 the grandchildren of baby boomers \u2013 now entering that phase where they\u2019re seeking to find a family home,\" he said.", "description": "Meriton leapt up the rankings of the country's biggest home builders last year, propelled to No. 2 from ninth place on soaring apartment completions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3078%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_50%2C$y_409/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4426df0d117acf99c9a34b6cc1b6c693665127ff", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
