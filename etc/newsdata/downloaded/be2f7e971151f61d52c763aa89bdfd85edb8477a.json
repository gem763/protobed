What\u2019s more? Over 80 percent of all voters (including 84 percent of independents) now want these reforms passed at the federal level.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSen.

Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders on difference with Warren: she's a capitalist 'I'm not' Sunday Show Preview: Trump's allies and administration defend decision on Syria Klobuchar takes shots at health and education plans supported by Sanders and Warren MORE (I-Vt.)? Despite his first-in-class small-donor-powered fundraising operation, his poll numbers continue to drop while Warren\u2019s are surging. He\u2019s also yet to officially pledge to #FixDemocracyFirst. Sanders should join his cohorts and re-establish himself as America\u2019s anti-corruption leader by pledging to tackle corruption not only as a platform issue, but as his first issue.\n\nHopefully, Sanders sees that attempting to fix any other issue \u2014 from health care to education, taxes to the environment \u2014 without first breaking special interests\u2019 grip on the system is not possible.\n\nHe seems to be getting closer to this realization: On Monday, he announced a bold plan to get corporate money out of politics that starts with a ban on corporate contributions to next year\u2019s Democratic Party Convention and all related committees, if he\u2019s the nominee. And, to be fair, he was the first to sign onto a \u201cFix Democracy\u201d pledge in 2016 \u2014 but so much has changed since then. We have learned of unprecedented millions being purged from the rolls since 2016 \u2014 which has not been addressed during the debates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSanders has a prime opportunity to break this silence during the upcoming Oct. 15 debate. For too long, candidates have put democracy reform in their platform, as he has (even without mentioning voter purges or their proven countermeasure, Same Day Registration), but have not put it as the first issue, understanding that all other issues are affected by corruption. Getting corporate money out of politics is a start, but it is clear voters need more.\n\nIndeed, without pledging to address corruption first, it may be impossible to win the presidency. No Democratic nominee for president has won a majority of the white vote in the past 50 years, and the 2016 election was determined by less than 80,000 votes across 3 states. There\u2019s literally no path to victory without the black and brown vote.\n\nSanders was definitely on the right path at the last presidential debate, when he said that every issue we care about is blocked by corruption. But if he\u2019s really committed to getting his poll numbers back on track, he\u2019d do well to make the case as to why the next president must fight corruption. In the wake of the first presidential election without the full protection of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the future of our nation depends on the next president being committed to this cause and fix democracy.\n\nRenaldo Pearson is the director of external affairs for RepresentUs, the nation\u2019s largest grassroots anti-corruption campaign.
