That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\n\"To be clear, what you described is a quid pro quo\" -- Here's Mick Mulvaney casually admitting that Trump held up aid to Ukraine as leverage to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the 2016 election pic.twitter.com/ylz7BKEmKd \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nForeign policy negotiations often demand trading a move by one country with a policy change by the other. President John F. Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union by agreeing to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the USSR pulling its nuclear missiles from Cuba.\n\nWhat makes Trump\u2019s exchange different is that the \u201cfavor\u201d he asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a personal, political benefit. The insertion of personal gain is what makes it corrupt.\n\nMulvaney claimed that the Trump administration was withholding aid from Ukraine to coerce the country into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged \u201ccorruption\u201d in the 2016 election \u2015 not former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s top political rivals heading into 2020. (Mulvaney\u2019s claim is incomplete and misleading: Trump brought up both the DNC server and Biden in his call with Ukraine\u2019s president.)\n\nWhen Karl asked why the U.S. stopped the aid, Mulvaney said that Trump thought it was unfair that the European Union wasn\u2019t doing more to help Ukraine.\n\nThen Mulvaney referenced a debunked conspiracy theory that claims the DNC\u2019s physical \u201cserver\u201d is missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia\u2019s hack of the DNC\u2019s servers, is framing Russia for election interference.\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,\u201d Mulvaney told the reporter. \u201cBut that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we hung up the money.\u201d\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported last year, the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cserver\u201d is actually a system of 140 servers and none of the DNC\u2019s machines are missing.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska denounced efforts to \u201chold up\u201d foreign aid for political reasons.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d Murkowski said in response to questions about Mulvaney\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d Murkowski says when asked about Mulvaney comments today\n\n\n\nShe also says it\u2019s not appropriate to hold G7 at Trump Doral \u2014 Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) October 17, 2019\n\nHours after the news conference, Mulvaney walked back his admission that the U.S. withheld Ukranian aid for political gain.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, he said the opposite of his earlier remarks: \u201cThere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukranian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nMulvaney also wrongly blamed the media for \u201cmisconstruing\u201d and putting a spin on the comments he made during the news conference, which was televised and streamed live to the public.\n\nPaul Blumenthal contributed reporting.\n\nThis article has been updated with Mulvaney\u2019s later comments denying he had said there was a quid pro quo over political help.", "description": "Trump's acting chief of staff told reporters, \"We do that all the time,\" when asked about withholding aid for political help.
