So far we know that the basics of the complaint are that President Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating his likely 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, amid reports that his son, Hunter, was given millions of dollars while sitting on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian gas company. The likes of Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff, who have already suggested Trump's request of Zelensky is an impeachable offense, found the document to be \"troubling,\" \"deeply disturbing,\" and an \"urgent matter.\"\n\nSchumer on reading the whistleblower complaint: \u201cHaving read the documents in there, I'm even more worried about what happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation. There are so many facts that have to be examined. It\u2019s very troubling.\u201d \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) September 25, 2019\n\nSCHIFF after reading whistleblower complaint:\n\n\n\n\u201cI found the allegations deeply disturbing. I also found them very credible. I can understand why the IG found them credible ...The complaint was very well written and certainly provides information for the committee to follow up...\u201d \u2014 Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) September 25, 2019\n\nRep. Mike Quigley (D-IL) called the complaint \"extraordinarily detailed\" and agreed with Schiff that it is \"deeply disturbing\" and a \"blueprint\" for Congress.\n\nOther Democrats are demanding to see the \"classified\" parts of the document. GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had a field day with that.\n\nCan't make this up.\u2192 Democrats are holding a show vote to request access to the classified whistleblower documents. There\u2019s just one thing...they ALREADY have access. They were literally able to view the documents in the Capitol today.\n\n\n\nThis Dem Majority has become pointless. \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) September 25, 2019\n\nA few Republicans who read the complaint had a much different reaction than their Democratic counterparts.\n\nI do not support impeachment of President Trump. I have just read the whistleblower complaint made available to House Intelligence Committee Members. I believe strongly in transparency and it should be immediately declassified and made public for the American people to read. \u2014 Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) September 25, 2019\n\nSchiff revealed this week that the whistleblower agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee for further discussion about what he knows of that phone call between the two presidents.\n\nIn a press conference earlier today, Trump maintained that his call with Zelensky was on the level and that if anyone has something to answer for, it's Biden and the Democrats. He called the whole whistleblower mania a \"hoax.\"", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:28:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/143/2733b6f3-c891-450a-8f9d-6f74bbdbbf1c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
