Portland, Maine, US\n\nThe Harbour City of Maine is not to be confused with Portland in Oregon, despite both being popular locations for foodies.\n\nThis US city has an abundance of cuisines to choose from, such as locally caught seafood and Mexican tacos.\n\nNewspaper fans can stay at The Press Hotel \u2014 where the Portland Press Herald was once headquartered.\n\n2. Dakar, Senegal\n\nLocated in West Africa, Dakar offers a combination of African and French architecture and culture.\n\nTravellers can easily travel to the city thanks to flights with TAP Air and Iberia.\n\nWith the 30th Fashion Week next year in June, as well as the first design hotel of the city, Bantu Wax, the politically stable city is one to visit in 2020.\n\n3. Plymouth, UK\n\nPlymouth was voted \u201cone to watch\u201d thanks to the influx of famous chefs at the Barbican including Marco Pierre White and Mitch Tonks.\n\nThe city in Devon is also celebrating 400 years since the Mayflower set sail from Plymouth to the US, with a number of celebrations planned throughout the year.\n\nWith some of the largest concentrations of cobbled streets in Britain, be sure to wear your comfortable walking shoes.\n\n4. Salvador, Brazil\n\nBrazil hit the headlines earlier this year following the Amazon fires, although experts claimed that tourism is as big as ever.\n\nThe capital Bahia recently launched a new metro line from the airport to the city centre, making it easier for visitors.\n\nArt Deco fans will also enjoy the rich history and architecture of Salvador.\n\n5. Paris, France\n\nWhile one of the most popular cities in the world, Paris is one to add to the bucket list next year thanks to a number of new hotels opening in the city.\n\nA new Soho House will open in 2020 along with the Bulgari Hotel Paris.\n\nModern art fans can also head to the new Bourse de Commerce, designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando.\n\n6. Egadi Islands, Sicily\n\nThe Five Islands of Egadi in Sicily are special for their own reasons, and not just because they remain relatively untouched by tourists.\n\nFavignana, shaped like a butterfly, is the largest and is easily biked around, while Levanzo, the smallest, is great for scuba divers thanks to the Roman shipwreck remains.\n\nThe other three have their own stories \u2014 Marettimo was once considered to be the home of Odysseus.\n\n7. Siargao, Philippines\n\nSiargao is Bali before the tourists came, according to experts.\n\nJust one tenth of the size, surfers flock to try the famous Cloud 9 barrelling wave on the shores.\n\nThere are a number of eco-hotels and establishments on the main island as well as the nearby islets.\n\n8. Kyoto, Japan\n\nAussies will be flocking to Japan next year thanks to the 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe games have meant that a number of new hotels are opening in the capital.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth detouring to Kyoto, which offers authentic Japanese experiences including onsen bathing and ryokan-inspired homes.\n\n9. Galway, Ireland\n\nGalway is also having a moment next year having been voted 2020s European Capital of Culture.\n\nThe Irish west-coast city will host numerous events featuring high-profile celebrities, including Margaret Atwood on the International Women\u2019s Day march.\n\nThe world\u2019s longest oyster festival, having run for 65 years, will take place later in the year.\n\n10.
