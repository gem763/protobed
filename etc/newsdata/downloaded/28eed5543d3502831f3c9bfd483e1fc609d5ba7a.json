Departments face new challenges in monitoring and responding to any disruption that may ensue.\n\n\"This includes supporting businesses and individuals in meeting their new obligations, mitigating risks of the border becoming vulnerable to fraud, smuggling or other criminal activity, and activating civil contingency plans if necessary.\"\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit plan explained Boris Johnson sent the EU a new Brexit plan in October 2019 to replace Theresa May's 585-page Withdrawal Agreement. It would keep a transition period continuing EU rules and payments to December 2020. But it would scrap the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic from 2021. In the backstop's place would be 'two borders': Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. Customs checks across the Irish border would only take place on a \"very small number\" of goods, away from the border itself to avoid new physical infrastructure. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland would get a chance to exit EU single market rules every four years through a vote in Stormont. But this proposal was reportedly dropped after anger in the EU. Stormont has not sat for years and there are fears such a veto would give the DUP too much power.\n\nThe report says there are 150,000 to 250,000 traders, estimated by HM Revenue & Customs, who would need to make a declaration for the first time in the event of no-deal.\n\nThe NAO said Government's reasonable worst-case planning assumptions state that the flow of goods across the short Channel crossings could initially be reduced to 45-65%, taking up to 12 months to flow normally, and in forming this estimate it assumed that 30-60% of hauliers travelling to the EU border will have appropriate documentation.\n\nThe watchdog found that despite efforts across Government, a \"large proportion\" of traders and businesses would not be ready for new customs and regulatory controls if the UK leaves without a deal and might not be able to access the support they require.\n\n\"Despite the Government's actions, it has been unable to mitigate the most significant risks to the effective functioning of the UK border in the event of no-deal and the border would be 'less than optimal',\" the report said.\n\nBrexit Countdown PM says we leave in 0 Days 0 Hours 0 minutes 0 Seconds\n\nThe NAO said the UK Government has announced temporary arrangements for managing trade crossing the land border from Ireland to Northern Ireland, but it acknowledges these are \"not likely to be sustainable\", adding that there is still uncertainty about border arrangements that the Irish government would introduce.\n\nGareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \"Preparing the UK border for EU exit with or without a deal is extremely complex and has required a huge amount of work from many Government departments, agencies and third parties such as traders.\n\n\"Despite their efforts, significant risks remain which may have consequences for the public and businesses.\n\n\"Government will face new challenges in monitoring and responding to any disruption that may ensue following a no-deal exit, and will need to replace temporary measures with sustainable long-term solutions to ensure the border is fit for purpose.\"\n\nCommenting on the report, a Government spokesman said: \"We are doing all that is necessary to ensure that, if we do leave without a deal, the transition will be as smooth as possible for people and businesses - which the NAO recognises.\n\n\"This includes simplifying import processes, upgrading IT systems, securing additional freight capacity and putting traffic management plans in place around our busiest ports.\n\n\"As the NAO says, many of the challenges that we may face if the UK leaves the EU without a deal require businesses and citizens to take action.\n\n\"That's why we are running the largest communications campaign in recent UK history and providing targeted advice to help them get ready for Brexit on 31 October.\"", "description": "A damning National Audit Office (NAO) report says it is impossible to know what will happen if there is no Brexit deal on October 31", "authors": ["Catherine Wylie", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20397805.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Passport-control-at-Gatwick-Airport.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
