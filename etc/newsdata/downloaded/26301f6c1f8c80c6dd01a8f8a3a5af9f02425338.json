With no fancy lights or extra amplification \u2014 just performers and a crowd, with hardly any distance between them \u2014 emotions can run high.\n\nSo if you look around the room when a Tiny Desk is being taped, you'll usually see a Bob Boilen-patented mix of joy, surprise and delight on people's faces. But the intimacy and intensity of Tiny Desk concerts also mean that, sometimes, we've been known to cry at a particularly moving set. (Some of us more than others.) Of course, those tears can be caused by a variety of things, from the powerful emotions within a particular song (for example, every song by Julien Baker) to the stories an artist tells during the performance (like Rev. Sekou's recollections of being in Charlottesville, Va. during a white nationalist rally). When I asked my colleague Lars Gotrich which Tiny Desk made him cry, he gave a somewhat surprising answer: soprano Barbara Hannigan. \"Seeing that level of mastery and emotion wrapped up in one performance,\" Lars told me, \"I was overcome.\"\n\nSo if you're in need of an emotional outlet today, check out this playlist of Tiny Desk concerts hand-selected to bring on the tears. (And if your coworkers ask what's up, feel free to send them the playlist \u2013 or, you know, just tell them it's allergies. It's always allergy season somewhere.)\n\nTiny Desks In This Playlist\n\n\u2022 Julien Baker (read more)\n\n\u2022 Yusuf/Cat Stevens (read more)\n\n\u2022 Bernie and The Believers (read more)\n\n\u2022 Rev.
