In the early 1990s, over 90 per cent of the population identified as Catholic and 85 per cent said they went to mass at least once a week. In the last census in 2018, the rate of weekly mass goers had dropped to 35 per cent.\n\nThe Catholic Church was once one of the most powerful institutions in Ireland but its authority was rocked by a series of child abuse scandals. Changing demographics has also put pressure on the church as young people are much less likely to practise their faith.\n\nSenior clerics in Ireland have struggled to make any impact in recent referendums on liberalising the country\u2019s socially conservative laws. In May 2015, Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce same sex marriage through a popular vote and in May 2018 the ban on abortion was repealed by over two-thirds of voters.\n\nThe ACP\u2019s views do not chime with the church hierarchy in Ireland. In 2018, Josepha Madigan, a government minister, and a practising Catholic, helped say mass in her local church with the help of two other lay people when a priest failed to show up.\n\nMs Madigan subsequently called for the ordination of women priests, which prompted an angry response from the Archbishop of Dublin who claimed the minister had been \u201cdeeply disrespectful to her parishioners.\u201d\n\nCalls for reforms are gaining momentum not just in Ireland but in other traditional Catholic countries. Last weekend, Catholic bishops from across the Amazon called for the introduction of married priests.", "description": "Ending forced celibacy and ordaining female priests are among the reforms needed to address the shortage of Catholic priests in Ireland, an influential lobby group has said.
