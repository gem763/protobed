It's not clear when Durham's inquiry shifted to a criminal investigation.\n\nDurham is examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance methods and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate.\n\nMueller's investigation shadowed Trump's presidency for nearly two years and outraged the president, who cast it as a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" Mueller determined that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn't find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that Durham's inquiry had become a criminal investigation.\n\nThe chairmen of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, which are leading the impeachment inquiry, said in a statement late Thursday that the reports \"raise profound new concerns\" that Barr's DOJ \"has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge.\n\n\"If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage,\" Democratic Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff said.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Trump recently made several calls at Barr's request to foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general with the Durham investigation.\n\nBarr also traveled with Durham to Italy in August and September, and the two met with Italian intelligence officials to seek information about the activities of FBI agents assigned there, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.", "description": "The Justice Department has shifted its review of the Russia probe to a criminal investigation, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday, a move that is likely to raise concerns that President Donald Trump and his allies may be using the powers of the government to go after their opponents.
