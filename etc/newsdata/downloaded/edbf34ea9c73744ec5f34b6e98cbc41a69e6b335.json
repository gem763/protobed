(Nicholas Granum/Courtesy of Megan Figeuroa)\n\nWhat would you do if somebody said you'd won a free vacation? Now, what if the vacation was in Detroit, where you'd spend hours sitting with minimal pee breaks as politicians polling lower than the Mariana Trench bicker with each other? Disneyland it ain't. Nevertheless, chilling with the likes of Andrew Yang and Joe Biden is a real vacation option in 2019, thanks to the wide array of Democratic presidential candidates offering prizes including (though not limited to!) tickets to watch debates in Miami, Detroit and Houston.\n\nAlyssa Cowan, a 31-year-old nonprofit production manager from Sacramento who scored tickets from Yang\u2019s campaign for the July debate in Detroit, describes the civic-minded appeal of such contests: \u201cI guess part of me is like, if more people are going to get engaged in any part of the process it\u2019s going to be a positive, even if it\u2019s kind of weird that it\u2019s from campaign giveaways and stuff.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 16 campaigns that have offered such prizes this year can thank Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 White House bids for elevating the role of sweepstakes in presidential politics. He gave away many freebies including \u201cDinners With Barack\u201d \u2014 which, granted, were gimmicky but also \u201calways incredibly successful at building lists of supporters and engaging supporters online,\u201d according to Tara McGowan, who worked on the 2012 campaign and is now chief executive of Acronym, a political-strategy nonprofit in D.C.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton raffled off dinner and cocktails with her and the Clooneys, among other prizes; now, with a crowded field \u2014 and with candidates vying to garner a certain number of donors so they can qualify for each round of debates \u2014 it\u2019s almost impossible to toss a buck at a campaign without running the risk of enrolling in a yoga class with Tim Ryan, committing to a whiskey tasting with Kirsten Gillibrand (who has since dropped out), or bagging a Nintendo Switch from Bernie Sanders. (Actually, that last one doesn\u2019t sound bad.)\n\nSo what\u2019s it like to donate \u2014 or be a cheapskate and not donate, as only your email address is typically required to enter (got to read the fine print) \u2014 and learn you\u2019re being magically whisked away to debateland? It starts with a congratulatory phone call that the winners I spoke to almost universally regarded as a scam. David Torvik, a 40-year-old firefighter from Olympia, Wash., who attended the June debate in Miami on Yang\u2019s dime, says that when he told his wife he won, \u201cshe was in disbelief, and my mom was like, \u2018Don\u2019t give them any of your banking info!\u2019 \u201d\n\nReality often sets in when the candidates get on the horn. Kellie Nelson, a 48-year-old purchasing manager from Charlotte, says she donated to the Biden campaign thinking she was \u201cgoing to get a sticker for my car or whatever.\u201d Then, the next day, she answered her phone, and \u201cI was like, \u2018Holy Christ! It\u2019s Joe Biden.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWinning doesn\u2019t always earn approval from others. \u201cYou know that look when parents are disappointed in you? My co-workers said that\u2019s how they looked at me,\u201d notes Cowan. \u201cI definitely got a lot more strange reactions when they found out I won it from Yang, because I think it\u2019s me and one other person at work who are supporters of him.\u201d\n\nThe winners typically fly for free in coach to the debate city and grab a taxi or Lyft to their paid-for hotel, which Cowan rated four out of five stars. \u201cUsually I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to get fancy and go stay at a Quality Inn versus a Motel 6,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cSo the fact that we were at this [Crowne Plaza] \u2014 I was just like, \u2018This is great!\u2019 \u201d\n\nBefore the debates, Nelson and her wife cruised around Detroit in a white passenger van with Jill Biden and her grandchildren. They spent some of the time talking with the youngsters about their shared affinity for Australian shepherds. \u201cBeing an aide to a senator or being a U.S. senator was probably a childhood dream many moons ago,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see these people who have such an effect on your life.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Torvik, left, and wife Taylor meet Andrew Yang at the Democratic debates in June in Miami. (Photo courtesy of David Torvik)\n\nOutside the debate venue in Miami, Megan Figueroa, a 32-year-old university project manager in Tucson and winner of Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s contest, got yelled at by pro-Trump protesters, though with different messages. \u201cOne kept calling us fascists and seemed to be more interested in the economy,\u201d she reports. \u201cThe other protesters seemed to be very homophobic.\u201d\n\nCowan and her sister attended a Yang-sponsored happy hour at a bar near the Fox Theatre in Detroit, where they eyeballed a lone John Delaney supporter in the corner. \u201cYou know if you were driving by a Quiznos and they\u2019re trying to get you to come in \u2014 one of those sandwich signs and people are spinning it? He had one of those and it said John Delaney.\u201d (The dude was not spinning the sign.)\n\n\u201cI think I had like two Millers and, man, I was going to need something because they do not tell you that the debate is not just a debate,\u201d Cowan says. \u201cThey shuffle you in there so early, and then they have opening acts.\u201d The audience also had to practice applauding at the right moment. \u201cThey had a guy come out to teach us to clap after the commercial breaks, so it seems like we\u2019re clapping the whole time.\u201d\n\nFor normies, the star power concentrated at a presidential debate can be intense. \u201cI\u2019m not used to seeing people I see on TV all the time right in front of you,\u201d says Torvik. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018There goes Cornel West! And there goes Tom Brokaw and Al Sharpton!\u2019 Just people who are not celebrities, but are not not celebrities.\u201d\n\nMany of the winners describe meeting their candidate as a major highlight of the trip. \u201cThere\u2019s an air of calm in the room the way he listens with such compassion,\u201d says Julia Johns, a 31-year-old ESL teacher in Denver who flew to Detroit courtesy of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (but only after consulting the carbon cost of the flight). \u201cHe\u2019s just an incredible presence to be around.\u201d About meeting Castro in the flesh, Figueroa says: \u201cIt felt like hugging my primo, my cousin, someone I know who has my back.\u201d\n\nAfter the debate in Miami, the Yang Gang gathered for an after-party on a rooftop with an open bar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t off the hook, so to speak,\u201d Torvik says. \u201cAndrew himself I guess had a cold, and people were pretty tired.\u201d He spent the rest of the night hanging with a Yang staffer at a place with live music and people dancing on the bar.\n\nIn Detroit, Cowan didn\u2019t push hard to shake hands with her candidate afterward. \u201cI appreciate him and I appreciate his message,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in my older years, I\u2019m less the kind of person who feels they need to meet people and get a picture with them.\u201d Instead, she went back to her room and ordered food. \u201cI\u2019m on the West Coast,\u201d she notes. \u201cI never get White Castle.\u201d\n\nHow, in the end, does this experience rate next to a traditional vacation? \u201cIt seems like to get access you got to be a millionaire sometimes,\u201d says Torvik. \u201cWe\u2019re just normal folks and we got to do this cool thing, so I think that\u2019s good.\u201d Figueroa put it this way: \u201cLife is absolutely absurd, so you might as well enter a few gimmicky contests. Who knows when entering one will land you on MSNBC hugging a presidential candidate?\u201d\n\nJohn Metcalfe is a reporter in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nMore from the Magazine:\n\nAre goats the new weed whackers? Plenty of people want them to be.\n\nArmy recruiters released their first rap video. It wasn\u2019t exactly a mic drop.\n\nWhat should you look for in the Democratic debates?
