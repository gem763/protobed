There were quid pro quo allegations including Trump tying foreign aid to this investigation. Alas, it wasn\u2019t any of that. The Ukrainians brought up Biden, Trump asked if they could help the Department of Justice\u2019s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation, and there was nothing to the foreign aid angle. Yet, House Democrats still went along with their impeachment push because of this still ties into Trump-Russia collusion, a manufactured liberal media lie, and the Left\u2019s desire to impeach Trump.\n\nLiterally within seconds of this, Trump repeated his false claim about what Al Green said about impeachment. \u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) September 25, 2019\n\nTrump seems to believe that the fake quote he put in @RepAlGreen's mouth is real pic.twitter.com/KlU9Wo2XYy \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2019\n\nDemocrats were elected to do this in 2018. This juncture was inevitable. The anti-Trump derangement syndrome is too powerful and its infected masses too great. Rep. Al Green (D-TX) gave away the playbook this summer when he said Democrats had to impeach this president because if they don\u2019t, Trump will get re-elected. Yeah, that\u2019s a no so subtle way of saying their 2020 field cannot beat Trump. The president referenced those remarks today, but writers for The Washington Post and Vox thought this was fake news. Sorry guys, there\u2019s video. Green said this on MSNBC in July.\n\nFACT CHECK TIME!
