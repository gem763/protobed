Without a steel fence to keep the gatecrashers away, Glasto was officially free and The Levellers played to what is reported to have been the festival\u2019s largest ever crowd to date, estimated at 300,000. Imagine how many dogs were tied up at the gate. Alamy 2/20 19. Kanye West \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015 As far as classic Glastonbury talking points go, nothing since Michael Jackson died has come close to Kanye\u2019s 2015 slot. For all his claims to be \u201cthe biggest rock star on the planet\u201d, nerves got the better of what was arguably Kanye\u2019s highest-profile show ever. His attempt to echo Jay-Z\u2019s rock-embracing \u201cWonderwall\u201d from 2008 fell flat when he forgot the words to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d, and he had to restart \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d\u2019 after comedian Lee Nelson invaded the stage pretending to be a surprise guest rapper. Nonetheless (look away now, Noel), some class this as another key victory in hip-hop\u2019s Glastonbury takeover. Getty 3/20 18. Primal Scream \u2013 NME Stage, 1992 The volume, according to some onlookers, was like listening to a car stereo playing \u201dMovin\u2019 On Up\u201d underwater three miles away. Yet Primal Scream bringing Screamadelica to the NME Stage in 1992 was more of a collective celebration of music\u2019s most double-visioned zeitgeist. Generation \u201cLoaded\u201d came together as one, and rock and dance cultures mated furiously in the bushes at this peak of the Ecstasy rave explosion. Youtube 4/20 17. T Rex \u2013 Main Stage, 1970 \u201cDon\u2019t touch my car!\u201d Marc Bolan barked at Michael Eavis when the burgeoning festival don \u2013 en route to Minehead Butlin\u2019s to replace The Kinks at what was then essentially a farmer\u2019s party taking place on a stage held together with string \u2013 tried brushing leaves off his Cadillac. Yet Bolan\u2019s T Rex stormed the inaugural Glastonbury (or the Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues Festival as it was known \u2013 \u00a31 per ticket and all the milk you could drink). \u201cBolan played on and on and on as the sun was going down,\u201d Eavis recalled, \u201call the hits, the full works, and it sounded fantastic.\u201d Rex Features 5/20 16. Portishead \u2013 Acoustic Tent, 1995 As many a troubadour will attest, it\u2019s rare to find a crush of 15,000 people stuck outside the Acoustic Tent. But the arrival of local (ish) heroes Portishead bearing the sumptuous jazz lounge trip-hop of their hugely acclaimed debut album Dummy prompted just such polite chaos. The lucky few inside reported a bewitching set of very modern heartache \u2013 \u201cGlory Box\u201d and \u201cSour Times\u201d capping a show of immense grace and emotion. As many tears inside as out. Rex Features 6/20 15. The Killers \u2013 New Tent, 2004 The best sign of encroaching superstardom, they say, is when your John Peel Stage debut is as rammed and rambunctious as Theresa May\u2019s leaving drinks. Arguably the first and finest example was the tsunami of fans descending on the New Tent early on the Saturday evening in 2004, to toast the arrival of Las Vegas indie pop showmen The Killers. The crowds stretched far outside the tent but even the ones on the outskirts bawled along to \u201cMr Brightside\u201d and \u201cAll These Things That I\u2019ve Done\u201d. It was such a \u201cmoment\u201d that the band returned to the stage (now the John Peel Stage) for a secret encore in 2017. Rex Features 7/20 14. Orbital \u2013 NME Stage, 1994 Dance music had long-since conquered clubland, but its clout as a force to unify a vast festival crowd was unrecognised until Orbital took Glasto \u201994 by synthetic storm. Drawing 40,000 ravers to the NME Stage for their headline set with little more than compulsive beats and headlights on their faces, the Hartnoll Brothers dazzled not just the millions watching Glastonbury\u2019s first televised broadcasts on Channel 4, but Eavis himself. So much so, in fact, that he was inspired to open a dedicated Dance Tent the following year. It\u2019s since grown into its own festival-within-a-festival in the Silver Hayes dance village. Rex Features 8/20 13. New Order \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1981 By 1981, Glastonbury had grown from its Pilton Pop, Folk & Blues roots, but not far. It was a CND charity gathering of around 3,000 bikers burning up the site as they waited for Hawkwind to come on. \u201cIt was our version of Altamont but without any trouble,\u201d said New Order\u2019s Peter Hook of their \u201cspirited\u201d support slot, but it was also the moment the band emerged from beneath the lingering clouds of Joy Division and proved themselves the silvery scouts of the new electronic age. Rex Features 9/20 12. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2011 If Jay could do it, so could Bey. Following her husband\u2019s celebrated 2008 headline slot (and pregnant with their first child at the time), Beyonc\u00e9 delivered Glastonbury\u2019s ultimate pop experience to date. \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\u201d, \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d, glitzy covers of both \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d and \u201cSex On Fire\u2019, billowing ballads sung while kneeling on white grand pianos\u2026 even the bells had whistles on them. All of this was wrapped up with the most bootylicious of Destiny\u2019s Child medleys. Rex Features 10/20 11. Dolly Parton - Pyramid Stage, 2014 The Sunday afternoon legend slot was custom-built for Dolly. From \u201cJolene\u201d to \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d, the queen of country charmed the sodden 2014 crowd like no other artist in this affectionate slot before or since, with her between-song yarns about mountain life, a song called \u201cMud Song\u201d specially written for the occasion and her way of calling the event \u201cGlastonberry\u201d. Kylie\u2019s got her work cut out. Rex Features 11/20 10. Happy Mondays \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1990 By its very nature as a gigantic concave mirror on alternative culture, Glastonbury reflects and exaggerates music\u2019s pivotal moments. Case in point: Happy Mondays roll onto the Pyramid Stage in 1990 \u2013 just as Ecstasy is reshaping youth culture into very bendy shapes indeed \u2013 and twist the melon of an entire generation with \u201cStep On\u201d, \u201cWrote For Luck\u201d and \u201cHallelujah\u201d. Where the Second Summer of Love (1988-1989) was an in-the-know affair, this set made it universally hip to be hairy, lairy, baggy and boggle-eyed. Getty Images 12/20 9. Jay-Z \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2008 Noel Gallagher wasn\u2019t having it, but Glastonbury 2008 certainly was. Gently mocking Noel\u2019s disgust as rap infiltrated rock\u2019s most revered stage, Jay-Z entered with a ramshackle solo rendition of \u201cWonderwall\u201d, then all but smashed his acoustic guitar as he burst into \u201c99 Problems\u201d. There followed a veritable firestorm of hip-hop classics \u2013 \u201cIzzo (H.O.V.A.)\u201d, \u201cGirls, Girls, Girls\u201d, \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d, \u201cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\u201d \u2013 almost as though Jigga was beating the spirit of Glastonbury into submission before forcing it to wear a Brooklyn Nets shirt. The festival\u2019s mind was opened forever, that night. Rex 13/20 8. Patti Smith \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2015 Most so-called \u201cheritage\u201d acts go through the motions at Glastonbury \u2013 a stout chunk of their folky new record and, begrudgingly, a smatter of their old hits. Not Patti Smith. She attacked the Pyramid Stage in 2015 like a white-haired tornado. Ripping strings from her guitar by the fistful and hailing \u201cFreedom!\u201d at the top of her voice, she tore through \u201cLand\u201d, \u201cGloria\u201d and The Who\u2019s \u201cMy Generation\u201d like the age-defying punk pioneer she is. She even found time to present the actual Dalai Lama with a birthday cake onstage and fall on her face, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a f****** animal!\u201d Amen. Getty Images 14/20 7. Oasis \u2013 NME Stage, 1994 Scenes become seismic events when they prove they can dominate an entire Glastonbury festival. Take Sunday 26 June, 1994, when a young, cocksure Liam Gallagher strode onto the NME Stage in a black jumper and shades and demanded of a distinctly mad-ferrit crowd: \u201cAre you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?\u201d Songs rarely came so \u201cproper\u201d as \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol\u201d, \u201cLive Forever\u201d and \u201cFade Away\u201d, which joined \u201cShakermaker\u201d and \u201cSupersonic\u201d in the wider public domain that day \u2013 bombardments from Britpop\u2019s northern armies. The Nineties suddenly had some real fight in them. Rex 15/20 6. Blur \u2013 NME Stage, 1994 By the time Pulp and Radiohead had played that same stage, that same day, in a line-up that Johnny Greenwood would describe as \u201dlike the Champions League\u201d, Britpop had officially arrived. To herald this cultural breakout, Blur rolled up in their Parklife charabanc at sundown for a coming-of-age party that saw \u201cGirls & Boys\u201d, \u201cEnd of a Century\u201d and the era-defining title track taken on as generational anthems, at a show as celebratory and momentous as any headline set. It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade. Getty 16/20 5. Radiohead \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1997 Radiohead\u2019s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle \u2013 against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. \u201cEverything broke onstage,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt turned into the worst night of our lives. I don\u2019t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.\u201d But it\u2019s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. \u201cLucky\u201d rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead\u2019s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia \u2013 \u201cNo Surprises\u201d, \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cAirbag\u201d \u2013 made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling. RMV/REX/Shutterstock 17/20 4. The Smiths \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1984 \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 \u2013 shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn\u2019t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as \u201cHand in Glove\u201d, \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d and \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d. The performance inspired Glastonbury\u2019s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely \u201chippy festival\u201d again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous. Rex Features 18/20 3. Paul McCartney \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2004 Sometimes all it takes to slip seamlessly into Glastonbury legend is the greatest songbook known to mankind. Sir Paul\u2019s first ever UK festival show \u2013 no, really \u2013 was the singalong to end them all: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d into \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cBand On the Run\u201d, \u201cBack In the USSR\u201d, \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d and a \u201cHey Jude\u201d you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. McCartney has been semi-confirmed for 2020 \u2013 start refreshing the ticket page now. Brent N. Clarke/Invision/AP 19/20 2. David Bowie \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2000 Bowie\u2019s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We\u2019d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum\u2019n\u2019bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t exactly expecting \u201cChanges\u201d. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang \u201cChanges\u201d. And \u201cLife On Mars?\u201d And \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d and \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d and \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cStarman\u201d and \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could\u2019ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered. 20/20 1. Pulp \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1995 When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement \u2013 they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world\u2019s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of \u201cBabies\u201d, \u201cDisco 2000\u201d and \u201dCommon People\u201d crystallised Britpop\u2019s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes. They even unveiled a new song seemingly penned for the occasion \u2013 \u201cSorted For E\u2019s & Wizz\u201d \u2013 and encapsulated the bewildering, otherworldly spirit of Glastonbury in 20 words: \u201dIs this the way they say the future\u2019s meant to feel?/ Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d And to think, they asked Rod Stewart to fill in first. 1/20 20. The Levellers \u2013 Pyramid Stage 1994 Sometimes quantity really does matter as much as quality. Without a steel fence to keep the gatecrashers away, Glasto was officially free and The Levellers played to what is reported to have been the festival\u2019s largest ever crowd to date, estimated at 300,000.

It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade. Getty 16/20 5. Radiohead \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1997 Radiohead\u2019s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle \u2013 against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. \u201cEverything broke onstage,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt turned into the worst night of our lives. I don\u2019t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.\u201d But it\u2019s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. \u201cLucky\u201d rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead\u2019s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia \u2013 \u201cNo Surprises\u201d, \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cAirbag\u201d \u2013 made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling.

The Smiths \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1984 \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 \u2013 shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn\u2019t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as \u201cHand in Glove\u201d, \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d and \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d. The performance inspired Glastonbury\u2019s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely \u201chippy festival\u201d again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous.

Sir Paul\u2019s first ever UK festival show \u2013 no, really \u2013 was the singalong to end them all: \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d into \u201cDrive My Car\u201d, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d, \u201cGet Back\u201d, \u201cBand On the Run\u201d, \u201cBack In the USSR\u201d, \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling\u201d, \u201cLady Madonna\u201d and a \u201cHey Jude\u201d you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. McCartney has been semi-confirmed for 2020 \u2013 start refreshing the ticket page now. Brent N. Clarke/Invision/AP 19/20 2. David Bowie \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 2000 Bowie\u2019s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We\u2019d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum\u2019n\u2019bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t exactly expecting \u201cChanges\u201d. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang \u201cChanges\u201d. And \u201cLife On Mars?\u201d And \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d and \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d and \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cStarman\u201d and \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could\u2019ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered. 20/20 1. Pulp \u2013 Pyramid Stage, 1995 When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement \u2013 they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world\u2019s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of \u201cBabies\u201d, \u201cDisco 2000\u201d and \u201dCommon People\u201d crystallised Britpop\u2019s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes. They even unveiled a new song seemingly penned for the occasion \u2013 \u201cSorted For E\u2019s & Wizz\u201d \u2013 and encapsulated the bewildering, otherworldly spirit of Glastonbury in 20 words: \u201dIs this the way they say the future\u2019s meant to feel?/ Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d And to think, they asked Rod Stewart to fill in first.\n\nHere are some of the rumoured acts...\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nWhen Glastonbury creator Michael Eavis was asked whether Paul McCartney might make a trip to Worthy Farm, he said: \u201cHopefully for the 50th. Don\u2019t make a big thing of it though, will you?\u201d Fat chance of that. The Beatles legend is one of the bookies\u2019 favourites to headline the Pyramid Stage, and even said himself he is \u201cstarting to think about it\u201d.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nThe singer, fresh off the back of her seventh album Lover, is performing a string of tour dates with a suspicious gap on the weekend of Glastonbury, leading fans to speculate on whether she could be a headliner. Swift has so far remained silent on the matter.\n\nFleetwood Mac\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll burn in hell if we don\u2019t do it one day,\u201d Mick Fleetwood told The Independent when asked about whether his band, who have never played the festival before, would headline Glastonbury in 2020. However Michael Eavis has said they\u2019re too expensive: \u201cI can\u2019t afford them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to bring their price down.\u201d\n\nSpice Girls\n\nScary, Sporty, Baby, Ginger and Posh could be destined for the Legends\u2019 slot at next year\u2019s Glastonbury, having recently reunited for a sold-out arena tour \u2013 with the exception of Victoria Beckham. But Mel B thinks her elusive former bandmember could be tempted back for a show at Worthy Farm. \u201cMy plan is for all five of us to do Glastonbury next year for the 50th anniversary,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the process of persuading Victoria to do it. And I will make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe 1975\n\nAsked in 2018 whether The 1975 are ready to headline Glastonbury, frontman Matty Healy said: \u201cYeah, I think we are. I know that we are. Glastonbury, give us a year.\u201d To which Emily Eavis responded with: \u201cThat\u2019s good. Interesting. They\u2019re great. Obviously we\u2019d love to have The 1975.\u201d After their headline slot at Reading & Leeds in 2019, could 2020 be their year?\n\nElton John\n\nElton John announced that he will be retiring from the road after a three-year Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, but Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary could be the perfect last hurrah. When asked in 2015 if he\u2019d ever play the festival, John said: \u201cI\u2019ve never been asked\u2026 so I can\u2019t answer that question until they ask me.\u201d\n\nFoals\n\nFoals have now played Glastonbury a total of five times, with their last being a secret set at the 2019 gathering. They\u2019ve certainly earned their stripes at Worthy Farm, so it\u2019s possible they could finally get a headline slot in 2020.\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nJay-Z became the first rapper to headline Glastonbury in 2008 and, despite the initial backlash with Liam Gallagher declaring hip-hop as \u201cwrong\u201d at the event, since then Kanye West and Stormzy have followed in the artist\u2019s footsteps. Could Kendrick Lamar be next?\n\nArctic Monkeys\n\nThe Sheffield band have already played two Glastonbury headline slots \u2013 one in 2007 and one in 2013 \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean Alex Turner and co should be ruled out for another performance on the 50th anniversary.\n\nColdplay\n\nChris Martin and his guitar made a short and sweet appearance alongside Kylie Minogue on the Pyramid stage in 2019. Could this have been a teaser for the artist to return with the rest of his band in 2020?\n\nThe Kinks\n\nAlthough they haven\u2019t played together for decades, Ray and Dave Davies announced in 2018 that they are recording a new Kinks record together. Given that they were the first band to ever headline Glastonbury in 1970, the 50th anniversary feels like the perfect time to come back.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nGiven her status as one of the biggest pop acts in the world right now, and her attachment to the UK, Ariana Grande headlining Glastonbury could be a real possibility in 2020.\n\nBlur\n\nDamon Albarn and his band headlined Glastonbury in 1998 and 2009. The fact they reunited to play together for the first time in four years in March 2018 has sparked rumours they could be heading back to the festival \u2013 after all, third time\u2019s a charm.\n\nOasis\n\nDespite their many years of public feuding, all fans want is for Noel and Liam Gallagher to reunite and perform as Oasis. And what better time to do so than a headline set at Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary?", "description": "Glastonbury Festival will mark its 50th anniversary in 2020, with next year\u2019s event expected to be one of the biggest and most ambitious yet.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/13/07/glastonbury-2019-jason-bryant-hh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
