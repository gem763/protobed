All when Trump will be on the ballot in a matter of months, anyway.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats become single-issue candidates, which weakens them,\" Ceraso said, adding that the proceedings will only solidify Trump's base.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

The investigation into Trump\u2019s ties with Russia \u2014 the focus of previous impeachment discussions \u2014 barely registered in the campaign after the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nThe uneasiness about impeachment seems to reflect a minority view within the party\u2019s political and professional classes. Broadly, Democrats see the Ukraine scandal as more straightforward \u2014 and more persuasive \u2014 than the Byzantine Russia investigation. Many Democrats who\u2019ve balked at impeachment in the past are now on board.\n\nThe countervailing opinions within the party come at a sensitive time for Democrats. The primary has entered a critical five-month run-up to the start of voting, with candidates fine-tuning their messages to voters. An impeachment push in Washington threatens to upend months of planning and strategizing, denying oxygen to much of the field and throwing a spotlight on a part of the Democratic front-runner\u2019s past that he\u2019s been striving to keep away from the campaign.\n\nDemocrats can only guess \u2014 or dread \u2014 where it will all end up.\n\nOne strategist working for a Democratic presidential candidate said Tuesday that if the evidence of wrongdoing against Trump proves even slightly less overwhelming than assumed, the result could be a \u201cMueller redux.\u201d\n\nImpeachment proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton, another Democratic strategist said, \u201cdid wonders for [his] approval rating. \u2026 You know what Omar [Little] used to say on 'The Wire'? \u2018If you come at the king, you best not miss.'\" Even if Trump were impeached, the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to convict him.\n\nBiden said Tuesday that Congress has \u201cno choice but to initiate impeachment\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t comply with ongoing investigations. And several other Democrats have heightened their own calls for impeachment.\n\nBut for a presidential candidate, calling for impeachment is one thing. Having proceedings opened is another, and it has the potential to reshape the entire 2020 campaign.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nOne Democratic strategist familiar with multiple presidential campaigns in Iowa said the party\u2019s eventual nominee would be better served if House Democrats decline to open proceedings, even as candidates publicly urge them to. He reacted with alarm as Pelosi signaled Monday that she had become more open to the possibility of impeachment.\n\n\u201cShe needs to take one for the team and say, \u2018Nope, we\u2019re not doing it,\u2019\u201d the strategist said, before Pelosi greenlighted an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nAnother Democratic strategist with ties to the national party agreed. Holding the earlier Democratic line \u2014 with Democratic presidential candidates calling for impeachment and Pelosi declining to go there \u2014 would also help vulnerable Democratic House members with their reelection bids.\n\n\u201cI think that works well for both Congress and the candidate because then [House members] can say they stand against the nominee,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nThe uneasiness surrounding impeachment in Democratic Party circles was laid bare in Iowa this week, as news of the Ukraine scandal unfolded amid the Polk County Steak Fry, a major event on the Democratic primary calendar.\n\nBiden moved to confront Trump while at the event, saying the allegations against the president appear \u201cto be an overwhelming abuse of power.\u201d Elizabeth Warren told reporters that Trump has demonstrated \u201che thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact, can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Cory Booker called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201ca betrayal of our nation.\u201d\n\nAnd the caucusgoers in attendance?\n\n\u201cI talked to a lot of people, and it didn\u2019t come up once, not at all,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of Iowa's Polk County Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m sure it really energizes Twitter, but Twitter doesn\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the 2020 presidential election, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that Ukraine matters that much either way. \u2026 In the end, we\u2019re running out of months now. We\u2019re almost a year out from the election.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3744/1155968404_6089157105001_6089152801001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\n\u201cThe bread-and-butter issues are more important now than ever,\u201d Bagniewski added. \u201cWe all need to start deciding what we want to be spending our time on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a national spectacle that will make people defend the presidency or tune out, which is worse,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic strategist based in New York. \u201cThe incessant banging about it doesn\u2019t help. Stick with issues that work.\u201d\n\nBob Mulholland, a Democratic National Committee member from California, put it this way: \u201cAbsent Trump being caught in a trunk with a young boy, impeachment is a political disaster for us Democrats.\u201d\n\nStill, numerous Democrats believe impeachment proceedings against Trump could bloody him and hurt Republicans running in down-ticket races. Failing to pursue impeachment could potentially depress Democratic turnout. One Democratic strategist said he was waiting for better polling on Ukraine.\n\nKaren Hicks, a Democratic strategist in New Hampshire, said that politically, \u201cIt\u2019s risky either way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people should sort of do their jobs and hope that we can all walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is that everybody\u2019s turned into a pundit, where people are not representing what they think, but they\u2019re representing what they think the voters will think. So, it all becomes a complicated bank shot,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cWhat we need is for everybody to fulfill their role.\"", "description": "Some party officials in early nominating states think a D.C. spectacle will play right into Trump's reelection strategy.", "authors": ["David Siders"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/19/79/ca98622b4519aeeb9b88bd481c49/20190924-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
