They are the people who got us into the Middle East mess, but never had the vision or the courage to get us out,\" Trump said. \"They just talk.\"\n\nHe said that the announcement of a permanent cease-fire \"validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago was scorned.\"\n\nThe president's comments came hours after after Russian troops advanced toward northern Syria in order to facilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the area. The Russian troops will help patrol the border area on the Syrian side of the Turkish-Syrian border, according to Russian state media.", "description": "President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he is lifting U.S. sanctions on Turkey imposed after the country invaded northern Syria earlier this month, calling the country's temporary cease-fire in the area \"permanent.\"", "authors": ["Tucker Higgins", "In"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106198717-1571846024691gettyimages-1177744462.jpeg?v=1571846067", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
