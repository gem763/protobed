That\u2019s still slightly warm for the time of year, but we\u2019re about to change that up for the next few days. It is a pleasantly cool evening ahead for any outdoor plans, including the Nationals game. Tomorrow, we see some much-needed rain, finally.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: We stay clear through the evening before clouds thicken and lower once deep into the night and toward sunrise. Lows range across the 50s, as winds come from the southeast and south around 5 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\n[Drought denter? A brief soaking rain is likely in D.C. area Wednesday from developing storm.]\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): Rain chances are up as we get past sunrise. It looks like most or all of the morning commute should be dry, but rain is probably picking up across the area by midmorning and into lunchtime or so. The most widespread and consistent rain comes during the afternoon, when it could be heavy at times and some thunder may mix in. As much as an inch or so may fall locally. High temperatures occur early, perhaps as mild as just into the 60s. Temperatures should fall back to the 50s in the rain. Winds are out of the south around 5 to 10 mph early but turning to the northwest with time, and turning gusty in the evening.\n\nSee David Streit\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

Only 0.27 inches was recorded over the 45 days ending Oct. 12. The only periods with less rain ended in January 1956 with 0.23 inches, October 1930 with 0.25 inches and October 1884 with 0.25 inches.\n\nWeather models tend to indicate that tomorrow\u2019s storm is just the start of a pattern that will continue to deliver more rain.
