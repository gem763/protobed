Serpro's president, Caio Paes de Andrade, was brought in by economy minister Paulo Guedes to boost its value and increase attractiveness to investors.\n\nSerpro provides systems across all government bodies and is staffed by about 6000 employees.

However, over the last three years, the company has seen a turnaround of its finances, partly aided by the increase in the portfolio of non-government customers.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Andrade said Serpro has been selling processing services of public data to startups like Uber and local digital banks, who feed the data into their analytics engines to inform decisions in areas such as fraud.\n\nSerpro already has 1,300 private sector customers and wants to boost that number to 4,000, Andrade told Reuters. It is also planning to offer cloud computing services in partnership with firms like Google, as well as services to support compliance with Brazil's version of the General Data Protection Regulations, which will be enforced in 2020.\n\nThe government expects to raise 1.3 trillion reais ($318 billion) with the privatization of companies that include Serpro and another tech firm, the Social Security Technology and Information Company (Dataprev).\n\nThe privatization program has no specific timetable and will now see a number of feasibility studies carried out into the assets.", "description": "The company set to be privatized is looking to increase revenue and attractiveness to investors by selling public data processing to technology startups like Uber.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/28/e4b06a81-b03c-4e4b-91d0-d308fb0939cf/thumbnail/770x578/582a61175aed89b780a11970a0b0b57f/technology-science-and-cloud-computer-3d-illustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
