collision and turned his head away from Yato in a bid to avoid a head clash.\n\nWayne Smith, writing in The Australian, said Hodge was unfortunate to be the first player to face a disciplinary hearing at the tournament.\n\n\u201cWith World Rugby having issued a statement in July warning that any foul play involving contact with the head or neck would result in at least a mid-range sanction, there was always the fear he would be made an example of,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt is rare that Clive Woodward, who led England to their World Cup final victory over the Wallabies in 2003, gets much good press in Australia but his criticism of the decision was widely shared.\n\n\u201cTotally wrong decision, will have huge implications for the tournament \u2013 for me this is a yellow card and no more,\u201d Woodward wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHas any of those making this decision ever tried stopping someone as powerful as Yato by wrapping their arms around him? Good luck if you try that!\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby have made much of their campaign to rid the game of high hits and the fact that the match officials did not penalise Hodge even after reference to the TV pictures will be an embarrassment for them.\n\nWithout specifically mentioning the Hodge incident but perhaps to clear the ground for it, World Rugby issued a statement on Tuesday admitting the officiating over the opening weekend had not been up to scratch.\n\nThere might be more embarrasment on the way for World Rugby after Samoans Rey Lee-lo and Motu Matu\u2019u were cited for dangerous high tackles on Wednesday after only being shown yellow cards in their match against Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a benchmark that I think they\u2019ll look back and regret when the biggest talking point out of this World Cup is refereeing decisions and sanctions,\u201d former Wallabies winger Drew Mitchell said of World Rugby on Fox Sports TV.\n\nHodge can appeal the decision within 48 hours. Rugby Australia have yet to comment on the punishment.\n\nReuters", "description": "Australia\u2019s media has reacted with fury to the decision to ban Wallabies winger Reece Hodge for three World Cup\u00a0matches for a dangerous tackle with Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph describing it as \u201cfarcical\u201d.
