For Sarah Kucharski, it was a golden era.\n\nKucharski obsessively identifies and critiques Swift\u2019s style in real-time, and Swift\u2019s big move to New York in the summer of 2014 was the challenge she\u2019d been waiting for.\n\n\u201cIt was wild,\u201d Kucharski says. \u201cEvery single day, maybe even twice a day, there would be new outfits and it was so much fun. It was so much fun.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Kucharski started Taylor Swift Style, also known as \u201cTSS\u201d\u2014\u201cthe original Taylor Swift blog,\u201d the account claims on Instagram. Today, she still spends around 20 hours a week working on the blog and she counts Swift herself and Swift\u2019s stylist among her followers.\n\nKucharski says when she started the blog in 2011, there wasn\u2019t anything like it.\n\n\u201cAt the time, celebrity fashion accounts weren\u2019t really as much a thing as I think they are now, where there\u2019s kind of a closet account for every celebrity,\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\n\nOn the blog and Instagram, Kucharski identifies almost everything Swift wears anytime she\u2019s photographed: red carpet, candid shot, Instagram post, TV appearance\u2014everywhere. Kucharski identifies the skirts, the tops, the dress, the rings on her finger. She\u2019s even dabbled in identifying furniture that pops up in the background of Swift\u2019s Instagram. On a good day, she can even identify Swift\u2019s clothes within an hour after a new photo pops up.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a lot of trial and error,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s gotten to a point where you are kind of able to spot brands just by sight alone just because you\u2019re in it all the time and you can just recognize her favorite brands and her go-tos.\u201d\n\nEventually Kucharski found her groove, mixing in some fashion criticism to her original process. When Swift wore a romper from the Mary Katrantzou Resort 2015 collection at the 2014 VMAs, Kucharski wrote, \u201cThe nicest thing I can probably say about this is\u2026 her legs look great?\u201d She named the moment \u201cThe Incident\u201d\u2014an outfit her blog still references.\n\nKucharski might have been the first of her kind, though Selena\u2019s Closet, a style site and Instagram account for Selena Gomez, began shortly after in 2012. In recent years, this type of Instagram has blown up.\n\nJenna, who prefers not to disclose her last name, got into the game by helping run a dedicated style account for actress Genevieve Padalecki. Wanting to branch off on her own, she started \u201cMargot Fashion Files\u201d in 2015, right before Margot Robbie starred in Suicide Squad.\n\n\u201cIn real life, I\u2019m not a fashion person,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cI just buy whatever and wear whatever, but I do enjoy looking at the current fashion trends.\u201d\n\nJenna has invested a few hundred dollars into the style website. She uses an affiliate program but has only made 25 pounds, about 30 bucks, from it to date.\n\nJenna says it\u2019s all just for the thrill of finding the matching piece.\n\n\u201c[Robbie] wears a lot of boutique kinds of pieces, so you might not know what she\u2019s wearing,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cI spent two years looking for a pair of boots that she wore\u2014that\u2019s how dedicated I am when I focus on something.\u201d\n\nStill, there might be money to be made. Kucharski says she makes money from her blog, but declined to give specifics.\n\nFor Airien Leight, who runs @petedavidsonsstyle on Instagram, it\u2019s not about affiliate links. The 14-year-old says she started the account in May because of lack of \u201cgood Pete Davidson style accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made one because I know how big of a role fashion plays in Pete\u2019s personality and then Pete actually followed me when I had like 12 followers, which was insane, but then obviously a few days later, he deleted his account,\u201d Leight says. (Davidson deleted his account after posting he didn\u2019t want to be on Earth anymore.)\n\nLately, Instagram has been purging some of these style accounts. Kucharski didn\u2019t say why she believes her original Instagram account @tayswiftstyledotcom was disabled in May, but several style accounts have started to create backup accounts in case theirs get purged.\n\nThe account @baldwinsclosett is a backup style account for model Hailey Bieber. Its bio reads that the original account was disabled with 100,000 followers.\n\nStill, Kucharski says she never thought about quitting the blog because it\u2019s a labor of love. And even with the target of her obsession as a follower, Kucharski continues to post her opinions on Swift\u2019s fashion choices\u2014the good, the bad and ugly.\n\nKucharski says she is committed to being \u201ccritically kind\u201d even when she thinks an outfit misses the mark. \u201cJust because you\u2019re a fan doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t express your genuine opinion in a constructive, kind, polite way.\u201d\n\nAfter all, Swift might be watching.", "description": "A set of super-fans race to identify their fave celebrity\u2019s fashions, cataloguing every single piece on Instagram.", "authors": ["Paige Skinner"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569793332/190927-Skinner-taylor-style-tease_okegmt", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
