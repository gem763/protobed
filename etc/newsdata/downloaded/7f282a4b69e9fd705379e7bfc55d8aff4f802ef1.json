Because if you lose concentration, if you lose the plot, for just a minute or two against New Zealand, the game can be over.\n\nThe margin for error against New Zealand is smaller than against any other team.\n\nEngland need to maintain their focus if they are to beat New Zealand in World Cup semi-final\n\nEddie Jones and his side complete their captain's run in wet conditions in Tokyo\n\nEddie Jones, the England head coach, has been in very good form at his press conferences, and although he has had plenty to say, I wouldn't classify any of it as controversial or inflammatory. It's all been good-natured, pithy and mildly entertaining.\n\nIt also serves a purpose. While Eddie takes centre stage on the top table most days, it takes most of the players out of the firing line so they can get on with their job of preparing.\n\nI enjoyed the moment when he asked the gathered media to put their hands up if they thought England would win. By his own calculation, he saw three hands out of a hundred go up timidly.\n\nWhen asked if they backed England, only three journalists of around 100 raised their hands\n\nWell, make that four, Eddie, except my hand goes straight up with conviction. England to win, by five points!\n\nWhat will Eddie have been quietly telling his players over the last day or two? And again in the final hours before the game?\n\nFirst, he would be reminding England that they are the better team, the better players, and there is no need for any mental tricks and contorted logic to make that claim.\n\nNew Zealand have lost to Ireland and Australia in the past 12 months and they have just scraped home against others - including England last November, because we still believed the myth that they are unbeatable.\n\nEngland played the better rugby when they lost 16-15 at Twickenham. But New Zealand knew how to win the game.\n\nEngland have learned from that and moved on. I am confident that if they get into a 15-0 lead, this time they won't blow it.\n\nEngland produced the better rugby despite suffering defeat when the sides met in November\n\nSam Underhill executed a stunning try-saving saving tackle on Wales centre Scott Williams\n\nWhen I interviewed Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje this summer, I sensed individuals who were ready for the biggest challenge of all. That gives me confidence.\n\nThey have achieved everything else in the game, reaching and then hopefully winning a World Cup final would just be the next step.\n\nThe importance of getting the basics right for the full 80 minutes, or even longer if required, is vital.\n\nDo that and the brilliant 'miracle plays' will come naturally, because that's what happens when you get a great rugby team going full bore with the adrenalin pumping.\n\nThink back to one of Sam Underhill's first Tests, at Twickenham against Wales, when he slipped but bounced up to give chase to the speedy Scott Williams for 40 yards and pulled off that incredible try-saving tackle as the Welsh back looked certain to slide in for a try.\n\nThat stuff happens when your blood is up.\n\nNew Zealand are the favourites, and that target of trying to make it three straight World Cups must begin to weigh a little heavily.\n\nThe expectation at home for the All Blacks is always massive.\n\nIf they fail to reach the final it is seen as a failure, whereas there would be no huge fall-out if England lost. Just unbridled joy if they win.\n\nThe return of George Ford as the starting No 10 is a horses for courses selection.\n\nWhat it says to me is that Eddie wants both his natural starting 10s on the park to maximise England's kicking options to drive New Zealand deep into their territory.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily read too much, tactically, into Scott Barrett's selection at No 6 for New Zealand. They already have ample options in the lineout with Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Kieran Read and Ardie Savea.\n\nThe selection of Scott Barrett in the second row will not likely be of much tactical significance\n\nHaving George Kruis (right) on the bench provides England with plenty of line-out options\n\nBarrett has been selected because he is one of New Zealand's best all-round forwards and if England do find the lineout hard going, they have options, with George Kruis coming on and one of the starting locks reverting to the back row later in the game.\n\nFinally, knowing Eddie, he will also have taken himself away for 10 minutes to go through the rules and regulations with a fresh eye, especially after this summer's Cricket World Cup featuring both England and New Zealand.\n\nIf the scores are level after 80 minutes, there are an additional two periods of 10 minutes each. Then, if it's still level, we get a third period of up to 10 minutes, during which the first side to score would win.\n\nIf neither side scores during that final sudden-death period, the match would be decided by a goal-kicking competition.\n\nOn a piece of paper somewhere, Eddie will have scribbled down five goal-kickers and a list of those likely to be on the field at the end of that final period. Attention to detail, at all times, is what will get England through to the final.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: There has been a load of noise this week about this World Cup semi-final, but I just hope England have been able to step away from all that and go into their match bubble.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/17/20189068-0-image-a-9_1572021209892.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
