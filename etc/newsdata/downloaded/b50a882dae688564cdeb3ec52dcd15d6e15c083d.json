This brings its total investment to $10 million.\n\nThe funding came from the lead contributor Idinvest Partners, which focuses on small and medium-sized European businesses. Also involved was Bpifrance, an investment bank created by two French public entities.\n\nAs such, the government has come conspicuously close to directly funding the improvement of Bitcoin amid an apparent softening of its stance on cryptocurrency more broadly. Bpifrance\u2019s digital investment director V\u00e9ronique Jacq noted:\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency\u2019s potential is becoming more and more obvious. In this area where there is still much to explore and build, Bitcoin provides a platform for experimenting and implementing that is second to none. [...] Lightning is its most promising scalability solution and we\u2019re happy and proud to help and partner with ACINQ, a French company that is one of the world leaders of this new technology.\u201d\n\nLightning\u2019s slow grind to recognition\n\nACINQ has stated that it would use the money to improve the Lightning protocol and expand its own business operations.\n\nThe news comes as commentators continue to put faith in that Lightning allows for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, it was Samson Mow, CSO of fellow Bitcoin technology firm Blockstream, who reconfirmed his belief that Lightning would form part of Bitcoin\u2019s future mainstream presence.\n\nNonetheless, its journey to common usage cannot come as a result of a single watershed moment, he suggested, adding:", "description": "Bpifrance is one of the three major backers of Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network implementation developer ACINQ", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOTliYjBiOTJhM2QxM2I4MzAxNWE2YzA5N2E1MGQyMjYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
