This evening, Trevor Noah got in on the\n\n\u201cNow, whether you like Trump or not, you have to admit this is a big win in the fight against ISIS. But Trump is the only person who can turn a unifying occasion into a dick-measuring contest,\u201d offered Noah.\n\nThe Daily Show host then threw to Trump\u2019s Baghdadi presser, wherein the president bragged, \u201cThis is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big, but Osama bin Laden became very big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it a country\u2014a caliphate\u2014and was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d exclaimed Noah. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend this guy is a bigger get than bin Laden. First of all, it\u2019s childish. Secondly, he\u2019s not. Bin Laden changed the entire world forever. It\u2019s 18 years after 9/11 and I still can\u2019t take four ounces of lotion on an airplane. I go on vacation, and my skin is dry as fuck. That\u2019s how bad of a terrorist bin Laden was! We all ashy in these streets because of bin Laden!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d Noah added, \u201cbecause we all know who really made this thing happen. It was that K-9,\u201d referring to the hero dog who aided (and was subsequently injured in) the Baghdadi raid. \u201cOr as I call it, a dog. That dog deserves the highest honor America has to offer, which is its own movie.\u201d\n\nNoah then aired a trailer for a saccharine comedy film starring the heroic K-9, giving him the fake-Hollywood love he so richly deserves.", "description": "The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host felt he needed to set the record straight Monday night regarding the president\u2019s boasts following the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_703,w_1251,x_0,y_55/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572311060/Screen_Shot_2019-10-28_at_8.30.32_PM_qywjm5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
