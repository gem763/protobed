(AP) - One of the biggest question marks surrounding the 19th-ranked Wisconsin Badgers entering this season was their offensive line.\n\nThat question was answered emphatically in the season opener, as the Badgers dominated South Florida up front on Friday in a 49-0 win on the road.\n\n\u201cIt was good to get guys playing and going,\u201d coach Paul Chryst said of the line on Monday. \u201cEach one had some really good moments in it and each one has got some things to clean up, which means you could say the same thing for the unit, right? But I liked the group. \u2026 I thought the line did a lot really good, certainly.\u201d\n\nThe Badgers lost four starting offensive linemen from a year ago, including guard Michael Deiter and tackle David Edwards, both taken in the NFL draft. Guard Beau Benzschawel signed with the Lions as an undrafted free agent and made the 53-man roster. Deiter and Benzschawel started a combined 103 games and made up one of the best run-blocking guard combinations in the nation.\n\nDespite the highly touted departures, the line seemed to not miss a beat in the run game Friday night, paving the way for 234 yards on the ground. While preseason AP All-American Jonathan Taylor led the team with 135 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, both freshman Nakia Watson and senior Bradrick Shaw also found the end zone, with Watson gaining 80 yards in his debut.\n\n\u201cI think they could be very good,\u201d Taylor said of the new group up front. \u201cAnd one thing I talked about in preseason was that we have (center) Tyler Biadasz back, which was huge. A lot of people talk about our young offensive line, but for him being our anchor, being able to lead those younger guys, I knew we would be fine at that position.\u201d\n\nBiadasz, who, like Taylor, was a preseason AP All-American, returned for his redshirt junior season after earning first-team All-Big Ten honors a year ago. Biadasz leads a group that includes junior left tackle Cole Van Lanen, senior left guard Jason Erdmann, sophomore right guard Josh Seitzner, and sophomore right tackle Logan Bruss. Those four had a combined seven starts entering the season opener, with Bruss owning six of those.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new year, it\u2019s a new team, it\u2019s a new line,\u201d Biadasz said. \u201cSome guys are coming back, but it\u2019s like, it\u2019s all new chemistry, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working for. \u2026 I think we have a great group and I\u2019m excited. \u2026 But we can definitely get better.\u201d\n\nJunior quarterback Jack Coan completed 19 of 26 passes for 201 yards and two touchdowns - both to Taylor - and had zero interceptions Friday. But Coan was sacked three times. Some of that was due to the inexperience up front, but Coan, who made only his fifth career start in the opener, admitted Monday that one of those sacks was his fault.\n\n\u201cThey just overloaded one side with pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, I could have gotten the ball out of my hands. Just quick and easy completions instead of going through my normal progressions.\u201d\n\nDespite the sacks, the line did enough up front to help secure Wisconsin\u2019s most lopsided road shutout since defeating Northwestern 49-0 on Oct. 1, 1983. It also helped Taylor earn Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors for the fifth time in his career. Taylor totaled 183 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns, becoming the first Big Ten player with at least two rushing and two receiving scores in the same game since Illinois\u2019 Mikel Leshoure in 2010.\n\n\u201cHe earned a lot of whatever he gets,\u201d Biadasz said of Taylor. \u201cBut we\u2019re definitely helping, as well. But, I mean, he makes a lot of people miss. We can\u2019t take credit for that.\u201d\n\nWisconsin hosts Central Michigan on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One of the biggest question marks surrounding the 19th-ranked Wisconsin Badgers entering this season was their offensive line.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/30/wisconsin_south_florida_football_29811_c0-1068-2973-2801_s1770x1032.jpg?ebb73e0553bfb6a6196c842ab0f7a713f24b3c53"}
