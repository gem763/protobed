The act expanded the 1969 federal hate-crime law to include crimes based on a victim\u2019s sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.\n\nJudy and Dennis Shepard, unable to attend due to a prior commitment, prepared a statement that was read at the ceremony by Cynthia Deitle, a former FBI agent who is now programs and operations director for the Denver-based Matthew Shepard Foundation.\n\nThe Shepards praised Justice Department employees who over the years have worked to implement and enforce the act, but they blasted Barr \u2014 and by extension President Donald Trump \u2018s administration \u2014 because the department argued last week before the Supreme Court that employers should be able to fire employees because they are transgender.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

We do not honor our son by kowtowing to hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general \u201cmust lead and demonstrate his refusal to accept hate in all its manifestations,\u201d the Shepards said. \u201cHe must demonstrate courage, even if it means disagreeing with the administration. So far, he has done none of these deeds.\u201d\n\nMany of the guests at the ceremony rose for a standing ovation after Deitle finished reading the statement.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Justice Department.\n\nMatthew Shepard\u2019s murder was a galvanizing event for LGBT Americans, epitomizing the pain and discrimination that many had experienced personally.\n\nShepard was found badly beaten and barely breathing on Oct. 6, 1998, after being tied to a split-rail fence on a dirt road near Laramie, Wyoming. He had spent 18 hours there in the near-freezing cold before a cyclist discovered him, at first mistaking him for a scarecrow. He died five days later. Police said his two attackers targeted him because he was gay. Both were sentenced to life in prison.\n\nJames Byrd Jr., a black man from East Texas, was also killed in 1998. He was chained to the back of a truck and then dragged along a secluded road. Two of the white men convicted of his murder have been executed.\n\nWednesday\u2019s ceremony included opening remarks by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, who outlined some new initiatives aimed at increasing the reporting of hate crimes and improving law enforcement\u2019s response to them.\n\nThe event also featured a panel discussion about the first hate-crimes murder prosecution brought under the Shepard-Byrd act. That case involved a group of young white people in Mississippi who drove into the majority-black city of Jackson in 2011 to harass black people. A 49-year-old black man, James Craig Anderson, was run over and killed by a truck driven by one of the white youths.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Parents of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student killed in 1998, assailed Attorney General Barr Wednesday for \"hypocrisy\" on LGBT rights.", "authors": ["David Crary"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/judy-dennis-shepard.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
