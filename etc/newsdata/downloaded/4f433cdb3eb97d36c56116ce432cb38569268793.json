We consider such an accusation as the biggest insult directed to us,\" he said in Istanbul.\n\nMore:\n\n191021075409869\n\nAnkara terms the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) a \"terrorist\" offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been waging a rebellion inside Turkey since 1984.\n\nThe PKK is blacklisted as a terror group by Ankara, the United States and the European Union.\n\nAnkara's military action against Kurdish forces who played a key role in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group has drawn widespread international criticism and prompted some NATO countries to suspend new arms sales.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly voiced \"serious concerns\" over the military operation launched on October 9 to push Syrian Kurdish forces away from the Turkey-Syria border.\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan responded angrily to widespread criticism in the West of Turkey's operation in northeast Syria.\n\n\"The whole of the West, sided with the terrorists and have attacked us - including NATO and European Union countries,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought you were against terrorism and terrorists. What happened? Since when have you started to move in line with terror?\"\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish groups were a key US ally in the fight against ISIL.\n\nLast week, Turkey announced a 120-hour suspension of the offensive following a deal with US Vice President Mike Pence, under which Kurdish fighters were to withdraw to allow a \"safe zone\" to be set up along the border.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Turkey's foreign minister warned that his country will resume the military operation if Kurdish fighters did not withdraw from the region before the ceasefire deadline passed on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"We have 35 hours left. If they don't withdraw, our operation will resume,\" Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday in Istanbul. \"This is also what we agreed with the Americans.\"\n\nErdogan was to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.", "description": "Ankara's military action against Kurdish forces has drawn criticism and prompted NATO countries to suspend arms sales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/4b822219f69548d7ac6052846b3d536c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
