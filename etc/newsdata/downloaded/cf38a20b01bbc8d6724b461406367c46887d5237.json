Two were released later in the day and another was transferred to Memorial Health University Medical Center in nearby Savannah with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nAll six soldiers involved in the incident were members of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, often referred to as Dogface.\n\n\"Today is a heartbreaking day for the 3rd Infantry Division, and the entire Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield community, as we are all devastated after a training accident this morning on the Fort Stewart Training Area,\" said Maj. Gen. Tony Aguto, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division. \"We are extremely saddened by the loss of three Dogface Soldiers, and injuries to three more.
