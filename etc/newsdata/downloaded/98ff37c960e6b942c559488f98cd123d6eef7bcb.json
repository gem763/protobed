The lift in investment should be broad-based across the states.\"\n\nIn the minutes of its September board meeting, the Reserve Bank also pointed to the positive elements of business investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Overall, Australian businesses had not appeared to have been affected by the weak trade environment to the same extent as businesses in other advanced economies,\" it said.\n\n\"The ABS capital expenditure survey suggested that mining investment had grown in the June quarter, driven by an increase in machinery and equipment investment.\n\n\"The capex survey suggested there had also been an increase in machinery and equipment investment by the non-mining sector in the June quarter, while non-residential construction was expected to have declined.\"\n\nFollowing the central bank's move to cut interest rates to a record 0.75 per cent this month, RBA governor Philip Lowe had said banks \"should not be so scared\" to lend to small business.\n\n\"It is important that our financial institutions support small businesses in particular. Lenders should not be so scared of making a loan that goes bad that they don\u2019t provide the credit that the economy needs,\" he said.\n\nWhile business investment may look better in inflation-adjusted terms, Deloitte does suggest in its outlook that the retail sector is a concern.\n\n\"Retail spending growth looks recessionary in inflation-adjusted terms,\" the report said, \"but on the other hand retail price growth is now at its fastest in a decade\".", "description": "Fears of a business investment strike have been exaggerated \u2013 spending is at more than twice the level during the 1990s recession, new analysis shows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5346%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cce5e7f2d1112b6c8184ca535cf9fde5cd2e8ce2", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
