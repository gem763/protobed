(Sorry),\u201d the ad said. \u201cBut what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free reign to lie on his platform \u2014 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d\n\nAll week, Facebook has taken heat for refusing to take down a false ad run by Trump\u2019s reelection campaign about former Vice President Joe Biden, a frontrunner in the 2020 race. In the 30-second ad, the Trump campaign accuses Biden of promising Ukraine $1 billion if its government fired the prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a company in the country.\n\nTrump's efforts to find damaging information about the Bidens' actions in Ukraine that would benefit his re-election campaign are at the heart of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign sent a letter to Facebook, requesting the company take down the ad, which has been viewed 5 million times. But Facebook refused, saying the video did not violate company policies.\n\nLast month, Facebook executive Nick Clegg said in a blog post that politicians had almost total control of the content they posted online. Although Facebook employs third-party fact-checkers to reduce the spread of false news, politicians are exempt.\n\nWhile Warren acknowledged that Zuckerberg had not actually endorsed Trump, she went on to blame the company for helping him win in 2016. The social media firm and its rivals have faced intense scrutiny since that election over their failure to prevent misleading posts and ads, many posted by Russian intelligence agents, that were designed to influence and inflame U.S. voters.\n\n\u201cNow, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people,\u201d the ad said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\u201d\n\nIn May, Warren introduced a proposal to break up the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, which include Facebook, Google and Amazon.\n\nLeaked audio from a Facebook question-and-answer session in July revealed Zuckerberg candidly discussing some of the sweeping proposals introduced by Warren and promising to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight her break-up plan if she wins the White House.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Zuckerberg said at the time. \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Verge released the audio, Warren responded on Twitter, renewing her criticism of Facebook.\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The ad was intended to troll Facebook for allowing the Trump campaign to run a blatantly false ad about Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Debate-Warren.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
