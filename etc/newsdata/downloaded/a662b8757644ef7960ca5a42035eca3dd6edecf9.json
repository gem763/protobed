But in the end those hopes were dashed \u2014 at least for now \u2014 leaving officials in Skopje, the capital, angry and deeply disappointed.\n\nAfter EU ministers tried and failed to reach a deal on the enlargement issue at a meeting of the General Affairs Council earlier this week, Tusk put the matter on the agenda for the leaders' summit, hoping to pressure Macron.\n\nFrance has cited procedural reasons for blocking the two countries, arguing that the EU\u2019s entire accession system is in need of an overhaul. But Paris has also made clear its view that North Macedonia and Albania are not ready to begin the EU membership process. Supporters of putting the Balkan countries on the path to membership argued that both have fulfilled criteria set by the EU and that the bloc's credibility will be badly damaged it it fails to live up to its promises.\n\nThe discussion on enlargement of the EU came at the end of the first day of a European Council leaders' summit, at which the EU struck a tentative deal on the U.K.'s withdrawal from the bloc.", "description": "Supporters of Balkan candidate countries warn EU\u2019s credibility at risk.", "authors": ["David M.
