Mark Pocan Mark William PocanHow Trump and Pelosi went from bad to worse Top progressive calls for Pompeo's salary to be withheld over Sondland's blocked testimony Democrats take Trump impeachment case to voters MORE (D-Wis.), the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told The Hill on Tuesday that progressives would push for \u201cvery specific,\u201d targeted amendments on the floor, unless leadership agrees to make the changes ahead of time.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to be very specific about a few provisions,\u201d he said, saying that the amendments could include increasing the number of drugs that are subject to negotiations under the bill, and providing more \u201cclarity\u201d around lifting a ban on Medicare negotiating drug prices.\n\nProgressives have been pushing Pelosi for months to make changes to the proposal. The legislation could come up for a vote in the House as soon as next week.\n\nIt remains unclear whether leadership will allow floor votes on progressive amendments. A spokesman for Pelosi did not respond to a request for comment on that question on Tuesday.\n\nThe underlying bill allows the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prices for at least 35 drugs, up to a maximum of 250 drugs.\n\nProgressives have been pushing to lift the minimum number so that more drugs can be negotiated.\n\nThere is also concern among progressives that the bill does not fully repeal the ban on Medicare negotiating drug prices, which has long been a priority for Democrats. Rather, the bill creates an exception to the ban for those 250 or fewer drugs. Pocan indicated he wanted changes to broaden the lifting of the ban.\n\nPocan, though, did not say he would vote against the bill if progressives did not get changes, noting that the measure has a \u201cgood foundation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you've got a good foundation, why wouldn't you want to cover more drugs?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is expected to advance the measure on Tuesday.
