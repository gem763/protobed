Undeterred, defendant Buck then engaged in the exact same behaviour with Timothy Dean, leading to his untimely death. Shockingly, defendant Buck continued his path of destruction, nearly causing another fatal incident.\n\n\u201cHis deadly behaviour has not stopped.\u201d\n\nMr Buck faces charges of administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house. He is not facing any criminal proceedings in relation to Moore and Dean\u2019s deaths.\n\nHe remains subject to a wrongful death civil lawsuit, filed in February by Moore\u2019s mother.\n\nThat lawsuit alleges wrongful death, sexual battery, hate violence, drug dealer liability, negligence, infliction of emotional distress, and two violations of civil rights on the part of the 65-year-old.\n\nAn updated filing includes an accusation of human trafficking, alleging that Mr Buck paid Moore to travel from Texas to West Hollywood.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nLos Angeles prosecutors say Mr Buck attempted to stop the third man, who has not been named, from seeking help after he overdosed on 11 September.\n\nThe 37-year-old eventually escaped the flat and reached a petrol station, where he called the police.\n\nOfficers later searched the West Hollywood home and discovered hundreds of photographs of men in compromising positions.\n\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned for the safety of people whose life circumstances may make them more vulnerable to criminal predators,\u201d said Jackie Lacey, the Los Angeles district attorney.\n\n\u201cWith this new evidence, I authorised the filing of criminal charges against Ed Buck.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have asked Mr Buck\u2019s bail be set at $4m (\u00a33.2m), arguing that without a high threshold, another death was possible.\n\nIf convicted as charged, the 65-year-old faces a possible maximum sentence of five years and eight months in prison.\n\nMr Buck has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing.", "description": "A US businessman has been described as a \u201cviolent, dangerous sexual predator\u201d after a man nearly died in his West Hollywood home, following two identical deaths.Ed Buck, a prominent Democratic donor, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with battery causing serious injury, after years of accusations that", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A2rtqb.BnL6DbctSRj7f2A--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/34b67179b7527e1c8744a982e4e0d39e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
