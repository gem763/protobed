New areas being resettled with the Kurds,\" he said.\n\nThe Kurdish authorities in northeastern Syrian said they were \"perplexed\" by Trump's statement on a successful truce.\n\n\"Turkey and its mercenaries have absolutely not abided by it and repeatedly violated it,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"Trump saying the Kurds have been resettled in new areas opened the way to ethnic cleansing,\" it warned, calling for international protection for the displaced.\n\nInternational observers have warned that Turkey's incursion could force Kurdish fighters to redeploy from prisons and camps where they are guarding thousands of suspected IS fighters and family members, making way for jailbreaks.\n\nThat has raised fears of a resurgence by the extremists, whom the SDF expelled from their last scrap of territory in March but who continue to claim deadly attacks in Kurdish-held areas.", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces fully withdrew from a Turkish-encircled town in northern Syria Sunday, in what appeared to be the start of a wider pullout under a ceasefire deal.
