They\u2019ll continue to do so as they attempt to prevent her from running away with the race.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to critique: Sanders\u2019s plan would boost government spending by an estimated $30 trillion over 10 years and almost certainly require a middle-class tax increase. This is something Warren is reluctant to admit out loud. She\u2019s already pledged support for a wealth tax \u2014 one of the highly ambitious and controversial centerpieces of her campaign \u2014 which is set to raise $2.75 trillion over a decade for other initiatives. Talk of another tax aimed at raising multiples of that amount could cement the interventionist image some have of her, and turn off some voters.\n\nWhile this situation would seem to be intractable, the fact is, Sanders\u2019s plan isn\u2019t the only route to universal coverage \u2014 it\u2019s just a particularly expensive one. There are more affordable ways of getting to a similar place, and one of these other options could provide a workable solution for Warren.\n\nAmerica currently pays for health care via an expensive and regressive muddle of employer contributions, premiums, and out-of-pocket spending by patients. Medicare for All would replace all of those costs with a tax, which would make the health-care system more straightforward and equitable. If the tax that finances it is progressive and a single-payer system can reduce health expenses while providing quality care, many Americans would come out ahead. Making sure no chunk of the middle class loses out in such a transition, as Warren pledged Tuesday, will be exceptionally difficult, though.\n\nFinancing a health care plan gets a lot easier if it costs the government less. The Sanders proposal is much more generous than the single-payer health systems of other developed nations; these countries generally don\u2019t eliminate out-of-pocket costs or cover as expansive a set of services. A few edits could go a long way toward reducing spending.\n\nAdding some limits to coverage, excluding undocumented immigrants and retaining limited out-of-pocket charges cuts the cost of a single-payer plan nearly in half, according to an analysis of a variety of different proposals released Tuesday by the center-left think tank Urban Institute. The report also suggests that such a plan \u2014 which they dub \u201cSingle-Payer \u2018Lite\u2019\u201d \u2014 would also lead to significantly lower overall health spending relative to something like the Sanders plan, while still eliminating premiums and covering all documented residents.\n\nWarren may not embrace all of the cost-cutting measures included in Single-Payer Lite, let alone the bigger savings that would result from retaining a role for premiums or private insurance. But there are clear benefits to diverging from what Sanders has proposed, and they should be on the table when she finally stakes out her own detailed position on health care.\n\nShifting her stance won\u2019t be easy politically and it won\u2019t come without trade-offs. But if she\u2019s going to offer a plan that treads as lightly on the middle class as she wants it to, it\u2019s all but unavoidable.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMax Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.
