The full year gain of 25% is pretty reasonable, too.\n\nAll else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth.\n\nView our latest analysis for Cubex Tubings\n\nDoes Cubex Tubings Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?\n\nWe can tell from its P/E ratio of 31.74 that there is some investor optimism about Cubex Tubings. As you can see below, Cubex Tubings has a much higher P/E than the average company (8.0) in the metals and mining industry.\n\nNSEI:CUBEXTUB Price Estimation Relative to Market, October 30th 2019 More\n\nIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Cubex Tubings shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\n\nP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.\n\nCubex Tubings's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 100% last year. The sweetener is that the annual five year growth rate of 22% is also impressive. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio.\n\nRemember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet\n\nThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.\n\nSuch expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.\n\nIs Debt Impacting Cubex Tubings's P/E?\n\nNet debt totals 17% of Cubex Tubings's market cap. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.\n\nThe Verdict On Cubex Tubings's P/E Ratio\n\nCubex Tubings has a P/E of 31.7. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.1. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is superb. So to be frank we are not surprised it has a high P/E ratio. What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about Cubex Tubings over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 23.9 back then to 31.7 today. If you like to buy stocks that have recently impressed the market, then this one might be a candidate; but if you prefer to invest when there is 'blood in the streets', then you may feel the opportunity has passed.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It's great to see Cubex Tubings (NSE:CUBEXTUB) shareholders have their patience rewarded with a 33% share price pop in...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ChUjlbZ.gjcurhnds_NlTg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/0215f50dd63e8fb699379518bbb1985b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
