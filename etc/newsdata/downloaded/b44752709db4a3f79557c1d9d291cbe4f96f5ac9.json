But they say the level of enthusiasm for Trump in Wisconsin\u2019s so-called WOW counties \u2014 Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington \u2014 matters a great deal in a state where three of the last five presidential elections were decided by less than one percent.\n\nIn the state\u2019s political equation, they serve as a conservative counterweight to the big Democratic margins traditionally delivered by Milwaukee and Madison. Unless that suburban GOP engine delivers it\u2019s own blowout win for Trump next year, it will be difficult for him to capture the state a second time.\n\n\u201cFor the president to win Wisconsin again, he\u2019s not going to have the free ride he had last time. He\u2019s not going to have Hillary Clinton sitting on her hands,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a completely engaged opposition party on the ground.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
