Video showed the suspect being arrested just outside the mall by two police officers. As you can see, one of the officers had fired a taser at the suspect:\n\nJust heard about a knife attack in Manchester. Male suspected to have stabbed four people before being arrested by Armed police. Thankful for their quick response in catching him. Hopefully more will become apparent on the situation later on down the line pic.twitter.com/4NfWFFC4Vv \u2014 SC 41597 Dan (@SC_41597) October 11, 2019\n\nThe BBC describes the scene inside the mall:\n\nOne witness said they saw a man \u201crunning around with a knife lunging at multiple people\u201d, while another described people \u201cscreaming and running\u201d. The centre was put on lockdown as officers confronted the attacker, with some shoppers taking refuge in stores. A shop worker, who only gave his name as Jordan, 23, said: \u201cA man was running around with a knife lunging at multiple people, one of which came into my store visibly shaken with a small graze\u2026 Freddie Holder, 22, from Market Drayton, Shropshire, said he heard \u201ca load of screams just outside\u201d the shop he was in. He said a woman then came into the shop and told others \u201ca guy just ran past the shop and tried to stab me\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m still kind of in shock from it, I\u2019m shaking a little bit\u2026 all shops had been locked down just for safety.\n\nThree people were transported to the hospital with serious injuries and are expected to live. Police gave an update in which they said that almost immediately after the attack began the man was confronted by two unarmed officers. The suspect began chasing them and they radioed for help. Other officers arrived and the suspect was arrested. Police are still saying they don\u2019t know the motive for the attack but the suspect was arrested on suspicion of terrorism:\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson told a press conference that while the suspect was initially arrested for serious assault, he has now been arrested on \u201csuspicion of the preparation, commission and instigation of an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThere was a similar knife attack in Paris last week when a long-time employee of the police department killed four of his colleagues inside police headquarters. In that case the suspect was killed. Police were initially downplaying terror as a motive, but after a search of the suspects computer and phone they announced that terrorism investigators were taking over the case. A short while later, we learned the suspect had recently adopted more conservative Islamic views and had \u201cexpressed his support for the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait a bit longer to find out what motivated the Manchester suspect. In most cases, people carrying out these attacks are not trying to go unnoticed. On the contrary, they usually announce the motive in some way. Since he\u2019s still alive, maybe he\u2019s also talking. Here\u2019s a video of the police press conference.", "description": "\"I'm still kind of in shock from it...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Manchester-attack.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
