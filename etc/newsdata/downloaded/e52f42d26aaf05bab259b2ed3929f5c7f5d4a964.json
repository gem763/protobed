REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement that \u201call signed agreements with Israel and the obligations resulting from them would end\u201d if Netanyahu went through with the move.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank in a 1967 war and Palestinians, who signed interim peace deals with Israel in the 1990s that include security cooperation, seek to make the area part of a future state.\n\nIsraeli political commentators saw Netanyahu\u2019s declaration, in a speech broadcast live on Israel\u2019s main TV channels, as a bid to siphon support away from far-right rivals who have long advocated annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cToday, I announce my intention, after the establishment of a new government, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast live on Israeli TV channels, calling the area \u201cIsrael\u2019s eastern border\u201d.\n\nThat step, he said, could be taken \u201cimmediately after the election if I receive a clear mandate to do so from you, the citizens of Israel\u201d.\n\nArab League foreign ministers condemned Netanyahu\u2019s plan, saying it would undermine any chance of progress towards Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nAround 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 Israeli settlers live in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area, according to the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem. The main Palestinian city is Jericho, with around 28 villages and smaller Bedouin communities.\n\nFighting for his political life after an inconclusive election in April, Netanyahu also reaffirmed a pledge to annex all of the settlements Israel has established in the West Bank. But he said that broader step could take longer and required \u201cmaximum coordination\u201d with Washington, Israel\u2019s close ally.\n\n\u201cOut of respect for President Trump and great faith in our friendship, I will await applying sovereignty until release of the president\u2019s political plan,\u201d he said, referring to a long-awaited blueprint from Washington for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nThe U.S. plan, Netanyahu reiterated, would likely be presented very soon after Israel goes to the polls on Sept. 17. Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party and in office for the past decade, failed to form a governing coalition following a national ballot in April.\n\n\u201cThere is no change in United States policy at this time,\u201d a Trump administration official said when asked whether the White House supported Netanyahu\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWe will release our Vision for Peace after the Israeli election and work to determine the best path forward to bring long sought security, opportunity and stability to the region.\u201d\n\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner said in early May that he hoped Israel would take a hard look at President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming Middle East peace proposal before \u201cproceeding with any plan\u201d to annex West Bank settlements.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times in June, U.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman said that \u201cunder certain circumstances\u201d Israel has the \u201cright to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank\u201d.\n\n\u2018PERPETUAL CONFLICT\u2019\n\nHanan Ashrawi, a senior official in the Palestine Liberation Organization, said on Twitter after Netanyahu\u2019s announcement that the Israeli leader was out to impose a \u201cgreater Israel on all of historical Palestine and (carry) out an ethnic cleansing agenda\u201d.\u201dAll bets are off. Dangerous aggression. Perpetual conflict,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and Palestinians have called Trump\u2019s proposal dead in the water, even before its publication, citing what they see as his pro-Israel policies.\n\nLast March, just before Israel\u2019s previous election, Trump - in a move widely seen as an attempt to bolster Netanyahu - recognised Israel\u2019s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 conflict.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an election stunt and not a very impressive one because it\u2019s so transparent,\u201d Yair Lapid, co-leader of the centrist Blue and White Party, said in a statement about Netanyahu\u2019s plan.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBlue and White, led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, and Likud are running neck and neck in opinion polls.\n\nThe Jordan Valley, which Palestinians seek for the eastern perimeter of a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, stretches from the Dead Sea in the south to the Israeli city of Beit Shean in the north.\n\nThe 2,400 square km (926.65 square mile) valley accounts for nearly 30 percent of the territory in the West Bank. Israel has long said it intends to maintain military control there under any peace agreement with the Palestinians.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his intention on Tuesday to annex the Jordan Valley, a large swathe of the occupied West Bank, if he wins a closely contested election just a week away.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428375715&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891I0", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
