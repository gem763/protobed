He sat in front of the counterculture icon and made her life 'miserable' because she hated sports and dressed like a Beatnik\n\nJohnson, 76, would go on to be the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys and now works as a football analyst at Fox Sports\n\nThe unlikely meeting of Joplin, who went on to become a world famous folk and blues singer before fatally overdosing on heroin aged 27, happened in Port Arthur, Texas, where she and Johnson grew up.\n\nThey both attended Thomas Jefferson High School where, in the late 1950s, conformity was the norm.\n\nBut by Joplin's senior year she had become 'the image of everything the students disliked', her friend Tary Owens told George-Warren.\n\nJohnson was a grade behind Joplin and was the polar opposite of her.\n\nHolly George-Warren's upcoming book Janis: Her Life and Music is out October 22\n\nHe was the son of a dairy worker and had already lost his front teeth as the star linebacker on the school team, the Yellow Jackets.\n\nJoplin, by contrast, was already harboring dreams of escaping Port Arthur and was considering being a singer or a painter.\n\nIn his own memoir, Johnson said he singled out Joplin because she 'ran with the beatnik crowd'.\n\nHe wrote: 'Her crowd was, to say the least, anti-jock. Our crowd was made up of jocks and cheerleaders and majorettes who hung out with us and wore our leather jackets'.\n\nIt was true to an extent. Joplin was a rebellious teen who had grown to 'despise' team sports and 'abhorred' football, which was sacred in Texas at the time.\n\nJohnson wrote: 'Janis looked and acted so weird that when we were around her, mostly in the hallways at school, we would give her a hard time'.\n\nJohnson gave Joplin the nickname 'Beat Weeds' partly because she was a Beatnik and partly because 'weeds' in jock vernacular referred to pubic hair. Johnson said that it could have just as easily been 'Beat Bush', a cruder alternative.\n\nThat wasn't the only insult Joplin endured - other jocks called her a 'w***e' and threw pennies at her.\n\nWhen Joplin hit the boys' hands away, they would later lie and claim she was an 'easy lay', writes George-Warren.\n\nIn his own memoir, Johnson (left and right in high school) said he singled out Joplin because she 'ran with the beatnik crowd'. He wrote: 'Her crowd was, to say the least, anti-jock.

Johnson said that it could have just as easily been 'Beat Bush', a cruder alternative. Pictured: Joplin at Thomas Jefferson High School\n\nBut at the time, it was far from the truth. When Joplin did date somebody - she would later become polyamorous and date men and women - they would try and get her drunk and push her into sex, which she refused.\n\nJoplin's response to the insults was to laugh and swear at them, which sometimes landed her in the principal's office.\n\nJohnson and the others on the football team went 'unpunished' - and Johnson is still utterly unrepentant about it decades later, telling Sports Illustrated, 'Beat Weeds never wore any panties,' but it wasn't clear how he came to that conclusion.\n\nJoplin's best friend Patti Skaff said: 'People said she was loose and she did this or that. Ten times as many guys as she ever had gone out with said they had slept with her'.\n\nAfter high school, Joplin moved to Austin where she studied at the University of Texas, but her run ins with the football team continued.\n\nA cruel campus 'joke' was the thing that finally 'broke' her and sent her on an anti-establishment path for the rest of her life, George-Warren writes.\n\nJohnson and the others on the football team went 'unpunished' - and Johnson is still utterly unrepentant about it decades later, telling Sports Illustrated, 'Beat Weeds never wore any panties,' but it wasn't clear how he came to that conclusion.

In 1962 she was 'devastated' after she was voted the Ugliest Man on Campus. Pictured: Joplin in 1969\n\nEach year the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity sponsored its annual fund-raiser by holding an Ugliest Man on Campus contest.\n\nStudents voted for each candidate nominated by the various fraternities for $5 each. Normally a hulking linebacker would be the winner but in 1962 somebody anonymously entered Joplin.\n\nHer picture was put on posters all over campus and though she laughed it off, inside she was devastated, a friend said.\n\nPowell St John said: 'She had already been profoundly hurt over and over. The contest crushed her. Saddest thing you ever saw. I had never seen Janis cry. Janis had a very tough exterior but it really got her; got her bad'.\n\nJoplin moved to San Francisco and five years later she sang at the Monterey Pop Festival with Big Brother and the Holding Company and was catapulted into stardom that would come to a tragic end in 1970.\n\nShe played Woodstock and was contemporaries with Bob Dylan and Joan Baez as part of the 1960s generation that rocked the establishment.\n\nJoplin was posthumously admitted to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, her celebrity assured after her death at such a tragically young age.\n\nHolly George-Warren's upcoming book Janis: Her Life and Music, is out October 22.", "description": "Janis Joplin was bullied by\u00a0future Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson during their high school days in the late 1950s in Port Arthur, Texas, a new book obtained by DailyMail.com reveals.", "authors": ["Daniel Bates For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19793414-0-image-a-28_1571238461865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
