The peso currency has lost two thirds of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018, hammering imports and consumption.\n\nDomestic sales of cars, wines and meat have dipped as wallets have been squeezed. Industry sources estimated condom sales are down 8% since the start of the year compared to 2018, and have fallen by a quarter over recent months as the economic crisis has worsened.\n\nMost condoms, or the materials needed to make them, are imported, so a weaker currency has an immediate impact on the price, up some 36% since the start of the year, said Felipe Kopelowicz, president of Kopelco, manufacturer of Tulip\u00e1n and Gentleman condom brands.\n\nCondom packaging with words reading \"always use it\" is seen in a machine in a factory in Buenos Aires, Argentina September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nSales of birth control pill sales are also down - 6% for the year and by a fifth more recently, pharmacists said.\n\nIsabel Reinoso, president of the Argentina Pharmaceutical Confederation, told Reuters price rises meant thousands of women were going off the pill. \u201cIt\u2019s around 144,000 women who have stopped taking contraceptives each month,\u201d she said.\n\nRISKY ENCOUNTERS\n\nPublic health experts said the issue could aggravate levels of sexually transmitted disease.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re just thinking about getting by day to day, health is often relegated and sexual health, which is still taboo and has little support, even more so,\u201d said Mar Lucas, program director at Fundaci\u00f3n Hu\u00e9sped, an Argentine non-profit organization fighting HIV.\n\nThe government does distribute free condoms in public hospitals, but few know about it, she said.\n\n\u201cWe know they are rarely used, misused and used inconsistently. And so we keep having a lot of sexually transmitted infections,\u201d added Lucas.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nArgentina\u2019s Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.\n\nEmiliano Di Ilio, a pharmacist working in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, told Reuters that steep inflation had caused sales of condoms and contraceptive pills in his pharmacy to fall by 20% and 25% respectively in the last two months.\n\n\u201cPeople come, ask the price, and then just leave,\u201d he said.", "description": "In South America's capital of romance, Argentine lovers are cutting back on one important cost: contraception.", "authors": ["Lucila Sigal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431582466&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0UT", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
