Marvellous Mirren's brimming with it", "language": "en", "text": "Catherine The Great\n\nThursday, Sky Atlantic\n\nRating:\n\nWorld On Fire\n\nSunday, BBC1\n\nRating:\n\nThe lavish new costume drama Catherine The Great stars Helen Mirren, who is marvellous in the title role, and now you\u2019ll be expecting me to say more, so I will, even if that\u2019s all you really need to know. Stars Helen Mirren, who is marvellous. That should do you. That\u2019s your reason to watch, right there. But as I must expand, I shall also tell you it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s sexy, has a clever script and covers a period in history that hasn\u2019t been done to death. Unlike, ahem, World War II, say.\n\nThe four-part series has been made available in its entirety, but as it\u2019ll also be showing week by week, we\u2019ll stick to episode one. It\u2019s set from 1762 onwards, after Catherine has overthrown her useless husband, Tsar Peter III, in a military coup and grabbed power for herself. She wishes to \u2018liberalise\u2019 Russia, she says, but for the moment she must see off those seeking to topple her: the prisoner who claims to be the rightful tsar; the hopeless son who does not believe his father died from \u2018terminal piles\u2019; and Orlov (Richard Roxburgh), the lover who helped stage the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and now wants to power-share.\n\nHelen Mirren in regal splendour as the Empress of Russia, with Gina McKee as her confidante, Praskovya Bruce. Richard Roxburgh, centre, plays Grigory Orlov, Catherine\u2019s favourite in the aftermath of the 1762 coup\n\nShe is not having that, and won\u2019t even sleep with him any more, so he has sex elsewhere. There are a lot of bouncing bare bottoms in this show, as is now the way with lavish historical costume dramas \u2013 see also Versailles, Tudors \u2013 but I don\u2019t make the rules. And we are spared modern rock music on the soundtrack, for once, so there is that.\n\nCatherine knows Orlov is playing away from home, so to speak, but isn\u2019t bothered as she already has her eye on someone else. This is the military leader Potemkin (Jason Clarke), who is so swaggering and manly he can\u2019t be killed even when pushed from a window. \u2018You look ravishing,\u2019 she tells him at one point. Her confidante, Countess Bruce (Gina McKee), basically road-tests him in bed for her. So here we have not one but two older women running the show on their own terms. Ask yourselves: when did I last see that on TV?\n\nThis was written by Nigel Williams specifically for Mirren \u2013 he also wrote the 2005 series Elizabeth I, in which she starred \u2013 and there are some excellent lines. \u2018It is a mistake to ask rich people for money. How do you think they got rich? By giving it away?\u2019, she may say. Or when her adviser, Panin (Rory Kinnear), tells her she\u2019s inclined to be merciful, she replies, \u2018Not always. Ask my hairdresser.\u2019 Mirren is marvellous \u2013 did I say that already? \u2013 as one of history\u2019s most intriguing rulers. She is mesmerising and powerful, with a hint of mischief in her eyes, and this is never too expositiony. You tend to pick information up on the hoof, like the fact she was married off to Peter at 15, didn\u2019t know what was what on her wedding night (\u2018I thought men and women were no different under their clothes\u2019) and barely knows her son as he was brought up by her mother-in-law. And the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne? Sensationally lush. The interiors. The frocks. The banquets. Everything. I\u2019m hooked, and as for Mirren? Marvellous.\n\nIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s sexy and it covers a time in history that hasn\u2019t been done to death on TV. Unlike, ahem, World War II\n\nOn to the other historical drama of the week, Peter Bowker\u2019s World On Fire, which is a much more earnest affair. When I first heard about it, I\u2019m ashamed to say my first thought was, \u2018Oh God, not World War II again.\u2019 However, it promised to be different. It promised to be an epic, sweeping narrative focusing on \u2018ordinary people\u2019, although for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t see why that was different. Aren\u2019t most such dramas about ordinary people? Wasn\u2019t Catch-22 about \u2018ordinary people\u2019 in its way? (Poor Yossarian.) But while that was different and had something to say about the absolute absurdity of war, this, for the moment, seems wholly generic, with its smoky jazz clubs and Nazis and dimly lit rooms and newspaper headlines saying Germany has invaded Poland or whatever. I couldn\u2019t see why it might be fresh at all.\n\nIt opens in 1939 and the main characters are sweethearts Harry (Jonah Hauer-King) and Lois (Julia Brown), who are separated when he is dispatched to Warsaw as a translator, while she stays behind in Manchester working in a factory. Harry then falls for a Polish waitress, whose father and brother head off to defend Danzig, and also there\u2019s an American journalist (Helen Hunt), who has a gay nephew in Paris. Even though the journalist is based on the real-life British journalist Clare Hollingworth, the character didn\u2019t seem at all believable. \u2018The game just got bigger,\u2019 she says to Harry at one point. \u2018Did you?\u2019 Meanwhile, Harry\u2019s middle-class mother (Lesley Manville) is stereotypically posh and a snob, while Lois\u2019s bus conductor father (Sean Bean) is stereotypically not. It is sweeping, in the sense we are in a number of countries at the one time, but it\u2019s at the expense of characterisation. Harry, did he have any personality at all? Whereas Mirren\u2026 You can fill in the rest, I think.", "description": "The lavish new costume drama Catherine The Great stars Helen Mirren, who is marvellous in the title role, and now you'll be expecting me to say more, so I will, even if that's all you really need to know", "authors": ["Deborah Ross For Event Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/13/19307790-0-image-a-29_1570279651863.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
