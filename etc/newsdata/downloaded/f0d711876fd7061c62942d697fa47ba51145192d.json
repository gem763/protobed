The units have previously been replaced using a robotic arm, but the failed unit is too far away for the arm to reach.\n\nThe units regulate how much energy flows from the station's massive solar panels to batteries that provide power during nighttime passes around Earth. Three previous spacewalks had been planned to replace lithium-ion batteries, but those will be rescheduled until the latest issue is resolved.\n\nThe hardware failure presents some concern, especially since another battery was replaced in April and there are only four more backups on station.\n\n\"There's some level of concern,\" said Kenny Todd, manager of ISS operations and integration. \"It's absolutely a concern at this point when you don't know what's going on and we're still scratching our heads looking at the data.\"\n\nNASA astronauts Jessica Meir, left, and Christina Koch, right, have been tasked with replacing a faulty ISS power unit. It will mark the first all-female spacewalk. More\n\nThis week's spacewalk \u2013 Koch's fourth and Meir's first \u2013 will see the astronauts move the new hardware, install it, then return the faulty version to the airlock for future investigation. Todd said SpaceX's next uncrewed Dragon flight to the ISS can pick up the faulty battery and return it for inspection in December or January.\n\nKoch and Meir will have some leftover time during their extravehicular activity, or EVA, to finish additional tasks like hardware installations for the European Space Agency.\n\nThe planned EVA comes almost seven months after the first all-female spacewalk was canceled due to a lack of properly sized spacesuits for astronauts Koch and Anne McClain. Astronaut Nick Hague ended up joining Koch instead.\n\nBut this time, the right spacesuits are in place.\n\nFirst female spacewalk is set, again: NASA says it has the correct size spacesuit this time\n\n\"It will be an exciting event and something that we'll reflect on certainly after the fact,\" said Megan McArthur, deputy chief of NASA\u2019s astronaut office. \"In truth, in terms of looking at the workload that we have coming forward, this was the right crew to send out to do this set of tasks.\n\n\"All of our crew members are completely qualified to do this and I think the fact that it will be two women is a reflection of the fact that we have so many capable, qualified women in the (astronaut) office,\" she said.\n\nFollow Emre Kelly on Twitter: @EmreKelly.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Today: NASA: First all-female spacewalk moved up to fix ISS power issue", "description": "NASA has decided to move up the first all-female spacewalk to this week to tackle a power issue on the International Space Station.", "authors": ["Emre Kelly", "Florida Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kUs7w8H8y3NY.1_lbMKMZA--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MTIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/0a72252103dc654fb0c59fdd30674fde", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
