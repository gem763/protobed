That may be surprising, given flashy headlines showing substantial increases in support. But those results are mainly being compared with those taken before the inquiry was announced. It is not obvious that the most recent polls are much worse for the president than those taken a week or two ago.\n\nFour pollsters have conducted two surveys since the announcement of the inquiry (HarrisX, YouGov, Morning Consult and Quinnipiac), and on average they show support for impeachment creeping up \u2014 from plus-4 to plus-5 over an average of 10 days between the initial and second survey.\n\nIn other words, it is possible that impeachment support quickly rose as Democrats got on board, but has not necessarily increased much since.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nate Cohn", "Nytimes.Com Upshot Impeachment-Trump-Polling.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
