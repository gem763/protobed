Read More\n\nSamsung on Monday announced that the Galaxy Fold will launch in the US on Friday, Sept. 27. The launch follows the smartphone's release in Korea and parts of Europe earlier this month.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is Samsung's first smartphone with a foldable display and has seen its share of problems leading up to its second release date this year. In April, just a few days before the phone's first release date, tech reviewers began to experience issues with the display.\n\nUltimately, Samsung postponed the launch to investigate and correct the issues. And, as of Friday, US customers will be able to order the $1,980 foldable phone from AT&T, Best Buy, and in Samsung Experience Store locations.\n\nThere will be an unlocked version, as well as an AT&T specific version.\n\nNot every AT&T or Best Buy store will carry the Fold. You'll need to visit Samsung's website in order to find a nearby retail location that has the Fold. Samsung won't sell the Fold on its website. You can order through att.com and bestbuy.com, however.\n\nDisclosure: ZDNet may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.", "description": "The company's first smartphone with a foldable display is ready for the US.", "authors": ["Jason Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/f1f67292-4b5e-4e83-8767-9ccc82c5b062/thumbnail/770x578/143b46171d40242597ff6e30b12755ca/20190905-143339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
