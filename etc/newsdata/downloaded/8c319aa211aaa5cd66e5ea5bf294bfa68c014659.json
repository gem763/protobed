Rumors pointing to the cards and their respective specs have been swirling for quite some time now, and leaks involving spec sheets and other performance metrics have been dropping for the past week or so.\n\nAs we suspected, the upgraded cards effectively pack Ti-level performance into a package priced like one of its standard midrange GPUs. Nvidia is positioning the new 1660 Super as a kind of successor to the 1060. It will be priced at $229 and launches today, while pricing and availability for the 1650 Super are coming at a later date.\n\nThis won\u2019t get you real-time ray tracing, which the standard RTX and RTX Super cards offer. But Nvidia says the 1660 Super will deliver double the performance of a 10-series card like the 1060 and about 50 percent more performance compared to the standard 1660. The cards also launch with a new Nvidia driver that brings support for graphics features like ReShade, Nvidia Ultra Low Latency (now with G-Sync support), Enhanced Customizable Image Sharpening, and Turing Encoder to machines running the new GPUs.", "description": "Nvidia is extending its Super moniker from its higher-end RTX graphics cards with the launch of two new models: the GTX 1660 Super and the GTX 1650 Super.
