More than 100 Bahamians trying to escape the hurricane\u2019s devastation were ordered off of a ferry departing storm-ravaged Freeport, told by a crew member over the ship\u2019s intercom system that if they attempted to enter the United States without a visa, \u201cyou will have trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, all passengers that don\u2019t have U.S. visa, please proceed to disembark,\u201d the crew member continued.\n\nIn a statement, CBP denied that it had ordered the passengers\u2019 removal, and blamed the decision on a communication error between the ferry\u2019s operators and agency representatives.\n\n\u201cCBP was notified of a vessel preparing to embark an unknown number of passengers in Freeport and requested that the operator of the vessel coordinate with U.S. and Bahamian government officials in Nassau before departing The Bahamas,\u201d an agency spokesperson said in a statement. But the ferry operator, Balearia Caribbean, either misunderstood or decided that the vessel couldn\u2019t wait for hours while the arrival was coordinated\u2014resulting in dozens of people being forced to disembark.\n\n\u201cCBP told them that everyone that everyone who doesn\u2019t have a U.S. visa, and who\u2019s traveling on police record has to come off,\u201d booted passenger Renard Oliver told Miami news station WSVN, holding his infant daughter in his arms. \u201cNormally you can use police record by way of airplane, at least\u2026 It\u2019s hurtful, because I\u2019m watching my daughters cry, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has faced calls to clarify the process by which hurricane survivors can seek safe haven in the United States, either by suspending traditional visa requirements for Bahamian citizens with relatives in the United States, or by extending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation to the Bahamas. TPS, as the name implies, gives citizens of countries affected by natural disasters or civil unrest the ability to temporarily live and work in the United States, a status that can be extended for years.\n\nBut the Trump administration has been increasingly hostile to granting and extending TPS designations. The Department of Homeland Security is currently entangled in a federal court case after seeking to terminate TPS for South Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador, which would strip protective status from more than 300,000 people. The administration has also indicated that it does not support extending TPS to citizens of Venezuela\u2014blaming, in part, legal efforts to stymy the termination of TPS for other countries.\n\n\u201cAs long as courts continue to displace executive branch authority to terminate TPS status, it makes a decision to exercise the discretion in the first place considerably more complicated and more akin to a permanent status, rather than temporary,\u201d wrote acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli in a July letter to Sens. Dick Durbin (IL) and Bob Menendez (NJ), who along with 24 other senators called for extending the status for those seeking to flee the country. Cuccinelli added that \u201cthere may be other immigration relief measures available\u201d to those in need.\n\nWithout TPS, Bahamians are left with uncertainty about their immigration status beyond the discretionary entry promised by CBP\u2014which Florida lawmakers say isn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\n\u201cThe United States government should help ensure that those who were left with nothing can easily seek shelter with their families in the United States,\u201d wrote Reps. Brian Mast and Stephanie Murphy, a Republican and Democrat of Florida, respectively, in a letter calling on President Trump to \u201cexpedite, waive, or suspend certain visa requirements\u201d for Bahamian citizens affected by the storm. The letter was co-signed by eighteen other members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nMorgan told reporters on Monday that while \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been any formal grant of TPS\u201d for the Bahamas, his agency will continue to allow for discretionary entry on humanitarian grounds\u2014within reason.\n\n\u201cThere are still people that are enemies to this country,\u201d Morgan said, noting that while his agency wouldn\u2019t send Bahamians with criminal convictions back to their storm-ravaged country, but would turn them over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.", "description": "Admitting \u201cconfusion\u201d in Hurricane Dorian\u2019s aftermath, the head of Border Patrol said Bahamians are welcome to come to America.
