Until now, Trump\u2019s habit of using his office for personal profit has generally inspired response No. 1, pretending it doesn\u2019t exist. But now the Federalist, a site that (as its stuffy name implies) once aspired to intellectual respectability but has defined itself as the Trumpiest of Trumpsites, has again broken new ground. It has a column supporting Trump\u2019s decision to host the 2020 G7 summit at his own property.\n\nThe column, by David Marcus, does not merely defend Trump\u2019s choice as legal or unimpeachable. Marcus praises the president for his shrewdness. Marcus argues that hosting the summit at a Trump property gives the president a \u201chome field advantage\u201d when negotiating with his counterparts.\n\nTo be sure, the summit was always going to be held in the president\u2019s home country. But Marcus discerns a particular advantage in situating it at a property he personally owns. \u201cTo be able to scuff the table with the heel of your shoe while sitting back relaxed? That\u2019s a hell of a thing,\u201d admired Marcus. \u201cTo be able to point to everything and say, That\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nApparently the diplomatic advantages of being able to scuff tables with presidential shoes loom so large they justify Trump awarding a no-bid contract to his own property. (Bear in mind that, had any other government employee made such a decision, they would be fired.)\n\nMarcus notes at the end that, to be sure, Trump must make sure the summit does not profit him personally. \u201cNow look, does it have to be absolutely clear that the G7 doesn\u2019t profit Trump? Yes, of course,\u201d he concedes. \u201cMake sure that it is all done at cost. There is no doubt that Democrats will be on top of this like granola on yogurt. But assuming those ducks line up? Come on, this is great.\u201d\n\nMarcus proceeds immediately from insisting Trump must forswear any profit to assuming that he will, without bothering to propose any mechanism to ensure this happens, or even defining what it would mean. Trump of course has refused to publish his financial information. The Washington Post submitted a series of basic questions to define what Trump means by running the conference at cost:\n\nQuestions for @Trump Org today, about the huge contract that the president awarded to himself yesterday.\n\nI\u2019ll let you know when I hear back! pic.twitter.com/py5bPw6vHc \u2014 David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) October 18, 2019\n\nNone of these questions have been answered. Even if they were, and even if Trump somehow allowed some transparency to ensure his promises were followed, it\u2019s hard to nail down what it means to avoid a profit. The event is being held in the off-season, when the marginal cost of filling empty rooms is low. Trump has already used his office to give the facility millions of dollars worth of free publicity, most recently in an infomercial for its amenities. \u201cThere\u2019s almost 900 acres there. So it\u2019s a huge facility. And we\u2019ll be able \u2014 with a lot open space. I think there\u2019s three golf courses,\u201d marveled budget director, chief of staff, and now Trump Organization time-share pitchman Mick Mulvaney at the White House yesterday. More free advertising is sure to surround the event itself. Any resort in the world would gladly host a G7 summit for free, let alone at cost, in return for that kind of taxpayer-financed publicity.\n\nWill hosting the event at Trump\u2019s property change the tenor of the negotiations? Oh, absolutely. But not in the way Marcus says. It will reinforce the widely shared understanding by foreign leaders that Trump values flattery and bribes as a form of diplomacy. It is all wrapped into every negotiation. Why bother giving concessions to the United States government, on the scale of tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, when you can hack a few zeroes off the price and put the money in Trump\u2019s pocket instead?\n\nStaging the G7 in one of his resorts is a new level of brazen corruption by the administration. The message to the world will be that the United States has been reduced to the level of the kleptocracies Trump admires. And the message to this country is that Trump\u2019s supporters are along for the ride, all the way to the bottom, wherever that is.", "description": "President Trump announced yesterday he will host the 2020 G-7 summit at his own resort in Doral, Florida.
