My teenage body felt entirely foreign to me. But as I stared at my bare, ingrown-laden legs in the dressing room mirror, I felt the delicious ubiquity that comes with knowing you\u2019re part of the party, dressed like everyone else.\n\nForever 21, which announced it would file for bankruptcy on Sunday night, gave women across the country a sense that they belonged, even if that feeling came with the price of serpentine checkout lines and sweaters that ripped after half a wearing.\n\nI last shopped at Forever 21 around a year and a half ago. I don\u2019t remember why, but I was in desperate need of yoga pants. As I wriggled into a pair, I heard the sounds of a couple a few dressing room doors down kissing and giggling. I closed my eyes and thought of Bloomingdales.\n\nAs news of Forever 21\u2019s not entirely unexpected demise spread last night, there were predictable jokes made on Twitter regarding rushing to the mall for sales (30 to 50 percent off sitewide, if you\u2019re interested).\n\nBut running GIFs aside, the news relayed some sad truths: as The New York Times reported, 178 stores will shutter in the United States alone. Over 30,000 people stand to lose their jobs.\n\nFounded by Do Won Chang and Jin Sook Chang, a husband-and-wife team of South Korean immigrants who opened their first Los Angeles store in 1984, Forever 21 became a nearly mythic retailer to millennial women.\n\nThe store\u2019s constantly-revolving stock of crop tops, skinny jeans, and various sparkly things allowed shoppers a chance to try out trends on the cheap. Sure, employees were gruff and nothing was standardized. You needed to be a true hunter-gatherer to find what you wanted. But that only added to Forever 21\u2019s hate-to-love reputation.\n\nVisiting a Forever 21 felt like an exercise in autonomy. You were on your own among a sea of $15 bodycon; one had to be a true crate digger to succeed. And when your haul of $5 goodies inexplicably ran up to $300 at the cash register, you had to exercise restraint while editing your bundle down to an appropriate price.\n\nAll of the complaints about Forever 21 rang true. The clothes didn\u2019t last. The people who made them didn\u2019t get paid. Artists alleged that the company ripped off their designs, and leaders at the company never quite learned that it\u2019s not OK to sell \u201cNavajo panties\u201d or \u201cOriental girl necklaces\u201d or put all-white models in \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d t-shirts.\n\nForever 21\u2019s bounty of offenses has been the subject of too many listicles to link. Still, for customers who outfitted their youth in the franchise\u2019s faux leather and striped rompers (so many rompers), walking into a Forever 21 felt like coming home. Not the comfortable, mom-just-made-a-pie home, but the real, messy, disorderly home where people leave their socks out on the couch and your uncle doesn\u2019t believe in climate change.\n\nThe brand even famously blazoned \u201cJohn 3:16\u201d on every shopping bag, referencing the Bible verse. I have personally witnessed a tween use this tidbit to convince her nice Evangelical mother to let her buy one very un-Christian thong bodysuit.\n\nFormer suburban mall rats, such as myself, quite literally grew up at Forever 21. The brand\u2019s large footprint in shopping centers explains our nostalgia, but it\u2019s also the reason for Forever 21\u2019s current situation.\n\n\u201cForever 21 specifically challenged all the market\u2019s previously conceived notions on how quickly and cheaply you could get your hands on a hot fashion trend,\u201d Elizabeth Shobert, director of digital strategy for retail analytics company StyleSage, said. \u201cTen years ago, this matched how a large proportion of shoppers wanted to access fashion\u2014cheaply\u2014and importantly, by heading to the mall.\u201d\n\nBut now, as malls and department stores resemble less bustling bazaars and more empty settings worthy of a slasher film, things have changed. Forever 21 does have an online presence, but the manic design looks completely unhinged.\n\n\u201cForever 21 is just a mess in-store and overwhelming to shop,\u201d Charcy Evers, a fashion and retail trend analyst, said. \u201cConsumers are overwhelmed as it is, and brands need to offer a point of view, curation, and cut out the noise for them.\u201d\n\nShobert believes that Forever 21 can get more \u201cdisciplined\u201d when it comes to editing its mammoth collection of merchandise, and do more to \u201cmake sure both their online and in-store shopping experiences are more organized and less chaotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cGen Z wants shared values, and companies need to stand for something and be advocates,\u201d Evers offered. \u201cForever 21 couldn\u2019t be further from this.\u201d\n\nTrue, the brand often lacked a moral compass, but in its heyday it encouraged many women to express themselves. Even if the going-out top or see-through shirts only made it through one wear before falling apart, the clothes made for many memorable nights.", "description": "The one-time behemoth retailer will file for bankruptcy.
