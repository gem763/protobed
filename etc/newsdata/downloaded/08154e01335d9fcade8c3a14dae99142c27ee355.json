They don't like Brexit. And they don't want to be seen dancing to Boris Johnson's tune.\n\nSo they've composed their own plan for a snap poll on... 9 December.\n\nOne source suggested that the ever-so-slightly earlier date could particularly help the Liberal Democrats, because more students would still be in their university towns on the 9th than on 12 December.\n\nBut the bigger picture is that these two parties might be worried that if Brussels thinks that Parliament isn't actually going to use a longer extension to do anything meaningful, the EU will grant a shorter one instead... designed to apply pressure on MPs to approve the PM's deal.\n\nSo the Lib Dems and the SNP are saying, \"give us that longer delay and we will work to break the deadlock\".\n\nTheir plan, as it stands, hinges on No 10 being interested.
