San Francisco passed a homelessness tax on businesses.\n\npassed a homelessness tax on businesses. Mountain View passed a per employee \"head tax\" aimed at Google, which will end up costing the company millions every year.\n\nLocal politics are becoming too costly for the companies to ignore, says Margaret O'Mara, a tech historian at the University of Washington. \"They're now finally playing in local politics. It's becoming important not only to their public image, but also their bottom line.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Amazon has put $1.4 million into the Seattle City Council race this year. It's \"a staggering sum for a city election, let alone from a company that was M.I.A. in local politics for years,\" the New York Times' Karen Weise writes. Just four years ago, Amazon spent $25,000.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is critical that our hometown has a City Council that is focused on pragmatic solutions to our shared challenges in transportation, homelessness, climate change and public safety,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMoney in San Francisco's elections is reaching new heights, too. The past two City Hall elections saw $7 million and $8 million in spending, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nTech giants are also putting money into local projects \u2014 often trying to address housing and transit crises fueled by their own growth.\n\nJust this week, Facebook committed $1 billion for Bay Area housing.

And in some cases, spending too much can work against tech giants.\n\nIn Seattle, progressive candidates are latching onto Amazon's big political contribution as a talking point. Kshama Sawant, who is the most vocal anti-Amazon Seattle council member, tweeted, \u201cEMERGENCY! Amazon just dropped a $1 million bomb on Seattle elections \u2014 we can\u2019t let Jeff Bezos buy City Hall!\u201d\n\nAnd in San Francisco, Juul garnered widespread backlash after it spent millions to support a ballot measure overturning a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes. The company later pulled support for the measure.\n\nWhat to watch: As the techlash intensifies, eyes are on federal regulators, but local and state lawmakers will be in the crux of the action, too, O'Mara says. \"We're in for a really interesting 5\u201310 years in which this issue of tech regulation is going to be a really defining political question \u2014 at every level.\"\n\nGo deeper: Cities, not Congress, are clipping Big Tech's wings", "description": "Some of their toughest, priciest fights are in their hometowns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/2K5dCn37gz7Govu67fXF2v7NR5M=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571868546424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
