I\u2019m disinclined to think so, but I certainly don\u2019t rule it out. There\u2019s more than enough to justify an investigation. I am at a conference in Massachusetts today, and last night after dinner, I spent an hour or two reading the day\u2019s impeachment news. It\u2019s exhausting, and I am extremely discouraged that this is what we\u2019re going to have to deal with every day for the next year, until the election.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: the main reason we are having to do this is because Donald Trump is reckless to a shocking degree. One day after the Mueller Report failed to take him down, he gets on the phone with the Ukraine president and pops off like this. How hard is it to restrain yourself? I resent the hell out of Donald Trump for putting so many conservatives, especially Republican lawmakers, in the position of having to defend him over stupid, easily preventable missteps.\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know what to think about him, and what should be done about all this. I guess that makes me a very small sliver of the American electorate, most of whom have made their minds up. Some of you readers chastise me because I\u2019m too forgiving on Trump. Others chastise me because I\u2019m not as supportive of him as you think I should be. I\u2019m on record here as saying that despite his rottenness, I might vote for him anyway in 2020, on the principle of \u201cVote For The Crook, It\u2019s Important\u201d. I believe, however, that there has to be a bright red line. Would you vote for a confessed murderer for president? If not, then that\u2019s one line. What would Trump have to do that would cause me to support his impeachment, or at least to vote against him for re-election \u2014 this, in spite of the very real and significant damage a Democratic president would do to causes (abortion, religious liberty) that mean a lot to me?\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t know. But I am sure I\u2019m going to find out as the investigation goes forward.\n\nThe howls and cries of liberals who see no reason at all why anybody should support Trump in spite of himself fall on deaf ears. They don\u2019t feel as strongly about religious liberty and the pro-life cause as I do, and therefore they don\u2019t have an intuitive grasp of how disastrous a Democratic president would be, given how radical the party has become on those issues. If the situation were reversed, and a corrupt Democratic president was the only thing standing between a champion of the Religious Right taking office, and putting abortion and LGBT rights in jeopardy, they would know exactly how I feel.\n\nThe howls and cries of conservatives who see no reason at all why any conservative should abandon Trump fall \u2026 well, they don\u2019t fall on deaf ears, because conservatives are my people. But I do have little patience for those who are willing to accept anything this White House says in defense of itself. This country has gone way too far in empowering the Executive \u2014 and this is something many conservatives were saying under George W. Bush. If Trump really has done what he is being accused of here, and he gets away with it, then we conservatives will have been responsible for a shocking de facto expansion of presidential powers. To say nothing about what we will have done to the integrity of our political movement.\n\nHear me: I\u2019m not saying that we should climb aboard the impeachment train. It\u2019s way too early for that. I am saying that it\u2019s way too early to say that we will never climb aboard it. This morning I met a man about my age, a former Catholic who recognized me at the hotel breakfast, and who told me a very grim story about his own childhood molestation at the hands of a priest, and the molestation of his young son. It ended up destroying his family. He told me about a new scandal that will soon be uncovered; he was interviewed by police investigators over it. It involves a molestation cover-up, and a victim\u2019s suicide. The man told me that after 40 years of being a Catholic, and working for the Church that whole time, he came to believe that the clergy and the hierarchy believe that protecting the institution is more important than truth, and the suffering of victims. He left the Catholic Church.\n\nComing back up to the room, I was thinking about the principle here of defending \u201cour guys\u201d at all costs. Donald Trump\u2019s sins, offenses, and possibly crimes, are not as bad as molesting a child, heaven knows. But the principle is the same: if we throw all morality out for the sake of protecting our own, we will stand naked and condemned.\n\nOne more time: I am willing to put up with a degree of corruption by Trump to protect more important principles. But that cannot be an open-ended commitment. And if we conservatives are going to stand by the guy, we should at least be honest about who and what we are defending, and why. To that end, here\u2019s a good Ramesh Ponnuru column about the lies many conservatives are telling ourselves to protect Trump. Excerpt:\n\nThe \u201cwhistleblower complaint\u201d contains a lot of hearsay. That\u2019s true, but the allegations are of sufficiently troubling acts as to be worth investigating. Russiagate was a hoax, and the same people who spread it are yelling about this. Russia interfered in the 2016 election; the president has repeatedly denied that point; and top aides expressed their willingness to get election help from the Russian government. The idea that there was something worth looking into was no hoax, even if Robert Mueller was unable to show that Trump was involved in a criminal conspiracy. The multiplicity of grounds Trump\u2019s enemies have cited to call for impeachment shows they are just after him for partisan reasons. Partisanship is definitely playing a large role, just as Hamilton predicted. Note, though, that this defense of Trump is similar to one Hillary Clinton\u2019s fans made over her emails: They\u2019ve alleged one thing after another about her for decades, so why take this one seriously? It wasn\u2019t wrong for Clinton\u2019s defenders to point to Republican partisanship. But Clinton also had a history of ethical corner-cutting that kept leading to accusations, some of them justified and some of them unjustified. Trump seems to have a habit of confusing his interests with the country\u2019s, and it too is leading to scandal after scandal. Trump\u2019s enemies are trying to annul an election; they can\u2019t accept his legitimacy. Trump is the legitimate president, and some of his opponents have foolishly denied it. He was elected fair and square under the process our Constitution lays out. If he\u2019s removed from office after an impeachment trial, he\u2019ll have exited the presidency under another process the Constitution lays out. And Hillary Clinton won\u2019t become president. Removing a president for high crimes and misdemeanors is not something to be done lightly. There is plenty of room for debate over what counts as an impeachment-worthy offense. It may be wiser to leave a judgment of Trump\u2019s conduct to the next election. But if Congress chooses to leave him in office, it shouldn\u2019t be based on the weak arguments his defenders are currently making.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-28-at-9.15.18-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
