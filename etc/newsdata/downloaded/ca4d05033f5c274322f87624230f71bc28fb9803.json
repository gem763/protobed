USD 0.2686 and is up by 5.6% in the past 24 hours and by 7% in the past week.\n\nIn comparison, bitcoin and ether are down c. 1%, while XLM is the second best performer with 3.6% gains today.\n\nXRP price chart:\n\nLooking at the top 10 coins by market capitalization over the course of the last week, we find that majority have seen a 2%-7% rise, while bitcoin is almost unchanged.\n\nJust four days ago, as reported, Ripple came out with a host of updates and news, but XRP was trading sideways nonetheless. The price has risen more than 7% since then.\n\nAs a matter of fact, looking at the chart for the last week, we can see XRP making a gradual rise starting with October 4th, reaching its highest peak between then and the time of writing on October 7th with a price of USD 0.269 \u2013 which is also the level it last saw on September 24th.\n\nThe second place on weekly charts is taken by EOS, which appreciated 6.8% in the last seven days. It too, like many other coins, had seen a major drop on September 24th, and has been trading sideways since. The last week has proved greener for EOS, which now trades at c. USD 2.99 and is up by 0.6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cryptoverse has taken notice of the latest XRP rally, with many discussing possible dumps and/or pumps, while the speculations about an altseason continue.\n\nTrader and analyst Luke Martin, aka Venture Coinist, updated his thread on the progress of XRP, and says that the coin is on its way to 4,000 sats (USD 0.32).\n\n$XRP road to 4000 sats continues.\n\n\n\nThe comments on the first post in this thread are hilarious to read now. pic.twitter.com/1BLki6c9Qu \u2014 Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist) October 7, 2019\n\nFurthermore, Su Zhu, CEO of Singapore-based investment management firm Three Arrows Capital, thinks that right now \u201cthe biggest bull case\u201d for BTC is XRP, adding that in the short to medium term the altcoins with structures that look like XRP and ETH will outperform those that look like EOS and BCH.\n\nI think all things equal the alts w/ structures that look like XRP and ETH will outperform the ones that look like EOS and BCH in the short to medium term.
