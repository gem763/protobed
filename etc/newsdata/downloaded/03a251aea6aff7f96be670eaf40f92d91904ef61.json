That one felt a little different.\"\n\nNew Orleans had lost their previous five season openers. And after last season ended with a bitter loss in the NFC title game, the Saints had expressed urgency in recent weeks to start the 2019 campaign off well.\n\n\"I knew how big this win would be,\" Lutz said. \"There was a little more weight on my shoulders on that one.\"\n\nThe moment the ball left Lutz's foot, holder Thomas Morstead appeared to know it was good, and turned toward his kicker triumphantly flexing both arms at his side. Moments later, the crowd noise in the Superdome reached an ear-splitting crescendo as the ball split the uprights and Saints players began jubilantly streaming onto the field.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to former Saints receiver Kenny Stills with 37 seconds left, capping a two-play, 75-yard drive that put the Texans in front after they began their final possession down by six with 50 seconds left.\n\nBut there was just enough time for Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who capped a 370-yard, two-touchdown performance by completing a 15-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr., an 11-yarder to Michael Thomas and another pass to Ginn for 9 yards in quick succession. That allowed New Orleans to save its final timeout until just 2 seconds remained and set up Lutz's career-long kick.\n\n\"When you have Drew as your quarterback, all I cared about was getting ready for the kick, because I knew with 37 seconds left there was going to be a chance,\" Lutz said.\n\nThe 40-year-old Brees completed 32 of 43 passes. He threw one interception deep in Houston territory in the first half that could have proved costly, but did enough to make up for it.\n\nBrees appeared to have all but sealed it when he spotted Ginn deep down field on third and 2 and connected for a 41-yard gain to the Houston 44 at the 2-minute warning. Alvin Kamara, who had 169 yards from scrimmage, followed with an 11-yard run, and the Saints ran the clock down to 55 seconds before Lutz converted a 47-yarder.\n\nOne of Brees' TD passes went to reserve QB and utility player Taysom Hill, who also subs in as a tight end or slot receiver. Brees' other TD went to second-year pro Tre'Quan Smith.\n\nWatson completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 two of them to DeAndre Hopkins \u2014 and also ran for a 21-yard score on a fourth-down play.\n\nThe Texans finished with 180 yards rushing \u2014 68 yards more than the Saints allowed in any game last season \u2014 with Carlos Hyde rushing for 83 yards and Duke Johnson 57.", "description": "Wil Lutz made a 58-yard field goal as time expired to lift the New Orleans Saints to a 30-28 victory over the Houston Texans on Monday night in game that had three scoring plays in the final minute.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277185.1568083936!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/texans-saints-football.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
