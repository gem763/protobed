Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Dorian is not the first Category 5 hurricane to threaten the United States during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, but on Sunday he said he\u2019s \u201cnot sure\u201d he\u2019s \u201cever even heard\u201d of such a thing.\n\n\u201cI knew it existed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen some Category 4s. You don\u2019t even see them that much. But a Category 5 is something that, uh, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever even heard the term, other than I know it\u2019s there. That\u2019s the ultimate. And that\u2019s what we have, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cI'm not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a Category 5.\"\n\n\n\nAlso President Trump: pic.twitter.com/lj8c5yeUQ1 \u2014 Kasie DC (@KasieDC) September 2, 2019\n\nNot only has Trump seen the U.S. threatened by Category 5 hurricanes, the strongest classification on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, he\u2019s used nearly the same line before, as CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale pointed out in a tweet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on the existence of Category 5 hurricanes, 2017-2019. pic.twitter.com/IRRny20hfp \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 1, 2019\n\nIn September of 2017, it was Hurricane Irma, which raged through the Caribbean as a Category 5 storm before hitting Florida as a Category 4.\n\nOne year later, Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm. But in remarks on the damage it caused, Trump repeatedly referred to Maria as a Category 5 storm. His facts may have been wrong, but clearly he\u2019s heard of a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nThen, in October of 2018, Hurricane Michael became the first Category 5 storm to hit the contiguous United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Though the storm, which laid waste to the Florida Panhandle, was initially thought to be a Category 4 when it made landfall, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later upgraded it to a Category 5.\n\nAnd Trump was aware of that. This May, he visited Tyndall Air Force Base on the Florida Panhandle and saw firsthand the devastation that Michael caused. \u201cNever heard about Category 5s before,\u201d he said. That was four months ago.", "description": "Last year, a Category 5 storm devastated the Florida Panhandle.
