We cannot just sit back and watch as priceless endangered species are wiped off the face of the earth by our own carelessness and criminality.\u201d\n\nRebecca Newsom from Greenpeace UK said: \u201cThis is the first big test of Boris Johnson\u2019s climate and environmental leadership on the world stage, and he\u2019s heading for a flop.\n\nWorld losing area of forest the size of the UK each year, report finds Read more\n\n\u201cThe collection of pet projects announced here falls desperately short of the radical action and bold vision demanded only last week by millions of kids and grownups in the largest climate protest in history.\u201d\n\nOn protecting wildlife, Newsom said the UK would have a much bigger impact \u201cif it paused trade talks with Brazil until the Amazon is protected while committing to putting environmental and human rights protections at the heart of all future trade deals\u201d.\n\nMike Barrett from WWF UK praised the biodiversity fund and said the innovation money was \u201can important acknowledgment of the scale of the global crisis\u201d.\n\nBut he added: \u201cInvestment in technology is welcome but the government must back this up with trade policies that actively combat climate change and reduce deforestation.\u201d\n\nIn New York, Johnson is set to hold a series of talks likely to touch on Brexit, including with Donald Tusk, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar.\n\nOther bilateral meetings include Donald Trump; the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi; the New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern and Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.", "description": "Announcement comes as PM heads to New York for meeting of UN general assembly", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a2dd37a61a148e202059c4d09b54fb87ec05ce/0_684_1830_1098/master/1830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46fc0a3bf6eb68cb77f42bd2c9010f4a", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
