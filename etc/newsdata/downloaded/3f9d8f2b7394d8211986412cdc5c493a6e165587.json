A fixture of the magazine since its very first issue (in which the puzzle was created by none other than Stephen Sondheim), the print crossword will be available on New York\u2019s website on desktops and mobile devices alike at nymag.com/crossword. A puzzle will go up every Sunday night, with a new one every two weeks timed to the release of the magazine, and a puzzle from the archives on alternate weeks. The puzzle pages will be exempt from New York\u2019s digital subscription product.\n\nNew York\u2019s crossword puzzle is set apart by writer Matt Gaffney\u2019s voice. \u201cGaffney\u2019s puzzle falls right into the great traditions of New York Magazine,\u201d says city editor Christopher Bonanos. \u201cIt\u2019s brainy but also hugely entertaining, it\u2019s impeccably constructed while retaining a sense of loose and funny, and it has a distinctive voice unique to our magazine\u2019s pages. And now to our digital pages as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis marks a new era in the New York Magazine crossword puzzle\u2019s history, and I for one am agog,\u201d says Gaffney, who has been creating the crossword puzzles for the past year and a half. \u201cPuzzlers will now be able to tackle these anywhere \u2014 downtown Oslo, the shores of Lake Erie, atop Mt. Etna, or along the banks of the Elbe.\u201d\n\nIn further good news for cruciverbalists, a spiral-bound book collecting 50 of Cathy Allis\u2019s New York crosswords will be published by Simon & Schuster in June 2019.", "description": "A crossword puzzle will go up every Sunday night, beginning with the puzzle in the March 4\u201317, 2019 issue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/press/2019/03/01/01-nymag-crossword.w1200.h630.jpg"}
