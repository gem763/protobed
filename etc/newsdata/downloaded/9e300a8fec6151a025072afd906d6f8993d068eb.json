James would go on to snag a job as executive vice president of a construction company in 2010, despite having virtually no experience in the field. And only a few months into his tenure, the company would win one of its biggest contracts in its history, a $1.5 billion deal to build affordable homes in Iraq. By pure happenstance, Joe was also the Obama administration\u2019s point man in Iraq at the time.\" The article is titled Wherever Joe Biden Went, Hunter Cashed In. The New York Post article doesn't think Hunter was qualified. \"Burisma, the largest gas company in Ukraine, which also happened to be paying Hunter Biden a $50,000 monthly salary as a board member. By coincidence, Hunter had landed this cushy gig in a foreign country only a few months after the Obama administration began dispatching his father, Joe, to the very same foreign country on a regular basis. There was, of course, absolutely nothing in Hunter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to indicate that he would be a valuable addition to foreign energy interest. He didn\u2019t speak the language, and he had no particular expertise in the energy industry. Oh, he did have one thing, though: his last name.\"", "description": "Kim Kardashian West and husband Kanye West welcomed son Psalm via surrogate on May 10", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7YkWQQxpCkI4s.CmrilsKw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/meredith_videos_131/f1906a13b5132fd5160470c0912900c8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
