They are now completing her final manuscript, \u201cDivided We Fall: Why Consensus Matters,\u201d due for publication by Brookings Institution Press next year.\n\nThe United States was once defined by our confident perception we sometimes called American exceptionalism. Our \u201ccan do\u201d spirit helped us win two world wars, land on the moon, invent much of the global economy, and create a working class that was the envy of the world. Now we wonder whether we are coming apart at the seams.\n\nOur country is divided in ways that bring to mind the great social upheavals of the 1960s, or worse, our great Civil War of the 1860s. The rise of \u201cred state\u201d versus \u201cblue state\u201d hyperpartisanship has now metastasized into increased racism, nationalism, xenophobia, and homophobia that are far too often expressed through violent attacks. A truly great nation worthy of a modern exceptionalism would rise to the challenge to heal the wounds of hate and division by giving all Americans opportunities to participate in growing an economy that offers broadly shared prosperity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen we look deeply at the political and cultural divisions cleaving the United States, we consistently find extremes of economic inequality adding fuel to these fires. Stark differences in current economic security and future prospects bring fear, anxiety, distrust, and resentment. High earners in booming cities are able to separate themselves and their families by participating in the global knowledge economy. There is economic insecurity on the city streets below and in suburban areas, small towns, and rural counties in the parts of the country that have still not seen a recovery, where people struggle to pay monthly bills, pay off debt, and cover the costs of education, health care, and housing, while holding onto hope for a better future.\n\nEconomic inequality has two important dimensions. A plan to tackle both dimensions of vertical and horizontal inequality could go a long way toward uniting our red state and blue state nation, and breaking the hyperpartisan gridlock in Washington. Democrats understand vertical inequality, which is most visible in big cities where extremes of wealth and poverty live in close proximity. Republicans pay more attention to horizontal inequality, which are differences in wealth and growth between the big cities generally on the coasts and the rest of the country in the heartland where agriculture and manufacturing have been in a long term decline.\n\nPolitical progressives have been drawing attention to vertical inequality for years and have developed a solid list of proposals designed to shrink the gap between the small number that earn the most and the large number that earn the least. There are many proposals to increase taxes on the richest Americans, starting with calls to reverse the Republican tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, through ideas to close tax loopholes and proposals to tax families with the greatest wealth.\n\nAt the other end of the income scale, there could be bipartisan agreement to strengthen the social safety net and \u201cmake work pay\u201d by expanding the earned income tax credit. Rather than just giving people money, policies to help people afford more education and technical skills training could lead to better jobs, and transportation assistance would help them get to jobs. Additionally, programs that strengthen child care, preschool, health care, and home health assistance would help to raise pay and professional standards for some of the most important but least well compensated workers in our society, those that take care of the youngest and oldest Americans.\n\nRepublicans have been more consistent in highlighting the pain and resentment in the deindustrializing heartland and rural areas where there has been no economic recovery. Their principal policy\u2014including Opportunity Zones in the 2017 Tax Bill\u2014 if well administered to encourage projects that benefit struggling families in economically challenged communities (rather than just lowering taxes for developers gentrifying those areas), is a small step, but it isn\u2019t enough. A new national economic strategy to bring better paying jobs to the parts of America that have been falling behind is needed and could gain widespread voter support.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis does not have to mean greater power in Washington. Instead, Washington needs to respect and support the success that state and local leaders have had in writing their own turnaround stories. While Washington has been incapacitated by hyper-partisan warfare, cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Nashville and Atlanta (although problems and inequality persists in all of these examples) have been bringing together local leaders; Republicans and Democrats, businesses and labor groups, educators and law enforcement, to put aside their differences and identify relative strengths, develop regional economic strategies, and set priorities for investments to grow local businesses, attract new businesses, and create better paying jobs.\n\nMore recently, many next-level towns like Akron, Louisville, Knoxville, Dubuque, and Huntington WV, have been following the same playbook and gaining traction. Although every story is different, the patterns of success are emerging. Regional economic strategies generally involve investment in four broad areas: 1) education, 2) innovation, 3) infrastructure and 4) healthy communities.\n\nWe must train people for the jobs of today and tomorrow, starting with early childhood education, through grade school and high school, job training academies and community colleges, and on to advanced degrees and technical skills. We need apprenticeships and a culture of life-long learning, so every American has access to the skills needed for better jobs in the modern economy.\n\nWe must support innovation by building bridges between businesses and researchers at local colleges and universities. Many towns are having success with business start-up incubators, and identifying future growth areas such as regenerative agriculture, advanced manufacturing, sustainable energy, and knowledge-based industries.\n\nThere are many reasons for a major new national investment in infrastructure\u2014starting with public safety concerns and annoying traffic jams caused by aging roads and bridges\u2014but there is also a very strong economic case to be made for a broader discussion of necessary investments to improve local productivity and international competitiveness. Different areas will have different priorities, but we must connect wind farms and server farms with a modern smart energy grid. Upgrading freight rails, inland waterways, and seaports will help get manufactured goods to customers. And with some areas of the country still not served by mobile telephone and broadband data networks, we should make it a national priority to ensure that 5G connectivity does not become a new digital divide between urban growth centers and areas with lower population density.\n\nEconomic growth depends on attracting and retaining younger workers and this requires a healthy vibrant community where people want to live and raise a family. Young people want movie theaters, restaurants and bars so most of the mid-sized cities and small towns that are successfully reversing their declining populations have been rebuilding downtown areas, Main Streets, and Riverwalks with better lighting and community policing so people feel safe and business can grow. Regional hospitals, often one of the largest employers in a community, are also key to healthy communities and should be kept open.\n\nHealthy communities also take care of their poor and elderly and this is where efforts to address vertical and horizontal inequality come together. Economists call efforts to address vertical inequality \u201cpeople-based\u201d policies and efforts to address horizontal inequality \u201cplace-based\u201d policies. A new national economic strategy combining both approaches would have broad support and would bring greater inclusiveness and opportunity to the people and places in America that have been falling behind.", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: Alice Rivlin, the first director of the Congressional Budget Office and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, died earlier this year as she was writing this article with her son Allan and his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/wallet_money.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
