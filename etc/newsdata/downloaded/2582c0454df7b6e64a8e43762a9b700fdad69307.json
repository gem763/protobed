She was among a group of residents who attended a pre-planning meeting.\n\nIt comes after South Somerset District Council opted to change the area's status from 'rural settlement' to that of a village, meaning it could support more housing. But residents including Valerie are against the plans.\n\nTemplecombe sits between the A303 at Wincanton to the A30 leading to Yeovil and Salisbury, and the A357 runs through the heart of the village.\n\nAs such, many large vehicles use the village as a cut through and reports of damage to houses or cars are common.\n\nThe council decided that Templecombe could cope with more housing, but many local residents disagree - including Valerie.\n\nShe told the meeting: 'The increase in car pollution, at a time when we are meant to be cutting back on this, and extra traffic is one of the things you hear most from people.\n\nSlades Hill (pictured) in Templecombe is one patch of the village in which developers have already declared an interest\n\nPictured: The plans for Slades Hill in Templecombe, which Valerie Singleton fears will bring more traffic and pollution to the area\n\n'We are used as a cut-through from the A303 to the A30 - and the lorries coming through are terrible.\n\n'Of course new housing is important, and we all realise that - but it had to be done well and in a well thought-out way.'\n\nTerina Worrall added: 'I used to live at the narrowest point in the high street. Our cottage was always being scraped and had the gutter torn off.\n\n'I recall a lorry and a caravan passed, the caravan got squashed and popped its top. It's very narrow but it's now got a pinch point there, but can understand the concerns.'\n\nValerie Singleton (pictured with Blue Peter co-stars Peter Purves, left, and John Noakes, right) attended a pre-planning meeting to air her concerns about the plans\n\nAnd Kelvin Sykes said: 'End the housing free-for-all. It's destroying our, countryside and villages.\n\n'Cheap, shoddy and ugly with no purpose other than to satisfy corrupt and inept council quotas. End this madness.'\n\nTwo property developers, Thales Group and Origin3, have plans for the area which would see new homes built - but nothing has been approved yet.\n\nRobin Cave, who chairs the parish council, said: 'We have no objection to the village expanding per se, but it is just too much.\n\n'With all the applications put in, we could see over 50 per cent growth, and we do not have the infrastructure to cope with that. The school is full and the doctors' surgery is over-subscribed.'\n\nAngry resident David Seares said: 'There is immense concern amongst residents about the impact all the proposed housing developments will have.\n\n'Thales' website states they employ 750 in Templecombe - but only a small percentage of these live here.\n\n'Their car park is daily at capacity and sometimes overflows. Some commute by train.'", "description": "Valerie Singleton, 82, says that developers with her village of Templecombe in their sights risk increasing car pollution in the south Somerset village.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20031070-0-image-a-43_1571741238684.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
