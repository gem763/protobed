He said the carbon tax for large emitters was likely set at $30 per tonne to align with federal regulations, which state the price of carbon must rise to $40 per tonne in 2021 and $50 per tonne in 2022.\n\nMasson is also chief commercial officer at Fractal Systems Inc., which is developing technology to reduce the viscosity of oilsands bitumen, and said the new TIER system is friendlier to the province\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nThe TIER system taxes heavy emitters based on their ability to reduce their emissions by 10 per cent below their own facilities\u2019 average emissions between 2016 and 2018. The previous system, taxed heavy emitters based on their emissions compared to the average emissions profile across their respective industries.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of different reservoirs that we have and they are at different points in their life cycle,\u201d Masson said, noting that different facilities might have different emissions profiles based on when they were built, what they produce or what part of hydrocarbon-bearing formation they are extracting.\n\n\u201cWhat this system does is it accommodates those differences,\u201d he said, because the system allows a company to benchmark against itself.\n\nEnvironmental organizations, however, decried the move away from a carbon price that rewarded companies for reducing their emissions below the industry\u2019s average.\n\n\u201cA sector-based benchmark is better,\u201d Pembina Institute analyst Jan Gorski said, calling the TIER system \u201ca step backwards\u201d from what former premier Rachel Notley implemented while in government.\n\nIn addition, he said the TIER system would not reward companies that have already reduced their emissions effectively.\n\nIn fact, financial analysts covering the oilsands predicted that the lowest emissions facilities in the play would pay more under TIER than under the NDP\u2019s Carbon Competitiveness and Incentive Regulation (CCIR).\n\n\u201cRelative to the CCIR carbon tax, the TIER system would be less financially punitive on less GHG-efficient facilities, while the most GHG-efficient facilities would likely be subject to some tax as opposed to having likely generated some GHG tax credits under the prior CCIR system,\u201d GMP FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn wrote in a research note published Wednesday.\n\nUnder the new system, the most greenhouse-gas-intensive steam-based oilsands facilities will end up paying 33 cents per barrel of oil in the TIER tax, compared with $1.69 per barrel under the CCIR tax \u2013 a reduction of 80 per cent.\n\nHowever, the most efficient steam-based oilsands facilities will pay roughly 13 cents per barrel under the TIER tax, rather than receiving a credit of 32 cents per barrel under the CCIR system.\n\nAs a result, analysts say the most efficient oilsands facilities will end up paying more in tax under TIER than they did under the CCIR system.\n\nFor example, Dunn wrote that Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.\u2019s Athabasca oilsands project is equipped with carbon capture technology and has \u201cthe lowest direct emissions intensity of the upgraded mined projects, will likely be financially worse off under the TIER system than under the old CCIR system.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Environmental organizations, however, decried the move away from a carbon price that rewarded companies for reducing their emissions below the industry\u2019s average", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/cnrl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
