Howard won 43-40. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nAfter two solid seasons starting for FCS Howard, Caylin Newton, Cam\u2019s younger brother, is moving on.\n\nThe junior quarterback announced through Twitter on Tuesday that he will officially enter the transfer portal and leave Howard after graduating from the school next May. Because he redshirted this year, he will have two years of NCAA eligibility remaining.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNewton\u2019s Bison team has opened the season with a record of 1-3, including a blowout 79-0 loss to Maryland to open the season.\n\nTo date, the biggest game of Newton\u2019s career has been his first. As a true freshman making his debut in 2017 against UNLV, Newton led the Bison to a 43-40 win while rushing for 190 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries and contributing 140 yards in the air. With UNLV being favored by 45 points, it was the biggest upset (gambling-wise) in college football history.\n\nNewton has gone on to earn Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) Rookie of the Year honors for his freshman campaign and the MEAC Offensive Player of the Year award last season. He posted 2,629 passing yards, 22 touchdowns and 17 interceptions on 304 attempts as a sophomore, and rushed for 504 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Newton has any FBS interest. Rated a three-star recruit by Rivals in the Class of 2017, he had no FBS offers.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Caylin Newton won his conference's Offensive Player of the Year award last season.
