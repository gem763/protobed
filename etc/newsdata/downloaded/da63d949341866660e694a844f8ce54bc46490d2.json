Don\u2019t do that. Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached,\u201d Kelly said at the conservative Washington Examiner Political Summit. Kelly said he warned the president not to hire a lackey to run his staff. \u201cDon\u2019t hire someone that will just, you know, nod and say, \u2018You know, that\u2019s a great idea Mr. President,\u2019\u201d he told the partisan crowd. \u201c \u2018Because you will be impeached.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt a certain level, Kelly\u2019s comments are self-serving in ways that undermine their credibility. To hear the retired general tell it, he had what it took to steer Trump away from pitfalls, crimes, and impeachable offenses. It\u2019s a strength Kelly apparently believes acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney lacks.\n\nThe trouble is, Kelly\u2019s record doesn\u2019t exactly back up the boast. After all, he was in the West Wing from July 2017 to January 2019, and during that time, the Republican president committed all kinds of misdeeds, as the Mueller Report documented in great detail.\n\nIf Kelly knew just what to do to prevent presidential high crimes and misdemeanors, his efforts fell short.\n\nBut what struck me as truly amazing was the on-the-record response to Kelly\u2019s comments from White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham: \u201cI worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great President.\u201d\n\nNo, seriously, that was her official statement.\n\nPutting aside Kelly\u2019s competence as a White House chief of staff, Grisham\u2019s statement goes a long way toward proving his concerns about Team Trump correct. His point was that the president would benefit from a capable team, filled with sensible officials who have the will and the wherewithal to restrain Trump\u2019s worst instincts.\n\nConfronted with this awkward-but-accurate assessment, the White House responded by pretending Trump\u2019s instincts are without flaw. Kelly just wasn\u2019t smart enough, the argument goes, to fully appreciate the \u201cgenius of our great President.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a quote one might ordinarily expect from North Korea, not the White House. It\u2019s also a quote reinforcing the very concerns Kelly was right to articulate.", "description": "Defending Team Trump against criticisms from John Kelly, the White House issued a statement with a decidedly North Korean tone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/afp_ym0sr_0.jpg?itok=24qCBjhX", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
