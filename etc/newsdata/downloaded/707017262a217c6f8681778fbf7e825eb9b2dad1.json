The trigger, in the end, was news Thursday that the government was planning, among other measures, to impose a tax on WhatsApp calls \u2014 a decision it later withdrew as people began taking to the streets.\n\nIn some cases the demonstrations evolved into riots, as protesters set fire to buildings and smashed window fronts, taking their anger out on politicians they accuse of corruption and decades of mismanagement.\n\nThe protests were the largest since 2015, and could further destabilize a country already on the verge of collapse and with one of the highest debt loads in the world. The unrest could plunge Lebanon into a political crisis with unpredictable repercussions for the economy, which has been in steady decline for the past few years.\n\nSome of the protesters said they would stay in the streets until the government resigns.\n\nTime and again, the protesters shouted \"Revolution!\" and \"The people want to bring down the regime,\" echoing a refrain chanted by demonstrators during that swept the region in 2011.\n\nLebanese demonstrators burn tires during a protest against dire economic conditions, on October 18, 2019 in the northern port city of Tripoli.

The country is corrupt, the garbage is all over the streets and we are fed up with all this,\" said Loris Obeid, a protester in downtown Beirut.\n\nSchools, banks and businesses shut down as the protests escalated and widened in scope to reach almost every city and province. Hundreds of people burned tires on highways and intersections in suburbs of the capital, Beirut, and in northern and southern cities, sending up clouds of black smoke in scattered protests. The road to Beirut's international airport was blocked by protesters, stranding passengers who in some cases were seen dragging suitcases on foot to reach the airport.\n\n\"We are here for the future of our kids. There's no future for us, no jobs at all and this is not acceptable any more. We have shut up for a long time and now it is time to talk,\" Obeid added.\n\nSome protesters threw stones, shoes and water bottles at security forces and scuffled with police. Security forces said at least 60 of its members were injured in the clashes.\n\nTwo Syrian workers died Thursday when they were trapped in a shop that was set on fire by rioters. Dozens of people were injured.\n\nProtesters were also injured.\n\nLebanese demonstrators wave the national flag during a protest against dire economic conditions in downtown Beirut on October 18, 2019.

The small Arab country on the Mediterranean has the third-highest debt level in the world, currently standing at about $86 billion, or 150% of its gross domestic product.\n\nInternational donors have been demanding that Lebanon implement economic changes in order to get loans and grants pledged at the CEDRE economic conference in Paris in April 2018. International donors pledged $11 billion for Lebanon but they sought to ensure the money is well spent in the corruption-plagued country.\n\nDespite tens of billions of dollars spent since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon still has crumbling infrastructure including daily electricity cuts, trash piles in the streets and often sporadic, limited water supplies from the state-owned water company.", "description": "The protests were the largest since 2015 and could further destabilize a country already on the verge of collapse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/1b864db1-c008-44f1-9cdb-3c8d7a4ab93c/thumbnail/1200x630/7bcfcfe9442ec92e0fc2de412e7a10ae/lebanon3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
