Moreno says the fuel subsidies, in place for four decades, had distorted the economy and cost $60 billion.", "description": "Measure to eliminate fuel subsidies sparked worst unrest in years, resulting in 477 arrests", "authors": ["Reuters In Quito"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621d25cec7f4bd57efce89131de846ca0ddcb323/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c721cc45e2dad145cac7bd427ec5e9ab", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
