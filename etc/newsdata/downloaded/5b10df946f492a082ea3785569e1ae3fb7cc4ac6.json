And by \u201crevealed,\u201d we mean one-by-one, on Twitter \u2014 a drip-feed of over 300 movies and shows.\n\nThe reveal started with a rather ominous tweet that began, \u201cIt. Is. Time.\u201d You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Disney had completely snapped and was ready to begin world domination. Instead it started a thread of truly epic proportions, with each title to be added to Disney+, fittingly starting with the progenitor of the whole Disney Princess schtick, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nIt. Is. Time. From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Mandalorian, check out basically everything coming to #DisneyPlus in the U.S. on November 12.

If you ever for a moment doubted that Disney owns everything under the rays of our yellow sun, check this thread.\n\nWe have the popular:\n\nThe not-so-popular but still recognizable:\n\nRanging to the more obscure:\n\nAdventures of the Gummi Bears (1985) pic.twitter.com/cwZDGWBHR9 \u2014 Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019\n\nDown to\u2026 wait, is this even real?\n\nY\u2019all are just making shit up, aren\u2019t you?\n\nDavy Crockett and the River Pirates (1956) pic.twitter.com/A1CiLSxm00 \u2014 Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019\n\nIf you took a drink every time someone in the responses to these tweets uttered the words \u201cchildhood\u201d or \u201cnostalgia,\u201d you\u2019d be dead in under an hour.\n\nAll in all, Disney revealed a damned cavalcade of classics that\u2019ll be available on Day One. If my word doesn\u2019t convince you, check out Disney\u2018s trailer showing off most of its launch titles. It\u2019s three goddamned hours long:\n\nIt also showed off some of its new titles that are coming to bolster the old favorites, including The Mandalorian, High School Musical: The Series, and The World According to Jeff Goldblum.\n\nDisney+ is destined to survive on the strength and breadth of its back-catalog. Is the complete life works of Uncle Walt and his cult of personality enough to compete with the likes of Netflix? Well, that\u2019s a matter of preference. But speaking strictly for myself, I know I\u2019ll probably find more to watch from a quick recon of Disney+ than I will after hours of aimless browsing on Netflix.\n\nStill, there are a few notable titles missing. The Avengers is absent, though that\u2019s probably just an oversight \u2014 every other Marvel property is around. Up is also missing, in case you wanted to cry first thing upon logging in. The first National Treasure isn\u2019t there, though its sequel is (both are particular guilty pleasures of mine). And of course Disney\u2018s deepest disgrace, Song of the South, is not here.\n\nFrankly, seeing the company\u2019s entire history laid out chronologically like this, I see plenty more that probably should have remained in the vault:", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F11%2FDisney-Plus.jpg&signature=e7082e565f491e9ace84875689b96fc5", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
