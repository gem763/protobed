Here\u2019s how those demonstrations played out across the country. 3:38\n\nThunberg began weekly sit-ins outside the Swedish legislature last year, which over the course of a few months grew into a global phenomenon. One week ago, millions of people around the world marched in protest against governments not taking drastic climate action. Another day of global protest took place Friday, including in more than 85 cities and towns in Canada.\n\nFrom St. John's to Vancouver, and as far north as Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, tens of thousands of Canadians came out in force. They came in strollers and on skateboards, on bikes and in army boots, wearing knee braces and leaning on crutches and canes. From babies to baby boomers, grandkids to grandparents, they filled parks and the lawns of legislatures and Parliament, toting papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Earths and trees, some with full potted plants on their backs.\n\nHuge crowd of thousands, mostly children and teens for historic Manitoba#climatestrike - the biggest protest they\u2019ve likely seen in Winnipeg in their lifetimes. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mbyouth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mbyouth</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatestrikemanitoba?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#climatestrikemanitoba</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WWrM7QpDww\">pic.twitter.com/WWrM7QpDww</a> \u2014@EmilyBrass\n\nTheir message was clear: bolder action is urgently needed to save the planet from the crisis of climate change.\n\nIn Halifax, several thousand people marched through the streets and ended their protest at the headquarters of Nova Scotia Power. In Toronto, thousands more filled the front lawn of the provincial legislature and the streets around it.\n\nIn Ottawa, the crowd size exceeded most Canada Day celebrations, filling the streets for more than a dozen city blocks as the marchers wound their way through downtown from city hall to Parliament Hill. Some added a truly Canadian flavour by putting their placards on hockey sticks and insisting their chants be delivered in both official languages.\n\nGreta Thunberg praises protesters as hundreds of thousands expected for Montreal climate march<a href=\"https://t.co/Dt34NVeACH\">https://t.co/Dt34NVeACH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/U31kETZpJ4\">pic.twitter.com/U31kETZpJ4</a> \u2014@Steverukavina\n\nMany of those who came out called Thunberg their inspiration.\n\n\"I think she has revolutionized how we look at activism,\" said Pascal Morimanno, a 17-year-old marching in Fredericton. \"She is one person but there are millions of youth out here now because of her. She is the face of new activism.\"\n\n\"This movement has been built around children fighting for their future,\" added Roy Bateman, a 13-year-old marching in Toronto. \"[We're] also fighting for those who are less fortunate and also those who will be more harshly affected by climate change.\"\n\nHe said politicians could address climate change but are making the wrong choices.\n\n\"It's a matter of priorities,\" he said.\n\nWatch highlights from climate rallies across Canada:\n\nGreta Thunberg says student protesters should take it as a compliment that powerful men including U.S. President Donald Trump have tried to 'silence' the environmental movement. 1:14\n\nThousands of protesters in Vancouver reached the final destination in their three kilometre march from city hall, plugging West Georgia Street in the city's downtown.\n\nAmong them were the five children of the Duprat family of nearby Lions Bay, who brought their parents to the rally.\n\n\"It hurts me because I've only lived on this Earth for so little time and I don't want to end it that quick,\" said Nalia, 11.\n\nBetty Kidanewold, 14, travelled with friends from the Vancouver suburb of Surrey to join the march, saying they're tired of seeing world leaders deny climate change on TV or fail to act with urgency.\n\n\"If we're going to take a stand, it's got to be now,\" she said.\n\nDemonstrators participate in a climate strike in Vancouver on Friday. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nNot everyone in Canada backed the events. In the Alberta capital, several thousand people protested on the lawn of the provincial legislature, but were measured in criticizing things like the Trans Mountain oil pipeline.\n\nPaula Camacho, a 25-year-old student at The King's University in Edmonton, said she didn't have a particular stance on expanding the pipeline, but added that other energy sources are also needed.\n\n\"I know there are so many people who depend (on oil) job-wise,\" Camacho said. \"But I think it's good to have these conversations and talk about something that is more sustainable for everybody.\"\n\nInside the legislature, some people put posters in their windows saying they loved Canadian oil and gas.\n\nProtesters gather at Churchill Square to begin a march to the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton on Friday. (Travis McEwan/CBC)\n\nComing as it has in the midst of Canada's federal election campaign, many candidates and four of the six mainstream party leaders joined events in their cities Friday. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Green Leader Elizabeth May, and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet all marched in Montreal, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh marched in Victoria.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer said there would be Conservative representation at the Montreal march, but he was not personally attending any events. In fact, he flew over many of them Friday as he made his way on his campaign plane from Montreal to Vancouver for an announcement in Coquitlam, B.C.\n\nBernier, the only national party leader to deny climate change is a crisis caused by human activity, is campaigning in his home riding of Beauce in Quebec.\n\nProtesters gather outside the Ontario legislature in Toronto for the climate strike on Friday. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\n\nTrudeau marched with his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, and two of their three children, Xavier, 11, and Ella-Grace, 10, as well as several Quebec candidates. He was met with some cheers and some hostility. Several protesters shouted at him that he was a hypocrite because he is promising climate action but expanding a pipeline to extract more oil from Alberta.\n\nOne protester attempted to throw an egg at Trudeau but was promptly wrestled to the ground by his security detail. Xavier appeared visibly upset, and Trudeau stopped to comfort him for a few moments.\n\nTrudeau heckled\n\nJaggi Singh, one of Canada's best-known anti-globalization activists and a self-proclaimed anarchist, followed Trudeau along the march route, yelling at him for buying the Trans Mountain pipeline.\n\n\"As a man born in blackface, I denounce you,\" Singh shouted at Trudeau, referencing the recent revelation that Trudeau put on blackface makeup several times when he was younger.\n\nTrudeau smiled and waved through most of the event, shouting, \"Thank you for being here\" at those who decried him, while his supporters around him chanted in French, \"Moving forward for the planet.\"\n\nThis is what thousands of people protesting in Halifax looks like.<br>Lots of chants about all levels of Cdn government needing to wake up & the power is with the people.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FridaysForFuture?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FridaysForFuture</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateStrike?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ClimateStrike</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ubUrw4aPoC\">pic.twitter.com/ubUrw4aPoC</a> \u2014@cbccolleenjones\n\nEarlier Friday, Trudeau sat down with Thunberg for a private meeting. Trudeau's quest for re-election next month depends heavily on convincing Canadians that his party's climate plan is enough to do Canada's part for the planet; his rivals on the left argue the Trans Mountain deal undermines any climate action he is taking. Thunberg said she told Trudeau the same thing she tells all world leaders.\n\n\"Just listen to the science,\" she said.\n\nMarches already took place earlier Friday in dozens of countries around the world including in India, the Netherlands and Italy. Thunberg said she believes 60,000 people took part in marches in her home country of Sweden, while 300,000 marched in New Zealand, more than three per cent of the country's entire population.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Canadians attended marches across the country to\u00a0urge\u00a0 government and corporate leaders to address climate change.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300731.1569615067!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/climate-strike-20190927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
