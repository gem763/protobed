He messed it up anyway.\u201d in which he appeared to join in on the left\u2018s attempts to dismiss President Donald Trump\u2019s latest victory \u2014 the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nIn his piece, Boot seemed bothered by President Trump\u2019s characterization of the ISIS leader \u201cdying like a coward,\u201d and implied that al-Baghdadi\u2019s suicide was somehow an act of bravery, by suggesting in his piece that the president\u2019s assessment of the terrorist\u2019s death was incorrect.\n\nBoot\u2019s \u2014 now-deleted \u2014 statement implying that al-Baghdadi did not die a coward read as follows:\n\nThe assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\n\nThe columnist\u2019s assessment of the ISIS leader \u2014 who blew himself up along with three children \u2014 was met with a plethora of backlash, prompting Boot to retract the sentence, as well as insist that he never meant to describe al-Baghdadi as a courageous individual.\n\n\u201cAn earlier version of this column included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward because he blew himself up,\u201d wrote Boot in his update to his column. \u201cThe line was removed because it unintentionally conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous.\u201d\n\nBoot\u2019s initial evaluation of al-Baghdadi\u2019s suicide arrived on the heels of a separate WaPo gaffe, in which the newspaper referred to the ISIS terrorist as an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d in their obituary, before ultimately changing it.\n\n\u201cRegarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly,\u201d tweeted WaPo\u2018s Vice President of Communications Kristine Coratti Kelly on Sunday.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Following backlash, Washington Post columnist Max Boot deleted a sentence in which he argued the ISIS leader did not die a \"coward.\"", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-613364994-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
