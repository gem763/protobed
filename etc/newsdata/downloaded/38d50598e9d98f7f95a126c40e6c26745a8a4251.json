Now she's the inspiration for a new picture book called, Greta and the Giants, to be released in November 2019.\n\nBritish author Zo\u00eb Tucker and American illustrator Zoe Persico are collaborating on the project for Frances Lincoln Children's Book Publishers. Thunberg's team calls it \"a valuable and interesting project.\"\n\nThe story follows a girl named Greta, who lives in a beautiful forest. When giants begin to destroy her home, the animals beg her to take action.\n\nA small portion of the proceeds for the book will go to an environmental advocacy group called 350.org. The book will be printed on 100 per cent recycled paper.\n\nThunberg first made global headlines in 2018 when she refused to go to school in the weeks leading up to Sweden's general election to highlight the impact of climate change. Her school strike prompted other students around the world, including Canada, to follow suit.\n\nShe's since met the Pope, spoken at Davos and attended anti-coal protests in Germany.\n\nThunberg is now taking a year off school to attend the events in North and South America and meet with some of the people most affected by climate change. She recently completed a two-week journey across the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 from Plymouth, England to Brooklyn, New York \u2014 on a zero-emissions sailboat.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press.", "description": "Greta and the Giants will tell the story of a girl who lives in a forest that is being destroyed by giants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269999.1567612307!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/greta-thunberg.png"}
