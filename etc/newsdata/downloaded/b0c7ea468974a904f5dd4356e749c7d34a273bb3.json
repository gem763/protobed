If Boris Johnson tries to defy the law and defy both the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments by crashing out of the EU without a deal \u2013 then we are calling on the Scottish courts to uphold the law.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He must be reminded that he is not above the law.\u201d\n\nMr Maugham added: \u201cThis is a very simple case. Our supreme parliament \u2013 elected from 46 million \u2013 has directed the prime minister \u2013 elected from 160,000 \u2013 to seek an extension. That is the law, and no man or woman is above it.\u201d\n\nNo ruling in the case is expected before next week.", "description": "Boris Johnson today faces a further legal challenge to his Brexit plans, just 10 days after his humiliating defeat at the hands of the Supreme Court.
