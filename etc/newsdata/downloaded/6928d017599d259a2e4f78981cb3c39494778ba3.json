(Back in May, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general said there was no evidence that Biden or his son broke the law.)\n\nAfter the CNN host noted that Giuliani was obviously doing this for political purposes to serve his client\u2014Democratic lawmakers are currently probing Giuliani\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2014Giuliani flip-flopped on his position within 30 seconds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that\u2019s what Biden said to the Ukraine,\u201d Cuomo responded to Giuliani\u2019s claim that then-Vice President Biden bribed the Ukrainian president to squash an investigation into Hunter. \u201cDid you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d Giuliani answered. \u201cI asked Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never asked anything about Hunter Biden, you never asked anything about Joe Biden to the prosecutor?\u201d Cuomo asked, prompting Giuliani to assert that he had only asked why the case into Hunter\u2019s company was dismissed.\n\n\u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden,\u201d Cuomo shot back.\n\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Giuliani exclaimed, causing a befuddled Cuomo to shout: \u201cYou just said you didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe rest of the 30-minute marathon went pretty much down this road. Giuliani, performing for an audience of one, used much of his time to take pointed personal shots at Cuomo, calling him a \u201csellout\u201d while constantly evading the anchor\u2019s questions.\n\nDespite repeatedly telling Giuliani they were getting nowhere in the segment and expressing his frustration over the former mayor\u2019s tactics, Cuomo allowed the interview to go on and on and on. Even when they were supposedly wrapping it up, the two continued to go at each other for what seemed an eternity.\n\n\u201cYou are not fair and impartial,\u201d Giuliani seethed after telling Cuomo he\u2019d never give him documents that prove his allegations against Biden because the CNN host is \u201cthe enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are totally biased and your network is a creature of a Democratic National Committee,\u201d Giuliani added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d Cuomo responded. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed for you. Have a good night.\u201d\n\nShortly after his battle with Cuomo and another (much friendlier) interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Giuliani took to Twitter to essentially admit that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cA President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMaybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn\u2019t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media.\u201d", "description": "\u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d Giuliani said when asked if he\u2019d asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and family. Thirty seconds later, he changed his tune: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568945987/cuomo-prime-time_11_daryxg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
