Such laws are being advanced in various states as a way to begin to deal more effectively with America\u2019s burgeoning mass shooting toll.\n\nFormer Marine Shane Kohfield \u2014 in a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat with a knife strapped to his shoulder at the time \u2014 allegedly made the threat on a loudspeaker outside the home of Portland\u2019s mayor in July.\n\nWithin days, agents seized Kohfield\u2019s weapons. They relied on the red flag law that went into effect early this year that allowed them to temporarily take possession of the guns even though Kohfield hadn\u2019t committed a crime, the newspaper reported. The statute allows law enforcement, family members or roommates to petition a judge for an \u201cextreme risk protection order\u201d that bars a targeted individual from gun possession.\n\nPhil Lemman, Oregon\u2019s acting deputy state court administrator, said Kohfield surrendered five guns, including an AR-15.\n\nKohfield, who served two tours of duty in Iraq, was also taken to a veterans hospital in Portland, where he spent 20 days. He was not charged with a crime \u2014 but he was also not allowed to attend the August demonstration staged by the white nationalist Proud Boys, which drew antifascist counterprotesters.\n\nKohfield, 32, told The Oregonian that he understands why his guns were taken and why he was transported to a hospital. \u201cI looked unhinged,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked dangerous and have the training to be dangerous,\u201d Kohfield added, but said that he did not intend to hurt anyone.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment specifically on Kohfield\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThe Portland Joint Terrorism Task Force\u2019s role is to assess, address and mitigate any given threat against the people of Oregon appropriately,\u201d a spokesperson for the bureau\u2019s Portland office told The Oregonian in an email Friday. Sometimes that involves efforts to \u201cdivert a person before a significant violent crime occurs.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: A prior version of this story referred to Iran when it should have referred to Iraq.", "description": "Agents relied on Oregon's \"red flag\" law to take proactive measures to head off potential violence, The Oregonian reports.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6a13f1250000ad0000de33.jpeg?cache=9pkov2czwj&ops=1778_1000"}
