I had a lot of questions and I wanted to get to know him for who he is now.\n\n'What was I like as a kid? Those kind of questions.

'I had a feeling it was paparazzi, but I just kept going. The show must go on.'\n\nThose photos appeared in a tabloid a few weeks later.\n\nAnd although it was a 'positive article', she said the incident put 'distance between me and my classmates.'\n\n'It's hard when everyone talks about you and you're not talking about yourself,' she said.
