He is personally invested in the success of both countries. In fact, that\u2019s his job. Geoffrey Pyatt is the U.S. ambassador to Greece.\n\n\u201cGiannis is probably the biggest thing that\u2019s happening these days in U.S.-Greece relations,\u201d Pyatt said of Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Greek star of the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be interesting how that plays out.\u201d\n\nIt will also be interesting because Team USA hasn\u2019t been this vulnerable since 2006, the last time they lost a game in the Olympics or World Cup. The country that beat them? It was Greece. That loss came on the heels of the U.S. turning a bronze medal in 2004 into a national humiliation. The country that hosted those Olympics? It was also Greece.\n\nBut this ominous history is not the reason Greece vs. the U.S. on Saturday morning will be so interesting. The real intrigue here isn\u2019t about things that have happened before. It exists because of something that\u2019s never happened before: The best player is not playing for Team USA.\n\nThat\u2019s why Greece vs. the U.S. could be the most compelling matchup of this tournament. It\u2019s the NBA\u2019s most valuable player against a team of NBA players. It\u2019s also the closest thing to Giannis Antetokounmpo against the world as this world might ever see.\n\nThat it\u2019s even happening in the first place is a historical anomaly. Antetokounmpo is the first reigning MVP to challenge Team USA with teammates who give him a legitimate chance to win. FIBA basketball is more like the NCAA tournament than the NBA. The games are physical, intense and often unpredictable. And it\u2019s extraordinarily useful to have the best player on the floor.\n\nHis team isn\u2019t the betting favorite to beat the U.S. (Serbia) or the country that has come torturously close to upsetting the Americans (Spain), but it would surprise absolutely nobody if Greece became the first country to beat Team USA on a stage like this since Greece.\n\nGreece's Giannis Antetokounmpo, center, tries to handle the ball through Brazil's Alex Garcia and Vitor Benite.

The only other Greek player on an NBA roster is Thanasis Antetokounmpo, his brother, and he\u2019s spent the last two seasons playing for Panathinaikos in Athens, where his coach, Rick Pitino, had more NBA experience than his teammates. But the presence of Giannis Antetokounmpo alone might be enough. That\u2019s because every player on the team, even the ones who are not members of the Antetokounmpo family, benefit from his transcendence.\n\nThe best way to understand his effect may be to think about Antetokounmpo as if he is a condiment. He is the tzatziki of basketball.\n\n\u201cGiannis is like this secret sauce that gets added to the Greek squad and they all play better,\u201d Pyatt said.\n\nGreece also lost this week to a Brazil team starring Anderson Varejao and Leandro Barbosa, which was not the most encouraging outcome, considering Varejao and Barbosa washed out of the NBA two years ago. Antetokounmpo took only one shot in the fourth quarter. This felt like roughly a billion shots too few. Things got so bleak for the Greeks that Brazil\u2019s coach bragged about stopping the world\u2019s most unstoppable player after the game and claimed that someone named Alex Garcia had \u201ckicked his ass.\u201d Alex Garcia is 39 years old and played his last NBA game in 2004.\n\nBut there are two sides to every upset. This one would be as much about Greece as the U.S.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmp of Greece reacts during a match against the Dominican Republic.

But the basketball world isn\u2019t the same as it was in 1992 when the Dream Team swaggered its way to global domination. It\u2019s flatter. The Americans lost in 2002, 2004 and 2006, and they were challenged despite winning the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics. They can\u2019t assume every competition will be a piece of cake or else they\u2019ll find themselves eating a large heaping of crow.\n\nBut even the national teams that make them sweat are typically built around generations of players who\u2019d been together since they were kids\u2014not a singular force like Antetokounmpo. Team USA always had the most talent and the most talented player. Except that won\u2019t be true on Saturday. The Americans are no longer so American. This particular Team US is defined by who\u2019s not playing: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving are still enjoying their summer vacations.\n\nThe Americans still have an enviable collection of starpower, the World Cup\u2019s deepest roster and the tournament\u2019s two best guards in Kemba Walker and Donovan Mitchell, but there was cause for concern even before they learned Jayson Tatum wouldn\u2019t play against Greece with a sprained ankle. They had won 78 consecutive international games heading until they lost an exhibition to Australia last month, and they would have lost to Turkey this week if Turkey hadn\u2019t picked the last 10 seconds of a one-point game in overtime as the right time to miss four straight free throws.\n\nWhich brings us to this peculiar matchup between a favorite that\u2019s oddly susceptible and an underdog with an improbable advantage.\n\nThe only other time the U.S. and Greece could play again is if they meet in the World Cup finals\u2014this is still pool play, not the knockout round, so a loss won\u2019t eliminate either team\u2014but there are some people in Athens who aren\u2019t taking any chances. At the beginning of last week, there were already plans to screen the game in the U.S. embassy. It won\u2019t be the first time that Antetokounmpo makes an appearance there. He visited this summer with his mother and brothers. \u201cHe insisted on coming in, waiting in line and going through the security protocols just like everybody else,\u201d Pyatt said.\n\nNow the Greeks are banking on Antetokounmpo doing some of the things that nobody else can do. But whether that will be enough to beat the U.S. was not something that Pyatt was willing to predict.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a diplomatic challenge,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cThe best team will win.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Can Greece and Giannis Antetokounmpo beat Team USA?
