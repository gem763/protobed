At the time he was threatened by the culprits and his home was pelted with eggs.\n\nMrs Badru, who lived with her son until his death, said: 'He was wearing caps to cover his face and any time he wanted to go out I would have to go out and check if there was anyone in the compound or in the garden and then he would go.'\n\nTo escape the initial threats, Mr Badru went to the south-west of England to study for A Levels and a degree, returning to London in 2016 and calling himself 'Prince' in an attempt to hide his identity.\n\nHis mother said she found it 'difficult' watching him hide away and added that she felt she did not have power and wished she had the money to get him a house in a safer area.\n\nDenton O\u2019Neil (left) was jailed for life for the gang rape in 2007, after Mr Badru (right) testified against the group in court\n\nPolice are still investigating the motive for Mr Badru's death, with one line of inquiry being the death threats sent by members of the gang and another being the string of relationships he had with different women.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh who is leading the case said the silence 'is not going to stop the case from progressing, because we're trying to get justice for Abraham and his family'.\n\n'It is astonishing there are people out there who clearly know exactly what happened to Abraham that night on the 25th of March. They know who is responsible; they know where the gun is and they know why Abraham was shot,' he said.\n\nTributes on Ferncliff Road in Hackney, where Abraham Badru was shot.

I have no other child.'\n\nOn the day he died, Mr Badru had been shopping, before collecting a takeaway and seeing his father and step-sister.\n\nHe then visited a woman between 10.20pm and 10.40pm before driving home. During the journey he was on the phone to a second woman for 44 minutes, and was still on the call at 11.11pm when he was shot.\n\nMr Badru had changed his plans at the last minute and detectives are trying to find out who would have known where he would be at the time he died.\n\nAn 18-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in November and released under investigation.", "description": "Ronke Badru revealed that her son, Abraham, would hide his face after police gave him a bravery award for his heroism when he sent nine would-be rapists to jail after stopping an attack in east London.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/07/20167616-0-image-a-18_1571983318483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
