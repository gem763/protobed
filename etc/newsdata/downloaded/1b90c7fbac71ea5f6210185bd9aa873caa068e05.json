She is pictured (left) during a community event with some of the friends she made at the complex after she moved in back in May 2018\n\nOverture Fair Ridge (pictured) sent Cruey an eviction notice on September 16, ordering her to move out by October 17\n\nCruey became emotional when asked about the email by the Washington Post this month.\n\n'I don't appreciate them sending notes about me and lies about me,' she said as she wiped away tears.\n\nShe insisted that her friends at the complex baked the cookies and gave them to her.\n\nShe added that the Mix and Mingle event was at 4.30pm - which was too late for her to eat them - so she shared them with two neighbors the following day.\n\nBy traditional landlord standards, Cruey is a model tenant - she pays her rent on time, keeps her home tidy and gets along well with her neighbors\n\nThree months after the original email came, Cruey got another one on September 16 with a letter titled: 'Notice of Lease Termination.'\n\nThe letter stated that Cruey's violation was 'not remediable' and ordered her to move out by October 17 - Thursday.\n\nIt warned that if she refused to do so, the landlord would take legal action against her.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Cruey hadn't packed a single item in her apartment as she told the Post she doesn't want to leave.\n\nThe 83-year-old, who has five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, moved into the complex, where she pays $2,000 per month, in May 2018.\n\nShe said she had wanted to stay at the home in Prince George County that she shared with her late Army veteran husband Harry until his death in 2015, but her daughters convinced her to move so that she could be closer to family and live in a community that would keep her active.\n\n'I adjusted to it,' Cruey said. 'And I'd be happy to stay here the rest of my life. If it takes negotiation, whatever it takes, I'd like to stay right where I am.'\n\nCruey's daughters convinced her to move into the complex for retirees after her husband Harry (pictured together) died in 2015\n\nThe lease termination letter came four days after Cruey met with a community manager about Fairfax County's Affordable Dwelling Unit rental program, which offers reduced rent to low- and moderate-income households.\n\nThe letter claimed that Cruey 'refused direct instruction to leave a private meeting'.\n\n'After being instructed to leave, you behaved in a loud and obnoxious manner, and you physically assaulted the community manager by grabbing her wrist,' it read.\n\nCruey explained that after she was told that the reduced rent was only available for people already enrolled in the rental program, she wanted to stay to find out whether she was eligible.\n\nShe swore that she never grabbed anyone in the meeting.\n\nCruey received an eviction notice on September 16 that accused her of 'physically assaulting' a community manager at a meeting four days earlier - which she denies having done\n\nCruey's daughter Sandra said the family has reached out to the owner of the apartment complex, Greystar, about resolving the issue so that her mother won't have to move. She said no one at Greystar has responded.\n\nWhen asked about Cruey's situation by the Post, Greystar issued this statement: 'While it is our policy not to discuss individual residents, leases or alleged lease violations, it is our practice to respond to resident concerns and enforce our community rules for the quiet enjoyment of all residents.'\n\nA former resident at Overture told the Post that this isn't the first time a resident has received an unreasonable lease violation.\n\nThe woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, claimed that she'd seen tenants reprimanded for cursing or taking an extra pork sausage at the complex's free breakfast.\n\nIf Cruey does end up being evicted, she will move back to the home she shared with her late husband or will stay with one of her daughters. She is seen with family in a Facebook photo\n\nCruey said she intends to fight the eviction and will do whatever it takes to stay in her apartment.\n\nShe is in the process of filing a complaint against Overture with Fairfax County.\n\n'I don't want them doing this to my friends one at a time when they come up for a new lease,' she said.\n\n'As long as I'm fighting, I can survive. The day I'm not fighting, I will go under.'\n\nSandra Cruey said that if her mother does lose the apartment, she can move back into her old home, which has not yet been sold, or will stay with one of her daughters.\n\nShe said she hopes it doesn't come down to that, and issued a warning to other families with aging loved ones.\n\n'I want my mother to stay, but if she can't, I want other people to know they need to be careful before they sell their parents' property,' she said.\n\n'You might think you found a great place, but things might change.'", "description": "Elsie Cruey received a notice about her apparent lease violation back in June, warning her that she could soon lose her one-bedroom at the Overture Fair Ridge complex in Fairfax, Virginia.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/19/19853184-0-image-a-15_1571338783383.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
