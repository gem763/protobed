Apparently it was \u2018old school\u2019.\n\nAnd in this way, we millennials were quickly banished to the back of the shelf, along with grumpy baby boomers calling us snowflakes.\n\nAs we get closer to entering 2020, we make the sobering realisation that the first of the 90s kids will be turning 30.\n\nYikes, we\u2019re old. And nothing makes us feel older than when the young \u2018uns brush us in with the baby boomers and Gen Xers.\n\nGeneration Z has been doing that with one cutting phrase: \u2018ok boomer\u2019.\n\nJudging by the words, you\u2019d think the dig is reserved to the generations preceding millennials but these youngsters have been conflating us all.\n\nAnything that\u2019s deemed condescending or opposed to their beliefs might be met with the retort \u2018ok boomer\u2019, usually reserved for anyone over 30.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not that old\u2019 you might protest. But when you consider that the oldest millennial is 38 (the youngest 23), it does seem pretty old to a 17-year-old born in 2006.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut no one (aged 30+) is above facing the retort. Even Barack Obama was trolled with the very phrase while advising youngsters against cancel culture.\n\nThe age range for baby boomers, Gen X, millennials, Gen Z Baby Boomers are born between 1946 and 1964 and are called so because after WWII there was a huge surge in the birth rate Generation X includes anyone born between 1965 and 1980. Millennials are those who are born between 1981 and 2000. Generation Z is anyone born after 2000.\n\nAs with most things enjoyed by these digital natives, the phrase was conceived on the internet. It\u2019s been scribbled in notebooks, pumpkins and high school pictures in America.\n\nThe popularity endures as it seems to be Generation Z\u2019s go-to retort to dismiss older people who don\u2019t understand their passions, whether it\u2019s climate change, mental health or Peppa Pig.\n\n\u2018Ok boomer\u2019 is most prolific on video-sharing app Tik-Tok where it\u2019s enjoyed in artworks, audios, and makeup tutorials.\n\nOne teenager who\u2019s designed merchandise (the last stage of the meme cycle) told the New York Times what the words mean.\n\n\u2018The older generations grew up with a certain mindset, and we have a different perspective,\u2019 said Shannon O\u2019Connor, 19.\n\n\u2018A lot of them don\u2019t believe in climate change or don\u2019t believe people can get jobs with dyed hair, and a lot of them are stubborn in that view. Teenagers just respond \u201cOk, boomer\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like, we\u2019ll prove you wrong, we\u2019re still going to be successful because the world is changing.\u2019\n\nWith young people becoming more and more involved in social affairs on topics such as global warming and the political landscape, it might be a good time to start listening to their criticisms of the status quo.\n\nLest we be grouped with baby boomers (sorry not sorry).\n\nMORE: Teacher keeps a list of \u2018Generation Z\u2019 slang words and honestly, we stan\n\nMORE: Care home residents give daily advice to the younger generation and it\u2019s adorable\n\nMORE: Forget millennials and Gen Z, the rise of \u2018Generation Alpha\u2019 is on the horizon\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Generation Z has been using the phrase as a retort to baby boomers and millennials who just don't get it.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93949269_1572443299.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
