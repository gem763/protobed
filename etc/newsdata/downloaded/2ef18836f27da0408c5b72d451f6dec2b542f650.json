Even to an offensive lineman coming out of Wyoming, Bill Callahan had a reputation. There would be discipline and demands, to be sure, but the Redskins\u2019 offensive line coach had a wealth of football knowledge that he could impart to his players. So, what\u2019s a little yelling?\n\nBut then Roullier showed up for rookie mini-camp.\n\nCallahan, knees bent to observe his linemen up close, barked \u201cGo!\u201d at the top of his lungs. As Roullier completed one drill, Callahan quickly moved onto the next. Go. Go. Go.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fully describe until you\u2019re actually here,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019re experiencing truly what he is.\u201d\n\nWhen he recalls this instance, Roullier\u2019s tone isn\u2019t critical. Instead, he sounds thankful. Those grueling days, he said, taught him right away how tough you have to be to play in the NFL, how fast it moves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for good reason,\u201d Roullier said.\n\nOver the past few days, the rest of the Redskins\u2019 roster has started to learn how precise and demanding Callahan can be in lead up to Sunday\u2019s game against the Miami Dolphins. Since replacing Jay Gruden, the 63-year-old interim coach has re-arranged the format of practice. The music that typically plays after the team\u2019s stretch is gone. Players disperse to their drills. They run sprints after practice.\n\nEarlier this week, Callahan admitted taking over the Redskins is \u201cdifferent territory for me.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Callahan has been a head coach \u2014 he spent two years at the helm of the Oakland Raiders and another four in college at the University of Nebraska \u2014 but it has been more than 10 years.\n\nCallahan, though, never stopped thinking about his days as a head coach. He pondered what he could learn from those situations, what he could do differently the next time around. Even as a position coach, Callahan said he\u2019d wonder what he would do if he were the head coach instead.\n\nThe reflection taught him patience.\n\n\u201cI think that just comes with age,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI\u2019m just more patient, and I think coaching linemen (creates) that patience. \u2026 You can improve a player if you just try to find what it is he\u2019s all about. And then try to find that avenue to connect with him and create that relationship so they can be successful.\u201d\n\nCallahan says he\u2019s at the \u201ctail end\u201d of his career. At 63, he\u2019s now the fourth-oldest head coach in the NFL \u2014 trailing only Pete Carroll (68), Bruce Arians (67) and Bill Belichick (67).\n\nTo players inside the Redskins\u2019 locker room, Callahan comes off as \u201cold school.\u201d\n\nLinebacker Jon Bostic smiled and started laughing, noting those types of coaches have certain ways of saying things to get a player\u2019s attention.\n\nDefensive lineman Jonathan Allen said Callahan stuck out as a \u201cguy that would fit into Alabama very well,\u201d citing his mentality and work ethic.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very passionate, energetic coach who\u2019s going to bring the physicality every day,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of team we\u2019re going to be on Sundays.\u201d\n\nIn five-plus seasons, Gruden also stressed the importance of being physical, wanting his teams to dominate inside the trenches. But he went about practice differently, leading to criticisms the coach was too \u201claid back.\u201d\n\nCritics viewed Gruden\u2019s teams as sloppy, and Washington has committed the second-most penalties this season. Former receiver Pierre Garcon tweeted the Redskins needs a coach who is \u201caccountable and holds everyone responsible.\u201d\n\nCallahan appears to be trying to hold his players to that standard. Roullier said Callahan is making sure players understand where they need to be, adding \u201cextra pressure\u201d to be doing exactly the right thing at all times. \u201cThat\u2019s really what he\u2019s trying to change,\u201d he said.\n\nPlayers will have to buy in. As Roullier acknowledged, the Redskins have a mix of young and older players, which means some of the veterans might not have been used to running gassers at the end of practice. Entering the season, the average Redskins player was just 26.1 years old \u2014 ranking 20th in the NFL.\n\nBut players will respect their head coach as long as he\u2019s consistent in his approach, Roullier said.\n\nRight tackle Morgan Moses, who credits Callahan for his massive improvement from his first to the second year, said the coach\u2019s attention to detail will make a difference.\n\n\u201cThe culture has to change,\u201d Moses said, \u201cbut we also have the players in here to do it.\u201d\n\nPart of that change is putting in more work. Typically when practice ends, the offensive line stays on the field for another extra 30 minutes of work, often being the last position group to return to the locker room.\n\nBut with Callahan in charge, every unit now has a \u201cdevelopmental period\u201d to work with their position coaches.\n\nMoses laughed when asked if it was nice to see the other position groups working alongside the offensive line.\n\n\u201cIt was, man,\u201d Moses said. \u201cIt was. It was. It was.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
