Danielle with her daughters in her backyard. Photo: Michelle Groskopf\n\nSince February, the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration has given 130 individuals \u2014 randomly selected from neighborhoods with a median household income at or below Stockton\u2019s of $46,033 \u2014 monthly payments of $500, no strings attached. The disbursements are part of an 18-month pilot program studying the effects of a universal basic income (UBI). Since February, I have followed five of the recipients to watch how this unexpected windfall has changed their lives. Read the stories of Grace, Laura, Greg, and Phyllis for more about what a basic-income policy looks like for real people.\n\nMonth One W h e n s h e n e e d e d e x t r a m o n e y , D a n i e l l e w o u l d c h a n g e h e r t a x - f i l i n g s t a t u s t o t e n d e p e n d e n t s s o s h e c o u l d t a k e h o m e e n o u g h t o p a y f o r g r o c e r i e s .\n\nDanielle didn\u2019t recognize the return address, but she opens all her mail so she took out the letter and read something about completing an online form to receive $500 a month. What is this?, she thought, wondering if it was a scam. That night, she was watching the local news and it mentioned the SEED program. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I just got that letter,\u2019 \u201d she says. She filled out the questionnaire but missed a section and couldn\u2019t use the back button to complete it. Oh well, she thought. The whole idea that someone would give her $500 a month seemed so far-fetched anyway. Then, a week or two later, she got a text saying she\u2019d been selected to receive the money.\n\n\u201cIt was very surreal,\u201d she says. We\u2019re talking in the SEED office downtown, where she has come after work to fill out the paperwork to get the debit card on which she\u2019ll begin receiving her monthly disbursements. She has never met any of the staff before; they\u2019ve communicated only by text, with the last message instructing her to come to this address. Her husband dropped her off, and she told him to note the building number \u201cif anything happens to me,\u201d she says. As I start to reassure her, she waves away my concern. \u201cThat\u2019s just me. I worry,\u201d she says. \u201cI never stop worrying or having anxiety.\u201d\n\nDanielle wasn\u2019t always a worrier. She\u2019s 42 now with two daughters, who are 3 and 4 years old. But before she got married and had kids, she and her two younger sisters loved to have adventures. They all lived together in the house they\u2019d grown up in, renting it from their parents. Danielle would get off work at ten at night \u2014 from her second shift working retail after her day job in an office \u2014 and they\u2019d drive to the Jackson casino on the Indian reservation. The casino didn\u2019t serve alcohol. She wasn\u2019t much of a drinker anyway, but she loved to talk. She met her husband there when he was working as a dealer. \u201cSome nights, we would have so much fun we went straight to work the next day,\u201d she says.\n\nThings started to change after her youngest sister, who had chronic asthma, died of a heart attack. She was only 25. That was in 2012. Three months later, Danielle\u2019s father lost his job, and her parents moved back to their house, where Danielle was living with her new husband. It was a difficult time, made worse by the fact that Danielle and her husband had to carry the household financially. Her mom landed a part-time low-wage job, but her dad, who was in his 60s, couldn\u2019t find anything. Danielle kept thinking, They\u2019ll recoup, they\u2019ll bounce back. But they didn\u2019t. After a year of their living together, Danielle became pregnant and she and her husband moved out. Her parents couldn\u2019t keep up the mortgage payments and ended up losing the house and doubling up with relatives. \u201cI still feel really guilty,\u201d Danielle says.\n\nOne night in 2014, she felt a sharp stabbing sensation in her chest. It was the weekend, and her husband drove her and their infant daughter to the ER. \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d Danielle says. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have heartburn.\u2019 \u201d The bill for that visit was $2,500. Her daughter\u2019s delivery was another $2,000. Soon Danielle was pregnant again, and boom, they were up to $6,500 in medical debt. They had health insurance, but until they reached the annual deductible of $9,000, their plan didn\u2019t cover much. Danielle says she\u2019ll never set foot in a hospital again. \u201cIf I\u2019m bleeding and broken, you\u2019re not taking me. I\u2019m not going.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband had personal loans, too, from when they were \u201cyoung and dumb about their money,\u201d credit-card bills from their wedding, extra expenses while living at her parents\u2019 house, and the costs for two small children. Although the pair earned salaries that put them comfortably above Stockton\u2019s median household income of $46,033 \u2014 she does admin for a small business, and he drives for a national courier \u00adcompany \u2014 they still had trouble servicing their debt and covering household bills.\n\nWhen she needed extra money, Danielle would change her tax-filing status to ten dependents so she could take home an extra $70 a week to pay for groceries. But when it came time to pay their taxes, they\u2019d end up owing thousands, which meant getting on yet another payment plan, this time to the IRS. For years, she has been keeping a color-coded Excel spreadsheet on her computer to track all the debt. They were rarely able to pay more than the minimum amounts due.\n\nAll her fights with her husband were about money. She\u2019d have a meltdown over the unexpected cost of needing a new tire and fretted that they weren\u2019t doing right by their children.\n\nAbout a year ago, Danielle\u2019s husband started picking up a Saturday shift, which paid time and a half and brought in as much as $600 extra each month. Danielle was determined to use this windfall to turn their situation around. She began following #\u00addebtfreecommunity on Instagram. Couples posted pictures of themselves with a sign on which they\u2019d written how much debt they had and how long it took for them to knock it out. $120,000 in 20 months!\n\nDanielle went back to her spreadsheet to see what would happen if she paid more on this bill and that loan. There in the distance was a horizon where they might finally be debt free. She put her family on an austerity diet. No more grocery shopping at Walmart, where unnecessary snacks and toys somehow always made it into the cart. No more heading to the arcades or bowling for entertainment. It would be such a relief to know that when there was an emergency, they\u2019d still be okay. Her parents and her sister, whom she hasn\u2019t yet told about the program, are not going to be able to recognize her. \u201c \u2018What\u2019s wrong with Danielle?\u2019 \u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201c \u2018Are you pregnant?,\u2019 \u201d she jokes. \u201cI know some people might go absolutely crazy: I\u2019m going to buy this and \u2026 I don\u2019t want to buy anything! I want to pay this off!\u201d\n\nAs we begin to wrap up, Danielle gets teary-eyed saying how humbled she feels by the opportunity. \u201cMaybe somebody would deserve it better,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at the same time, maybe this is my chance. Maybe this is my moment of hope.\u201d\n\nMonth Four \u201c T h i s i s t o t a l l y a w e s o m e . I f e e l l e s s s t r e s s . I \u2019 m n o t s c r e a m i n g a s m u c h . \u201d\n\nI pull up outside the small ranch house on a quiet street in one of Stockton\u2019s older neighborhoods. The house looks a little unloved from the outside, with tall grass and a broken shade in the front window. Danielle\u2019s waiting in the screen doorway. Kid-size shadows move behind her; the dog sounds her alarm. It\u2019s Saturday morning, and Danielle\u2019s husband is working the extra shift. Her older daughter is stamping quietly on a low table in the corner of the living room, and the younger one is playing in the bedroom the two sisters share.\n\n\u201cI am kind of excited to talk,\u201d she says as soon as we sit down in a pair of recliners. She wants to provide as much feedback as possible because she\u2019s hoping the program will take off. \u201cThe only thing that I think that would have been even more helpful is maybe like a place that we could go and seek tips and suggestions.\u201d She knows she can spend the money however she wants and doesn\u2019t even have to tell anyone what her experience is like. \u201cBut why wouldn\u2019t I want to say, \u2018This is totally awesome. It\u2019s making me feel better. I feel less stress. I\u2019m not screaming as much.\u2019 Unless, I guess, I was using it frivolously.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d already told me on the phone how she\u2019d used the money to help pay down their debts, and the $500 was having the most amazing effect on her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he\u2019s competing with me, but \u2026\u201d He\u2019s been working every Saturday to match it and then some.\n\nShe has updated her spreadsheet and thinks they\u2019ll be able to pay off their $60,000 in debt, including their car payments, by September 2020, one month after the SEED program ends. Then they should have some expendable income to put toward buying a house or starting a college fund or even just renting a nicer home somewhere, with central air-\u00adconditioning, where they can have their friends over to watch the game. That\u2019s her plan as long as everyone behaves, as she calls it, meaning if they don\u2019t have any unexpected expenses. By \u201ceveryone,\u201d she\u2019s referring to her parents and sister, too.\n\nNo one in her family talks much about her parents\u2019 personal business, but Danielle is painfully aware that they went from being solidly middle class to qualifying for food stamps in three short years. Where she can, she has been letting the SEED money trickle down. Driving to her first appointment to complete her paperwork, she noticed a spare tire on her sister\u2019s car, so she bought her a new tire on her credit card. A few months later, they had a big family wedding, and Danielle took care of the $60 alteration on her sister\u2019s dress. Then there was a $150 speeding ticket. Her sister works full time, but her husband has a big alimony payment and Danielle knows they struggle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how my family works,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all pick each other up, and that\u2019s how we keep going.\u201d In fact, Danielle and her husband\u2019s lives wouldn\u2019t work without her family\u2019s help. Her father arrives at seven every morning to watch her two girls and her nephew. Danielle takes her dad\u2019s car to work, since her husband needs their car to get to his job. Her mother arrives in the afternoon when she gets off her part-time position at a school, so her dad can get a break. It\u2019s a delicate dance of scheduling and car shuffling that depends on nobody getting sick and nothing breaking down.\n\nDanielle pays her parents for their help, although they don\u2019t ask her to. If they had to send the girls to day care outside the home, it would cost a lot more. And Danielle\u2019s happy to provide her father with some income, since he still hasn\u2019t found a job. With her oldest starting school in August and her youngest a year behind, they won\u2019t be needing his help much longer.\n\nWhen I come back a few nights later, the TV is on. The Dodgers are playing Atlanta and losing. Danielle\u2019s husband pulls up a folding chair to join me and Danielle in the recliners. A tall man with a surprisingly soft voice, he tells me he has noticed a big change in his wife over the past few months and in himself, too. Before, he didn\u2019t have much energy to do anything else when he worked the six days. \u201cI was just tired,\u201d he says. \u201cI had chores to do on Sunday, the one day I had off.\u201d He couldn\u2019t get around to mowing the lawn, which his father-in-law would rib him about. Even if he did want to go somewhere, Danielle wouldn\u2019t let them spend any money because they have to pay the bills. But with the extra funds coming in from SEED, his outlook has improved. He has been taking the girls to some parks they\u2019ve found, hidden pockets in the nicer parts of town. He\u2019s teaching them T-ball. His older girl has a good arm.\n\nI suggest he could have viewed the extra money as an opportunity to work less and spend more time with his family. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about it, honestly,\u201d he says. He just wants to get rid of their debt.\n\nThe couple recently received another boost from Trump\u2019s new tax plan. With the doubling of the standard deduction and the child credits, Danielle explains, they owed only $120 on their federal return and even got a little back from the state. That\u2019s never happened before. \u201cI know it\u2019s the Trump thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not very political, but it\u2019s like, Wow, this really helped us\u201d \u2014 much more so than some of their homeowning friends.\n\nDanielle talks about all the little ways they try to save money: waiting until a movie goes to DVD, eating beans and rice or spaghetti, buying her kids clothes at the 90 percent-off sales, regifting gift cards to avoid having to buy presents. Her husband nods along. She tracks where every last dollar goes. He\u2019ll even call to double-check before spending $5 on lunch. \u201cI like the fact that she keeps reminding me of the finish line,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m just grinding six days a week, every single week, for nothing. That would be depressing.\u201d\n\nMonth Seven A n o t h e r s i d e e f f e c t o f r e d u c i n g t h e i r f i n a n c i a l s t r e s s : \u201c W e h a v e l o v e f o r e a c h o t h e r . \u201d\n\nDanielle and I sit at a picnic table as her two girls climb on a play structure in a small park. We\u2019re in an upscale development in the Spanos Park neighborhood, named for Alex Spanos, a billionaire real-estate developer who owned the Los Angeles Chargers. Born and raised in Stockton, he got his start borrowing $800 from a bank to buy a truck that he drove around to farms, selling sandwiches to migrant workers. Now his name is stamped on cultural institutions, business parks, neighborhoods, and streets across the city. \u201cThose are hero stories to me,\u201d Danielle says. \u201cStart from the bottom and have goals and get there.\u201d\n\nToday is the first day Danielle\u2019s husband has been able to pick up the Saturday shift in months. The trade wars have been hurting business, and the company is cutting back on overtime. Anyway, they\u2019ve been treating the duration of the SEED demonstration like a sprint, scrimping and working all the time, and Danielle confesses that her husband was starting to get a little burned out.\n\nBut an opportunity has just come up for him to trade his swing shift for a steady one in a nearby city. It\u2019s a route her husband loves in a beautiful area with none of the drama that can happen in Stockton. (He has co-workers who have been robbed trying to deliver a package in certain neighborhoods.) It would be a relief to know he was safe every day and to have his schedule set now that their oldest has started school. Even though it will be a slight pay cut, he told his boss he\u2019d take it. With the SEED money, they can afford for him to earn a little less, and Danielle wants him to be happy. Another side effect of reducing their financial stress: \u201cWe have more love for each other,\u201d she says.\n\nBoth Danielle and her husband want to be involved parents. He took off work for the first two days of school so he could bring his daughter and meet the teachers and the other parents and kids. Danielle jokes that he was going to bring a lawn chair and sit outside all day. For her part, she bought everything on the teacher\u2019s wish list: all the wipes, paper towels, and boxes of tissues, spending nearly $60. \u201cWe could afford it,\u201d Danielle says. \u201cImagine if the teacher had to pay for all that?\u201d She can\u2019t wait to make Valentine\u2019s Day cards and go on field trips. Her boss will likely retire before too long, and when he does, she\u2019s hoping to work for the school district. Her father just started working for the school district himself, getting a job as a part-time custodian. Danielle still hasn\u2019t told her family about SEED, but she thinks her own determination to improve their financial situation is rubbing off. Her parents are thinking about finally getting their own place.\n\nAs we talk, Danielle keeps an eye on her girls. Every so often, her gaze wanders to the duplex homes circling the park. The hedges are clipped, the lawns are lush and tamed, the woodwork is crisply painted. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just so nice,\u201d she says, sighing. \u201cIf the neighbors knew each other, this would be a great area to have their little barbecue.\u201d That\u2019s her idea of the American Dream, she tells me: owning a home in a nice neighborhood with a good school, where people know their neighbors and get together once in a while. She\u2019s still on track to get rid of their debt one month after the SEED program ends. By October of next year, they\u2019ll start saving to buy a house. She has looked at the listings online. \u201cNot to buy, just a dream for now.\u201d\n\nThis project was supported by a grant from the investigative news site Capital & Main.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
