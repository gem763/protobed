It\u2019s part of the company\u2019s plan to invest $50 million in education over the next five years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDunbar, one of 50 participating schools in the Washington metropolitan region, fits the profile of those that Amazon has provided with funding. The Dunbar student body is 94 percent black and 5 percent Hispanic. Nine percent of students are homeless, according to city data. Sixty-five percent of students are considered at-risk, which means they are homeless or in foster care, their families qualify for public assistance, or they have been held back more than a year in high school.\n\nRecords show that fewer than 1 percent of students passed the math portion of a 2019 national standardized test administered by the District, and about 16 percent passed the English portion.\n\nBezos, whose $112 billion fortune makes him the world\u2019s richest man, dropped into the classroom to encourage the students. Wearing a sport coat and an open-necked shirt, he arrived surrounded by a swirl of somber security guards and well-dressed public relations officials wielding cameras. Television cameras, photographers and reporters ringed the classroom while several Amazon engineers circulated between the desks to offer help. Combined, they outnumbered the 20 students hunched over their laptops on Dunbar\u2019s third floor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cKeep at it,\u201d said Bezos, who owns The Washington Post and bought the former Textile Museum in the District with the aim of turning it into the city\u2019s largest private residence. \u201cThese skills can change your life. You\u2019re the next generation that is going to take that leadership and move the world forward. \u2026 I hope some of you come and work for Amazon someday. We need the help.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills for them. Some of those jobs will be available just across the Potomac River, in Amazon\u2019s second headquarters that is being built in Arlington County.\n\nRamona Hutchins, Dunbar\u2019s computer science, engineering and physics teacher, said her two classes of 43 students (mostly juniors) are finding that the discipline of coding is teaching them problem-solving skills, critical thinking and perseverance. After some initial frustration, the students have adapted, she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to interrupt them when they\u2019re into a project,\u201d she said. In the first nine weeks of school, they\u2019ve learned the difference between analog and digital, have moved from static to dynamic coding and are learning to code mathematical operations in the Python computer language, she said.\n\nNext up: She\u2019s buying a robot that Amazon funded so the students can learn to code movement. Next year, she hopes to launch an Advanced Placement computer science class, which Amazon will also pay for.\n\nFor a lucky 100 students from underrepresented and underserved communities across the nation, Amazon will also award $10,000 scholarships for those who plan to study computer science at a four-year college or university. They will be guaranteed paid internships with the company after their freshman year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDunbar Principal Nadine Smith said word has spread to the student body that the introductory computer science class is interesting and worthwhile.\n\n\u201cWe want the students \u2026 to be inspired and feel like they belong to a successful group of students who can go into STEM fields,\u201d she said, using the acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. \u201cThere are students here who are athletes, poets and some in special ed who really blossom when they work on computers. Our job is to awaken that genius in them, that talent that they may not even know they have.\u201d\n\nAwakening students can be tough work, even when Bezos stands in front of a high school class surrounded by television, video and still cameras. Bezos tried asking a few questions, loosening them up with questions about their teacher and joking about his own children\u2019s vague responses to his questions. He prompted one student to tell him about his current project that involved coding for computers that operate systems in a house.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cVery cool,\u201d the business mogul responded.\n\nThen, after a group photo and a few more words of encouragement, he was gone. And even if several of the students were not sure who he was or why he came, they said they appreciated the 15-minute drop-in visit.\n\n\u201cIt shows us how if we put our minds to it, we can do it, too,\u201d said Dajuana Gore, 14.\n\n\u201cIt gives us exposure to people like that and shows us how important this is,\u201d added Rakyia Addo, 16.\n\n\u201cIt helps inspire us to continue coding, and gives us the inspiration to succeed,\u201d said Jay\u2019quan Gillis, 15.\n\nPerry Stein contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The Amazon chief executive dropped by a Washington school to promote the company\u2019s computer science education grants.", "authors": ["Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fwbH8u0hJoieplTtdD8Vam6xHnQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DVV3U2HUD4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
