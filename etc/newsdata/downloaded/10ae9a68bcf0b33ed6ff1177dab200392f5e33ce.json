Kumar had backed Ward's last startup, Second Sight, a suite of investment tools that was, in Ward's words, an \"absolute failure.\"\n\nFor whatever reason, Kumar still believed in Ward. And now he had a new idea for him.\n\nWard recalled to Business Insider how Kumar wondered why he still got a paper stock certificate in the mail when he invested in a private company. Investing in public companies was so much easier.\n\nWard was a \"finance guy,\" Kumar reasoned, referring to Ward's master's degree in capital market finance. Couldn't he solve this problem?\n\nNearly a decade later, Carta is a $1.7 billion platform for buying and selling shares in private companies. (Kumar is a cofounder.) Carta recently closed a series E round, which brought its total funding to $448 million.\n\nIf you talk to Ward for more than a few seconds, you'll see at least one reason for Carta's explosive growth. Ward is a master salesman. He makes complex financial concepts easy to understand; he's excited to answer questions about the company that he's probably fielded 100 times before.\n\nWard recently participated in a Business Insider Prime webinar, where he walked through his series A and series E pitch decks. He discussed the importance of \"message-market fit,\" how Carta raised $800,000 in three weeks, and the only reason investors will support an early-stage company.\n\nSimply enter your email address to receive a FREE download of the full transcript of the webinar!", "description": "The founder of Carta recently participated in a Business Insider Prime webinar, where he walked through his series A and series E pitch decks.
