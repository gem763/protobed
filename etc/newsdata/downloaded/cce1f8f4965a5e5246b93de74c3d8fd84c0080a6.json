He went to that company in trouble.\u201d\n\nHere's the relevant portion of the press conference where authorities revealed the information https://t.co/sJEDA5KrQx \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 2, 2019\n\nThe one thing that no one is mentioning in their headlines or in their tweets about this is that authorities have said that although they were trying to track him down he did *not* make anything threatening statements https://t.co/EVzyvy89Gs \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 2, 2019\n\nFifteen minutes after the call to the FBI, Combs said, a Texas state trooper unaware of the calls to authorities tried pulling over Ator for failing to signal a lane change. That was when Ator pointed an AR-style rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired on the trooper, starting a terrifying police chase as Ator sprayed bullets into passing cars, shopping plazas and killed a U.S. Postal Service employee while hijacking her mail truck. Combs said Ator \u201cshowed up to work enraged\u201d but did not point to any specific source of his anger. Ator\u2019s home on the outskirts of Odessa was a corrugated metal shack along a dirt road surrounded by trailers, mobile homes and oil pump jacks. On Monday, a green car without a rear windshield was parked out front, the entire residence cordoned off by police tape. Combs described it as a \u201cstrange residence\u201d that reflected \u201cwhat his mental state was going into this.\u201d Combs said he did not know whether Ator had been diagnosed with any prior mental health problems. (AP)\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday the shooter had failed a background check to purchase a gun in the past and did not get a background check done for the firearm he used in the attack.\n\n\"We must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands,\" he said.", "description": ".09/03/2019 19:39:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/245/186053da-4bbf-4abf-803f-9e653039a8b6.png"}
