When Pi\u00f1eiro checked his phone, the most special text message was congratulations from his dad.\n\n\u201cJust that he was proud of me from all the stuff we\u2019ve been through,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro said. \u201cIt was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nA newspaper sports front the following day aptly dubbed him \u201cEddy Money,\u201d and the Chicago Bears kicker with the swagger he attributes to his Hispanic heritage and the name that rhymes with the Spanish word for money is now the toast of the NFL\u2019s kicking fraternity after booting a game-winning 53-yarder last week. Assuming he can play through a right knee injury , Eddy Money\u2019s next trick comes on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d against the Washington Redskins .\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to be defined for one made field goal if more misses follow for a team haunted by Cody Parkey\u2019s \u201cdouble doink\u201d in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s over, the kick already happened, how can I get better in practice \u2026 to play in the next game and make more kicks and try to be as perfect as I can be?\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro said. \u201cI want to be a great kicker so I can support my family for the rest of my life so they never have to work a day in their life. That\u2019s been my goal since Day 1 and they\u2019ve struggled so much and they\u2019ve given me everything, and now it\u2019s time that I give them everything.\u201d\n\nEddy Sr. was far from the only one congratulating Pi\u00f1eiro for his big kick to beat Denver . He was recognized and lauded by the Bears on a trip to downtown Chicago, and his phone lit up with messages from friends around the NFL who watched Pi\u00f1eiro go undrafted, spend last season on injured reserve, and win the kicking competition to replace Parkey.\n\n\u201cI reached out to him and congratulated him,\u201d Arizona Cardinals kicker Zane Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little community so we all kind of root for each other. That was a huge kick for Pi\u00f1eiro. That situation he\u2019s in is not easy with all the pressure over there. For him to step up and have a great game is awesome.\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1eiro is on the opposite end of the spectrum from Parkey, who infamously hit each upright and the crossbar on three separate misses in a single game last season. When his 43-yard attempt against Philadelphia in the NFC wild-card round hit the left upright and the crossbar before falling short in the end zone, Parkey\u2019s peers felt for him in that moment.\n\n\u201cI know how lonely a position kicker can be,\u201d Washington\u2019s Dustin Hopkins said. \u201cIt sucks for them. I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve been there several times, so I know the feeling. I hate it for those guys.\u201d\n\nHopkins obviously won\u2019t be rooting for Pi\u00f1eiro the opponent Monday night, or for division and conference rivals competing with the Redskins. He just doesn\u2019t want it to come down to Pi\u00f1eiro or anyone else missing a kick.\n\nEven more, Hopkins tries not to watch or dwell on another kicker\u2019s failures because in his lonely job it can only mess with his head.\n\n\u201cI try not to think about misses too much for anybody\u2019s sake,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be thinking about misses. I want to focus on makes and kind of more of a positive attitude.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no lack of positivity around Pi\u00f1eiro, who believes the Bears became closer as a team after his emotional kick.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all gotten closer as a family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy how our team is so united now, like, I have their back, they have my back. There\u2019s going to be days when I miss a kick and they\u2019re going to have to get my back. And there\u2019s going to be days when the offense or defense doesn\u2019t perform and I have to get their back.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s offense has struggled so much that Pi\u00f1eiro has accounted for the most points through two games: 13 total on four field goals and an extra point to the six on the Bears\u2018 only touchdown, a 1-yard run by David Montgomery. The kicker could be counted on again for that Monday night with a national audience watching.\n\nPi\u00f1eiro led the nation with a 94.4% conversation rate on field goals his second and final college season at Florida, and has kicked in just about every situation. He said his preparation doesn\u2019t change for night games like the one he\u2019s about to kick in Monday. Older kickers point out it\u2019s not the same - it never is.\n\n\u201cEvery single time we go out there is a little different,\u201d 34-year-old veteran Stephen Hauschka of the Buffalo Bills said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a surfer: every time he\u2019s out on the ocean, the ocean\u2019s just a little different. The wind, the temperature, the field, the humidity. It\u2019s different every time. I think we just kind of get used to it.\u201d\n\nNew York Giants Pro Bowl kicker Aldrick Rosas said night games are special because of the stage and nostalgia.\n\n\u201cIt kind of brings back memories of when you were a little younger,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cSunday, Monday, it\u2019s prime time. The lights are just a little brighter.\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1eiro grew up wanting to play soccer and didn\u2019t kick a football until high school, so he doesn\u2019t have those memories. He also won\u2019t be fazed under the bright lights because he wants the game to be on his foot.\n\n\u201cHe definitely craves the pressure,\u201d Bears guard Kyle Long said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that coach (Matt) Nagy has talked about for a long time, craving pressure and being in those pressure situations. We\u2019ve been there before and how do we deliver?\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1eiro delivered when it mattered most. Now, on to the next kick.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow and Sports Writers Andrew Seligman, John Wawrow, Tom Canavan and David Brandt contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tears came to Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro's eyes after hitting the biggest field goal of his life.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/aptoix_bears_broncos_football_18248_c0-207-4946-3090_s1770x1032.jpg?b03437053780635ed38c6d00f3aa8ef07bc308fc", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
