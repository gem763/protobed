Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragedy.\n\nFloral tributes left for Leicester City's late owner were laid outside the stadium after the crash\n\nSunday marks the first anniversary since Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha (right) died in the crash\n\n\u2018During the course of the investigation, the AAIB has been working closely with the helicopter manufacturer, other specialist organisations and regulators to identify the cause of the accident and any contributory factors. We have published two special bulletins.\n\n\u2018The first highlighted the initial facts identified in the early stages of the investigation, and the second identified that the accident was caused by the failure of the duplex bearing in the helicopter\u2019s yaw control system.\n\n\u2018The helicopter manufacturer issued several Alert Service Bulletins designed to ensure the continued airworthiness of the AW169 and AW189 fleets, which were subsequently mandated by European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Airworthiness Directives.\n\n\u2018All parties involved in the investigation continue work to fully understand what initiated the failure of the duplex bearing and to develop any additional safety actions. We expect to publish our detailed final report next year.\u2019", "description": "The\u00a0Air Accident Investigation Branch will not publish their final report into the crash that killed Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha until next year, a statement published on Sunday said.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/15/20087844-0-Floral_tributes_left_for_Leicester_City_s_late_owner_were_laid_o-a-5_1572190597144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
