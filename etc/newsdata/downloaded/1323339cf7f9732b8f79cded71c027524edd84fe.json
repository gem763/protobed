The series of tests I conducted variously as a kitchen monkey at Cook\u2019s Illustrated magazine, as recipe czar at the website Serious Eats and in researching my cookbook produced good data, but none of it felt definitive. Further home experimentations (there have been weeks when my wife, Adri, begged me to stop serving egg salad for dinner) have left unanswered questions and conflicting results.\n\nDo older eggs really peel more easily? (The internet insists they do.) Can an ice bath prevent green yolks? Is there anything the Instant Pot can\u2019t do better? I simply did not have enough data to say for certain.", "description": "In his first column for The Times, J.
