Richard Shelby, the senior senator from Alabama, also said that he believes a Moore run could hand the election to Jones. In response, Moore tweeted that if \"Senator Richard Shelby would have stayed out of the 2017 race, Doug Jones would not be in the Senate now.\"\n\nIn a response to Moore's announcement, the Mitch McConnell-backed Senate Leadership Fund said on Thursday: \"We believe most Alabama Republicans realize that nominating Roy Moore would be gift wrapping this Senate seat for Chuck Schumer.\"\n\nThe big picture: The GOP's majority in the Senate has had major implications over the past two years, as judicial nominations \u2014 including two to the Supreme Court \u2014 have often been decided by a handful of votes. Now, with an aging SCOTUS and a number of judicial seats remaining vacant, the fate of just one Senate spot holds serious consequences.\n\nWhat to watch: Moore is entering an already crowded field, with seven other Republicans already registered for the primary.\n\nGo deeper: Roy Moore sees uptick in polls ahead of 2020 Senate race\n\n", "description": "Moore's candidacy was derailed last year by sexual misconduct allegations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ycNcfCI20_XwVV54EIsVE8OUO14=/0x423:5568x3555/1920x1080/2019/06/20/1561053068540.None", "published_at": "2019-06-20"}
