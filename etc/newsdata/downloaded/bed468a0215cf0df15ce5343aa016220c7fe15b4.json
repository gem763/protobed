He described him as a 'lovely person, very sunny and very professional'.\n\nHe added: 'It came as a big shock and we still feel the loss.'\n\nThe inquest heard evidence that the top of the stage was overloaded by about 16,000lbs and the stage set had not been assembled correctly (pictured, the collapsed scaffolding)\n\nMr Johnson was killed and three other people injured, one seriously, in the tragedy which took place an hour before the gates opened to the public (pictured, the collapsed scaffolding)\n\nRichard Hughes, from the band Keane, added: 'Clearly something went wrong very badly and it's incumbent on all of us to make sure it's not swept under the carpet.\n\n'And we need to make sure that everyone who works in this kind of thing is safe.'\n\nA court case against the entertainment company who organised the 2012 gig was halted in 2017 because of Canadian rules relating to the amount of time the case was taking.\n\nMr Johnson's father Ken, from Doncaster, welcomed the coroner's comments.\n\nIt's exactly what we needed someone to say,' he said. 'At least that information now should help people to acknowledge the negligence.\n\n'My wife, Sue, will never forgive them for what happened. My feeling is that I don't think any of them went out to kill Scott. They went out to do their job, but it wasn't done very well. I will continue to support any changes to the rules in Canada.'\n\nAt the time of Mr Johnsons' passing, a message on the radiohead.com website said: 'We have all been shattered by the loss of Scott Johnson, our friend and colleague.'\n\nIt went on: 'He was a lovely man, always positive, supportive and funny; a highly skilled and valued member of our great road crew.\n\n'We will miss him very much. Our thoughts and love are with Scott\u2019s family and all those close to him.'", "description": "Scott Johnson, 33, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, had been setting up equipment before the\u00a0band's sell-out gig in Toronto, Canada in June 2012 when\u00a0the scaffolding collapsed.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20170572-0-image-a-4_1571990968806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
