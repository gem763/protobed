Jones is being sued by nine family members of loved ones who died in the 2012 shooting after he and his staff spent years falsely claiming that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut \u2015 which left 20 children and six adults dead \u2015 was a hoax, and that the parents were \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d\n\nJacobson testified that Jones and his staff \u201cgot a rush\u201d out of chasing baseless conspiracy theories related to Sandy Hook, including the false claim from Jones that CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper was standing in front of a blue screen and talking to actors \u201cdoing the fake crying\u201d after the shooting.\n\nI told [Jones] straight to his face: \u2018They\u2019re going to come after you for Sandy Hook. This is really bad.' He just stared at me like a deer in the headlights, he had nothing to say. And we just went on our way. Robert Jacobson\n\nJacobson warned staff numerous times about the implications of what they were doing, he said.\n\n\u201cI would make it my business to go in to the writers and explain to them as clearly as possible that there is journalist ethics; and I tried to demonstrate what those ethics are and why they are violating them and what the damage could possibly be,\u201d Jacobson said. They didn\u2019t care, he said.\n\nJacobson said he was concerned that the only source Jones and his staff seemed to have for their lies about the Sandy Hook parents came from Wolfgang Halbig, an Infowars contributor and notorious harasser of the Sandy Hook parents. Halbig was also recently found to have communicated with a former National Rifle Association official to call into question last year\u2019s shooting in Parkland, Florida, HuffPost reported.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they took Halbig\u2019s word for it, and that was the article,\u201d Jacobson said about the reporting process at Infowars. \u201cThe article was: Whatever came out of Halbig\u2019s mouth was news.\u201d\n\nHuffPost Illustration / Chris McGonigal A whistleblower has testified that Alex Jones and others on staff had no shame in spreading lies about the Sandy Hook parents.\n\nWhen Jacobson confronted Infowars writer Adan Salazar about Halbig, he said he was again mocked.\n\n\u201cAdan Salazar responded with \u2015 and I\u2019m going to quote him because he said it to me many times \u2015 \u2018I want to print up a T-shirt that says, \u201cHalbig was right.\u201d I want bumper stickers that say, \u201cHalbig was right,\u201d\u2019 to a laughing room,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\nJones did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Jacobson said he also confronted Jones directly months before a 2017 interview with NBC\u2019s Megyn Kelly.\n\n\u201cI told [Jones] straight to his face: \u2018They\u2019re going to come after you for Sandy Hook. This is really bad,\u2019\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cHe just stared at me like a deer in the headlights, he had nothing to say. And we just went on our way.\u201d\n\nThe former employee described a culture of celebration when new Sandy Hook lies were published. Infowars news director Rob Dew \u201cwas overzealous to receive any type of hint that perhaps this might have been a phony act, a staged act. Any type of whisper that came through to him, he would celebrate,\u201d and on-air contributor Dan Bidondi \u2015 described as being \u201cvery emotional\u201d \u2015 also \u201cgloms onto conspiracy kind of situations,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\nNot only did Infowars spread absurd lies about the Sandy Hook shooting for over five years, but they responded to the distress of the victim\u2019s families with laughter and mockery. Mark Bankston, attorney representing multiple Sandy Hook parents\n\nA primary concern for Jacobson was the fear Jones\u2019 rabid fan base might come after the Sandy Hook parents.\n\n\u201cWe do know that [Jones] affects his audience in a way that angers and mobilizes them,\u201d he said in the deposition. And it\u2019s true: Florida woman Lucy Richards was sentenced to five months in prison in 2017 after she sent Sandy Hook father Leonard Pozner a voicemail that warned, \u201cYou gonna die. Death is coming to you.\u201d Pozner is suing Jones for defamation.\n\nJacobson contacted Lewis\u2019 attorney Mark Bankston of the Texas law firm Farrar & Ball after reading about the numerous lawsuits against Infowars. Bankston deposed Jones earlier this year in a surreal scene that showed Jones in the hot seat as he was unable to answer basic questions, including the date the school shooting happened.\n\n\u201cMr. Jacobson\u2019s testimony confirms the cruelty at the heart of Infowars\u2019 reckless obsession with Sandy Hook,\u201d Bankston said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cNot only did Infowars spread absurd lies about the Sandy Hook shooting for over five years, but they responded to the distress of the victim\u2019s families with laughter and mockery.\u201d\n\nAt times, the deposition became contentious between Bankston and Jones\u2019 attorney, Mark Enoch, as Enoch repeatedly attempted to interrupt Bankston\u2019s questions. Enoch was replaced by attorney Michael Burnett in July to represent Jones. The Infowars host also lost a legal battle last month when he was denied an appeal in a separate defamation case brought against him by Sandy Hook father Neil Heslin. Bankston is also representing Heslin in that case.\n\nJacobson was ultimately fired by Jones in 2017 and made headlines last year after he filed a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission claiming Jones and his staff used anti-Semitic language to describe him. The former employee told HuffPost that Jones also called him \u201cBeefcake\u201d for years after Jacobson accidentally clicked a spam link that led to a gay porn website.\n\nBut Jacobson\u2019s testimony has nothing to do with him being fired, he said. Instead, Jacobson sees it as a way to seek redemption after staying quiet for so long.\n\n\u201cJust being in that building, it\u2019s such an embarrassment and disgrace to think back on,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI understand I could go into the old \u2018I started on an innocent track, I was just interested in the occult stuff,\u2019 but that\u2019s no excuse. I feel ashamed whenever I think back to working there. It\u2019s a total shame and blight in my memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo yeah, am I squealing on Alex?\u201d he added. \u201cWell, I have a soul to consider.\u201d", "description": "In a court deposition, Rob Jacobson said he told Infowars staff to stop spreading lies about the Sandy Hook parents.
