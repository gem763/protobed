Mitchell\u2019s nephew, 20-year-old Jacquerious Mitchell, was in critical condition in a Dallas hospital with a gunshot wound. The third suspect, Thaddeous Green, 22, was still at large.\n\nInvestigators believe the three men were in Dallas to buy drugs from Joshua Brown , Assistant Chief Avery Moore said at a news conference earlier Tuesday. Moore said Jacquerious Mitchell told police that Brown shot him in the chest after Green and Brown began fighting during the drug deal, and that Green then shot Brown twice.\n\nGreen left with Brown\u2019s backpack and gun, police said. Authorities confiscated 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) of marijuana, 149 grams of THC cartridges and more than $4,000 in cash during a search of Brown\u2019s home.\n\nIt is unclear how the three men came into contact with Brown or why they would have driven more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) from central Louisiana to purchase marijuana in Texas.\n\nThe police announcement comes after rampant speculation regarding Brown\u2019s death, which happened two days after a jury sentenced the white former police officer to 10 years in prison for killing her black upstairs neighbor in a case that sparked fierce debate over race, politics and policing.\n\nAmber Guyger fatally shot Botham Jean in September 2018 in his fourth-floor apartment and testified that she mistook it for her own unit one floor below. She was arrested on a manslaughter charge three days after the killing, prompting criticism that the original charge was too lenient, but a grand jury later decided on the more serious charge of murder.\n\nBrown, who was black, was one of several neighbors who were called by prosecutors to testify at the trial. The conspiracy theories surrounding his death underscored the distrust that some Dallas residents have for their police department.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to believe that their conclusions so far in the investigation are unreliable, but I believe \u2026 some members of the community will have a difficult time accepting it because of their association \u2026 with the Amber Guyger trial,\u201d said Lee Merritt, attorney for the families of Brown and Jean.\n\nThe NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. previously requested an independent investigation into Brown\u2019s death, calling it \u201cdeeply alarming and highly suspicious\u201d in a news release. And Merritt urged the department to hand off the investigation into Brown\u2019s death to another law enforcement agency as a way to bolster trust.\n\nBut Moore, the assistant police chief, said Tuesday that it was reckless for people to speculate as to the circumstances surrounding Brown\u2019s death, adding that it undermined the public\u2019s faith in the department.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there\u2019s been speculation and rumors that have been shared by community leaders claiming that Mr. Brown\u2019s death was related to the Amber Guyger trial and somehow the Dallas Police Department was responsible,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI assure you that is simply not true and I encourage those leaders to be mindful of their actions moving forward because their words have jeopardized the integrity of the city of Dallas as well as the Dallas Police Department.\u201d\n\nThe tensions between Dallas police and community activists erupted in shouting and shoving at the first meeting of a new Community Police Oversight Committee. The disturbance happened when the committee adjourned without taking public comment. Police Chief U. Renee Hall intervened and opened the floor to comment, much of it critical of the department and mistrustful of the committee\u2019s intensions.\n\nBrown, who lived on the same floor as Jean, testified that on the night Jean was killed, he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots. He said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nMerritt previously said Brown had had reservations about testifying in such a high-profile trial because he had been wounded in a shooting outside of a Dallas strip club last year. Police Major Max Geron said Tuesday that investigators have no evidence linking that shooting to Brown\u2019s death.\n\nSince the shooting, elected leaders have asked the public to refrain from speculating about the circumstances of Brown\u2019s death. Mayor Eric Johnson on Tuesday thanked \u201ceveryone who demonstrated patience and responsibly reserved their judgment while\u201d police investigated.\n\nThe Rev. Michael Waters, pastor of Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church in Dallas, who has pushed for police reform in the city, said the speculation around Brown\u2019s death is driven by \u201cgenerations\u201d of mistrust for the police that\u2019s grown out of wrongful convictions and abuse.\n\n\u201cThere is cause for the community to be skeptical,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThere is a lack of credibility that the Dallas Police Department currently has and, frankly, it\u2019s not just among brown and black communities.\u201d", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Three Louisiana men are suspected in the killing of a witness who testified at the murder trial of a former Dallas police officer,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/51cb82_dallas-officer-mistaken-apartment-witness-killed-10806-dallas-assistant-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
