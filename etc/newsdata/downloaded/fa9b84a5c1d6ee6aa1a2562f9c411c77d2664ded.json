You never know which French team is going to turn up.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ultimately for a team like the USA, if you finish third in the group stages, you automatically qualify for the next World Cup, which will be their goal.\n\n\"To do that they're going to have to upset either France, England, or Argentina, and obviously beat Tonga as well. It's a tough ask for them, but I believe they can put a scare up the Argentinians.\"\n\nGoode also urged England, for whom he made 17 appearances between 2005-2009, not to underestimate the USA.\n\n\"No team will be taking the USA lightly,\" he said. \"There is an expectation that England will beat them, but, if you underestimate any team at the World Cup, with the power they have got and the players they've got to run a game, then you're only going to do yourself a disservice.\"\n\nRead more: Here's everything that's happening at the Rugby World Cup, and how to watch it live online\n\nHis warning comes after England coach Eddie Jones said facing the USA will be like facing \"15 Donald Trumps\" who will come out \"all guns blazing.\"\n\n\"It's going to be like 15 Donald Trumps out there, so we'll have to be on our job, because we know they're going to give it everything they've got, just like Tonga did,\" he said, according to Sky Sports.\n\n\"That's great for us because we'll have to be at our best.\"\n\nRead more: England's rugby coach says facing the USA at the World Cup will be like facing '15 Donald Trumps' who will come out 'all guns blazing'\n\nUSA head coach Gary Gold appeard to be a bit confused by the comments, saying: \"At this stage, with all due respect, we're not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that.\n\n\"I don't know what it means.\"\n\nEngland produced a convincing display in its World Cup opener against Tonga on Sunday, running 35 points past Toutai Kefu's side to begin the tournament with a win.\n\nEddie Jones' side was sloppy in opening stages, managing only three points from an Owen Farrell penalty, however found its rhythm after Manu Tuilagi scored the game's first try on 23 minutes when he muscled past four defenders to place the ball over the line.\n\nTuilagi added England's and his second just seven minutes later, when he was fed in following some excellent quick hands from Elliott Daly and Jonny May on the left flank.\n\nYou can watch the highlights here:\n\nJamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie added two more tries, both of which were converted by Farrell to seal an impressive victory.\n\nEddie Jones' has already announced he will make 10 changes to the starting XI that beat Tonga against the USA, including dropping key men Ben Youngs, Farrell, and Tuilagi.\n\n\"Against the US we want to take a different approach,\" Jones told the BBC. \"We want to take them at the start of the game, go out pretty hard, attack them a bit more and see where it leads us.\"\n\nThe USA's clash with England kicks off at 11.45 a.m. GMT or 6.45 a.m. ET Thursday.\n\nRead more: These photos of 90-year-old Japanese men competing in full-contact rugby are all the fitness motivation you need", "description": "The USA takes on England, who beat Tonga 35-3 on Sunday, in its World Cup tournament opener on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a2e112e22af03d0441ff3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
