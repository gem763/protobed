The strike, according to industry analysts, could cost the automaker an estimated $50 million per day at least.\n\nSeveral sticking points have been a thorn in each other\u2019s side, including GM\u2019s closure of four U.S. factories last fall, as well as the use of temporary employees, with the union pushing for a better path to make them permanent while also gaining benefits in the process.\n\nTemporary workers currently account for between 7 to 10 percent of GM\u2019s U.S. hourly workers, which translates to about 4,100 temporary employees.\n\nUAW\u2019s strike against GM is actually one of two separate strikes, with 850 union-backed Aramark janitorial employees who work at GM facilities walking off the job a day before autoworkers did the same.\n\nSources close to the UAW and GM told the Free Press that the two sides must decide upon a new contract with both Aramark and autoworkers in a timely fashion, or else union workers will be forced to cross the others\u2019 picket lines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "UAW-GM Vice President Terry Dittes provided an update to the union's negotiations with the automaker.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
