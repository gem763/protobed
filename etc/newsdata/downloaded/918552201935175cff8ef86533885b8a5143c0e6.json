President Donald Trump appointed Holmes to the council for a term that expires in 2022.\n\n\u201cAmerica is the greatest, most enduring experiment in freedom and flourishing in world history,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cOur founders risked their lives to endow future generations with the blessings of liberty, and we have kept our republic in spite of the rest of the world being in nearly constant turmoil around us. Much of this miracle can be credited to the many Americans who have endeavored to protect and preserve our heritage by ensuring that the ideas and the documents that gave life to and sustain our nation are taught to every new generation.\u201d\n\nPrior to becoming Heritage\u2019s executive vice president in 2018, Holmes oversaw the think tank\u2019s defense and foreign policy institute for more than two decades.
