Because Lauer\u2019s job was one that virtually put him in the homes of millions of Americans every morning, it\u2019s impossible not to read the letter in his voice.\n\nOther than that, there\u2019s nothing really interesting within it. The defenses he lobs are lazy and familiar, like he\u2019s copying and pasting from some pamphlet powerful men get when they\u2019re accused of sexual violence. Which sort of makes Lauer\u2019s letter a cultural artifact; when aliens land on the planet in some distant future, they\u2019ll be able to look at what he\u2019s written and see exactly how it looks when a guy is trying to cover his own ass.\n\nIn response to the letter, Nevils reiterated that her story was believed by both executives at NBC, who fired Lauer in 2017, and by Farrow. She correctly referred to Lauer\u2019s words as \u201ca case study in victim blaming.\u201d Nicole Bedera, a sociology PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, whose Twitter thread about her dissertation analyzing the behavior of college men accused of assault went viral earlier this year, told VICE that Lauer\u2019s letter\u2014this case study\u2014contains many of the common arguments sexual assailants use to try and control a narrative they don\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cSaying that what happened between two people is consensual is probably the strongest defense that assailants have, because no one can prove otherwise,\u201d Bedera told VICE, adding that, in this case, an important detail is how wildly different Nevils\u2019 account is from Lauer\u2019s. Lauer also insinuates that the past two years have been hell, though the only people in his world who seem to have experienced any harm are his ex-wife and children. Sure, saying, \u201cI cheated\u201d probably sucked (and may/may not be what led to his divorce), but that\u2019s a much easier confession than, \u201cI cheated by sexually assaulting a younger woman in my field.\u201d\n\nDespite the vague air of self-pity that permeates his letter, Lauer never spells out what, exactly, has been so bad. As justification for his screed, he writes that these \u201cfalse stories\u201d have brought him \u201charm,\u201d but that\u2019s about it. \u201cLike a lot of sexual assailants who use this language of their lives being ruined, [Lauer] doesn\u2019t actually talk about how it\u2019s been so hard for him; he doesn\u2019t get into specifics,\u201d Bedera said. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like the experience of assailants I\u2019ve interviewed, it\u2019s likely because he would have a hard time articulating it. He didn\u2019t lose anything, save for his high-power job.\u201d\n\nThroughout the letter, Lauer makes it sound as though he\u2019s been doing his victims a favor by staying out of the spotlight (not totally true, since he released a statement addressing the allegations in November 2017). He refers to this as \u201cthe shelter of my silence,\u201d like he\u2019s kindly holding a big umbrella over all the women he\u2019s hurt. But as Bedera pointed out, by Lauer\u2019s own admission in this letter, he\u2019s not actually been silent. From the letter:\n\n\u201cThere are people who fully understand the actual dynamic that existed between Brooke and me. They have reluctantly and quietly reached out in the past two years and shared what they know. They have accurately described Brooke and her role in this affair. I hope those people will understand that these allegations cross a serious line, and what they can share is a vital truth, even if it may seem unpopular.\u201d\n\nUnless these people were leaving Lauer voicemails, or sending him texts/emails/letters to which he never responded, Bedera said this doesn\u2019t sound like silence. This sounds like a guy who\u2019s been talking about things with people in relative private. Who are these people? Lauer joined NBC in 1992, it\u2019s reasonably safe to say his friends\u2014like all our friends are\u2014are similar to him, in terms of career trajectory and power. They sound like the same people Nevils would likely be trying to work for or with, and the last people she\u2019d want gossiping about her. Lauer didn\u2019t invent this tactic, though\u2014in Bederas\u2019 yet-to-be-published research, she documents a similar phenomenon among young men accused of assault in college: They talk about it way more than one might expect.\n\n\u201cJustin, from the Twitter thread, he said the same thing\u2014he talked about how his life had been ruined, but he was the one who told everyone,\u201d Bedera said. \u201cHe was the one who went around and spread rumors about it; people supported him when he was the one to say it first, this was his way of staying ahead of the story. It\u2019s a way to gather empathy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s notable that this is the first time most people are hearing Nevils\u2019 name. She was anonymous when she made the allegations, and in the immediate aftermath that resulted in Lauer getting fired. By Lauer\u2019s own account in a letter he very much wants people to read, people close to him know details about his encounter with Nevils. What is it that they know, and how, exactly, do they know it?\n\nThe crucial difference between a Matt Lauer and a Justin is that Lauer\u2019s version of \u201csilence\u201d is simply not talking to the press for a couple years. The damage still exists just the same. Per Bedera\u2019s research, Justin told people in his social circle, plus women he wanted to date, about his assault in order to paint his victims as unreliable, or crazy. If Lauer has been doing the same thing\u2014a theory Bedera\u2019s research would support\u2014that\u2019s a ring of very powerful people who feel empathetic for the man who was once the highest paid anchor at NBC.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Hannah Smothers on Twitter.", "description": "Men who've been accused of assault talk about it more than anyone, as a way to \"gather empathy.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f904305193d0009b9634f/lede/1570738943768-GettyImages-458012722.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7805xh;0xw,0.1121xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
