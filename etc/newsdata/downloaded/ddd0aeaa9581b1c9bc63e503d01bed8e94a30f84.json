City Hall has reduced the size of the proposed facilities, added a guarantee that Rikers will in fact close and promised a range of other investments to appease critics.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe believe that in securing this broad set of commitments, the Council sends a strong message that we understand our new approach must go beyond new jail buildings,\u201d Council member Adrienne Adams, chairwoman of the landmarks and dispositions subcommittee, said at a committee hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut the proposal continues to face opposition from a vocal contingent of activists who oppose the construction of any new jails, even though the plan will result in a net decrease in city detention facilities. They have prominent supporters including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who came out against the city\u2019s plan earlier this month.\n\nThe Council members who represent the areas surrounding the planned jails support the proposal, and all four \u2014 Steve Levin, Margaret Chin, Karen Koslowitz and Diana Ayala \u2014 spoke in favor of the plan at a subcommittee meeting Wednesday.\n\nDespite the Council\u2019s tradition of deferring to local members on land use applications, it is not a given that the plan will win full Council approval. The plan needs 26 votes to pass, but as many as 14 members are considering voting against it and others remain undecided, per recent reports.\n\nCouncil land use chairman Rafael Salamanca voted against the plan on Wednesday, as did Council Members Inez Barron, Andy King, Ruben Diaz Sr., and Chaim Deutsch. Some argued the proposal does not address the root inequities in the criminal justice system.\n\nMembers who voted in support of the plan said closing Rikers is only the first step of a broader overhaul of the city jail system.\n\n\u201cThere will not be another opportunity to vote to close Rikers in the near future,\u201d said Council Member Mark Treyger. \u201cI do not have confidence that there\u2019s the political and bureaucratic will to close Rikers outside of this vote.\u201d\n\nGlenn Martin, an early advocate for closing Rikers, sent an email to Council members this morning urging them to vote down the $8.7 billion plan.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of my work was never only to shutter Rikers, and certainly not to construct 4 new Torture Towers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt a cost of $300,000 per bed per year, Rikers will eventually close, but the important question is \u2018and then what?\u2019 You hold the answer to that question with your vote. Member deference is where dreams go to die.\u201d\n\nDana Rubinstein contributed to this report.", "description": "The proposal continues to face opposition from a vocal contingent of activists who oppose the construction of any new jails.", "authors": ["Janaki Chadha"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ab/b0/27f68a1949929ca782050c7bc1d7/rikers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
