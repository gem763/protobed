If they are to defeat the group leaders in Cardiff, Ryan Giggs' side will need another stand-out performance from Bale, following the 1-1 draw in Slovakia on Thursday.\n\nTheir routes to football's summit have been remarkably similar: both made transfers to Tottenham early in their careers after shining away from the spotlight, Modric with Dinamo Zagreb, Bale with Southampton; both struggled to make an immediate impact in the Premier League; both improved so dramatically that Real signed them, Modric in 2012 and Bale a year later for a then-world-record \u00a386million in August 2013. Four Champions League titles followed.\n\nWales will need another stand-out display from Gareth Bale when they take on leaders Croatia\n\nLuka Modric had been named the best player at this year's World Cup in his hunt for success\n\nDamien Comolli, now director of football at Fenerbahce, was the driving force behind the deals that brought them to Tottenham for a combined \u00a323.5million, Bale joining in 2007 and Modric arriving after Euro 2008.\n\nAsk Comolli why they have had such successful careers and one word crops up again and again - personality. The former Spurs sporting director told Sportsmail: 'Our UK chief scout flagged Bale to us when he was 15 or 16, and we started to follow him up. Maybe he was shy off the pitch or in the changing room, but he was definitely not shy on the pitch, and that's what we loved about him.\n\n'His debut was against Manchester United at Old Trafford, in August 2007, and he was outstanding. It didn't matter where he was playing, he wasn't fazed by anything and showed a lot of personality.\n\n'He seemed immune to pressure, wanting the ball, wanting to take responsibility. Not long after that, he scored a free-kick in the north London derby. We had seen that personality even when he was playing in away games in the Championship with Southampton.\n\nDamien Comolli had been the driving force behind the pair's transfers to Tottenham\n\n'Ten or 15 years ago, clubs didn't focus as much on personality. But the game is so much quicker now, so much more demanding, and clubs cannot have players who hide. Gareth never did, even as a teenager - which is why he's been successful at a club like Real Madrid.'\n\nModric, meanwhile, was scouted while at Dinamo and then Spurs accelerated their move when he inspired Croatia to a 3-2 win at Wembley in November 2007, ensuring England did not qualify for Euro 2008.\n\nTheir best traits then remain their best traits today - Bale is still powerful and athletic and has retained much of his speed, even though he turns 31 next July. At 34, Modric may not cover the ground as quickly as he did once but he is as clever and subtle as ever - and, according to Comolli, even more driven than before.\n\nSpurs had accelerated their move for Modric after his star showing against England in 2007\n\n'I had a long chat with Luka at the Audi Cup in pre-season,' he revealed. 'I found him very ambitious, still wanting trophies, wanting success. Incredible personality.\n\n'It was when Real were being linked with Paul Pogba and Luka was asking me questions about him, his style of play. He was wondering how Pogba might adapt to Real Madrid, how he and Pogba might play together.\n\n'I've lost count of how many medals he's won but he still wants more. The Fenerbahce players and staff asked me about our conversation and I said: \"It's very simple: he's 34 and he's still talking about winning.\" That's why he's at this level.\n\n'When we signed him, people told me he was too small, he didn't score enough, didn't assist enough. What they didn't realise was how he makes a team tick.'\n\nBale's first 18 months in the Premier League were blighted by injury but he soon flourished\n\nDespite their difficult beginnings in the Premier League - Bale's first 18 months were blighted by injury, while Modric did not find form until Harry Redknapp replaced Juande Ramos as manager in October 2008 - Comolli never had doubts about where they were heading.\n\nAs the pair, who have 205 caps between them, prepare to inspire their countries again, it would foolish to bet against them reaching new heights - Bale's gloomy demeanour in Madrid notwithstanding.\n\nComolli added: 'They have a hatred of losing. You do not stay at that level for as long as they have without it. Nobody could be sure they would win all these titles, these Champions League, but it was always clear they would become special players.'", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE: They have shared 15 trophies with Real Madrid, yet on Sunday Gareth Bale and Luka Modric will resume their hunt for the prize they crave just as much.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/23/19610674-0-image-a-68_1570833502324.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
