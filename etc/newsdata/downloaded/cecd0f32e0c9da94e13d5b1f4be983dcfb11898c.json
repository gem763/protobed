Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue\u2014and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country. pic.twitter.com/jE2uiXaENZ \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 15, 2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke has been very vocal about putting the issue of gun control at the forefront of his presidential campaign after a shooter killed 22 people on Aug. 3 in his hometown of El Paso. Part of his plan to tackle gun violence includes a mandatory buyback of assault rifles and a voluntary buyback of handguns.\n\nA mandatory buyback involves the government demanding that owners of assault rifles turn in their weapons in exchange for money. The idea also has been supported by fellow 2020 candidates Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\n\nDemocrats have long argued that passing stricter gun control laws does not mean the government wants to take guns away from law-abiding citizens, making O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201chell, yes\u201d at Thursday\u2019s debate a challenge to his party\u2019s message on guns. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told CNN on Friday that he thinks video of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment \u201cwill be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d\n\nAside from mandatory gun buybacks, Buttigieg and O\u2019Rourke have voiced support for similar gun control legislation, including universal background checks, \u201cred flag\u201d laws and a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.\n\nOn Monday in South Carolina, Buttigieg clarified his remarks from the CNN interview by stressing he wants to focus on \u201cwhat we can do right now\u201d about gun control, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think we can wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less how Republicans are going to react to it,\u201d the military veteran said, according to a transcript from his campaign, again mentioning universal background checks, red flag laws and a ban on new sales of assault rifles. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to mobilize and engage the American majority that can deliver that, because lives are on the line and we can\u2019t afford to wait.\u201d\n\nThough Buttigieg, who is more moderate than many of his fellow Democratic candidates, doesn\u2019t believe now is the time for mandatory buybacks, his campaign would not directly say whether that applies to voluntary buybacks. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a 2020 candidate considered similarly moderate, said after Thursday\u2019s debate that she preferred a voluntary buyback to a mandatory one.\n\nHuffPost recently reported that 52% of all registered voters support a voluntary buyback of assault rifles, including 80% of Democrats; 42% of registered voters support a mandatory program, including 69% of Democrats.", "description": "The two 2020 presidential candidates are sparring over making mandatory buybacks on assault rifles part of Democrats' push for stricter gun control laws.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d801f6b3b00002efad4b507.jpeg?cache=odv9frytjj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
