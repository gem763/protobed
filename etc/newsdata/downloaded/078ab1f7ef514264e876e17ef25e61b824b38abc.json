USA TODAY\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- You wanted drama in the New York Yankees-Minnesota Twins series?\n\nWell, you came to the wrong place.\n\nThe only tension in this American League Division Series was wondering whether Yankees slugger Aaron Judge would spray Budweiser on Giancarlo Stanton, or whether Stanton would douse him with a bottle of champagne first in the celebratory Yankees\u2019 clubhouse.\n\nIt was that kind of series.\n\nIt amounted to nothing more than a bye-week for the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees -- stop us if you heard this before -- swept the Minnesota Twins in three games, winning Monday night, 5-1, in front of a sellout crowd of 41,121 at Target Field, who have seen this act over and over and over again.\n\nWell, the players may have changed, and the years have gone by, but it has all remained the same.\n\nThe Twins still cannot beat the Yankees.\n\nThey have now beaten them 13 consecutive time since Oct. 5, 2004, shattering the all-time postseason record against a single team.\n\nThe Twins and Yankees began facing one another in the playoffs since 1961, and 68 years later, the Twins have still not defeated Yankees in a postseason game in Minnesota.\n\nAnd with the exception of Twins Cy Young winner Johan Santana, no Twins\u2019 pitcher has ever beaten the Yankees in a playoff game.\n\nLuis Severino closes out the second inning fired up. (Photo: Jesse Johnson, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Twins now have lost 16 consecutive postseason games overall, tying the NHL\u2019s Chicago Blackhawks for the longest postseason losing streak in North American Sports history.\n\nWho knew that winning the American League East would guarantee you a first-round bye?\n\nThe Twins tried everything to break the curse.\n\nTwins DH Nelson Cruz addressed the team after their Game 2 loss, reminding them that it was no fluke they won 101 games and hit a major-league record 307 homers.\n\nFormer Twins greats Rod Carew, a Hall of Famer, and Torii Hunter spoke to the hitters Monday before the game, telling them to stop relaying on the home run, and just concentrate on putting the ball in play.\n\nTwins officials cranked up the volume on the loudspeakers, with music blaring louder than it ever has all season, pleading with the sell-out crowd to get crazy, scream, make noise, and do everything possible to turn it into the Midwest version of the Bronx Zoo.\n\nREMEMBER ME? Yankees' forgotten ace\n\nYADI: Cardinals force a decisive Game 5 with Braves\n\nThey even turned out the lights during Yankee pitching changes with the fans using the flashlight on their cell phones as if they were at a Prince concert.\n\nSo, what happens?\n\nWell, the players may have changed, and the years have changes, but everything always remains the same.\n\nWell, if there was any consolation prize for the Twins, at least this one was close.\n\nThe Twins threatened to score throughout the game, but except for Eddie Rosario\u2019s leadoff homer in the eighth, came away empty time and time again.\n\nTheir frustrations were best exemplified in the second inning when they loaded the bases with none out against Yankees pitcher Luis Severino.\n\nMiguel Sano, who hit 34 home runs during the season, hit a high infield pop-up for the first out. Marwin Gonzalez struck out on four pitches. Jake Cave struck out on six pitches.\n\nThe Twins would have runners on first and second in the third inning, and again in the fifth, and a runner on second base with one out in the sixth, and couldn\u2019t bring home a run.\n\nA team that hit 307 homers during the season, with five players hitting 30 or more, the Twins hit only one home run in the last 21 innings.\n\nAnd for a team built on home runs, it was a recipe to be swept out of the playoffs.\n\nThe Yankees now have four days off before they play again on Saturday, facing the winner of the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nPardon the Yankees for rooting for the Rays.\n\nIf nothing else, they\u2019d at least like to see the series go five games, assuring that co-aces Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole would have one less start in their series.\n\n\u201cI think our guys are locked and ready to go,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, \u201cand this time of year, look at those off days as really good recovery days and beneficial. I think we have that mindset.\u2019\u2019\n\nCertainly, they proved against the Twins that their offense is in October-form. The Twins\u2019 starting rotation lasted just 11 innings in the three games, surrendering nine runs and permitting 22 baserunners.\n\nNot a single Twins\u2019 starter lasted past the fifth inning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strength of this team,\u201d Judge says. \u201cOne through nine is going to most likely get to a 3-2 count every single time. You\u2019re going to foul off some pitches, and then if you\u2019re not going to pitch to us, we\u2019ll take our walks.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s selfish, and that\u2019s what makes this team so great. We get into that bullpen early, and when we\u2019re able to get to a bullpen early, especially in a series like this, it helps you out not only in that game, but the next couple games down the road.\u201d\n\nThe next road trip will most likely take them to Houston, where Verlander and Cole await.\n\nThe Yankees are not afraid.\n\nThey are ready for the American League\u2019s main event.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Luis Severino tossed four scoreless  innings en route to a Yankees 5-1 victory.
