But she\u2019s won 32 of 36 matches in a remarkable breakout season, capturing titles at Indian Wells and Toronto while surging up to No 15 in the rankings. It\u2019s been more than six months since she lost a completed match.\n\nNow the indefatigable 19-year-old from the Toronto suburb of Mississauga is one win from a first major championship in only her fourth main-draw appearance at a grand slam and can eclipse a record held by Maria Sharapova, who broke through at 2004 Wimbledon in her seventh attempt.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy.\n\nAndreescu, who is the first man or woman born in the 2000s to reach a final at one of the sport\u2019s four bedrock events, advances to face six-time US Open champion Serena Williams, the No 8 seed who brushed aside Elina Svitolina in Thursday night\u2019s first match and will be taking a fourth crack at moving level with Margaret Court atop the all-time grand slam leaderboard. A triumph for the precocious Canadian would also be notable given that women\u2019s tennis is hardly the province of prodigies and starlets it once was: Not since Sharapova won the 2006 US Open aged 19 has a teenager captured a major title.\n\nThe nearly 19 years between Andreescu and Williams is the largest age difference ever in a women\u2019s grand slam final, eclipsing the previous mark set by 1991 US Open finalists Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles, who were born 17 years and 45 days apart. The pair met once before in last month\u2019s Toronto final when Williams retired with a back injury trailing 1-3 after just 19 minutes.\n\n\u201cHaving those four games against her I think is going to help me on Saturday,\u201d said Andreescu, who is unbeaten in seven career matches against opponents ranked in the top 10.\n\nBencic, who was bidding to become only the second Swiss woman to reach a major final after her longtime mentor Martina Hingis, played a cleaner and steadier baseline game throughout the first set in the grand slam semi-final debut for both players, forcing Andreescu to fight off break points in the fourth, sixth and 10th games. But the 22-year-old lost her nerve in the tie-breaker, making her first double fault of the night followed by a glut of unforced errors to gift Andreescu the opener.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy at all,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cShe hits the ball really hard and really flat I think every shot. My knees were to the ground. It wasn\u2019t too fun playing her. That\u2019s what makes her such a great player.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cBut the main reason I won today I think is because I just kept fighting. I never let up.\u201d\n\nThe world No 12 was able recollect and break Andreescu in her opening service game of the second, then a second time for 4-1. But the highest ranked teenager on the tour found a vein of form as her opponent came apart, keeping Bencic off rhythm with a clever mix of angles, slices, high balls and drop shots and breaking three times as many return games to close the show.\n\n\u201cIt was just here and there, some stupid mistakes from my side, good shots from her side, some lines, some net cords,\u201d said Bencic, who will return to the top 10 in next week\u2019s rankings after a 43-month absence. \u201cTennis is very fast. Things turn around very fast. Unfortunately for me today was the other way.\u201d\n\nAfter she pounded a crisp return into the corner on match point that Bencic could scarcely get a racquet on, Andreescu stood on the baseline with an expression of disbelief.\n\n\u201cA lot of emotions are running through my body right now,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully I can just keep the momentum going for the finals. Hopefully I can play a little bit better than I did today.\u201d", "description": "The 15th-seeded teenager was able to find another level when it mattered most in a 7-6 (3), 7-5 victory over Belinda Bencic to reach the US Open final", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d34c03a32e4b5f06d6cbb4df08cee853ede0e0/0_177_4627_2777/master/4627.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=172bd30def4208f56ea5bf85edd4909f", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
