From the Daily Caller:\n\nThe Department of Labor reinstated a political appointee Wednesday night who resigned under pressure after a Bloomberg Law reporter accused him of anti-Semitism for a Facebook post in which he was actually condemning anti-Semites in the alt-right, the Daily Caller News Foundation exclusively learned. Acting Secretary Patrick Pizzella \u201cpersonally made this decision after carefully reviewing all the facts and circumstances,\u201d a senior Labor Department official told the DCNF. \u201cHe concluded that a correction is much better than an injustice.\u201d\n\nYes, a correction is better than an injustice. If only Bloomberg understood that principle.\n\nIt was immediately obvious to anyone who cared to look at what Leif Olson had written on Facebook that he was not making an anti-Semitic comment. In an obviously sarcastic, conspiratorial tone, Olson wrote, \u201cNeo-cons are all Upper East Side Zionists who don\u2019t golf on Saturday if you know what I mean.\u201d The comment and the post it was part of were intended to mock Breitbart News and the Paul Nehlen campaign to unseat Paul Ryan.\n\nOne of the only remaining hooks reporter Ben Penn had to hang his inaccurate story on was a quote by the Anti-Defamation League condemning Olson\u2019s comments. However, the ADL also corrected itself: \u201cWe appreciate Mr. Olson\u2019s clarification that he intended to be sarcastic with his posts, and accept his explanation of the content in question.\u201d\n\nEven Vox published a story saying Olson had obviously been wrongly accused.\n\nDespite this, Bloomberg refused to back down. When asked for a comment by the Post\u2019s Erik Wemple, Bloomberg replied, \u201cWe stand by our reporting.\u201d\n\nAsked Bloomberg for a comment on the @benjaminpenn story on Leif Olson. https://t.co/Nt7fQGxMUT The response is unsurprising and highly disappointing: pic.twitter.com/oX1c9a8wcI \u2014 ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) September 3, 2019\n\nBloomberg\u2019s response seems to lean on the idea that all they did was ask questions and the DOL responded with news of Olson\u2019s resignation. What we don\u2019t know is what Ben Penn told the Department of Labor when he initially contacted them. Did he clearly state that the comments were anti-Semitic as he did in the tweet below or did he present a balanced view of the comments?\n\nThis is the latest in a series of mishaps under the Trump administration personnel vetting system. What makes this one remarkable is that Olson's Facebook page was public to his non-friends. Any cursory screening of his social media accounts could've uncovered the anti-Semitism. \u2014 Ben Penn (@benjaminpenn) September 3, 2019\n\nI guess the only question left is what Bloomberg will do now that this splashy story has completely collapsed. As of this moment, the story still hasn\u2019t been updated or corrected despite a clearly false headline that reads \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d Bottom line: There were no anti-Semitic Facebook posts just a garbage story by a hack reporter.", "description": "\"...a correction is much better than an injustice.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Department-of-Labor.jpg"}
