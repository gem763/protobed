But the aftermath of the festival proves to be hazardous, especially for the capital city of the country. Even after awareness about the harms of burning fire crackers, people go forth with it, considering it to be a part of their tradition, not realizing that it is DEEPawali, a festival of lights and not of noise and air pollution.\n\nWe know from the news (and personal experience) that the air quality in Delhi had been worsening since before the festival, what with stubble and illegal garbage dumps burning in NCR, but last night, the city felt like it would choke.\n\nAnd not just Delhi, worsening of air in different parts of the country, especially North India, due to the bursting of fire crackers is being reported.\n\nANI shared pictures of people bursting crackers on Marine Drive on Diwali night. It might seem beautiful but the truth of the matter is, no one cleaned the mess up after their night of festivities.\n\nMaharashtra: People bursting crackers at Marine Drive in Mumbai. #Diwali pic.twitter.com/g8pMs9yw0S \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 27, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 3 K SHARES 570 SHARES 203 SHARES\n\nANI tweeted some pictures from Moradabad showing the cracker waste left behind by people.

Rather than having filters to protect from pollution it seems the car is absorbing the pollution, making us the air purifier of the streets.#HappyDeepavali #AirPollution @AQI_India @pranaair pic.twitter.com/99C2TcViuX \u2014 Caroline Hasl (@CarolineHasl) October 27, 2019\n\nJust landed in Delhi after the good air in Goa. pic.twitter.com/QsXPkIhfO1 \u2014 Shikhar Verma (@shikhar2907) October 27, 2019\n\nAll these images have been retweeted by AQI India.\n\nIn some places in Delhi NCR, the pollution levels are 16-20 times higher than the safe limit. We are literally breathing poison and it is all the consequence of #crackerwalidiwali that some people seem to be proud to celebrate.\n\nWhen people are suggested to not do something that harms the environment, especially at a time when we are witnessing the effects of climate change unfold in front of our eyes, it is not an attack on a religion or its tradition. It is simply prioritising what is more important- human life.", "description": "Diwali is probably the most anticipated festival of the year for a lot of people.
