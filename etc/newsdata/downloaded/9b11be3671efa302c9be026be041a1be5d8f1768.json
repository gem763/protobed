(AP) - Progress can happen rapidly when a new coaching staff is trying to rebuild a football program.\n\nNeal Brown and Les Miles took that notion to the extreme.\n\nAfter watching West Virginia get dominated by Missouri on the road, Brown spent last week on the sideline as his Mountaineers ran roughshod over North Carolina State. And a week after Kansas lost to lowly Coastal Carolina at home, Miles had the Jayhawks flying high in a win at Boston College.\n\nTwo good wins for the Big 12. Two bad losses for the ACC.\n\nNow, the Mountaineers (2-1) and Jayhawks (2-1) begin conference play when they meet Saturday at Memorial Stadium. West Virginia has won eight of nine in the series, though with a pair of new coaches on the sideline - and after the last couple weeks - nobody knows quite what to expect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to handle the trip much better than the first away game we had,\u201d said Brown, who took over for the departed Dana Holgorsen after a successful four-year stint at Troy.\n\nWell, the Jayhawks have to defend their home field a lot better than last time, too.\n\n\u201cThe guys have accomplished to a point,\u201d Miles said, \u201cand now it\u2019s about the next things we set our sails on doing. I certainly like where we\u2019re at and I think our team will really be motivated to do special things. They understand they\u2019ve done a couple. Now, is there more to it?\u201d\n\nThe opener is crucial for both coaches for a couple reasons: They want to keep the momentum going from last year, start the Big 12 off with a bang and they certainly don\u2019t want to lose to a team that many pundits consider their biggest competition for the conference cellar.\n\nIn the last decade, Kansas has managed just six conference wins. Never during that stretch have the Jayhawks had more than one; their lone victory in 2013 was over the Mountaineers.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun to see our hard work and preparation pay off last week,\u201d Kansas quarterback Carter Stanley said. \u201cBut win or lose, you have to flush it on Sunday. It\u2019s a new week and it\u2019s up to us to see what we can do with it.\u201d\n\nOPTIMISTIC FEELINGS\n\nKansas started last season 2-1, too, but lost eight of its last nine games in another dismal year that ultimately cost David Beaty his job. But the Jayhawks\u2019 48-24 rout of Boston College left them with a sense of progress under Miles, who is no stranger to building a program.\n\n\u201cThis year it definitely has a different feeling,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIt was a really good feeling how we went out there and executed. It just feels like we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nBATTLING COMPLACENCY\n\nOne thing Kansas hasn\u2019t had to deal with lately is complacency, simply because the program hasn\u2019t had many opportunities to play after a win. But it\u2019s not something that Miles is worried about.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re used to winning and winning and winning, it becomes old hat,\u201d he said.\n\nBUSH IS BACK\n\nSlot receiver Tevin Bush returns to West Virginia\u2019s lineup after serving a one-game suspension for an unspecified violation of team rules. The 5-foot-6 junior is the team\u2019s second-leading receiver with 95 yards on six catches.\n\nO-LINE ISSUES\n\nWest Virginia has played musical chairs on the offensive line with eight different starters so far. Some of it was due to illness or injury, some because the coaching staff wasn\u2019t seeing results. After the Mountaineers struggled to establish the run over its first two games, averaging just 1.1 yard per carry, they ran for 173 in the 44-27 win over North Carolina State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our O-line,\u201d said wide receiver Sam James, who had nine catches for 155 yards against the Wolfpack. \u201cThey fought through adversity, people criticizing them and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nHELLO, CUZ\n\nKansas offensive coordinator Les Koenning and West Virginia defensive coordinator Vic Koenning are cousins. Les pronounces his name KEN-ing, Vic pronounces his KONE-ing.\n\nVic Koenning said he didn\u2019t find out about the kinship until later in life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a long story,\u201d said Koenning, who knew of Les Koenning when the latter was a wide receiver in the 1970s. They ran into each other years later at a coaching convention.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be related to me,\u2019\u201d Vic Koenning said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Progress can happen rapidly when a new coaching staff is trying to rebuild a football program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/kansas_boston_college_football_72541_c0-109-2605-1627_s1770x1032.jpg?0821e7840380039e2352ea008311238a3960cb38", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
