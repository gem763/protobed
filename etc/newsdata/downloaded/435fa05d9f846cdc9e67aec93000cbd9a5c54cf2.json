But we were very anxious because there was such a build up, as you know.\n\n'The bottomline would have been if the fans were disappointed, we would have been mortified, because that's what this movie is about.\n\n'It was demanded by them, it had to be enjoyed by them and thank God it has been, so we are all genuinely blown away.'\n\n'We did not see it coming that we would beat Brad Pitt and Rambo.
