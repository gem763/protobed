But it\u2019s always had a questionable reputation among many money managers because of its volatility and difficulty in valuing.\n\nNow, InvestmentNews cites a study showing that a 5% allocation to the yellow metal improves the risk-adjusted performance of a standard portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds.\n\nFor optimal risk-adjusted performance, as measured by the Sharpe ratio, the standard 60-40 portfolio should be set at 60% stocks, 5% bonds and 35% gold, according to GraniteShares\u2019 research.\n\n\u201cAdding gold to a portfolio improves the Sharpe ratio, and a 35% allocation is optimal,\u201d said Will Rhind, founder and chief executive of GraniteShares, an ETF provider whose funds include the GraniteShares Gold Trust ETF (BAR). Rhind adds: \u201cGold has more value in a portfolio than most people think.\u201d\n\nWhen the analysis was pushed back to the beginning of 2000, it showed that adding an allocation of just 5% gold provided superior or equal risk-adjusted returns to a 60-40 portfolio 79% of the time.\n\n\u201cPeople often only think about how something correlates to equities, but you really need to think about how it correlates to everything else in the portfolio,\u201d said Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares. \u201cGold is essentially noncorrelated to all market factors,\u201d Giannotto said, pointing out that over the past 20 years gold has had a 0.007 correlation to equities and a 0.16 correlation to bonds. For perspective, consider that the historical correlation of utilities to equities is 0.6, and the correlation of real estate to equities is 0.7.\n\n--John Kimelman", "description": "Study shows a 35% allocation to gold improves risk-adjusted performance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106587/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
