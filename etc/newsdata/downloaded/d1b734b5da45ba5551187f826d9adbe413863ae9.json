This is worse than McCarthy. How about a total illicit impeachment proceeding? This is an illicit, rogue impeachment proceeding,\u201d Giuliani told host Laura Ingraham.\n\nGIULIANI HIRES FORMER WATERGATE PROSECUTOR JON SALE AS PERSONAL ATTORNEY AMID IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nThe former mayor of New York City suggested that some House Democrats were guilty of violating Article II of the Constitution, which outlines the president\u2019s powers during his four-year term as commander in chief, specifically his power to conduct the foreign policy of the United States. He also said he may sue Democrats in Congress for allegedly violating attorney-client privilege and over obstruction-of-justice claims.\n\nThe chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed Giuliani on Monday, seeking key documents related to the Ukraine controversy as part of their Trump impeachment inquiry. Giuliani lawyered up Tuesday, hiring former Watergate prosecutor John Sale.\n\nThough still mounting a defense, Giuliani claimed he has evidence, in the form of video recordings and interview notes, which are protected from an additional subpoena under the statute of attorney-client privilege. He said the evidence incriminates House Democrats for allegedly trying to threaten foreign powers into keeping quiet amid the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe pointed to the example of Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who last month boasted to reporters, including conservative columnist John Solomon, that he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that cooperating with Trump and Giuliani would be viewed as election meddling and would be \u201cdisastrous for long-term U.S.-Ukraine relations,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\nGiuliani also accused mainstream media organizations of bias, claiming they turned a blind eye to the Ukraine activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201c[The media] are covering up for the Democrats because they are more corrupt than anyone realizes. They are covering up serious crimes that were committed against the United States by the Bidens and taking millions and multimillions of dollars and putting the United States in a very compromised position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[The media] are covering up for the Democrats because they are more corrupt than anyone realizes. They are covering up serious crimes that were committed against the United States by the Bidens and taking millions and multimillions of dollars and putting the United States in a very compromised position.\u201d \u2014 Rudy Giuliani\n\nGiuliani said Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress are trying to silence him and Attorney General William Barr solely because they are effective in their legal defense of the president. Biden's presidential campaign requested in a letter Sunday that major news networks not invite Giuliani on air anymore, after Giuliani spent the morning on a series of talk shows aggressively highlighting what he called Biden's apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\nIngraham mentioned members of Congress are given immunity from prosecution in regard to comments made during legislative sessions. Giuliani said he would come after House Democrats for their remarks made outside of Congress, include Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who recently tweeted that Trump should be kept in solitary confinement, and another unnamed congressmen who allegedly said Barr should be arrested.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBiden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where his son Hunter Biden had a highly lucrative role on the board paying him tens of thousands of dollars per month, despite limited relevant expertise. The elder Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re, Brooke Singman and Blake Burman contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday he\u2019s considering individual lawsuits against House Democrats for allegedly violating the constitutional and civil rights of the president and members of his administration amid new congressional inquiries and subpoenas resulting from a\u00a0whistleblower\u2019s complaint.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "Rudy Giuliani"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/guiliani.jpg"}
