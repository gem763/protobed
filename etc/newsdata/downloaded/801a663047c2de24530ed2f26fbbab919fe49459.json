The whole expectation of her being Katie Price \u2013 this glamour model \u2013 you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s going to be amazing but then it\u2019s an anti-climax.\u2019\n\nOuch.\n\nKatie\u2019s reps responded to Charles\u2019 comments and told The Mirror: \u2018Given what she now knows about him it was inevitable he would sell a story to try to publicise himself.\n\n\u2018Kris and Kate are over Charles who is behaving like the little boy he is.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
