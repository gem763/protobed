To view the full results of the survey, visit APM Research Lab.\n\nWith the cost of college steadily rising, and student debt continuing to overwhelm millions of borrowers, it would make sense if young adults questioned the value of a bachelor\u2019s degree. But more than half of them still believe it\u2019s worth the price tag.\n\nAmong 18- to 34-year-olds, 59 percent believe four-year schools are worth the cost, according to a new survey from American Public Media\u2019s APM Research Lab and The Hechinger Report. While that\u2019s about the same percentage for those of middle age who answered the same question (60 percent of adults ranging from ages 35 to 54), it\u2019s noteworthy that so many millennials and Generation Z adults share this belief. They are the ones most burdened by student loans.\n\n\u201cCost is all about what you truly think the value of it is,\u201d said Anthony Bernazani, a 34-year old graduate of a community college and a four-year school, George Mason University, both in Virginia. Bernazani, a defense contractor, believes that because of the job opportunities, salary and intellectual gains that can come with a degree, \u201cthe value that you get out of it is worth the cost.\u201d\n\nMore than half of college students under age 30 took on debt to pay for their education, according to the Federal Reserve. The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that 45 percent of families whose head of household is below age 35 have student debt, but that percentage drops to 34 percent for those ages 35 to 44 and even lower for those 45 and older.\n\n\u201cCost is all about what you truly think the value of it is.\u201d Anthony Bernazani, a 34-year old graduate of George Mason University in Virginia\n\nDespite the weight of student loans, borrowing for a bachelor\u2019s degree offers a return on investment that will last a lifetime, higher education experts say.\n\nWith a four-year degree, \u201con average you make two-thirds more than high school graduates do,\u201d said James Kvaal, president of the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit group that works to improve college access and affordability. \u201cYou\u2019re only about half as likely to be unemployed. It is worth borrowing money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that idea of long-term gain over short-term pain that may be spurring young adults to keep borrowing, even as national student loan balances increased by $15 billion in the last quarter of 2018, according to the Center for Microeconomic Data at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nRelated: Americans don\u2019t realize state funding for higher ed is falling, new poll finds\n\n\u201cI think people recognize, especially young Americans, that if you don\u2019t go to college, you don\u2019t have a lot of opportunities and avenues available to you,\u201d said Rachel Fishman, deputy director for higher education research at New America, a think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd compared to a certificate or an associate degree, on average, \u201cthe bachelor\u2019s degree still performs better over someone\u2019s lifetime in terms of return on investment,\u201d she said.\n\nConsidering these statistics, she\u2019s surprised more young adults don\u2019t believe a four-year degree is worth the cost.\n\nAmong 18- to 34-year-olds, 59% believe four-year schools are worth the cost, according to a new survey from American Public Media\u2019s APM Research Lab and The Hechinger Report.\n\n\u201cI think it is a reflection of the anxiety people are feeling over how expensive a four-year degree in specific has gotten, and how a lot of the financing, especially for low- and middle-income students, for a four-year degree is going to take the form of a loan,\u201d Fishman said.\n\nAverage one-year costs for tuition, fees and room and board at public colleges totaled $21,370 for in-state students and $37,430 for out-of-state students this year, and $48,510 for private college students, according to the College Board.\n\nAbout 36 percent all American adults, regardless of age, believe college is not worth the cost, according to the APM-Hechinger Report survey. Of that 36 percent, 60 percent think the statement \u201cpeople often graduate without specific job skills and with a large amount of debt\u201d more closely aligns with their reasoning; 36 percent believe the statement \u201cyou can get a good job without a four-year degree\u201d comes closest to their reasoning.\n\nLee Leon is one young adult who\u2019s skeptical about the cost of college matching up to its worth.\n\n\u201cI went to college, and it just got me in a lot of debt,\u201d said the 29-year-old. She said her student loan debt was about $15,000.\n\nLeon, like Bernazani, took the survey, but her college experience was very different from his. Bernazani\u2019s parents paid for his education, but Leon used loans.\n\nShe took classes for four years at Saint Paul College in St. Paul, Minnesota, but dropped out because of health issues in 2012. \u201cI just started working,\u201d she said. She took jobs at Burger King and did other food services and customer service work. Her pay was around $7 or $8 an hour.\n\nWhile a majority of Americans believe college is worth the cost, an even greater percentage believe public college should be free.\n\n\u201cI had to pay a lot of my student loans back with, you know, my taxes,\u201d she said, adding that her wages were garnished.\n\nShe now works as a peer recovery coach for people struggling with addiction.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really need a college degree to get to where I am,\u201d she said. Leon makes between $16 and $18 an hour, she said.\n\nStudents who borrow and don\u2019t complete their degree are most at risk of not paying their student loans, which can make college seem less worth the cost.\n\n\u201cPeople who have low loan balances are actually the most likely to default on their loans out of any other group,\u201d said Fishman.\n\nAbout 11 percent of borrowers default on their student loans, according to the Department of Education.\n\nRelated: College spending comes under closer scrutiny\n\nCollege students and graduates are less likely to default with $100,000 in debt, for example, than with $7,000 in debt, Fishman said. Those with a smaller amount of debt probably went to school for a year and don\u2019t have much to show for it, or obtained a short-term credential that has a low return on investment. But if you have $100,000 in debt you probably have a graduate or professional degree, she said.\n\n\u201cYour debt-to-income ratio is going to look a lot different in those situations,\u201d Fishman said.\n\nSystemic racism may also influence whether college graduates see the cost as worth it.\n\n\u201cBlack borrowers in general across all income categories are more reliant on debt financing for their higher education. Even when they get a degree they still face labor market discrimination,\u201d Fishman said. The wage gap between black and white employees grew the most among those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, according to a 2016 report from the Economic Policy Institute on race and salary earnings covering a 36-year period ending in 2016.\n\nBorrowing makes sense for students from middle- and upper-middle-income households because they probably won\u2019t get a lot of grant aid, Fishman said. She encourages students to be prudent, though, when taking out loans.\n\n\u201cYou should take borrowing seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should not necessarily be scared of it, if it is the right decision for you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important, she said, for prospective students to pay attention to the student outcomes at schools they\u2019re considering: \u201cMake sure the graduation rates are good for students that look like you.\u201d\n\nThis story about the value of higher education was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.
