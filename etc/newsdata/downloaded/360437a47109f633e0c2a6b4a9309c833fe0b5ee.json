They\u2019re not. Like really, really not.\n\nFor one thing, the Obama administration was trying to get a corrupt prosecutor removed so that a more aggressive prosecutor would take over. For another, this was counter to the interests of Hunter Biden\u2019s client. It\u2019s exactly the opposite of what Biden would have done if he had been trying to help out his son\u2019s business.\n\nBut you\u2019ll never go broke betting against the reading comprehension of the American people. And if you can weaken Biden enough so that Elizabeth Warren can overtake him for the Democratic nomination, then suddenly Trump has the best-possible matchup for 2020.\n\nTake a look at the polling data: of the more than 70 head-to-head polls on Trump versus Biden taken so far, Biden has led Every. Single. One. As Harry Enten notes, \u201cI\u2019m not sure folks appreciate how unusual Biden holding a 10+ pt lead on Trump is at this point. No incumbent since at least WWII was down by anything close to that at this point.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Last", "Thebulwark.Com Republicans-Have-Four-Options-On-Trump-And-The-Ukraine-Theyre-All-Bad"], "top_image": ""}
