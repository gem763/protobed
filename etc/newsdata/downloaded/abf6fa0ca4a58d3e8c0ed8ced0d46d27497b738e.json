The central bank has cut rates twice so far in 2019.\n\nBut they pared bets the central bank would need to move to full-on crisis-fighting mode, and overall traders no longer saw a fourth rate cut in 2019 to be a likely scenario.\n\n\u201cInvestors are on high alert for signs of a recession, (but the jobs report) doesn\u2019t confirm the story,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a goldilocks report. It\u2019s not strong enough to move the Federal Reserve away from cutting rates at the end of October but it\u2019s not weak enough to make you concerned about the labor market or the consumer.\u201d\n\nThe report showed unemployment fell to 3.5% last month as U.S. employers added 136,000 jobs, down from 168,000 jobs created in August but still plenty to keep up with labor market growth.\n\nFed policymakers for years had forecast just such a moderation in jobs gains as the labor market reaches full potential, one of the Fed\u2019s two goals.\n\nSome policymakers, perhaps including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker who opposed the Fed\u2019s most recent rate cut, may take this emerging equilibrium in the labor market as more reason for the Fed to stand pat for the rest of the year.\n\nIn September, economic projections showed most Fed policymakers expected no further rate cuts this year.\n\nAt the same time, though, average hourly earnings were unchanged from the prior month, suggesting little upward lift to inflation that has lagged stubbornly below the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal.\n\nThat\u2019s sure to disappoint other policymakers, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who has wanted the Fed to make bigger rate cuts in part to aid the pocketbooks of regular Americans. In September, seven of the Fed\u2019s 17 policymakers signaled they thought the Fed would need to ease policy further by the end of the year, even as the median forecast was for no move.\n\nWith little that\u2019s policy-decisive to emerge from the final monthly jobs report before the Fed\u2019s next meeting on Oct. 29-30, U.S. central bankers are likely to continue to argue over what is \u201cappropriate\u201d to sustain the expansion and, as Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said late Thursday, take rate-cut decisions one meeting at a time.\n\n\u201cI look at a large number of indicators... I don\u2019t think recession risk is particularly elevated, under appropriate monetary policy,\u201d Clarida said, without saying exactly what appropriate monetary policy might be.\n\nThe Trump administration meanwhile kept up its pressure on the Fed to cut interest rate further. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro told CNN Friday the dollar is overvalued and is \u201ckilling\u201d U.S. exports, and he called for aggressive Fed policy easing in response. Trade data released Friday showed U.S. exports gained slightly in August.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board building on Constitution Avenue is pictured in Washington, U.S., March 19, 2019.
