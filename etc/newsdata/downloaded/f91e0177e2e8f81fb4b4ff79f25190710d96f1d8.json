REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\n\nThe pact will be signed by Argentine and Chinese officials in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, Argentina\u2019s agriculture ministry said in a statement. Last month Chinese officials inspected Argentine soymeal factories in the run-up to signing the pact.\n\nArgentina had tried for years to break into the Chinese market, the biggest consumer of the meal it uses to feed its massive hog herd. China, with its own crushing industry to protect, had steadfastly resisted.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war, however, strengthened Argentina\u2019s hand, prompting China to expand its soymeal import options, market sources say.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic agreement,\u201d Gustavo Idigoras, president of Argentina\u2019s CIARA-CEC chamber of grains exporting companies told Reuters, though he added the deal still required a two-step process of plant authorizations and then registrations that could take several more months.\n\n\u201cShipments aren\u2019t expected to start immediately.\u201d\n\nThe meal manufactured in the giant crushing plants that dot the banks of Argentina\u2019s Parana River, clustered around the country\u2019s main grains hub of Rosario, is exported mostly to Southeast Asia, Europe and Northern Africa. China imports only small amounts of soymeal currently, none of it from Argentina.\n\nArgentina, the top global exporter of processed soy, expects to export a total of 26 million tonnes of soymeal this year globally, and 8.5 million tonnes of raw beans.\n\n\u201cIt is excellent and timely news. Argentina needs to add more value to its exports to China and the world,\u201d said Luis Zubizarreta, president of Argentina\u2019s ACSOJA soy industry organization that represents farmers, exporters and seed firms.\n\nThe pact provided a welcome respite from the bad news that has hammered Argentina\u2019s economy in recent months. The country is in recession and inflation is expected at 55% this year.\n\nBusiness-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who is facing an uphill fight for a second term in an Oct. 27 election, said the agreement would bolster jobs in the agricultural sector and create more opportunities for Argentine farmers.\n\n\u201cOur country is the top exporter of soybean meal and now one of the largest markets in the world has been opened,\u201d he said.", "description": "China will allow the import of soymeal livestock feed from Argentina for the first time under a deal announced by Buenos Aires on Tuesday, an agreement that will link the world's top exporter of the feed with the top global consumer.", "authors": ["Hugh Bronstein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428453665&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8923X", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
