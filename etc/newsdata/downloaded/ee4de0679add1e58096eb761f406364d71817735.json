Lloyds, which is the most exposed British lender to PPI damages, said the uncertainty on payouts meant it would have to suspend around a third of its 1.75 billion-pound buyback this year.\n\n\u201cThe board will give consideration to the distribution of surplus capital at the year end and continues to target a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend,\u201d the firm said.\n\nThe PPI scandal is one of the costliest in history for U.K. banks. The policies, which were intended to cover missed debt repayments, were often sold using aggressive tactics and in the worst cases, banks misled customers by telling them that PPI was mandatory for loans.\n\nLloyds said it received about 600,000 to 800,000 PPI information requests per week during the deadline month, well above its previous assumption of 190,000 per week. The bank\u2019s shares fell as much as 2.3% in London morning trade.\n\nLast week Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said it plans to set aside as much as 900 million pounds more as customers sought to beat the August regulatory deadline and CYBG Plc, the owner of the Virgin Money brand, provisioned an extra 300 million pounds to 450 million pounds. British banks have provisioned about $55 billion so far.\n\n(Adds more detail from second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Viren Vaghela in London at vvaghela1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ambereen Choudhury at achoudhury@bloomberg.net, Marion Dakers, Keith Campbell\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Lloyds Banking Group Plc suspended its share buyback after a last minute rush of compensation claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its running total to 21.8 billion pounds ($26.7 billion) for the scandal.The bank is making a further provision of between 1.2 billion", "authors": ["Viren Vaghela"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/THFUVAVZAfuNXTA9tEDfYg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8ba783fe05784cbb26e1b45cd152ca07", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
