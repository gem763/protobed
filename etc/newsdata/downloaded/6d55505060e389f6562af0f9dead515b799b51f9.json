Bongarts/Getty Images 6/26 Andre Silva, Eintracht Frankfurt Andre Silva has yet to find a real home since leaving Porto in 2017 after a promising loan spell with Sevilla petered out last season. He will be tasked with replacing some of Luka Jovic\u2019s goals in Frankfurt. Getty Images 7/26 Bruno Fernandes, Sporting Lisbon One of the best players in this year's competition, Bruno Fernandes will be keen to further impress Europe\u2019s biggest clubs after a move out of Portugal failed to materialise this summer.

Liverpool FC via Getty Images 13/26 Enric Gallego, Getafe In the space of three years, Gallego has gone from part-time footballer/bricklayer to playing in a continental competition. The 33-year-old striker is a real feel-good story.

Arsenal FC via Getty Images 16/26 Fyodor Chalov, CSKA Moscow Chalov is thought to be the future of the Russian national team, but at 21 is already a very capable goalscorer - he has 30 goals in 74 games for his club.

AFP/Getty Images 21/26 Myron Boadu, AZ Alkmaar Boadu is just 18 but has netted three goals in five Eredivisie games for Alkmaar, and will be eager to put on a show when he travels to Old Trafford in a few weeks time. AFP/Getty Images 22/26 Morgan Gibbs-White, Wolves As Nuno Espirito Santo is yet to fully trust Gibbs-White with a significant role in the Premier League, the Englishman is another who will be keen to impress his manager. Getty Images 23/26 Moussa Marega, Porto Porto\u2019s main man is Moussa Marega, and the Malian boasts an impressive record of 33 goals in 67 Primeira Liga games.
