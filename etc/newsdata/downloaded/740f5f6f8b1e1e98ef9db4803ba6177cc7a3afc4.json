I mean they are very high-speed corners here and the wind affected it a lot,\u201d said world champion Marc Marquez, who admitted he was pushed to his limits.\n\n\u201cWhen you ride at 330 kph on the straight it (the bike) was shaking a lot. Tomorrow is another day and for the safely of the riders were decided to go back (to the paddock).\u201d\n\nThe new timetable will see Q1 and Q2 held in the morning \u2014 weather permitting \u2014 with the race itself pushed back an hour.\n\nIf qualifying cannot be held, the grid order will be based on the current combined practice results.\n\nThat would put Yamaha\u2019s Maverick Vinales, who won in Australia last year and topped all three completed sessions, on pole ahead of Ducati\u2019s Andrea Dovizioso and Honda\u2019s Cal Crutchlow.\n\nMarquez is currently sixth, a place ahead of veteran Italian Valentino Rossi, who will be riding in his 400th Grand Prix on Sunday.", "description": "Phillip Island (Australia) (AFP) \u2013 Qualifying for the Australian MotoGP was cancelled Saturday as fierce winds caused havoc at the beachside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/0a0dd3_winds-whipping-phillip-island-circuit-10-22-strong-field-didn-set-lap-time-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
