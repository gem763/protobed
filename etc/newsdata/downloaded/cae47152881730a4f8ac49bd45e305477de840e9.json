He said that people were inside the house at the time of the incident and that law enforcement tried to communicate with the suspect inside.\n\nEventually, the suspect came out and was placed under arrest, police said.\n\nAD\n\nThe man police arrested was identified as Deaundrye Thompson, 36, of Northwest Washington, and he was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, police said.\n\nAD\n\nCarroll said the incident was isolated and happened at what police think was an after-hours location. He said there appeared to have been a party, and a fight broke out during the gathering. It was not immediately clear what sparked the disagreement.\n\nCarroll said no weapons were found initially, but officers were expecting to search the property. No one was hurt, and the streets were reopened just before 10 a.m.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Police received a report around 4 a.m. Wednesday of a possible burglary.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/upgqC-XJpROQilpPV80ffudxoyQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UTYPRYW4DYI6PKCBEBTPV5ZR54.jpg"}
