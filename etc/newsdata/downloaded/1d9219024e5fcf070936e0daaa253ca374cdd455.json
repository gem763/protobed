USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 One of the greatest things the tech world brought us is gadgets. From tricked-out smartphones and notebooks to cloud-connected smart home appliances, the industry has built a massive economy around cool tech devices that now sit at the heart of our daily lives.\n\nUntil now, the vast majority of groundbreaking products have been based on company-specific advances \u2013 think Apple\u2019s iOS and the iPhone it enabled. As we head toward a decade change, however, we\u2019re on the cusp of a new era in which those proprietary capabilities become nearly irrelevant.\n\nIronically, it was this week's launch of a number of very Microsoft-specific advances to their Surface line of devices that really hit this point home. On the, ahem, surface of it, Microsoft unveiled the latest generation of their notebook, tablet and 2-in-1 products \u2013 all to be available this year \u2013 and previewed some intriguing new dual-screen foldable devices they will be bringing to market for holiday 2020.\n\nWhat's new from Microsoft: An Android Surface 'phone' and dual-screen Windows PC\n\nGalaxy Fold review: 5 things to consider as Samsung's second-try $2,000 phone goes on sale\n\nThe Surface Laptop 3, now available in both 13-inch and 15-inch screen sizes, the Surface Pro 7 and even the Surface Pro X \u2013 which features a Microsoft labeled SQ1 chip built in conjunction with Qualcomm \u2013 are extensions to the company\u2019s now well-known and successful line of mobile computers.\n\nEach of the new products featured exactly the kind of improvements you\u2019d expect them to have \u2013 faster processors, more storage, new connectors, better battery life, etc. All of the enhancements are important and highlight the company\u2019s desire to continue refining the Surface experience, but frankly, they\u2019re not that exciting.\n\nThe Surface Pro X does up the game to a degree by being the company\u2019s first Windows on ARM-based Always Connected PC, or ACPC. What that means is the processor, which is based on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chips used in other ACPCs, as well as many Android-based smartphones, isn\u2019t based on the x86 instruction set used in Intel and AMD chips, but rather ARM instructions that are commonly used in smartphones and other non-PC devices.\n\nThankfully, you\u2019ll never have to worry about it because all existing Windows applications will function on the device \u2013 but how they run under the hood is a bit different.\n\nTwo key benefits of using the ACPC architecture is that it gives longer battery life than traditional notebooks, and it includes a built-in LTE modem, allowing it to be always connected to the Internet (as long as you sign up for a data plan for it with your carrier).\n\nOne other clever feature of the Surface Pro X is that it features a special carrying and charging pocket for the included pen in the magnetically attached keyboard you use with the device. As with other Surfaces, you can use the pen for note-taking, annotations, drawing and much more.\n\nIn the foreground, left to right, are Microsoft's new Surface Neo, Surface Duo, and Surface Earbuds.

In sum, Microsoft highlighted several new processors with their traditional partner Intel (including the first-ever usage of a forthcoming Intel Lakefield chip in next year\u2019s Surface Duo foldable device), and the first-ever partnerships with both Qualcomm and AMD for CPUs inside their devices.\n\nThe AMD news was particularly sweet for the company because the special semi-custom Ryzen CPU that AMD created for Microsoft is going into its highest-performing new device, the Surface Laptop 3 15-inch version. After having been seen as a lower-cost, lower-performing alternative to Intel for many years, jumping into a higher-end, faster performing device says a great deal about how far AMD has come recently.\n\nIn addition to the technical details, what\u2019s interesting about these new CPU choices is that it essentially evens the playing field and turns what used to be considered a critical differentiator into a simple question of choice. Yes, there will certainly be differences among the devices that support the new chips, but having Intel-, AMD- and Qualcomm-based options means that Microsoft essentially believes none is more important than the other.\n\n10/2/19 10:08:55 AM -- New York, NY -- Microsoft unveiling event. - Panos Panay is the chief product officer of Microsoft , with a surface laptop Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY staff ORG XMIT: RD 138286 Microsoft unveil 10/2/2019 (Via OlyDrop) (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY)\n\nThis sense of equality extended to operating systems as well, most notably on the Surface Neo and Surface Duo foldable devices. The Intel Lakefield-based Neo will run a new variant of Windows called Windows 10X that\u2019s optimized for dual-screen devices. The similar-looking \u201cmini me\u201d version of the Neo is the smartphone-like Surface Duo, which will be based on Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and run Google\u2019s Android.\n\nAgain, there will obviously be differences between Windows 10X and Android, but Microsoft is working to provide as similar an experience as possible across the two devices. The primary way they intend to do that is through Microsoft applications \u2013including mobile versions of Office apps \u2013 as well as some UI extensions to Android that Microsoft has already worked with Google to create.\n\nThe reason this is all happening now is because of our growing dependence on cloud-based applications and services. This development has been going on for several years.\n\nWe have now reached a point, however, where the underlying device operating system used on different devices simply doesn\u2019t matter anymore \u2013 everything is delivered from the cloud and can be done so in a consistent way across different platforms, screen sizes and chips running inside. Sure, people are going to continue caring about specific devices and will continue to look for features or functions that provide meaningful differentiation across a diverse set of product choices.\n\nFundamentally, though, we\u2019re about to embark on an age when some of what used to be the most important factors in selecting one product over another become less so and we\u2019ll have a much wider range (and likely larger collection) of devices we can use to achieve whatever it is we want to do.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.
