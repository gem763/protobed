He said that he felt faint which prompted him to pull over and rest.\n\nHe added that he had been out with friends for dinner but began feeling lightheaded on his way home.\n\nHe admitted that the engine was still running when he passed out.\n\n'Out of abundance of caution, I pulled over to the side and stopped, even though I was relatively close to home. Someone called 911 and reported a person asleep at the stop sign,' Johnson said during the conference.\n\n'Responding officers did come. They checked on me and confirmed that I could continue on my way. Also, that feeling that I was feeling had passed by that time.'\n\nEmergency services responded to a 911 call and found Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, pictured, laying face down in a car\n\nJohnson requested the investigation to hold himself to the 'highest standard.' He said he wants to show people that everything was above-board and happened as described. Those at the scene said that intoxication was not a factor\n\nVideo courtesy of WGN\n\nJohnson said that he sensed the faintness was coming.\n\n'So I pulled over, stopped, and just rested myself until that feeling passed. I fell asleep \u2013 because remember, guys, we worked a long day that day.'\n\nHe also admitted that he should have considered having a driver with him but he let his usual driver go home to look after his child who was off school due to teacher strikes.\n\nJohnson also said that he had tried to speak to his cardiologist who had adjusted his medication for low blood pressure.\n\nHe added that he would need to take better care with keep taking his tablets properly.\n\nJohnson said: 'To avoid the appearance of impropriety and just have total transparency, I ordered the Bureau of Internal Affairs to conduct an internal investigation just to be transparent. As I\u2019ve said before, every officer, regardless of rank, must uphold themselves to the highest of standards, and that includes me.'\n\nWhen responding officers arrived at the scene, they did not give Johnson a Breathalyzer test. He defended the officers' decision, saying that they are only supposed to test drivers if they look impaired or smell like alcohol or another illegal substance.\n\nPolice department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Johnson indicated he parked his car after feeling lightheaded.\n\nOfficers checked on Johnson's well-being and didn't observe any signs of impairment.\n\nJohnson drove himself to his home nearby.\n\n'There were no charges of intoxication, no information of intoxication as far as I know,' Guglielmi said.\n\nGuglielmi says Johnson requested the investigation because he believes officers and the superintendent 'ought to be held to the highest standard.'\n\nJohnson was in hospital in June when doctors found a blood-clot in his lung during a stress test. He also underwent kidney surgery in 2017 and has to take medication which could explain his excuse for feeling tired\n\n'So what that means is they're going to interview the officers, they're going to look at all available evidence just to make sure that this is above-board and happened as described,' Guglielmi said.\n\nThe 59-year-old Johnson underwent kidney transplant surgery in August 2017. His son Daniel was the donor.\n\nGuglielmi said Johnson visited a doctor earlier this week regarding a medication change.\n\nHe said the superintendent on Wednesday expressed concerns about feeling exhausted.\n\nGuglielmi says Johnson visited a doctor Thursday to be evaluated on issues concerning his blood pressure.\n\nJohnson was hospitalized in June after doctors found a small blood clot in his lung during a stress test done as Johnson approached the two-year anniversary of his transplant.\n\nThe clot was treated with medication and rest.\n\nJohnson was appointed superintendent in March 2016 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nHis predecessor, Garry McCarthy, was fired days after the release of a video of the 2014 fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke.\n\nVan Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder last year and is serving a nearly seven-year prison sentence.", "description": "Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson asked the city's police department to conduct an internal investigation on himself Thursday after he was found lying down in a car.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/19886760-0-image-a-34_1571407233658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
