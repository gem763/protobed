Steve Scalise (R-LA) in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t meet the standard of a whistleblower, but more concerningly, the inspector general determined that this person has a political bias,\u201d remarked Scalise, adding, \u201cBy the way, guess who is lawyered up, right now? The so-called whistleblower has a lawyer that is a donor to Joe Biden. You can\u2019t make this up. So you want to talk about deep state type connections, look at the fact this person, by the inspector general\u2019s own determination, has a political bias.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nDemocrats seek to use impeachment of President Donald Trump as a \u201ccheck on the electorate,\u201d noted Scalise.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is a very powerful constitutional obligation that Congress is given as a check on an executive, not as a check on the electorate, which is what Nancy Pelosi\u2019s using it as,\u201d said Scalise.\n\nOn Wednesday, Scalise mocked Democrats with an impeachment-themed Mad Libs game.\n\n.\u2066@SteveScalise\u2069 is handing out MAD LIBS IMPEACHMENT GAMES at GOP conference this am. Stands to show: House Rs are salivating over the prospect of using impeachment against the majority, politically -> pic.twitter.com/J2Dsu5ERnu \u2014 Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) September 25, 2019\n\nScalise stated, \u201cIt really is unbelievable. When you look at the hype that was building up on this thing. Of course the media has been frothing at the mouth since literally the day Donald Trump took office. They\u2019ve wanted to get him out of office. The left has wanted to act like he\u2019s not president or they want to remove him as president so they had a mission when they took the majority to impeach him, regardless of the facts.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky illustrated the president\u2019s commitment to increasing European states\u2019 responsibilities for their own military and national security needs, observed Scalise.\n\n\u201cIt does show what President Trump has been saying since he got in office,\u201d said Scalise of the released transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nScalise concluded, \u201cOver in the European Union, a lot of these countries won\u2019t step up and do their part, especially for NATO. So [Donald Trump] called on NATO countries to [fulfill their] commitment [of] two percent of GDP for every country. Most of them are well below one percent, so Americans pick up the tab. A lot of people say, \u2018Hey, we support the Ukraine,\u2019 but America is really the only country that stood up and sold them Javelin missiles. Barack Obama wouldn\u2019t sell them the Javelin missiles to stop Russia.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "A bureaucrat framed as a \"whistleblower\" by assorted news media outlets \"doesn't meet the standard of a whistleblower,\" said Steve Scalise.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Steve-Scalise-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
