It was obvious from early on that the president of the United States is a would-be autocrat who accepts no limits on his power and considers criticism a form of treason, and he is backed by a party that has denied the legitimacy of its opposition for many years. Something like this moment was inevitable.\n\nWhat still hangs in the balance is the outcome. And if democracy survives \u2014 which is by no means certain \u2014 it will largely be thanks to one unpredictable piece of good luck: Donald Trump\u2019s mental deficiency.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that Trump is stupid; a stupid man couldn\u2019t have managed to defraud so many people over so many years. Nor do I mean that he\u2019s crazy, although his speeches and tweets (\u201cmy great and unmatched wisdom\u201d; the Kurds weren\u2019t there on D-Day) keep sounding loonier.\n\nHe is, however, lazy, utterly incurious and too insecure to listen to advice or ever admit to a mistake. And given that he is in fact what he accuses others of being \u2014 an enemy of the people \u2014 we should be thankful for his flaws.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe news item that got me thinking along these lines was, oddly, the latest budget review from the Congressional Budget Office, projecting a fiscal 2019 deficit of almost a trillion dollars \u2014 up by more than $300 billion from the deficit Trump inherited.\n\nNever mind the clear demonstration that the G.O.P.\u2019s Obama-era hyperventilating about deficits was completely hypocritical. The more important point is that $300 billion is a lot of money, and it should have been enough to buy Trump a lot of political gain.\n\nAfter all, other white nationalists trying to do what Trump is trying to do \u2014 subvert the rule of law and convert their nations from democracies on paper to one-party autocracies in practice \u2014 have solidified their grasp on power by delivering at least a bit on their populist promises. In Poland, for example, the Law and Justice party has increased social spending and is now promising a big rise in the minimum wage.\n\nTrump\u2019s domestic economic policy, however, has been standard Republican top-down class warfare. None of that $300 billion went for social benefits or even his continually promised, never-delivered infrastructure plan. Instead, it went mainly into tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy that have done little to boost investment.\n\n[For an even deeper look at what\u2019s on Paul Krugman\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\n\nAt the same time, Trump has pursued his personal tariff obsession despite mounting evidence that it\u2019s hurting growth. The economy was supposed to be his big political selling point. Instead, polls of his net job approval on economic policy are, on average, barely positive even now \u2014 and likely to get worse as tariffs on consumer goods bite and the economy slows.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s squandered economic opportunities are, of course, secondary at this point to his de facto self-impeachment.\n\nJust a few weeks ago it seemed that Trump would skate on charges both of colluding with Russia to subvert the 2016 election and of obstruction of justice; the Mueller report was basically a bust, partly because the story was complicated, partly because of Robert Mueller\u2019s diffidence.\n\nBut Trump has managed to make things clear enough for everyone to understand. First he demanded that foreign regimes produce dirt on domestic political rivals, not just in phone calls but right there on camera. Now he\u2019s engaged in a crude, obvious effort to stonewall the House impeachment inquiry that is clearly an impeachable offense in itself.\n\nWhy did he hand the defenders of democracy so much ammunition? Partly he seems to have gotten high on his own supply \u2014 he actually seems to believe the bizarre conspiracy theories his supporters drum up to excuse his actions. Also, he evidently lacks any kind of self-restraint. Even if he considers any effort to hold him accountable a form of treason, he should have known better than to blurt it out in public.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s own actions explain why a vote to impeach, which seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago, now looks almost inevitable. Conviction in the Senate is still unlikely, but not as impossible as it once appeared.\n\nThe larger point is that if Trump were cannier and more self-controlled, the march to autocracy might well be unstoppable. He has the backing of a party whose elected representatives have shown no sign of democratic scruples. He has de facto state media in the form of Fox News and the rest of the Murdoch empire. He has already managed to corrupt key government agencies, including the Justice Department.\n\nIndeed, these advantages are so large that the assault on democracy may yet prevail. The only reason it might falter is, as I said, Trump\u2019s own deficiencies.\n\nIt says a lot about the modern G.O.P. that the party is still solidly behind a man so obviously, grotesquely, not up to the job (although some rank-and-file Republicans now back an impeachment inquiry). But those of us who want America as we know it to survive should be grateful that Trump is so immature and incompetent. His character flaws are the only thing that gives us a fighting chance.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
