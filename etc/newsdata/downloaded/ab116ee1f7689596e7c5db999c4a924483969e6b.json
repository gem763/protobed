It\u2019s not just inaction during the worsening climate crisis that bothers them, but the increasingly bizarre criticism many older people throw at striking schoolchildren, in the media and elsewhere. In the absence of any meaningful attempts to restrain global carbon emissions, the direct action of young people should, logically, be applauded. But maybe we\u2019re not dealing with an entirely logical problem here.\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused Greta Thunberg \u2013 the Swedish teenager who started the global strikes \u2013 of creating \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d in children. So it\u2019s Thunberg\u2019s activism that is responsible for the anxiety children feel about their future, not the climate crisis itself? Thunberg has also been called mentally ill, a hysterical teenager and \u201ca weirdo\u201d. French academics criticized her looks and rather than address the points in her UN speech, dismissed Thunberg as \u201ca happy girl looking forwards to a bright future\u201d.\n\nNone of this acknowledges the urgency of the crisis that climate strikers are drawing attention to. So, why are they being made?\n\nBeneath the thin skin\n\nIt\u2019s been argued that most of the bullying Thunberg receives is from middle-aged, conservative men who feel threatened by her agency as a young woman, and respond with misogyny. But the criticisms of the strikers aren\u2019t only from powerful men like . I\u2019ve also heard from parents supporting their children on the school strikes that strangers have accused them of manipulating \u201cthat poor Greta Thunberg\u201d and betraying their children\u2019s right to have a \u201cnormal childhood\u201d.\n\nSome parents were told by passing women that they should be reported to child protection for abusing their children as they stood alongside them on the school picket line. Just to paint a picture of the scene, this was a picket line before school started with children under the age of eight holding their parents\u2019 hands, with painted signs urging onlookers to \u201csave the turtles\u201d. They went into school afterwards at the normal time.\n\nAs an academic and psychotherapist, I study how children are emotionally affected by the climate crisis. But I also want to understand why some adults have reacted the way they have to the young strikers. I find these children inspiring. On September 20 2019 \u2013 the day of the global strike \u2013 children in Afghanistan marched through the streets with their banners, flanked by soldiers in full body armor carrying guns. These children were putting their own lives at risk to get their message across to the world. On the other hand, we have these verbal attacks from adults, safe in their offices and homes.\n\nIn her UN speech, Thunberg challenged adults the world over to care about the climate crisis. She spoke of the shattered dreams and despair that her generation bears. She also recast inaction as a conscious choice. \u201cIf you choose to fail us, we will never forgive you,\u201d she said. By making this choice conscious, she left older generations with no more excuses. That challenge was always going to hurt and provoke a backlash. When adults are challenged to behave like adults, by a child, they can go in one of two directions.\n\nOne is simply to grow up. The other, is to defend themselves. In psychology, we try to listen through the defencss people make when they feel threatened. For example, when someone says that these young people should be in school instead of on strike, they may be pining for the sense of normality that seemed to exist before the climate crisis gained such prominence in everyday life.\n\nUrgent action is needed to restrain greenhouse gas emissions and keep global temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C.

It may be reasonable to assume many of the people who attack Thunberg and the school strikers are terrified. It\u2019s much easier to attack others than to look at ourselves, reflect on our own feelings and start to deal with them, like grown ups.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Caroline Hickman, Teaching Fellow in Social Work and Psychotherapy, University of Bath under a Creative Commons license.
