The Fox News poll found that supposedly showed a double-digit increase in the number of voters who wanted Trump impeached and removed from office.\n\nHowever, according to a New York Post analysis, Fox News misrepresented Americans\u2019 alleged support for impeachment.\n\nBraun Research, the pollster firm that conducted the survey, noted that 48 percent of its respondents were Democrats; however, the Post revealed that the \u201cactual breakdown\u201d based on party affiliation is 31 percent Democrat, 29 percent Republican, and 38 percent independent.\n\nThe Post noted that, when weighting the poll for party affiliation, would have revealed that only 44.9 percent of Americans, or less than a majority, back impeachment of President Trump. Forty-four percent of Americans oppose impeachment, according to the Post\u2018s analysis.\n\nThe Fox News poll incensed President Trump, who noted that, since he first ran for president, he has never had a \u201cgood\u201d Fox News poll.\n\n\u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet this week.\n\nFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nTrump added, \u201c@FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nOther conservatives have noted that the Fox News poll may also be misrepresenting Americans\u2019 support for impeachment.\n\nEmerald Robinson, chief White House correspondent for One America News (OAN), said that Paul Ryan, a board member of the Fox News parent company Fox Corp., hired a \u201cpolling firm run by liberal activists.\u201d\n\nRobinson said that the poll serves as \u201ccover for GOP to impeach Trump.\u201d\n\nJohn Roberts, the chief White House correspondent for Fox News, said the methodology for the poll remains the same.\n\nRobinson said in reply to Roberts the \u201cfirst rule of getting out of a deep hole?
