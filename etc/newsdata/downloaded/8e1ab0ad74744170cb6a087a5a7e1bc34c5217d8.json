And that meant the best dinner of the week: counter meals.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like it; a balmy evening where you\u2019re sitting in a club\u2019s bistro, scrounging up enough money to go play on the chocolate machine or begging Mum to buy you another fire engine, lemon-lime & bitters, or coke and raspberry (if you\u2019re anything like my brother), while waiting for the table\u2019s buzzer to go off like a frog in a sock.\n\nYou weren\u2019t allowed in the pokies or onto the tiled section near the bar, and one of the old barflies might have given you some of their change from their eighth shandy of the night. Maybe there would be an old, beat-up cubby house in the beer garden if you were lucky.\n\nBut the best part was the food. Oh boy, there\u2019s nothing that competes with the pure, simplistic comfort of a really bloody good counter meal from the local. We cast our minds back and dredged up our faves for you all to drool over.\n\nSteak Sandwich\n\nA tried and true staple of counter meals, here. Is a pub really a pub without a steak sandwich? I refuse to believe a publican is allowed to get licensed without having a steak sanga on the bistro\u2019s menu.\n\nOne of the things burnt into my memory around the humble, under-appreciated steak sandwich is that my dad\u2019s best friend refuses to eat anything else if he went out for a meal. It\u2019s a no fuss, no fuckin\u2019 around dish.\n\nChicken Parmigiana\n\nThe parma (don\u2019t argue) is probably the most quintessential modern Aussie pub grub out there. Sure there are various takes on the classic schnit, red sauce, ham, melty cheese combo like a Mexican Parm or a Hawaiian Parm, but the classic is the Italian chicken parm.\n\nThe classic fave and my go-to panic-order meal at the pub is actually a twist on the Italian original \u2013 the Eggplant Parmigiana. And honestly, if you can do an eggplant parma right then you\u2019ve got my vote (and my money).\n\nMixed Grill\n\nAh yes, the dish to have when you can\u2019t decide on what you want. Is it an intentional counter meals inclusion or the kitchen being thrifty when they get a bit of extra meat that *just* can\u2019t make up a full meal? Who\u2019s to say.\n\nThe classic mixed grill has all the trimmings that you\u2019d expect off the BBQ at the pub: t-bone steak, bangers, lamb chops, bacon, fried egg, and maybe some roast tomato and cooked mushrooms if you\u2019re feeling like filling your veggie quota.\n\nLook, it\u2019s essentially a reason to have a big breakfast at any time of day, and that in itself is good to me.\n\nBangers & Mash\n\nYou\u2019ve got sausages, you\u2019ve got mashed potato, you\u2019ve got peas, and you\u2019ve got it all smothered in gravy \u2013 maybe even an onion gravy. Is there anything that\u2019s bad here? No. Great meal. Can\u2019t fault it.\n\nSurf n\u2019 Turf\n\nSurely created by a Dad who scored a good deal at both the butcher and the fishmonger, this dish always seemed like the adult option on the menu at the bistro. A real Dad-level meal, when he can\u2019t decide if he wants a thick-cut steak or the seafood basket.\n\nFrom my memories, the classic surf n\u2019 turf that went down at the Ulladulla Bowling Club (where many Friday Night Family Dinners were had) included a rump steak with grilled prawns on top, usually with some kind of slightly creamy garlic sauce. Side salad. Chips.\n\nI never ordered it because I always thought it was a Big Adult Meal\u2122 and I was a very small child. Not for kids, stick with the spaghetti.\n\nLamb Cutlets\n\nThere\u2019s not much better, or reminiscent of the early 00s than crumbed lamb cutlets with a side salad, or mash and veg if it\u2019s winter.\n\nThe only thing that I reckon is better than this if you\u2019re looking for the rich flavour of lamb is slow-cooked lamb shanks, which usually comes on mash and is paired with some roasted dutch carrots, which we all know are just tiny carrots with their tops still on.\n\nBeef Stroganoff\n\nSome might think it\u2019s chaotic to order a pasta dish at the pub, but to that, I say: Nah, do it. Try a big beefy, mushroomy stroganoff with thick pappardelle and come back to me.\n\nNothing better than sitting back in one of those cheap cushioned bistro dining room chairs, and slipping into a food coma as they read the meat tray raffle numbers over the PA system.\n\nFish & Chips\n\nA humble champion amongst the chatter and noise, the fish & chips is incredible when done well and utterly disappointing when it\u2019s not. There is simply no room for errors when it comes to beer-battered and fried fish alongside a serve of chips, a lemon wedge, and some fresh tartare.\n\nFish needs to be moist, batter crispy. The same thing applies to the chippies, fluffy on the inside with a noted crunch. Miss me with anything less than that, thank you very much.\n\nRoast Of The Day\n\nUsually reserved for Sundays, the holiest of bistro counter meal days, the roast is a damn treat when you hit the jackpot. Cooked and served right, you can end up with a lump of delish roast meat (or veg roast), roasted veggies, with a boat of gravy. Maybe a Yorkshire pudding if you find the right place at the right time.\n\nThe only thing with the roast of the day is you have to time it right \u2013 get in when there\u2019s no rush, but also before it runs out. Which it absolutely will.\n\nCrumbed Steak\n\nSurely there is no dish more quintessentially 80s/90s than the classic crumbed steak. Who even know how or why these existed, but they did, and it\u2019s a fucken travesty that they\u2019ve seemingly fallen off menus for their fowl counterparts, the chicken schnitty.\n\nA steak that\u2019s been breaded and fried? Why the fuck not.\n\nSpaghetti Bolognese\n\nUsually for fussy children, and god-damned delicious. A dark horse on the menu of counter meals, potentially because it\u2019s one of those things that you look at and think \u201cNah, I could just make that at home.\u201d\n\nSeafood Basket\n\nA choice that can really be a mixed bag, depending on what kind of venue you\u2019re in. You might end up with crumbed calamari, battered fish, some prawn cocktails, and maybe some oysters Kilpatrick, or you might end up with half a fish shop on your plate with a bunch of sauces including variations of horseradish.\n\nA win either way in my books as long as there\u2019s no bloody seafood extender.\n\nPot Pie\n\nPot pies are touch and go for me when it comes to counter meals, it really depends what\u2019s inside the pie and what I feel like eating that day. You might end up with chunky beef and red wine, or a chicken and veg. Both reasonable. But maybe it\u2019s a fish pie, which I can very rarely get on board with.\n\nRegardless, a rookie error with the pot pie is accidentally touching the little ramekin that pot pies are sometimes baked in. Don\u2019t do that. No thanks.\n\nSalt & Pepper Squid\n\nYUM. Yum. A good light option and seemingly the rite of passage of counter meals when you\u2019ve first upgraded from the kids\u2019 menu. Get a place who knows how to cook squid so you don\u2019t end up with battered and fried rubber tyre on your plate, and you\u2019re bloody laughing.\n\nThe Buffet\n\nThe absolute holy grail of a bistro. The moment I step into the local RSL and notice those sacred bain-marie stations, my heart sings. You truly get the best of all the worlds here, which is great for those who struggle to decide on what they want to order (read: me). Just don\u2019t, and I must stress this, lose your plate. It\u2019s game over as soon as you lose your plate.\n\nHow do you round it out? Frog in a Pond.
