Schwab as usual, Schwab gets the credit but we did it first,\u201d said Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick. Online brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) followed Interactive Brokers\u2019 lead, Sosnick told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move, adding that eliminating fees and commissions was inevitable as firms fight to attract investors.\n\n\u201cThis has been something that has been building. This is sort of the inevitable result. We undertook it because we could see the fee pressure coming,\u201d Sosnick said.\n\nFree comes with a price\n\nThis Monday, July 18, 2016, photo shows a branch of Charles Schwab, in Burlington, Mass.

Interactive Brokers Chairman and CEO Thomas Peterffy says his firm will make up the revenue it loses from fees and commissions by selling order flow to market makers.\n\nInteractive Brokers had resisted selling order flow even though other firms did it because Sosnick says selling order flow doesn\u2019t lend itself to price discovery.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons many brokers have been able to keep commissions low, is that when they get an order from you, that\u2019s what we consider a marketable order. The market makers will pay them for that order flow to have the right to see that order first hoping to capture the spread,\u201d Sosnick said.\n\nSelling order flow is legal in the United States as long as firms adhere to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s national best bid and offer guidelines. But Sosnick points out, \u201cIn many countries you are not allowed to do this.\u201d\n\nInteractive Brokers is not selling all its order flow, allowing clients with older accounts to opt out. Peterffy outlined the program when he said, \u201cMany brokers sell their clients\u2019 order flow and still charge $4.95 or more to trade stocks and ETFs. With Interactive Brokers, clients can choose to pay no commissions and have their orders routed to market makers like many other retail brokers do or pay Interactive Brokers\u2019 ultra-low commissions and receive professional executions through our IB SmartRoutingSM system.\"\n\nSosnick predicts the SEC will pay more attention as brokers sell order flow. \u201cThat\u2019s likely to impact volumes and spreads. Because all of the sudden you have less spread discipline enforced in the marketplace because remember the person who is buying the order flow kind of has an advantage to see a wider posted bid offer spread.\u201d\n\nBrokers and exchanges keep track of metrics like volume and bid offer spreads. Sosnick says if market quality declines the SEC will have to act.\n\n\u201cIf you see bid offer spreads widen if you see volumes contract if you see price improvement disappear I think the SEC has no choice but to re-examine the plumbing that you don\u2019t really see in the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Online brokerages are eliminating fees and commissions but plan to make up the lost revenue by selling order flow which could draw greater SEC scrutiny.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/70V9bb6.PL6ujbFxfqWyqw--~B/aD0zNTc0O3c9NTM2MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1e2d7cb0-e615-11e9-bfee-f938f6677c40", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
