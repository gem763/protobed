Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\u201d\n\nThis prompted US weather organisations to refute the president\u2019s statement.\n\nThe US National Weather Service branch for Birmingham, Alabama responded to Mr Trump\u2019s tweet saying: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Florida \u2013 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J.

All we know is it\u2019s possibly the biggest. I have \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a category 5. I knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some category 4\u2019s \u2013 you don\u2019t even see them that much,\u201d Mr Trump said at a briefing with officials at FEMA\u2019s headquarters in Washington DC, CNN reported.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut a category 5 is something that \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever even heard the term other than I know it\u2019s there. That\u2019s the ultimate, and that\u2019s what we have unfortunately.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nMany pointed out it was remarkable Mr Trump had repeatedly said he had never heard of a category 5 hurricle.\n\nDorian is the fourth category 5 storm to make landfall in the US since Mr Trump became president. The others were Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Michael. At least 30 category 5 hurricanes have occurred around the world since 2016.\n\nPrevious times Mr Trump has expressed his incredulity at the existence of category 5 hurricanes include the days between the landfalls of Hurricane Irma and Maria, during which he said he \u201cnever even knew\u201d they existed.\n\nIn October 2017, Mr Trump claimed \u201cnobody has ever heard of a [category] 5 hitting land,\u201d and in May this year, speaking about the impact of Hurricane Michael, Mr Trump said: \u201cNever heard about category 5s before. A category 5 is big stuff.\u201d\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\nHurricane Dorian has already had a devastating impact on islands in the Bahamas, where a child has reportedly been killed amid floodwaters reaching 18-23 feet (5.5 \u2013 7 metres).\n\nThe \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d, have seen homes inundated with water, while winds gusting up to 220 miles per hour tore buildings\u2019 roofs off.\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious hurricane \u2013 185 mph [and] gusts up to 220 mph \u2013 that\u2019s the strongest, the largest in modern history, certainly the strongest any of us around here have seen,\u201d Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina, said in a press conference.", "description": "Donald Trump has caused unnecessary confusion by saying Hurricane Dorian \u2013 now the joint most powerful storm to make landfall on record \u2013 was forecast to hit Alabama, when in fact the state is not among those experts believe is threatened.Three other states \u2013 Florida, South Carolina and Georgia \u2013 are", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wFfwxDI9LawWSC0CsU6rdA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/55bac3e6bbf82099f93b632b95bf0b8a"}
