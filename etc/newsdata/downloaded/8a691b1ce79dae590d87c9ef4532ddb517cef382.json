Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager, posted a supportive message about protests in Hong Kong on Friday night that drew an angry response from Chinese officials and set off debate about how corporations should balance their public images with their eagerness to do business in China.\n\n\u201cWe voice our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Adam Silver offering as an excuse the right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in its statement announcing the cancellation of the N.B.A. broadcasts. \u201cWe believe that no comments challenging national sovereignty and social stability fall within the scope of freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference before a separate preseason game between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors being held in Tokyo on Tuesday, Silver said the cancellation was unexpected, and a community outreach event scheduled to take place at a school in Shanghai also had been canceled.", "description": "At a news conference on Tuesday, Adam Silver acknowledged that the backlash over a Twitter post by the Houston Rockets general manager might not end anytime soon.", "authors": ["Sopan Deb"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/sports/08nba-china3/08nba-china3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
