In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.\n\nBP Plc reported profit that beat analyst estimates as a strong refining performance offset the effect of lower oil and natural gas prices, and bad weather that curbed production.\n\nThe positive result will please investors expecting a gloomy third quarter for Big Oil. Crude prices have fallen as the U.S.-China trade war stokes demand concerns, while American output has continued to flood the market.\n\n\u201cBP delivered strong operating cash flow and underlying earnings in a quarter that saw lower oil and gas prices and significant hurricane impacts,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement.\n\nBP said adjusted net income was $2.25 billion in the quarter, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $1.77 billion. That compares with profit of $3.84 billion a year earlier, when BP decided to buy a $10.5 billion package of U.S. shale assets in cash rather than shares because it was so confident oil prices would stay high.\n\nAdvance Warning\n\nThis year, the London-based company took the unusual step of issuing a statement before earnings to flag up factors affecting business in the third quarter. BP warned it would pay a tax rate of about 50%, higher than the expected full-year rate of 40%. It also signaled that gearing -- a measure of debt to equity -- would remain above its target range.\n\nThe company also gave advance warning of a non-cash impairment charge from the sale of gas assets in the U.S. That amounted to $2.61 billion in the quarter, meaning the company reported a net loss of $749 million. In response to that guidance, analysts had already downgraded their estimates for adjusted net income by about a third over the past four weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a decent result, although worth keeping in mind that this comes after heavy downgrades in recent weeks,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Martijn Rats \u201cAs recent as early October, the consensus third-quarter net income was still $2.7 billion.\u201d\n\nStrong Trading\n\nBP\u2019s refining and marketing unit posted adjusted profit of $1.88 billion in the period compared with $2.11 billion a year earlier, a much smaller decline than its upstream business.\n\nThat result was achieved despite weakening margins as price differentials between heavy and light crude became less favorable to BP. Instead, the strong performance came from high operational reliability, with the company\u2019s Whiting and Cherry Point refineries in the U.S. processed record amounts of crude, the company said.\n\nBP also said that it enjoyed better income from natural gas trading and a higher contribution from oil. Although better known for its oil fields, refineries and pump stations, BP also runs an in-house trading businesses that\u2019s larger than the better-known independent oil traders like Vitol Group, Glencore Plc and Trafigura Group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a volatile market,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a Bloomberg TV interview. \u201cThe teams have been making some very good calls.\u201d\n\nHurricane Impact\n\nOutput fell from the preceding quarter as a result of the hurricane and maintenance, sliding to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, including the contribution of barrels from strategic partner Rosneft PJSC. Production should rise again in the fourth quarter, the company said.\n\nCash flow from operations including working capital, an important measure of whether BP\u2019s shale deal is paying off, held steady compared with a year earlier at $6.5 billion.\n\nBP has worked diligently to cut costs and boost the cash it generates from projects after crude\u2019s collapse in 2014. Some of that work can be attributed to Bernard Looney, the company\u2019s upstream director and incoming chief executive officer. Investors and analysts will expect him to continue that push, while expanding efforts to cut carbon, when he takes over the top job in February.\n\n(Updates with details of net loss in sixth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Javier Blas and Laura Hurst.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Amanda Jordan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
