Mr Daunt credits the recovery to his decision to make the chain act more like an independent bookshop, with local managers empowered to stock the titles they think will suit their particular markets.\n\nHe's plotting a similar strategy now. \"It is relatively simple. Fill bookshops with the books their customers want,\" he says.\n\n'Different market'\n\nWhere Mr Daunt sees similarities between Waterstones and Barnes & Noble, analysts warn of differences.\n\nDespite its diminished state, Barnes & Noble remains a massive operation, with 627 stores, some 27,000 full and part-time employees and $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) in sales in the 12 months to 27 April.\n\nBy comparison, Waterstones had just 278 stores, about 3,100 staff and sales of \u00a3385.7m when Elliott took over in 2018.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Barnes & Noble large shops have been hit by declines in mall traffic\n\nAmerica's size makes the mechanics of some parts of book selling, such as distribution, more challenging, while the threat from Amazon includes not only its online sales but a small, but growing number of dedicated book shops.\n\nBarnes & Noble shops are often found in suburban malls, where they occupy huge, 26,000-square-foot spaces - a challenge for any retailer these days, let alone a bookshop.\n\n\"You have to drive there, you have to get out of your car, park - all this stuff. It's not like walking down the street and saying, 'Oh those book choices look interesting. Let's pop in,\" says John Tinker, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, who has followed Barnes & Noble for years.\n\n\"He's following the same playbook as in England and to the extent it worked in England, that increases the odds that it works over here . But there's a lot of execution questions. Waterstones was sort of simpler,\" he says.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nOren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, says the US has relatively few bookstores compared to Europe and the UK, suggesting there is room for Barnes & Noble to succeed - especially given the growth local shops have seen in recent years.\n\nStill, the company remains awkwardly wedged between Amazon and the \"indies\". In the UK, Waterstones has opened unbranded shops which look like small independent bookshops - so-called \"stealth\" outlets that drew outcry.\n\n\"It's hard to take a 30,000-square-foot superstore out in a strip mall and convert that into a neighbourhood store,\" Mr Teicher says. \"There's got to be authenticity.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Events in Barnes & Noble stores can engage customers - and Mr Daunt plans more of them\n\nInvestment ahead\n\nMr Daunt, who will remain in charge of Waterstones and run it separately, has some room to experiment.\n\nMore than 200 Barnes & Noble leases are up for renewal in the next two years - offering an opportunity to push for lower rents, shrink square footage - or move to other locations entirely.\n\nAnalysts expect him to press publishers for better terms, while Elliott's backing provides - at least for a few years - a shield from short-term financial pressure and the resources to invest.\n\nMr Daunt estimates he will need some $100-$200m to upgrade everything from store furniture and fixtures to IT.\n\n\"Good bookstores are fabulous things and the problem with this one is it's just not a very good bookstore,\" he says of his visit to one of the New York City outlets.\n\n\"It's got all the makings of a good bookstore. It once was a good bookstore. So in theory it's not too tricky to turn it around.\"", "description": "Waterstones boss James Daunt has taken charge of America's biggest bookseller, the ailing Barnes & Noble.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E99D/production/_109050895_jamesdaunt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
