Every Android phone I pick up has a different user interface, with clumsy navigation, substandard animations, and an overall lack of polish. While the Galaxy Note 10 I\u2019ve been testing recently does a slightly better job at some UI elements, its fingerprint reader, bloatware, and forced Bixby integration still left me wanting more. I\u2019ve now been using Google\u2019s Pixel 4 for nearly a week, and it\u2019s given me hope that Android is heading in the right direction.\n\nGoogle has done a number of things with the Pixel 4 to appeal to iPhone users like myself. The basic navigation mechanic has switched to gestures by default as part of Android 10. It\u2019s almost identical to the gestures that Apple borrowed from webOS to bring to the iPhone X two years ago. You swipe up on a tiny white bar to go home and swipe across it to quickly switch apps. There\u2019s even a task switcher UI if you swipe up and hold.\n\nAlongside these new gestures, Google has also introduced its own version of Face ID. During my testing, I\u2019ve found it to be incredibly reliable and fast. It actually works better than Face ID by automatically bypassing the lock screen to get you straight into your phone without you ever having to touch the display. There\u2019s even a screen attention feature (that you have to enable) that stops the display from going to sleep if you\u2019re looking at it.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Face Unlock feature feels far better integrated into Android than any other face scanning feature I\u2019ve found on other Android handsets. It works with Google Pay, websites, and even third-party apps like 1Password. There might only be a handful of apps supported, but it\u2019s far more seamless than the many finicky fingerprint readers I\u2019ve had to battle with previously. Much like Face ID, it just works.\n\nGoogle\u2019s built-in core Android apps are also far superior to what Apple supplies with iOS. Google Photos smartly arranges my photos, Chrome syncs with all of the browsing I do on my desktop PC, Google Maps actually gets me to Victoria in London and not Victoria in Australia, and I don\u2019t really need to say anything about the state of the built-in Mail client in iOS 13.\n\nAll of these improvements have given me hope that I could switch to Android fully soon, but there\u2019s also a large number of annoyances that still give me doubt. The new navigation system works well in a lot of apps, but there are many that clearly aren\u2019t ready for it. I use Slack daily, and tapping into a conversation thread with co-workers and swiping back works well. But as soon as I attempt to swipe over to get the navigation bar (as I would on iOS), it immediately backs me out of the app.\n\nGoogle has implemented the swipe right gesture as a universal back button, but apps like Gmail used to use these edge gestures to open a slide-out menu. I\u2019ve been confused by this a number of times over the past week, and it\u2019s a really frustrating experience, especially if you\u2019re used to the gestures in iOS.\n\nApple hasn\u2019t exactly solved this problem of navigation back to an app either; in iOS, this ugly text appears at the top left of an app to help you navigate back. It\u2019s not ideal, but I prefer it to swiping across and exiting the app instead of getting a sidebar. Swiping within apps using gestures genuinely saves me time when navigating around apps, and I\u2019d like to see this used in Android.\n\nThere\u2019s also a level of inconsistency across Android in many parts that still makes it feel less polished than iOS. I can navigate to the Photos app on Android and tap a picture and then swipe down to dismiss it, but if I take a photo from the camera and look at a preview of the picture, then swiping down does nothing. The navigation buttons in a lot of apps like the Play Store, Phone, and Camera are placed at the bottom of the screen for easy access. In Chrome, they\u2019re placed at the top on Android, but even Chrome on iOS places these closer to your thumbs at the bottom of the display. Some have hamburger menus and navigation buttons, and it\u2019s almost like the teams at Google don\u2019t talk to each other or agree on a single unified effort here.\n\nElsewhere, it\u2019s really the small things that still put me off of Android, and you could probably ridicule me for even noticing them. When I swipe to the bottom of the page in Chrome, it just stops abruptly. There\u2019s no subtle bounce animation or anything to indicate I may have reached the end of the page. In Twitter for Android, I pull down to refresh, and there\u2019s no rubberband effect or anything resembling a decent animation, just a boring loading circle.\n\nBoth of these are strange omissions considering that I can do the same in the main app launcher on Android 10 and there\u2019s a subtle bounce. There are plenty of examples of this inconsistency across Android, and I won\u2019t list them all, but it leaves you feeling like you\u2019re missing something if you\u2019re used to the smooth animations found in iOS.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lack of clever haptics across Android. On my iPhone, I can pull to refresh in apps like Outlook, and there\u2019s a subtle vibration that lets me know the phone is searching for new mail. Android has this when you hold down to select pictures in the Photos app or swipe down to get to notifications, but it\u2019s not widely implemented across apps.\n\nSome of this inconsistency comes from app developers, and it often feels like there\u2019s a lack of polish and love given to Android apps compared to their iOS counterparts. Even Twitter still only has the basic dark mode, not the totally black \u201clights out\u201d mode that\u2019s available on iOS. Apps like WhatsApp feel totally different on iOS, as they\u2019re obviously trying to conform to some Android norms that are outdated in this modern Android 10 era.\n\nI\u2019d love to see Google focus on all of these parts of the user experience. There\u2019s clearly an effort to match what\u2019s available with the iPhone. But if you\u2019re going to overhaul the entire way you navigate around a touchscreen OS, then there needs to a bigger, more coordinated effort with developers.\n\nThat effort also needs to extend to the hardware before I\u2019d consider switching. The bezels on Pixel phones have always annoyed me, and the forehead on the Pixel 4 isn\u2019t much better. Thankfully, the overall build quality has improved from previous years, and the new orange color really pops. Google took a step back with battery life on the Pixel 4, though, and that\u2019s particularly unfortunate given the improvements on the iPhone 11 side.\n\nI\u2019d also like to see a good Android-compatible smartwatch before I consider switching. I use the Apple Watch paired to my iPhone, and there\u2019s still no competitor I\u2019d seriously consider. (The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is close, but to have the best experience with that, you really need to be using a Samsung phone.) Since you can\u2019t use the Apple Watch with Android, I feel a little locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem here. I also use AirPods, which is fortunate as there aren\u2019t any headphones or dongles supplied with the Pixel 4.\n\nDespite all of the challenges Google faces here, I\u2019ve really enjoyed using the Pixel 4 over the past week. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve genuinely considered switching to Android for a longer period than just a week or two. As a Windows user, I really want to switch to Android because Microsoft is increasingly focused on making Android and Windows work well together. Your Phone brings the type of integration between Windows and Android that Apple offers between iOS and macOS. Google is definitely bridging the gap between Android and iOS, and I\u2019m going to keep checking back in to see if it closes even further before I make the big jump.", "description": "Google\u2019s Pixel 4 comes close to the iPhone 11 in terms of software and user experience.
