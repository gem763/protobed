The wildly popular PC strategy game has been a hit since it debuted back in 2009, but until now it\u2019s also been the only game in the series. Today at its 10th anniversary celebration, developer Riot Games revealed a surprisingly large slate of new games and other experiences all set in the League of Legends universe.\n\nHere\u2019s the rundown:\n\nA fighting game: Riot previously revealed that it was working on a fighting game, and today the company officially unveiled \u201cProject L,\u201d a 2D fighter featuring League characters. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all we know right now. The game is still \u201cin early stage development,\u201d according to Riot, and there\u2019s no word on when we\u2019ll hear more.\n\nAn animated series : For years Riot has been releasing gorgeous animated shorts and music videos, and now the company is expanding on that with a full animated series set in League. It\u2019s called Arcane, is being produced in-house, and will be available next year. Here\u2019s a brief plot synopsis: \u201cSet in utopian Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, the story follows the origins of two iconic League champions \u2014 and the power that will tear them apart.\u201d\n\n: For years Riot has been releasing gorgeous animated shorts and music videos, and now the company is expanding on that with a full animated series set in League.

Following directly in the footsteps of games like Hearthstone and The Elder Scrolls: Legends is Legends of Runeterra, a free-to-play CCG coming to both PC and mobile next year. While the premise may not seem all that unique, the monetization model does sound interesting. Riot says that players will be able to \u201cdirectly purchase any card with either earned or paid currency.\u201d So long, blind packs.\n\n: Another fantasy series, another card game spinoff.

A mobile version of Teamfight Tactics: Teamfight Tactics launched a few months back, and the auto-battler has since become one of the most popular game modes within League of Legends. Now it\u2019s getting a standalone version on mobile devices. It\u2019ll be launching early next year. Riot also says that, on both PC and mobile, Teamfight will have a new structure that cycles through \u201cnew sets of champions and abilities every three to four months.\u201d\n\nAn e-sports management game : League of Legends is currently in the midst of its annual World Championship, but if that\u2019s not enough e-sports to keep you satisfied, this game should help. It\u2019s called, appropriately, League of Legends Esports Manager, and it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: a game where you manage a pro League team. The game will launch with support for the Chinese LPL next year, and eventually it\u2019ll support other regional leagues as well. Interestingly, revenue from the game will be shared with the real-world pro teams featured within it.\n\n: League of Legends is currently in the midst of its annual World Championship, but if that\u2019s not enough e-sports to keep you satisfied, this game should help.

A mystery: Riot also teased yet another game codenamed \u201cProject F,\u201d which is described as \u201ca very early development project that explores the possibilities of traversing the world of Runeterra with your friends.\u201d That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we know.\n\nOn top of all of those announcements, Riot also revealed the long-awaited mobile version of League of Legends, along with its first non-League project: a tactical shooter called \u201cProject A.\u201d And there are also changes coming to the core League of Legends game as well. Fans can expect a new hero \u2014 a support called Senna \u2014 on November 10th, and the iconic Summoner\u2019s Rift map is also getting what Riot describes as its biggest changes in years, with new dynamic features being added later this year. It\u2019s looking like a busy few years for the company.", "description": "For its 10th anniversary, Riot Games announced a number of League of Legends spinoffs including an anime called Arcane, a card game called Legends of Runeterra, and a fighting game known as \"Project L.\"", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnhieTC09EhTZRcDyRaaiI0n0oU=/68x0:960x467/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19291264/Screen_Shot_2019_10_15_at_9.50.43_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
