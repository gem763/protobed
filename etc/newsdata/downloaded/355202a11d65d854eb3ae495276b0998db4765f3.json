Bernie Sanders (D-VT), made the admission during an interview with the Associated Press on Saturday in South Carolina when asked if age mattered among White House hopefuls.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask, just like it was legitimate to ask me when I was 29 years old running for the Senate, did I have enough judgment to be a senator,\u201d Biden said. \u201cRight now, my age has brought with it a significant amount of experience in government and hopefully wisdom and some sound judgment.\u201d\n\nWhen pushed if his age would open up the possibility of serving only one term in the presidency, Biden asserted he was not ready to make such a promise, but also admitted he would not automatically commit to running for reelection in 2024.\n\n\u201cI feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you\u2019ll see,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I would run a second term. I\u2019m not going to make that judgment at this moment.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments come as his campaign struggles amid anemic fundraising, questions over his son\u2019s business dealings with foreign governments, and doubts over his own fitness for the presidency. The latter, in particular, has bogged down the former vice president\u2019s campaign since early summer.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, a cadre of allies and staffers began pushing in August for Biden\u2019s campaign to scale down his public appearances, especially in the afternoon and evening \u2014 when the former vice president has proven most likely to make a gaffe. The push came after Biden had a series of high profile lapses on the campaign trail, often misrecollecting key events and confusing time and place.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this was in August when Biden inaccurately claimed to have been vice president at the time of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201cThose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,\u201d Biden said during a huddle with reporters in Iowa, before claiming that when the survivors visited Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d\n\nMany of the reporters on hand, however, were shocked by the statement given that the shooting, which resulted in 17 fatalities and over a dozen injuries, actually occurred on February 14, 2018 \u2014 more than a year after Biden left office. In the aftermath of the flub, Biden\u2019s team attempted to downplay the incident, claiming the candidate had simply misspoken. When that approach approved not to be sufficient, the campaign pivoted to attacking the media for pushing it\u2019s own \u201cnarrative\u201d by reporting on the gaffes.\n\n\u201cThis is a press narrative, not a voter narrative,\u201d Biden\u2019s spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, asserted during an appearance on MSNBC. Sanders even went to the extent of lecturing the media on what it should and should not prioritize to \u201celevate the conversation\u201d surrounding the election.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow this election to devolve in a tit for tat over name-calling and \u2018gaffes,\u2019 something that does not matter,\u201d she said.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s argument, though, did not sway many, including some of the left\u2019s most venerated media personalities. Many, such as Jamil Smith, a senior writer for Rolling Stone magazine, have even called on the former vice president\u2019s campaign to \u201cstep forward\u201d and explain \u201cwhat is going on with him.\u201d\n\nThis is akin to his repeated Margaret Thatcher gaffe. Or it may be somehow different. I don\u2019t want to speculate about what caused Biden to say it. Again, his campaign needs to step forward, and we need to not be afraid to have a conversation about this. https://t.co/bSouvK3hO9 \u2014 Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) August 10, 2019\n\nSuch sentiments have increased as Biden has continued making gaffes, even fabricating an emotional story about the Afghanistan War and forgetting that his former running mate, Barack Obama, was America\u2019s last president.", "description": "Joe Biden refused to rule out serving only one term if elected in 2020, claiming he was not ready to \"make that judgement at this moment.\"", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178402703-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
