(Dash is an acronym for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.)\n\n\u201cOnly a few prior studies have examined the effects of the Dash diet on the incidence of heart failure, and they have yielded conflicting results,\u201d said Claudia Campos, associate professor of general internal medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine. \u201cFollowing the Dash diet can reduce the risk of developing heart failure by almost half.\u201d\n\nThe study recommends cutting five things out of your diet: This Dash diet recommends fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, poultry, fish and low-fat dairy products, while reducing these three main components: salt, red meat, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages. It is very similar to the Mediterranean diet, but the Dash diet recommends cutting out two more things: full cream (in favor of low-fat dairy products) and alcoholic beverages.\n\nThere are other ways to eat healthier too. People who eat slowly are less likely to become obese or develop metabolic syndrome, a cluster of heart disease, diabetes and stroke risk factors, according to research presented at the American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions 2017. They may be more conscious of what they are eating and drinking, and are less prone to overeating.\n\nThe Dash diet is very similar to the Mediterranean diet but, unlike that diet, it recommends low-fat dairy products and excluding alcoholic beverages.\n\nDietitians also advise against snacking and takeouts. People have less control over what goes into their meals when they order in. Americans get most of their daily sodium \u2014 more than 75% \u2014 from processed food and restaurant food, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People eat an average of 200 calories more per meal when they eat food from restaurants..\n\n\u201cExcess sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for a heart disease and stroke,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. \u201cTogether, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause.\u201d Americans get 71% of their daily sodium from processed and restaurant food. Cooking for yourself is the safest and healthiest option.\n\nArtificially sweetened beverages may be linked to an increased risk of stroke and dementia, according to the American Heart Association\u2019s peer-reviewed journal Stroke. Another 2015 study found that older women who consume two or more diet sodas per day are 30% more likely to suffer a cardiovascular event. Add that to more research suggesting regular soda is linked to obesity.", "description": "A study of 4,500 people over 13 years and published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine comes to some surprising conclusions.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG982_diet_ZG_20190404110016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
