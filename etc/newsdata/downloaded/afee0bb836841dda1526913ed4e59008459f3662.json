Stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports earlier in the session were the catalysts behind the early strength.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase kicked off things with third-quarter numbers that topped analyst expectations. The company\u2019s revenue also hit a record, boosted by home and auto loans along with credit cards. The news helped drive shares up more than 2%.\n\nAt 13:36 GMT, December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are trading 26855, up 109 or +0.41%.\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson were also up more than 2% after its third quarter numbers were lifted by higher sales of cancer and other prescription drugs. Shares of UnitedHealth, another Dow member, rose 2.9% after the company posted a quarterly profit that topped analyst expectations by 13 cents per share.\n\nDaily December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average More\n\nDaily Technical Analysis\n\nThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. A trade through 26975 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend will change to down on a move through 25983.\n\nThe Dow is posting an inside move for a second straight day.

If this move can generate enough upside momentum then look for the rally to extend into the downtrending Gann angle at 26960, followed by last week\u2019s high at 26975. Additional upside targets are minor tops at 27040 and 27112, followed by a downtrending Gann angle at 27136.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA failure to hold and a sustained move under 26727 will signal the return of sellers.
