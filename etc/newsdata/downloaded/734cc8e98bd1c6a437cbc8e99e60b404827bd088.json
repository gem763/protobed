To date, the slowdown has centred on business investment, while household spending has been more resilient.\n\nAnnual house price growth remained below 1pc for the 11th month in a row in October, at 0.4pc. Average prices rose by around \u00a3800 over the last 12 months, a significant slowing compared with recent years \u2013 for example, in the same period to October 2016, prices increased by \u00a39,100.\n\n8:13AM\n\nAnother mixed open across the continent , which the FTSE 100 \u2013 which narrowly grabbed gains at the end of yesterday\u2019s session \u2013 underperforming.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe pound is slightly weaker this morning;\n\n8:06AM\n\nTokyo shares hit highest close in a year\n\nA man looks at an electronic stock board of a securities firm in Tokyo Credit: Koji Sasahara/AP More\n\nIn Japan, the benchmark Nikkei index closed at its highest mark in a year, after seven successive sessions of gains.\n\nThe index added 0.47pc to reach its best close since October 10 last year.\n\nJapanese stocks have been lifted by rising optimism about US-China trade talks, and aided further by a stable yen.\n\nTokyo\u2019s Topix index, which is broader, closed up 0.86pc.\n\n7:59AM\n\nBP slides to a loss amid low oil prices and storms\n\nBP\u2019s outgoing boss, Bob Dudley Credit: Patrick T.

He writes:\n\nThe oil major reported a pre-tax loss of $25m (\u00a319.4m) against a profit of $5.4bn in the same period last year. Revenues fell 14pc to $68.3bn from $78.5bn a year earlier. The company has been seeking to reshape its business by jettisoning some of its assets and preparing for a lower carbon future.\n\nBP boss Bob Dudley, who will be replaced by Bernard Looney early next year, said:\n\nBP delivered strong operating cash flow and underlying earnings in a quarter that saw lower oil and gas prices and significant hurricane impacts.\n\nRead more here: Storms and low oil prices push BP to a loss\n\nDespite the fall, that result appears to be ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe loss sets the stage for a week of reports from oil majors, which are all expected to have come under pressure over the past quarter due to the falling oil price \u2013 but look for potential pressure on Royal Dutch Shell shares when markets open if investors were caught by surprise.\n\n7:37AM\n\nAgenda: For stock markets, the only way appears to be up\n\nA currency trader in Seoul, South Korea Credit: Ahn Young-joon/AP More\n\nGood morning.

A year ago, growth in paid clicks was 62pc.\n\n2) Britain has millions more graduates \u2013 so why has the economy got so little to show for it? \u201cEducation, education, education\u201d ran Tony Blair\u2019s slogan, and 22 years on from his first election victory his major target for university entrants has finally been hit. Was it worth it?\n\n3) The accounting scandal surrounding Goals Soccer Centres has deepened after the five-a-side operator called in fraud investigators.
