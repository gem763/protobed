Drinking coffee or alcohol makes this even worse. During a ten-hour flight, men can lose as much as two litres of water and women around 1.6 litres. Staying hydrated throughout and avoiding alcohol will help your body retain water. Infection: You are around 100 times more likely to catch a cold on a plane. The moisture-free conditions increase people's vulnerability to catching infections. Spending up to 20 hours in close contact with others also increases the risk of spreading bacteria. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged periods of immobility can lead to slow blood flow. The longer the flight, the greater the risk of blood clots. It is recommended that passengers regularly walk around the cabin and stretch. Radiation: Pilots and crew are exposed to high levels of radiation during their frequent flying. They come into contact with cosmic ionizing radiation from space which has been linked to cancer. Bloating and swelling: The air pressure can cause a build-up of gas in your body, which can lead to bloating, constipation and other gastrointestinal issues. Dizziness: The lack of oxygen can cause light-headedness, headaches and hypoxia.\n\nCEO Alan Joyce told Bloomberg the flights will have more legroom in economy class than standard planes.\n\nThere will be some space at the back of the aircraft available for stretching for passengers who would prefer not to remain seated for the best part of 20 hours.\n\nAfter boarding the test flight this weekend, passengers set their watches to Sydney time and were kept awake until night fell in eastern Australia with lighting, exercise, caffeine and a spicy lunch instead of the usual dinner.\n\nSix hours later, they were served a high-carbohydrate meal, told to avoid screens, and the lights were dimmed to encourage them to sleep through the night.\n\nThe purpose of the record-breaking flight, named Project Sunrise, was to conduct scientific research on passengers and crew on extra-long haul flights.\n\nThe data will be shared with the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority to help inform regulatory requirements associated with ultra-long-haul flights over 20 hours.\n\nProfessor Marie Carroll, from the University of Sydney, said she and fellow passengers did a lot of stretching and group exercises at prescribed intervals.\n\n'I expect that they will have a normal day today and a normal night's sleep tonight,' she said, adding that she felt 'amazingly good' considering the flight time.\n\n'It's all an experiment to see if airlines can adjust their schedule of food, beverages, exercise and lighting to be in sync with the destination time.\n\nQantas Flight 7879 took off from New York's John F. Kennedy airport at 9pm on Saturday with 50 passengers and crew on board\n\nThe historic flight in numbers Distance: 10,066 miles Time: 19 hours, 16 minutes Fuel: 101 tons When will the flight be in service? 2023 Cost of plane: \u00a3225million\n\n'We did the Macarena in the economy cabin,' she added.\n\nQantas used the test flight to monitor six volunteers to collect data on a range of variables.\n\nCNBC reported the volunteers were required to keep journals of their sleeping and eating patterns two weeks before the experimental flight.\n\nThey were also asked to maintain the sleep journals for two weeks after the flight to generate a a rounded assessment.\n\nResearchers from the University of Sydney used the space as a laboratory to monitor things like temperatures, lighting schemes, recipes, stretching exercises and the effects of jet lag.\n\nUniversity of Sydney professor Stephen Simpson said the experiment would help researchers understand the contributions to jet lag.\n\nQantas made history after the longest flight in history landed in Sydney after setting off from New York and spending 19 hours and 16 minutes in the air\n\nThe plane travelled more than 10,000 miles from New York to Sydney without refuelling - a feat achieved by no other plane\n\nFour pilots were put on rotation throughout the flight and two additional pilots who flew the aircraft to New York were stationed in the cabin\n\nA cabin crew member takes a reaction test on an iPad during the flight which was used to carry out research into long-haul flight behaviour\n\nDr Tracey Sletten from Alertness CRC taking urine samples to measure the concentration of melatonin in the flight crew as an indication of circadian timing\n\nFour pilots were put on rotation throughout the flight and two additional pilots who flew the aircraft to New York were stationed in the cabin (pictured: a Qantas pilot fitting a head device)\n\n'We know from the basic science of circadian rhythms that a bigger time difference between departure and arrival locations, and travelling east rather than west, tends to mean people feel more jet lag,' he said.\n\n'But people seem to be wildly different when it comes to the experience of jet lag - and we need more research on what contributes to jet lag and travel fatigue, so we can try and reduce the impact of long-haul flights.'\n\nFour pilots were put on rotation throughout the flight and two additional pilots who flew the aircraft to New York were stationed in the cabin.\n\nThey were given special headbands that monitored brain activity.\n\nScientists also tested the people on board using urine samples to gauge melatonin levels - the hormone that regulates sleep cycles.\n\nCameras were also mounted inside the cockpit to record pilots alertness.\n\nThe flight took 19 hours and 16 minutes and travelled 16,200 kilometres. It is the first of three test flights which aim to connect Australia to destinations including London and New York\n\nCEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce (left), said the success of the flight was a historic moment for the airline. Right, pilots were given special headbands that monitor brain activity\n\nA Qantas spokesperson said the flight tests are, 'just one part of the work we are doing to assess how to operate these flights safely.'\n\nQantas CEO Alan Joyce said the likelihood of the long hour flights becoming every day flights is 'ultimately a business decision'.\n\nMr Joyce also said the success of the flight was a historic moment for the airline.\n\n'This is really historic moment for Australian aviation and a really historic moment for world aviation,' Mr Joyce said at a press conference.\n\n'We're the first commercial airline to fly non-stop from New York to Sydney.'\n\nIf the data from the test flights suggest non-stop flights will not pose a health risk for crew and passengers, flights would start in 2022/23.\n\nThe direct flight saved passengers up to four hours in total travel time.", "description": "Non-stop 19-hour commercial flights from New York to Sydney could be available to passengers in economy class by 2023, with the only added benefit of slightly more legroom and a place to stretch.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19988054-0-image-a-58_1571657122537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
