But the following month, Seoul announced it was submitting a solo bid to host the tournament after the North Korean authorities failed to respond to its proposals, with FIFA saying it would continue discussions with Pyongyang.\n\nAD\n\nNorth Korea also failed to respond to South Korean requests to send media to cover Tuesday\u2019s match, or even to send a cheerleading squad, with relations between the two Koreas sharply deteriorating this year after an improvement in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nThe NK News service, which is based in Seoul, reported that a few tickets had been sold to foreign diplomats. Marked \u201ccomplimentary,\u201d the tickets were in fact sold for $50-60.\n\n\u201cFor sporting fans worldwide, hopefully the reason Infantino is going is to personally flag concerns about the restrictive way DPRK authorities have gone about hosting this match,\u201d said Chad O\u2019Carroll, founder of NK News, using the abbreviation for the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which inter-Korean relations so often get politicized suggests any initaitive to jointly host major international sporting risks being extremely challenging from a logistics point of view,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough South Korea is ranked 37 in the world compared to North Korea\u2019s 113, the team may be happy to come away with a tie. Players were only given an hour to practice on the artificial turf at the stadium on Monday after flying in via Beijing. The ball bounces differently on artificial turf than on the usual grass pitch.\n\nThe North Korean team hasn\u2019t lost at Kim Il Sung Stadium since 2005, when it failed to qualify for the World Cup in a match against Iran and angry North Korean fans hurled bottles and cans at referees and the Iranian players.\n\nSouth Korea leads Asian Qualifying Group H after two wins and this tie. North Korea lies in second, after two wins and a tie, but with an inferior goal difference.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Korean Football Federation\u2019s social media accounts, two players from each side were given yellow cards.\n\nAD\n\nMin Joo Kim contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "North Koreans even denied South Korea the right to televise the match or send reporters.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XZoLLUc4uS-kQaQK_lrr6EChVJg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FBMQIDHPGQI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
