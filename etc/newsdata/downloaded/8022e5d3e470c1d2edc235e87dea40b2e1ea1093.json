(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)\n\nVontaze Burfict is officially out for the season after the Oakland Raiders linebacker lost his appeal over a suspension for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe NFL announced the decision from appeals officer Derrick Brooks on Wednesday after a Tuesday hearing in which the Raiders supported Burfict.\n\nAppeals officer Derrick Brooks, jointly appointed by the NFL and NFLPA, has upheld the suspension of Vontaze Burfict. Burfict is suspended for the remainder of the season. The original announcement: pic.twitter.com/Hs7zeNWETs \u2014 Michael Signora (@NFLfootballinfo) October 9, 2019\n\nBurfict was initially assessed the harsh penalty following last week\u2019s game against the Colts, in which he was ejected for laying a vicious hit on a defenseless Doyle. That added yet another chapter to the linebacker\u2019s long history of dirty hits.\n\nThe NFL, clearly done with Burfict\u2019s act, held nothing back in assessing Burfict\u2019s conduct during the game and in the past.\n\nFrom NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan\u2019s letter to Burfict:\n\nThere were no mitigating circumstances on this play. Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game. Following each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly-appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designed to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nBurfict\u2019s outlook for his appeal got even bleaker when the NFL not-so-subtly revealed it had found another helmet-to-helmet hit in the Colts game that Burfict had apparently gotten away with.\n\nThe now-official punishment is unprecedented in NFL history for an illegal hit, Burfict seems to have done more than earn it in his eight-year NFL career.\n\nSuspension is latest Vontaze Burfict\u2019s many punishments\n\nThere was a reason that Burfict\u2019s notable defenders regarding the suspension were basically his own team and Bill Romanowski.\n\nBurfict has been laying dangerous hits for years, with past hits like going after Steelers receiver Antonio Brown in a playoff game and his own teammate or his own teammate Giovani Bernard\u2019s knees in practice. That history goes back to college, racking up 16 personal fouls in his last 26 games at Arizona State.\n\nBurfict has racked up more than $4.2 million in between fines and game checks lost to suspension according to Spotrac, a total that will only go up with this latest punishment.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Raiders linebacker will officially miss the rest of the season for his helmet-to-helmet hit on Jack Doyle.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ouQgzGB0Jjxwe1XIxTEjXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UZkMb5k6hxadSugDJX7BqA--~B/aD0xMzgzO3c9MjA3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9b8cfb40-e56b-11e9-b93c-745913be52dd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
