This came in after the brokerage firms announced that they are eliminating commissions for stocks, ETFs and options trades, hence, joining Interactive Brokers IBKR in the price war.\n\n\n\nTD Ameritrade Holding AMTD, which also announced commission-free trading, did not witness any change in its outlook and the same remained stable.\n\n\n\nHowever, the ratings of the three firms were not changed. Moody's affirmed their ratings.\n\n\n\nThe issuer as well as senior unsecured debt ratings of E*TRADE Financial has been affirmed at Baa2. The senior unsecured debt rating of Schwab has been affirmed at A2 while its commercial paper rating has been affirmed at P-1. Moreover, TD Ameritrade\u2019s issuer as well as senior unsecured debt ratings has also been affirmed at A2.\n\n\n\nReason Behind the Change in Outlook\n\n\n\nPer Moody\u2019s, relatively lower interest rates and flattening of the yield curve are already adversely impacting financials of brokerage firms. Now, with this fee cut, the profitability of these firms will likely be hurt even more. This is the main reason why Moody\u2019s downgraded the outlook for these firms.\n\n\n\nFrom charging $4.95-$6.95 per trade to zero commissions, these brokerage firms will be foregoing substantial fees.\n\n\n\nSchwab estimates that zero-commission trades are likely to have 3-4% adverse impact on quarterly net revenues while TD Ameritrade\u2019s net revenues will likely decline 15-16%. E*TRADE Financial estimates that this move will have a 10% adverse impact on its net revenues.\n\n\n\nNotably, Schwab seems to be a bit better positioned than its peers because it is less dependent on commissions, which constitute roughly 7% of total revenues. However, E*TRADE Financial\u2019s smaller scale compared with its peers puts it in a competitively disadvantageous position, making it difficult for it to be able to attract new clients.\n\n\n\nMoreover, while commission-free trading is expected to adversely impact TD Ameritrade\u2019s revenue growth, it will be partially offset by the company\u2019s cost-saving efforts.\n\n\n\nReasons Behind the Ratings Affirmation\n\n\n\nMoody\u2019s affirmed the ratings of E*TRADE Financial because it believes that the company\u2019s credit profile has improved over the past few years. This has benefited from the firm\u2019s balance sheet expansion strategy. Moreover, the company is well positioned to accommodate a growing client base while maintaining a strong leverage ratio.\n\n\n\nComing to Schwab, over the past few years, it has witnessed a significant improvement in its pre-tax margin, aided by rising equity market values and net client inflows, per Moody\u2019s. Its planned acquisition of USAA\u2019s Investment Management Company, efforts to strengthen trading business and improvement in operating efficiency bode well for the future.\n\n\n\nThe reason behind the ratings affirmation for TD Ameritrade is that it has a strong franchise in the online brokerage business, with clear leadership in the active trader segment and the growing institutional business, serving registered investment advisors. In fact, the company\u2019s acquisition of Scottrade Financial Services in 2017 significantly enhanced its scale and competitive position, without significantly increasing leverage.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Schwab and TD Ameritrade carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) while E*TRADE Financial has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nToday's Best Stocks from Zacks\n\n\n\nWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?
