There's going to be ambulances. I have 130 Porta-Johns coming,\u201d West said, adding that law enforcement and a security team also will be on hand.\n\n\u201cI'm providing security for the community as well, not just for the festival,\u201d she added. \u201cAlmost $31,000 just for the medical to be here.\u201d\n\nSamuel Sheller, the CEO of Guardian Elite Medical Services, told Fox News the company indeed had a contract with West and will be providing 24-hour ambulance coverage in Rachel with at least four personnel on-site at any given time.\n\nLincoln County officers told Fox News they\u2019ll be staffing the event in Rachel and another gathering east of there, in Hiko, but the sheriff did not return Fox News\u2019 phone call for specific details.\n\nComparisons between AlienStock and Fyre Festival -- the fraudulent event that left thousands stranded on a remote island with no infrastructure or resources \u2013 started to surface after the creator of the viral Facebook page, \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us,\u201d backed out last week over safety concerns.\n\nRoberts said he created the Facebook page in July after listening to a Joe Rogan podcast with Bob Lazar \u2013 the scientist who claimed he worked at Area 51 \u2013 got him thinking about the mystery surrounding it.\n\n\u201cWe will all meet up in rural Nevada and coordinate our parties,\u201d the post read. \u201cIf we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let\u2019s see them aliens.\u201d\n\nUltimately, millions of people pledged to help uncover the government\u2019s most coveted secrets.\n\n\u201cDude, it's wild,\u201d Roberts told Fox News. \u201cIt got to the point where I was like, \u2018Come on guys, I mentioned Naruto running in the post. It's not that serious.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts added that he\u2019s said it\u2019s \u201ca joke on the Internet probably like 50 thousand times at this point.\u201d\n\nWhen the post started gaining traction, West was approached by the band Wily Savage out of Los Angeles to host a small music festival at her motel. Around the same time, Roberts met with West about joining forces and creating a big party in the desert that he dubbed AlienStock, with thousands of people expected to flood Rachel.\n\n\u201cWe drove all the way out to the Nevada desert,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe actually did check out the Alien Research Center, but we drove straight past into Rachel and we talked to the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn and to Connie West and that's when we decided to move forward with AlienStock.\u201d\n\nWest agreed and the pair moved forward together to put on the festival, with Wily Savage helping bring in musicians.\n\nHowever, on Sept. 9, Roberts unexpectedly backed out of the event at the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn and moved the music festival to the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center over fears of a \u201cFYRE FEST 2.0.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees, we decided to pull the plug on the festival,\u201d a statement from Roberts read. \u201cWe foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we can\u2019t participate in any capacity at this point.\u201d\n\nAlthough Roberts pulled out, West said she\u2019s moving forward with AlienStock.\n\n'STORM AREA 51' TOO MUCH FOR YOU? TRY THESE OTHER ALIEN HOTSPOTS\n\n\u201cPeople are coming and now they're coming even harder in support,\u201d she told Fox News. \u201cWe're going to have the best party we can possibly have. We have a stage being built. We have the infrastructure that is coming in.\u201d\n\nThe disagreements between the two sides took place at a meeting over the weekend of Sept. 7, with Roberts\u2019 promoter, Frank DiMaggio, telling Fox News logistical concerns emerged over lack of infrastructure and safety.\n\n\u201cWe found out the exact information that we were expecting, we were just hoping it was going to be good news and it was actually worse than we thought -- all the way down to misappropriation of money, money disappearing,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cWhen that happens with being in this business, you run as far away from it as you can. These kids didn't know what they were getting into.\u201d\n\nWest argued Roberts and his friend were in charge of bringing additional infrastructure, as well as food and drinks, but she was left on the hook when they pulled out.\n\n\u201cThere has not been a penny from those boys,\u201d West told Fox News. \u201cI have no more money. I put my house up. I put my house up because they hadn\u2019t got their sponsorship money yet and I had to get these things locked in.\u201d\n\nMembers of Roberts\u2019 team disputed any discrepancy involving sponsorships, arguing they couldn\u2019t dictate when a sponsor would transfer money.\n\nWest also claimed none of the money from the parking spots sold for the festival would go to her, but rather to the landowners who offered up their lots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be split between them,\u201d she added. \u201cThe money doesn't go to me.\u201d\n\nRoberts initially had inquired about holding his event at the Alien Research Center in Hiko.\n\n\u201cMatty Roberts was involved with us early on and then not long before we were going to announce this event, he announced AlienStock which is the event down in Rachel,\u201d said Keith Wright, the executive producer for the Storm Area 51 Base Camp \u2013 the third event spurred by the Facebook post set to take place this weekend.\n\nWright said Base Camp, geared toward the \u201ctrue believers,\u201d will feature speakers including Jeremy Corbell, a documentary filmmaker exploring the realm of real-world mysteries such as UFOs.\n\n\u201cSo, we said, okay, here\u2019s an event. We\u2019ve got this influx of people. Some of them are probably true believers. Most of them are probably just here for the gag factor. Let's show these people that are here for whatever purposes here's what the movement is about,\u201d Wright told Fox News.\n\nHe added that Roberts pulling out left a \u201cpretty bad taste in the mouth of a lot of people in this community and this county.\u201d\n\nDiMaggio said the decision to move venues wasn\u2019t made lightly, but ultimately stemmed from a safety standpoint.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re stuck in traffic and they can\u2019t use their cell phone, what happens? What if you have a heart attack? Who\u2019s going to call the paramedics that might be 10 miles down the road because you\u2019re stuck?\u201d he asked, adding that \u201cVegas is where they\u2019re ready for anything here.\u201d\n\nHiko and Rachel are located in the middle of the desert with very limited resources, including spotty cell service. \u201cIt's about as remote as you can get,\u201d Wright acknowledged.\n\nSome people living in the area also expressed fear about the expected influx of thousands, telling Fox News there wouldn\u2019t be enough law enforcement to take care of them all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d one person who has lived in Rachel for 30 years and requested to remain anonymous -- since everyone seems to know everyone in the town -- told Fox News. \u201cYou have this little place in the middle of nowhere with 50 people in it, and all of a sudden, 10,000 people are going to show up or more... they will run out of water, run out of food, gasoline, and they\u2019ll be some idiots who try to do stuff they shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201d\n\nAmong the lingering questions: how many people will actually show up? Just like what\u2019s lurking behind the gated fence into Area 51... nobody really knows.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut, West said Rachel would be prepared for anything and one thing was certain, \u201cthis thing is still happening.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI mean, in the biggest way this is a showcase of what can be done with a few little people in a little tiny place.\u201d", "description": "The small town of Rachel, Nevada, located in the middle of the desert and home to only about 50 people, could be flooded with thousands of people this coming weekend after the\u00a0joke Facebook post to storm Area 51 \u2013 the top-secret military base that conspiracy theorists believe houses\u00a0aliens \u2013 went viral.", "authors": ["Benjamin Brown", "Benjamin Brown Joined Fox News In", "Currently Serves A Multimedia Reporter Based In Las Vegas."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/08/694940094001_6069753359001_6069763502001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
