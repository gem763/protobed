(Thank you, Mutti!)\n\nHeaven knows whether this is what Merkel intended to do when she let it be known that a Brexit deal is \u2018overwhelmingly unlikely\u2019.\n\nBut this, surely, will be the net effect of her intransigence.\n\nIf Merkel has removed a \u2018deal\u2019 from the table, then it follows logically that the only remaining option is \u2018No Deal.\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve seen \u2018experts\u2019 on social media \u2013 usually ones of a Remainer-ish persuasion \u2013 describing this as a \u2018catastrophic failure of diplomacy.\u2019\n\nI disagree. It looks much more to me like a case of \u2018Everything going according to plan.\u2019 At least it is, if like me, you want real, meaningful Brexit to happen.\n\nOne of the things the more sharp-eyed among you may have noticed in the three and a half years since the Brexit referendum \u2014 and in the fraught negotiations preceding it \u2014 is that the European Union is not remotely interested in striking an equitable or even mutually beneficial deal with the United Kingdom.\n\nAll along \u2013 and people like the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier have been perfectly frank about this \u2013 the sole purpose of the EU\u2019s dealings with regards to Brexit have been to humiliate and bully the United Kingdom.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing personal about this. (Well, not much). It\u2019s simply like this: if you allow one prisoner to escape without being shot, then all the others will expect to be able to escape without being shot. So, better to shoot the first escaping prisoner good and dead to make sure none of the other prisoners are tempted to make that foolish bid for freedom.\n\nOn the British side of the equation, meanwhile, any attempts to negotiate the Brexit that the majority of people want have been stymied by an entrenched Establishment congenitally predisposed towards Remain. This Remainer Establishment has tried \u2013 with some success \u2013 to make the termson which Britain leaves so awful that everyone has second thoughts and realises that it would have been better to Remain all along.\n\nAll this is very obvious, I\u2019m not pretending otherwise. But I think sometimes we become so embroiled in details that it\u2019s worth taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly why I\u2019ve always been, perhaps naively, confident that what we\u2019re going to get is a No Deal Brexit.\n\nAnd also why much cleverer analysts, such as veteran economist Dr Ruth Lea, have been predicting the same.\n\nA few months ago, Lea put a 75 percent probability on a No Deal Brexit. And she has an excellent track record with her predictions: she was one of the few who predicted a positive outcome from Britain\u2019s departure, in 1992, from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. She also correctly called out Gordon Brown on his disastrous deficit spending policies. And she has been a vocal critic of the Remainer Establishment\u2019s Project Fear.\n\nWhat is Ruth Lea\u2019s special skill? The same, I think, as that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior advisor Dominic Cummings \u2013 to spot the blindingly obvious when everyone else is running around like headless chickens.\n\nThe European Union is our enemy and can be relied on unfailingly to act like our enemy under all circumstances.\n\nWhat, therefore, is the canniest option when facing such an intractable opponent?\n\nWhy to use his intractability against him, of course!\n\nBoris \u2013 in his sweetly optimistic way \u2013 probably imagined that somehow he could engineer a congenial Brexit by jollying along all the competing parties and steering everyone to some kind of compromise deal which would get somehow get accepted by the EU and voted through by parliament.\n\nI\u2019m quite sure that Cummings never entertained such a fantasy. On the \u2018accepted by the EU\u2019 front, especially, it would fly in the face of everything that has ever happened ever.\n\nMerkel is not, of course, herself an EU functionary. But she thinks like the EU and she acts very much with the EU\u2019s interests in mind.\n\nThere was a fascinating example of this earlier this year in the BBC\u2019s fascinating documentary Inside Europe: 10 Years of Turmoil when we were shown then-Prime Minister David Cameron going round Europe with his begging bowl to try to persuade the various EU member state leaders to give him something, anything to incentivise the British people not to vote Brexit.\n\nHe failed, of course.\n\nDelingpole: Let\u2019s Not Delude Ourselves \u2013 Brexit Is War and the EU Is the Enemy https://t.co/LAXSHJzmh2 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2019\n\nIn one scene, Merkel was shown keeping him waiting late into the night. (She appears to need little sleep). This is a common EU tactic \u2013 the idea being, of course, to wear your opponent down until he gratefully seizes whatever gristly, rancid, flyblown morsel you care to toss him.\n\nShe got away with it with Dave. She won\u2019t get away with it with Boris who has sensed that, for all his squeamishness about confrontation, the British people are fully behind him and that this is his moment.\n\nAngela Merkel has done Brexit an enormous favour. It has made the British more determined than ever to get the hardest Brexit possible (for which self-respecting Briton wants to be told by the Germans what they can and cannot have). And it is going to force Boris to do the right thing.", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just gifted the United Kingdom a No Deal Brexit. (Thank you, Mutti!)
