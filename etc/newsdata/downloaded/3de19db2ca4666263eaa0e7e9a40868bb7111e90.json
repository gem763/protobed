Anton Novoderezhkin\\TASS via Getty Images\n\nWe may be getting our first look at Apple's next iPhones on September 10, and I, for one, can't wait.\n\nThe new phones are said to be fairly similar to last year's iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max except for a few features, mainly that the cameras on all three phones are likely getting a redesign.\n\nWhile we won't know until next Tuesday what the devices are named, various reports have pointed to two different naming conventions: Apple could change the style to iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, or it could keep the names similar to last year and call the phones iPhone 11R, iPhone 11S, and iPhone 11S Max.\n\nRead more: I've tried every single iPhone currently available \u2014 here's my ranking of the 7 iPhones you can buy right now\n\nWhile most of the world is apparently losing interest in buying new phones, I feel the opposite: For the first time in several years, I can't wait to buy a new iPhone.\n\nI haven't gotten a new phone in about three years, since I upgraded to an iPhone 6S from an iPhone 5S. I've been lucky enough to try lots of new phones over the years, which is part of the reason I haven't needed to upgrade. And for a long time, I was trying to decide whether I should switch to Android \u2014 especially after the Pixel 3 came out last fall, and again after trying Samsung's Galaxy S10e in April.\n\nBut through it all, I've accepted the fact that it's easier for me to remain an iPhone user. I use Apple products for work, and being able to sync my computer to my phone makes life a lot easier. When it comes to my personal life, it's easier for me to stay on the iPhone too. The majority of people in my life \u2014 except for two of my sisters and a few friends \u2014 use iPhones, so messaging is a lot easier. Plus, I use other Apple products at home, like an Apple TV, an iPad, and a MacBook.\n\nIt's not that I'm a diehard Apple fan \u2014 it's just that it's easier to stay on the platform that I'm already on.\n\nWhich is why, after trying most of the most popular high-end phones on the market over the past year or so, I still can't wait to buy a new iPhone. But I'm not after the biggest, most expensive iPhone 11S Max, or even the smaller-but-still-expensive iPhone 11S.\n\nNo, the phone I'm most excited about is the iPhone XR successor, the so-called iPhone 11R.
