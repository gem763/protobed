The Trojan was embedded within an app called Encontre Mais, advertised as a means to locate family members. In reality, Android.Banker.347.origin leverages the Android Accessibility Service to steal sensitive data from handsets and a recent upgrade to the malware has also opened up the possibility of automatically displaying phishing websites.\n\nCNET: Find a stolen laptop with free LockItTight service\n\nTrojan downloaders, too, were not missing from the researcher's findings. Samples including Android.DownLoader.920.origin and Android.DownLoader.921.origin were spread through Android gaming applications and on execution attempt to download further malware payloads.\n\nOther malware samples harvested from Google Play include adware from the Android.HiddenAds family, mainly hidden within games and other software. After launch, the adware buries its icon and displays advertising banners, and may also attempt to download and install APK files.\n\nThe team found a variety of spyware apps, too, in Google Play. Spyware is malware designed not only to steal information including message content, contacts, and potentially GPS location data, but also enables remote control -- including the monitoring of texts, phone calls, and online activity.\n\nTechRepublic: 70% of businesses report Pass the Hash attacks directly impact operational costs\n\nDr. Web says that over September, new versions of spyware were uncovered in Android apps including Program.Panspy.1.origin, Program.RealtimeSpy.1.origin, and Program.MonitorMinor.\n\nIn related news last week, researchers from Czech Technical University, UNCUYO University, and Avast published research on a massive malware operation targeting Android users.\n\nThe scheme has been running since at least 2016 and combines both the \"Geost\" botnet and banking Trojans. It is believed up to 800,000 Android users have been impacted and data including names, handset information, and locations may have been stolen.\n\nZDNet has reached out to Google and will update if we hear back.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
