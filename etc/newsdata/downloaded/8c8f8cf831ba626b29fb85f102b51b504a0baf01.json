We will improve as a team as well and we\u2019ve got to improve.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s defeat at West Ham means they have taken just eight points from their first six Premier League games of the season and they needed penalties to see off League One Rochdale in the Carabao Cup third round in midweek.\n\nPA", "description": "Harry Maguire believes he can contribute at both ends of the pitch and improve his leadership qualities for Manchester United.
