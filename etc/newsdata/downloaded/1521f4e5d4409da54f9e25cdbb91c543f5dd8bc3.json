The cease-fire and longer-term security along the border would not have happened without the brief fighting that followed the U.S. exit and Turkish invasion, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we\u2019re willing to take blame, and we\u2019re also willing to take credit,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump is banking on getting the credit come election time, at least from the ardent supporters he is hoping to turn out in droves for his reelection effort. His call to withdraw troops has become an applause line at his recent rallies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmerican combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world. Bring our soldiers back home,\u201d he said in Dallas last week to crowd chants of \u201cBring them back, bring them back, bring them back.\u201d\n\nForeign-policy experts along with many lawmakers in both parties continue to warn that Trump has made a foolhardy decision, and if the situation in Syria quickly deteriorates, Trump will own it ahead of the election.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president might have a case that this is a rather minor tactical decision on the ground in a small part of the world that doesn\u2019t have a core American interest, but he\u2019s wrong in the assessment that it doesn\u2019t have broader implications,\u201d said Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \u201cThat may play well to the president\u2019s base, but it doesn\u2019t play well to anybody who understands America\u2019s role more broadly in the world, which has been founded for 70 years on American credibility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump did not mention the deal between Turkey and Russia reached Tuesday that pushes Syrian Kurdish fighters from a wide belt of Syrian territory just south of Turkey\u2019s border and seals the Russian dominance in Syria as the United States steps aside.\n\nTrump did not mention Russia by name at all.\n\n\u201cOther countries have stepped forward; they want to help, and we think that\u2019s great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe nations in the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border. We want other nations to get involved.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to expand on the president\u2019s remarks in a call with reporters later Wednesday, was asked whether the White House is concerned about Russia\u2019s newly expanded role.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we always watch the Russians warily, wherever they are,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd so, the deal between Turkey and the Russians is something that\u2019s between them. We did not have any role to play in that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just the problem, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested in a tweet Wednesday.\n\n\u201cErdogan has NOT agreed to stop all military operations in #Syria,\u201d he wrote, referring to the Turkish president whom Trump has invited to visit the White House next month.\n\n\u201c#Russia is going to:\n\n-Remove Kurdish forces from east & west of current Turk controlled areas, including Kurdish cities\n\nAD\n\n-Help #Turkey push all SDF forces 30km south from entire border\n\n-Take control of 5 oil fields\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump said a small number of U.S. forces will stay behind in northern Syria to guard oil infrastructure. The administration official who spoke to reporters would not provide additional details about the number or location of those forces. Some troops are also temporarily being stationed in Iraq.\n\nWhile Trump claims those troops will come home soon, his administration will face a dilemma if tensions in Syria rise: Keep those troops there to help stabilize the region or send them home anyway to fulfill the president\u2019s promise?\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) opposed the withdrawal but gave cautious backing for the \u201csafe zone\u201d Trump says is being created along the border. He made clear he still thinks there is a risk of resurgent Islamic State terrorism that only a U.S. presence can reliably counter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI do not trust or believe that Turkey, Russia, or [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad have the capability or the desire to protect America from radical Islamic threats like ISIS,\u201d Graham said in a statement Wednesday, using an alternate acronym for the terror network.\n\n\u201cWhile I agree that America is not the policeman of the world, I firmly believe the American military is the most capable to protect America and should be used wisely to do so,\u201d Graham said.\n\nTrump is selling voters a different message.\n\n\u201cHow many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts?\u201d Trump asked rhetorically as he announced the lifting of punitive sanctions meant to deter Turkey. \u201cAfter all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course \u2014 one that leads to victory for America.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe language echoed the nativist isolationism that shocked his political opponents as Trump outmaneuvered them during the 2016 election and that he plans to employ during his 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Syria, and all forms of the Kurds, have been fighting for centuries,\u201d he said, implying that that was really none of America\u2019s concern. \u201cWe have done them a great service, and we\u2019ve done a great job for all of them. And now we\u2019re getting out.\u201d", "description": "Trump hopes his decision will please his most loyal political supporters, who tend to love it when he pokes a finger in the eye of the naysayers.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HBL7HqgiihAq8e1Xj_DmuizMXDs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WJJHVCHVWII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
