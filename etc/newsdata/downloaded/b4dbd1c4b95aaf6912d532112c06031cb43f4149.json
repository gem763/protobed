Because nobody really knows.\n\nAfter lawmakers voted 322 to 306 to withhold support for Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal, scuppering his hope of finalizing Britain\u2019s exit plan at an extraordinary \u2014 but ill-named? \u2014 \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d session in Parliament, the prime minister was forced to fold and seek an extension.\n\nAD\n\nA bill passed last month by British lawmakers mandated that if a deal were not approved by Saturday, Johnson would have to formally seek a three-month extension beyond the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson did that.\n\nGrudgingly? For sure.\n\nWith an eye on looming elections? Indubitably.\n\nAfter the Saturday showdown in Parliament came a kind of Sunday hangover, with the British people, and the Europeans, in a bit of a fog, as they read the morning papers and slurped tea.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government announced it was now seeking a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his Brexit deal on Monday afternoon \u2014 a ballot that Johnson was denied by Parliament\u2019s maneuverings on Saturday.\n\nIf that vote happens, Johnson\u2019s ministers promised, the Brexit deal will pass.\n\nAD\n\nOn the Sunday morning talk shows in Britain, Johnson\u2019s cabinet emphasized momentum and speed and \u201clet\u2019s get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nHis opponents, including members of his own Conservative Party, emphasized wait and scrutinize, and let\u2019s first see what the government\u2019s economic analysis says about the impact.\n\nAD\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, \u201cNotwithstanding the parliamentary shenanigans, we appear to have now the numbers to get this through.\u201d\n\nAs for Johnson\u2019s three letters to the E.U., the first did not contain his signature. Much was made of this on political Twitter.\n\n\u201cChildish,\u201d senior Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said Sunday, suggesting it was a stunt.\n\nAD\n\nBut it turns out that the lack of signature doesn\u2019t matter much, as it was an official communique from the prime minister.\n\nThe president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said late Saturday that the British government had notified the E.U. of its extension request.\n\n\u201cI will now start consulting E.U. leaders on how to react,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nBut Johnson also sent a side letter, a \u201cDear Donald\u201d letter, to Tusk.\n\nIt begins on a personal note: \u201cIt was good to see you again at the European Council this week.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen comes the bad news: \u201cRegrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen it puts the burden on Tusk: \u201cI have made clear since becoming Prime Minister, and made clear to Parliament again today, my view, and the Government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\u201d\n\nThe Europeans have hit the \u201cpause\u201d button again, as they wait to see what happens in the British Parliament this week.\n\nE.U. diplomats in Brussels told The Washington Post they will watch developments unfold in Britain before deciding how to handle the Brexit delay request.\n\nTusk will spend \u201ca few days\u201d speaking to E.U. leaders before coming up with a plan, one diplomat said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s multiple-letter strategy is unlikely to have an effect on the final decision, diplomats said.\n\nBut E.U. leaders would prefer to know whether the new Brexit deal has passed Parliament before they decide how long to delay the date and on what terms. There is little question that an extension will be granted.\n\nE.U. ambassadors gathered Sunday morning for a 15-minute meeting in which they signed off on the Brexit deal and forwarded it to the European Parliament so that it could be ratified this week.\n\nThat way, the accord would be squared away, from the perspective of the Europeans, on the off-chance that Johnson manages to win approval in London.\n\nAD\n\nThe E.U. diplomats did not talk about the extension request, two people familiar with the gathering said.\n\nAs has been the case through much of the Brexit debate, Britain\u2019s Sunday morning talk shows focused on the political fallout and the artful bobbing and weaving \u2014 with not much about what Johnson\u2019s deal would mean for trade, business, or ordinary people.\n\nAD\n\nThe Sunday newspapers focused on blame.\n\nThe pro-Johnson Telegraph was all sputtering blind-quoted vitriol: \u201cLet\u2019s call this what it is,\u201d said one furious Downing Street insider, according to the Telegraph. \u201cAn act of sabotage.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday Express banner headline was \u201cWhy Won\u2019t They Let Us Leave?\u201d The Mail on Sunday went with \u201cHouse of Fools.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Observer and the Sunday Mirror called Johnson\u2019s defeat in Parliament the day before \u201chumiliating.\u201d\n\nBirnbaum reported from Brussels.\n\nAD", "description": "Nobody really knows where Brexit is headed next, though the prime minister has asked the E.U. for an extension.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w4iiIAX862oIAdVLHFDdC-5cpzU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VBNKY5HTK4I6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
