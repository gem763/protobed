Biden, saying voters need to \u201cget over it\u201d and vote President Trump out of office.\n\nSitting down with People magazine in a joint interview with daughter Chelsea Clinton, Mrs. Clinton dismissed speculation that women might be less than enthusiastic about voting for Mr. Biden after several women came forward this spring and accused him of unwanted touching. The former vice president has since apologized for putting people in uncomfortable situations.\n\n\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, I\u2019m sorry, I have to jump in because I\u2019ve heard a little bit about that,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told People.\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think that the Twitterverse is the American electorate, but there are lots of vocal voices that say all kinds of things,\u201d she continued, adding that Mr. Biden \u201cis a thoroughly decent human being who has served our country honorably and well for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could take any person who sticks their little head above the parapet and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to run for president,\u2019 and find something that \u2026 a little annoying habit or other kind of behavior that people are going to pick apart and disagree with,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs. Clinton said Democrats need to remain focused on beating Mr. Trump instead of picking each other apart and distracting the public. She stopped short of endorsing Mr. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, and said that \u201canybody\u201d would be better than Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThis man must be defeated,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are putting themselves forward, which believe me, is a really difficult process to undergo, should be judged on the totality of their lives and their service.\n\n\u201cWe can pick apart anybody. I mean, that\u2019s a great spectator sport. But this man who\u2019s there in the Oval Office right now poses a clear and present danger to the future of the United States. So get over it,\u201d she continued. \u201cLook at the candidates, look at what they\u2019ve accomplished, look at what they have fought for \u2014 and vote for anybody to get rid of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf the American people don\u2019t understand that [Mr. Trump] is whittling away at our institutions, our rule of law, he is sowing mistrust among the American people toward one another, he is violating every norm of our values and our common humanity, he is making us a laughingstock and endangering our security around the world \u2014 if people don\u2019t understand that,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we are in for a very, very rocky ride as a country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
