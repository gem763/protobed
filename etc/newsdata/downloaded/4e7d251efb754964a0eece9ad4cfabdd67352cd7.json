How Faith discovers what\u2019s been going on has yet to be revealed, but the bigger question is: what does Cain have in store for both Nate and Moira?\n\nHe\u2019s certainly going to be out for revenge and, in the snippet, both Cain and Nate get into a brutal brawl on a boat, before said boat is pictured going up in flames. Could one of them lose their life as a result?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, Chas gets trapped in the loos, and matters go from bad to worse when she goes into labour. Will Paddy (Dominic Brunt) be able to get there in time before she gives birth?\n\nThen there\u2019s Robert (Ryan Hawley) and Aaron\u2019s (Dany Miller) attempt to evade the law. Upon learning that Lee has died, Robert is unable to process the news\u201a and knowing that this new development could mean he\u2019ll be charged with murder, Liv (Isobel Steele) suggests that Robert not only goes on the run, but that he takes Aaron with him.\n\nFootage in the trailer sees police vehicles arriving, as a worried Aaron and Robert hide. Will the pair manage to get out of dodge before the law catches up with them?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "It's a week that will seemingly change the Dales forever.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/emmerdale-trailer_1571042122.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
