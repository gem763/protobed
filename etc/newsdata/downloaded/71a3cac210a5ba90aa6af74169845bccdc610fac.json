Arriving before the crack of dawn, I was welcomed with a steaming cup of coffee by the head cowboy, Nadav. Joined by four other riders, we saddled up and rode out.\n\nEach cowboy made his own fashion statement. Nadav was dressed for the trail \u2013 no tassels or frills, just workers\u2019 pants, a button-down shirt and a broad, weather-beaten brown leather Stetson. Alon looked like he had just walked out a fashion shoot, accessorising his get-up with a Zippo lighter, a multi-tool Leatherman, an extra knife and a pack of cigarettes. Yakir, who grew up with horses and cattle on a kibbutz, or collective farm, wore a simple t-shirt and jeans with a baseball cap.\n\nI came away from my day on the range with a keen respect for the professional way the men tackled a tough job on rocky terrain. It was a refreshing break from taking photos some of the more familiar aspects of the Israeli-Arab conflict and a reminder that unique, individual characters are very much part of the landscape.", "description": "Cowboys tend cattle on a ranch just outside Moshav Yonatan, a collective farming community close to the ceasefire line between Israel and Syria.", "authors": ["Nir Elias"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQz8UJrWkhEjUK7PVRXyO9bTFHGBX5xD5fv0qGlLe4iPsH_kxbEm6bhudExesLKBoworChjUSHYe9n9bI27lJNzIStVL1JOymvWhC8kIZUWVJ"}
