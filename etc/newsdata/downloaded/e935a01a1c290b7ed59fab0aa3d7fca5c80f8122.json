Sessions\u2019 recusal not only lost Trump an ally atop the Russia investigation, something Trump never forgave him for, but his appointment as the nation\u2019s top cop also cost Republicans a seat in the Senate when Democrat Doug Jones won the special election for Sessions\u2019 seat.\n\nHe appeared to allude to that fact Tuesday, declaring that Republicans needed to \u201cget their back up\u201d after \"drifting away\" from GOP principles. Sessions made no mention of a return to politics, despite rumblings that he could decide to run for his old seat next year, but warned that \"the stakes are high\" and declared he saw an opening for Republicans to secure \"a historic governing majority in the Congress for quite a number of years.\"\n\nBut Sessions, who has largely stayed out of the public eye since his dismissal, showed he\u2019s comfortable enough with his exit to deliver some self-deprecating humor about the debacle.\n\n\u201cThere was one problem as attorney general, that\u2019s for sure, as you well know,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI like to say a lot of people get fired from their work, but mine was a little more public than most. You do the best you can. At least they don\u2019t shoot you when they fire you.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b4/a2/83f705524e0bbcdb52a059a146d2/191002-jeff-sessions-gty-773.jpg"}
