That is why Trump is lashing out at everyone in truly as the senator says, it is unhinged ways. That\u2019s why Lindsey Graham is floating this ridiculous resolution telling the House how to do it\u2019s business and giving Republican senators something they can kinda be for.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cEven the reasonable Republicans who might defect don\u2019t want to defend Trump on substance. And his true loyalists don\u2019t really want to defend him on substance. That is why they\u2019re storming the hearing room and stuff which has it\u2019s own terrible effects in terms of our democracy and how much of a banana republic we look like we\u2019re becoming.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe White House, Trump, and Trump supporters are in a pretty serious panic, I gotta say. And when you talk privately to Republicans on the Hill, Republican senators they will sign on to Lindsey Graham\u2019s resolution, it takes them off of the hook for awhile, and they are criticizing the Democrats but a lot of them are privately saying we need to see the facts, but we\u2019re not saying right now it is inconceivable we would vote to convict Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Friday's broadcast of MSNBC's \"The Beat,\" political commentator Bill Kristol said Republicans Senators were not ruling out voting to \"convict\" | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/Bill-Kristol-looking-up-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
