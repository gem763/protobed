You know him. It is always the same. He just does not get any more intelligent.\u201d\n\nA statement from the FIA, detailing the ruling and fine, said: \u201cThis message over the team radio was broadcast to the public and has since been carried by a number of media outlets in both print and audio form.\n\n\u201c(The message) is an insult to the stewards of the event and calls into question both the skills and the integrity of those stewards.\n\n\u201cThe wording used by Mr Steiner has caused moral injury to FIA officials, was prejudicial to the interests of motorsport and therefore shall be deemed to be a breach of the rules.\n\n\u201cPublic personal attacks against individual officials are totally inappropriate and will not be accepted.\n\n\u201cSince no penalties have been imposed on Mr Steiner for similar behaviour in the past, a fine of the amount imposed is considered appropriate,\u201d it concluded.", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Outspoken Haas Formula One team principal Guenther Steiner was on Friday fined 7,500 euros ($8,250) and warned about his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/f82a7d_steiner-was-hauled-in-hearing-japanese-grand-prix-on-friday-stewards-ruled-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
