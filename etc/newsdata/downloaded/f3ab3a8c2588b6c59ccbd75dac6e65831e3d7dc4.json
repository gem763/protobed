McKinley decried the politicization of U.S. foreign policy, according to the people familiar with the testimony.\n\nMcKinley, who as a Latin America expert was not specifically involved in Ukraine, was also frustrated that there had been no response to an August inspector general\u2019s report that found significant evidence of leadership and management problems, including allegations from career employees that Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley and his former senior adviser Marie Stull retaliated or tried to retaliate against them as holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters outside the closed-door hearing that McKinley was complimentary about Pompeo\u2019s role but did raise other issues.\n\n\u201cI think most of this is a concern by a colleague for an ambassador that he held in high regard,\u201d Meadows said, declining to provide more details of the closed session.\n\nRepublicans are crying foul over the process of the impeachment inquiry, but as House Democrats press on with the investigation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell briefed Republicans about the possible trial ahead.\n\nMcConnell warned of a possible House impeachment vote by Thanksgiving that would force a trial in the Senate, likely by Christmas. He used slides and history lessons during a private Senate GOP lunch in the Capitol to talk about the process, according to a person familiar with the meeting.\n\nCongressional leaders abruptly ended an explosive meeting with Trump at the White House on the situation in Syria, with Trump calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician,\u201d according to Democrats, and Pelosi saying the president was having a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he knows his House colleagues didn\u2019t run for office to conduct an impeachment investigation, but he said, \u201cThe facts that are already in the public domain are so deeply troubling and must be taken very seriously.\u201d\n\nAnother key figure in the impeachment investigation, special envoy Kurt Volker, returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to review the transcript of his Oct. 3 testimony to investigators, according to a person familiar with his appearance.\n\nVolker provided text messages to lawmakers that revealed an effort at the State Department to push Ukraine\u2019s leader into opening an investigation of the gas company Burisma, connected to the son of Trump\u2019s potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden, in return for a visit with Trump.\n\nThat effort soon escalated into what one diplomat feared was a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid. Trump has denied that, saying assistance to Ukraine was delayed to pressure the country into addressing corruption.\n\nAnother ambassador involved in those text message exchanges, Gordon Sondland, has been asked to appear Thursday.\n\nThe testimony so far from the witnesses, mainly officials from the State Department and other foreign policy posts, is largely corroborating the account of the government whistleblower whose complaint first sparked the impeachment inquiry, according to lawmakers attending the closed-door interviews.\n\nOne witness said it appeared \u201cthree amigos\u201d tied to the White House \u2014Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 had taken over foreign policy. Another quoted national security adviser John Bolton as calling Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d for his back-channel efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call in which he pressed Ukraine\u2019s president , Volodymr Zelenskiy, to investigate Biden\u2019s family is at the center of the Democrats\u2019 inquiry.\n\nPelosi, despite intensifying calls from Trump and Republicans to hold a formal vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry, showed no indication she would do so. She said Congress will continue its investigation as part of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThis is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We\u2019re on a path that is taking us, a path to the truth,\u201d Pelosi told reporters after a closed-door session late Tuesday with House Democrats.\n\nDemocratic leaders had been gauging support for a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry after Trump and Republicans pushed them for a roll call. Holding a vote would test politically vulnerable Democrats in areas where the Republican president is popular.\n\nTrump calls the impeachment inquiry an \u201cillegitimate process\u201d and is blocking officials from cooperating.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee overseeing the probe, has praised the State Department officials for stepping forward, under subpoena, to shed light on the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have learned much of this thanks to the courageous testimony of the State Department officials who have been put in an impossible situation by the administration,\u201d which is urging them not to comply with requests to testify to Congress, he said. \u201cThey are doing their duty.\u201d\n\nCareer State Department official George Kent testified Tuesday that he was told by administration officials to \u201clay low\u201d on Ukraine as \u201cthree amigos\u201d tied to the White House took over U.S. foreign policy toward the Eastern European ally.\n\nKent was concerned about the \u201cfake news smear\u201d against Yovanovitch, whom Trump recalled in May, according to emails obtained by the AP.\n\nKent told the lawmakers that he \u201cfound himself outside a parallel process\u201d and had warned others about Giuliani as far back as March. He felt the shadow diplomacy was undermining decades of foreign policy and the rule of law in Ukraine and that was \u201cwrong,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.\n\nConnolly said Kent described a May 23 meeting at the White House, organized by Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, where Sondland, Volker and Perry declared themselves the people now responsible for Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cThey called themselves the three amigos,\u201d Connolly said Kent testified.\n\nKent also told them that Trump, through the Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney previously led, was holding up military aid to Ukraine while pressing Zelenskiy to investigate a company linked to Biden\u2019s son.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Michael Balsamo, Eric Tucker, Matthew Daly, Padmananda Rama, Andrew Taylor and Alan Fram in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Dallas contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The swift-moving impeachment probe pushed onward Wednesday as a former top State Department aide testified that the Trump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/774c8e_trump-impeachment-47922-michael-mckinley-michael-mckinley-top-aide-secretary-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
