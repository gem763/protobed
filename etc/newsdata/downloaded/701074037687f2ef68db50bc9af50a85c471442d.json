CBS News\n\nShe said she never seriously considered running for the White House: \"No, because it's the kind of thing I think you feel in your gut, your soul, your being. I think you know if that is the thing you're supposed to do in your life.\"\n\nBut she had some advice for those who are running: Talk about what you would do for the country, as opposed to all the negativity.\n\n\"I think a lot of the candidates make the biggest mistake, and certainly this happened in the previous election. There's a law, natural law, that says, what you give your attention to, expands. So, you should not talk about the other guy, because you only empower your opponents when you talk about them.
