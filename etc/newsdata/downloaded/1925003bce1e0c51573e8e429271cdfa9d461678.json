USA TODAY\n\nTaking a 1-0 lead into the ninth inning, St. Louis Cardinals closer Carlos Martinez surrendered three runs with two out in front of a stunned crowd at Busch Stadium, as the Atlanta Braves rallied to take a 2-1 series in the National League Division Series.\n\nAdam Wainwright gave the Cardinals a tremendous start, tossing 7 \u2154 shutout innings with eight strikeouts before giving way to the bullpen. But Braves starter Mike Soroka was just as good, surrendering one run in seven innings and at one point retired 17 batters in a row.\n\nMartinez gave up a leadoff double to Josh Donaldson in the ninth but then struck out Nick Markakis and Adeiny Hechavarr\u00eda. On the first pitch to Dansby Swanson, the shortstop ripped a hanging slider into the left-field corner for a run-scoring double. With runners on second and third, Adam Duvall followed with a two-run single that gave the Braves a 3-1 advantage.\n\nTurning point\n\nDuvall, the hero in Game 2, fell behind 0-2 against Martinez \u2013 both swinging strikes \u2013with the game tied and runners on second and third in the ninth. After fouling off a 99-mph fastball, Duvall dunked a single into center field that scored the go-ahead runs.\n\nMan of the moment\n\nBearing the expectations of a No. 1 overall pick, Swanson has been scrutinized through the years. But in the biggest moment of his young career, the 25-year-old came through with the game-tying double in the ninth.\n\n\"I love Dansby in those situations. I always have,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said postgame. \"That kid lives for that moment. And he's been big for us the last few years since he's been up.\"\n\nState of the series\n\nAtlanta moves to the brink of the NLCS, while St. Louis is suddenly playing to save its season. The Braves haven't announced a starter yet for Monday's Game 4, but they could bring back Game 1 starter Dallas Keuchel on three days' rest, or turn to Julio Teheran who was originally left off the NLDS roster.\n\nThe Braves haven't won a postseason series since 2001.", "description": "Atlanta scored three runs with two outs in the ninth against St. Louis closer Carlos Martinez to win 3-1 in NLDS Game 3.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
