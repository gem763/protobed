Do you want to extend (the negotiations) for an indefinite time?,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nEthiopia last month rejected a proposal by Egypt to operate the dam. Addis Ababa did not say how much water it wants to release, but Egypt wants the dam to release a minimum of 40 billion cubic meters of water annually.\n\nYasser Abbas, the Sudanese water resources minister, said Ethiopia had proposed at the talks filling the dam\u2019s reservoir within four to seven years.\n\n\u201cAgreement has been reached on many points but there are some disagreements which the research committee will work on,\u201d he said, without elaborating.", "description": "Egypt said on Saturday that talks with Sudan and Ethiopia over the operation of a $4 billion hydropower dam that Ethiopia is constructing on the Nile have reached a deadlock, and it called for international mediation.", "authors": ["Khalid Abdelaziz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437475514&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940HX", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
