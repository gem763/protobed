You have to be careful.'\"\n\nSpeaking in Northampton, Mr Corbyn said the President's moments were monsterous.\n\nThe Labour leader said: \"That is the most crass, insensitive comment anyone could ever make.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn said he would \"mount legal action\" over the decision to grant diplomatic immunity to Anne Sacoolas if he were Prime Minister.\n\n\"I'm alarmed about that,\" he said.\n\n\"For somebody to be killed in our country and the person who did it to flee to the United States and then claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable.\n\n\"We would put every bit of possible pressure we could on the United States.\n\n\"If we could mount legal action in the United States, we would do so because it is simply not acceptable for someone to seek diplomatic immunity when somebody - a wholly innocent individual - has been killed by the behaviour of somebody else.\"\n\nHarry Dunn's parents want Anne Sacoolas to return to the UK to talk to them after she flew to the US following his death.\n\nHarry's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn have pleaded with Ms Sacoolas to be \"humane and kind\" and return to the UK after fleeing the country and claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, tragically died in a head on collision with a car close to RAF Croughton, an American spy base in Northamptonshire, back in August.\n\n(Image: JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nAnne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat, is suspected to have pulled out onto the wrong side of the road during the fatal accident.\n\nRadd Seiger, the spokesman for the Dunn family, said: \"Trump's comments are an attempted justification for what Anne Sacoolas did.\n\n\"They are insensitive, clumsy, oafish and insulting. We are horrified by his words and this has just brought more pain to the Dunn family.\n\n\"Trump has just inflamed the situation. He's caused more hurt and made the matter worse. His choice of words is appalling\",", "description": "Mr Corbyn said he would \"mount legal action\" over the decision to grant diplomatic immunity to Anne Sacoolas if he were Prime Minister", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Jim Lo Scalzo Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551497.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jeremy-Corbyn-speech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
