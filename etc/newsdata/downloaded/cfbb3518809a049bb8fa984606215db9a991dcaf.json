Microsoft MSFT, -0.68% , Expedia EXPE, +0.12% , and Overstock OSTK, +4.71% , among other big companies, also accept bitcoin. Bottom line: virtual currency has gone mainstream. However, using virtual currency has tax implications that may surprise you and the IRS is on the case.\n\nIn fact, virtual currency transactions are a hot-button issue with the IRS, and you can understand why. Coinbase claims it has now has over 30 million accounts. But in 2013-2015, fewer than 1,000 e-filed federal income tax returns reported transactions that appeared to involve virtual currencies. Hmmm. In response to this seeming contradiction, the IRS forced Coinbase to turn over information about 14,000 of its customers, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn July the IRS announced it has begun sending letters to taxpayers that may have failed to report income from virtual currency transactions or that may have failed to report their transactions properly.\n\nHere are some FAQs and answers on virtual currency and your taxes.\n\nWhat is virtual currency?\n\nVirtual currency is \u201cdigital money\u201d that\u2019s usually issued and controlled by software developers and accepted as payment by willing parties. Virtual currencies are also sometimes called cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2014, the European Banking Authority described virtual currency as a \u201cdigital representation of value\u201d that is not issued by a central bank or public authority but that is accepted by some as a means of payment. In other words, virtual currencies are unregulated \u2014 unlike currencies issued and controlled by governments and central banks.\n\nVirtual currencies can be transferred, stored or traded electronically.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, -1.45% is the best-known virtual currency. You can use it and other virtual currencies to make online payments to willing providers of goods and services. You can also hold virtually currencies for speculative investment.\n\nWhat are the basic tax implications of using virtual currency?\n\nThe IRS takes the position that virtual currency is \u201cproperty\u201d for federal income tax purposes. (Source: IRS Notice 2014-21.) Unfortunately, that means you are supposed to recognize taxable gain or loss every time you exchange virtual currency for goods or services or for good-old U.S. dollars.\n\nIf you fail to report virtual currency transactions on your tax returns and get audited, you could face interest and penalties and or even criminal prosecution in extreme cases. Yikes. Who knew?\n\nDepending on the circumstances, a virtual currency holding can be classified as business property, investment property, or personal-use property.\n\nHow do I translate virtual currency into U.S. dollars for tax purposes?\n\nCalculate the fair market value (FMV), measured in U.S. dollars, of the currency as of the date you receive it. The values of the most-popular virtual currencies are listed on exchanges. For example, bitcoin and three other virtual currencies are listed on the Coinbase exchange.\n\nTo calculate the FMV of virtual currency, convert it into U.S. dollars using the listed exchange rate. For example, at the time this was written, 1 bitcoin translated into $9,948.95. Or $1 translated into 0.000101 bitcoin. If you bought one bitcoin with U.S. dollars at this price, your tax basis in the bitcoin would be $9,948.95.\n\nWhat if I use virtual currency to buy stuff?\n\nWhen you exchange virtual currency for other property (including U.S. dollars), you must recognize taxable gain or loss.\n\nYou will have a taxable gain if the FMV of the property you receive exceeds your basis in the virtual currency.\n\nYou will have a taxable loss if the FMV of the property you receive is less than your basis in the virtual currency.\n\nIf the virtual currency was held for investment purposes for more than one year, any gain will qualify as lower-taxed long-term capital gain.\n\nExample 1: You use 1 bitcoin to buy computer equipment and software for your small business. On the date of the purchase, bitcoins are worth $9,500 each according to Coinbase. So you spent $9,500 on depreciable business computer equipment and software. Fair enough.\n\nBut you bought the bitcoin a few months earlier for only $9,000. So you also have a $500 gain from the appreciation in value of the bitcoin ($9,500 \u2212 $9,000) that you exchanged for the business assets. Since you are not in the trade or business of buying and selling bitcoins, the $500 gain is a capital gain (short-term or long-term depending on how long you held the bitcoin).\n\nWhat if I use virtual currency to pay workers in my business?\n\nIf you use virtual currency to pay employee wages, the FMV of the currency counts as wages subject to federal income tax withholding, FICA tax, and FUTA tax. Like any other wages paid to employees, you must report the wages on Form W-2.\n\nIf you use virtual currency to pay an independent contractor for performing services for your business, the FMV of the currency is subject to self-employment tax for the contractor. You are required to report the payment on Form 1099-MISC if payments to that contractor during the year amount to $600 or more.\n\nYou may also have a gain or loss due to appreciation or decline in the value of the virtual currency during the time you held it before paying it out as wages or for services from an independent contractor. Since you are not in the trade or business of buying and selling virtual currencies, the gain and loss will be a capital gain or capital loss (short-term or long-term depending on how long you held the virtual currency).\n\nWhat if I accept virtual currency as payment for stuff of services?\n\nHere\u2019s what happens, tax-wise.\n\nExample 2: You sell a valuable piece of antique furniture that you bought and lovingly restored for 3 bitcoins. On the date of sale, bitcoins are worth $9,900 each according to Coinbase. Your tax basis in the piece is $20,000. You must recognize a $9,700 taxable gain on the deal: ($9,900 x 3) = $29,700 sale price for the piece - $20,000 tax basis = $9,700 gain.\n\nExample 3: You accept 2 bitcoins as payment for services rendered as an independent contractor. On the date of receipt, bitcoins are worth $10,000 each according to Coinbase. So you must recognize $20,000 of taxable income ($10,000 x 2) for services rendered. And you will probably owe self-employment tax on the $20,000 too.\n\nWhich virtual currency transactions are likely to attract the attention of the IRS?\n\nSome 60% of global Bitcoin transactions were for less than $600, according to Coin Metrics, a virtual currency data provider. The IRS is unlikely to focus its guns on small players. So most folks have nothing to fear. The agency is more interested in tracking down individuals and businesses that engage in significant virtual currency transactions while failing to comply with the tax rules. For instance, those who earn significant unreported profits from speculating in virtual currencies, businesses that collect significant unreported revenue from virtual currency sales, and businesses that pay significant amounts to independent contractors using virtual currency and fail to file 1099s are the types of tax scofflaws the IRS has in its cross-hairs.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFor most folks, the tax rules for virtual currency transactions fall into the \u201cWho Knew?\u201d category. But the IRS doesn\u2019t usually accept that as an excuse, and the agency is on the prowl for virtual currency tax scofflaws. You don\u2019t want to get caught in the net. So it\u2019s important to maintain detailed records of your virtual currency transactions. The records should summarize: (1) when the currency was received, (2) the currency\u2019s FMV on the date you received it and the exchange used to determine that, (3) the purpose for holding the currency, and (4) the FMV of the currency on the date you exchanged it for something else (including U.S dollars) and the exchange used to determine that.\n\nWith this information, you can figure the tax consequences of your virtual currency transactions and keeping records of this information will serve you well if you get audited.", "description": "Beware \u2014 the IRS is on the prowl for cryptocurrency tax scofflaws.", "authors": ["Bill Bischoff"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ857_woman__ZG_20190906154112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
