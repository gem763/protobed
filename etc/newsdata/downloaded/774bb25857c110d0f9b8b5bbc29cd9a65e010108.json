GM, -1.26% and United Auto Workers doesn't look \"too onerous\" for the car maker, analyst Joseph Spak at RBC Capital said in a note late Thursday as more details about the contract emerged. \"We continue to believe that if this is ratified, it is a solid outcome for GM,\" Spak said. Shares of GM were approaching the end of the trading session about 1% lower. The tentative deal offers temp workers a shortened path to permanent status, calls for no additional health care costs, and provides ratification bonuses, and wage increases, among other items. GM shares have gained nearly 9% this year, underperforming the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28%, which has risen 20%.", "description": "The tentative deal struck between General Motors Co. and United Auto Workers doesn't look \"too onerous\" for the car maker, analyst Joseph Spak at...", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
