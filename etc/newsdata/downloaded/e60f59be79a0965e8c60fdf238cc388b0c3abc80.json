REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nFormer Reading keeper Mihaylov, who also played at the World Cup finals in 1986 and 1998 as well as the European championship in 1996, has been heavily criticised by Bulgarian media and fans for failing to lead the BFU out of years of corruption and controversy.\n\nBulgaria have failed to qualify for a major tournament since 2004 while Mihaylov\u2019s tenure has been marred by cronyism allegations. There have been widespread reports of match-fixing in Bulgaria in recent years but little in the way of progress in holding anyone accountable.\n\n\u201cAfter many years spent in the post and with his many contacts at a high international level, Mr. Mihailov expresses his firm readiness to continue to help the development of Bulgarian football in every way possible,\u201d BFU said in a statement.", "description": "The president of the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) stepped down on Tuesday after the prime minister urged him to quit following racist abuse from Bulgarian fans towards black English players during their Euro 2020 qualifier.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441089452&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0KW", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
