There are also no withdrawal restrictions.\n\nThis is a victory for Money Mail's Stop Short-changing Savers campaign, which calls for fairer rates and simpler accounts.\n\nLast month we revealed easy-access accounts are too complicated, with 13 of the top 30 deals restricting when customers can access cash.\n\nIt is also good news the account is available over the phone, as many top rates are now reserved for those willing to run their accounts online.\n\nWith big High Street banks paying a pittance it means savers who do not use the internet are increasingly reliant on phone or postal accounts.\n\nBritain\u2019s biggest building society Nationwide, for example, pays just 0.1 per cent on balances up to \u00a310,000 and 0.25 per cent if you have \u00a350,000+ in its Instant Access Saver.\n\nHalifax Everyday Saver and Web Saver, and Lloyds Bank Easy Saver, Standard Saver, Online Saver and Internet Saver pay only 0.2 per cent.\n\nBarclays Everyday Saver offers 0.25 per cent, or 0.3 per cent if you have \u00a350,000 or more in the account. NatWest Instant Saver starts at 0.2 per cent up to \u00a325,000, rising to just 0.3 per cent up to \u00a31 million\n\nAnd you earn only 0.35 per cent with Santander Everyday Saver and an even worse 0.15 per cent with HSBC Flexible Saver. The Marcus account from Goldman Sachs pays 1.45 per cent.\n\nThe new Saga account is only open to those aged 50 or over and can be run as an individual or joint account.\n\nYou can also attach a power of attorney document to it so a loved one can look after your money if you are unable to manage it in the future.\n\nEchoing the demands behind Money Mail\u2019s campaign, Jeff Bromage, managing director at Saga Personal Finance, says: \u2018We have listened to our customers and this is what they want \u2014 a consistently good rate, decent service and an account which is simple to understand.\u2019\n\nSaga\u2019s one-year fixed-rate bond, at 1.15 per cent, is far higher than major High Street accounts, too. Halifax and Lloyds pay just 0.55 per cent for two years, while Barclays and NatWest pay 0.65 per cent for one year.\n\nAny money in the Saga account is covered up to \u00a385,000 \u2014 \u00a3170,000 on joint accounts \u2014 under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\n\nThis applies to the total of any deposits with Goldman Sachs International Bank under any brand, including savings you may have with its Marcus account.\n\nIf you have savings in old Saga accounts opened before September 28 this year, your money is still with Birmingham Midshires and covered under the FSCS by the Bank of Scotland licence.\n\nsy.morris@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Saga's new Saga Easy Access Savings Account pledges to pay a consistently competitive rate without enforcing any complicated rules.
