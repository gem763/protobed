For AW20, the label has been announced as the Special Project for the forthcoming iteration of Pitti Uomo 97, the biannual menswear fair taking place January 7th-10th in Florence.\n\n\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Y-Project, Sterling Ruby and Claire Waight Keller\u2019s Givenchy, the announcement cements Telfar\u2019s reputation as an international fashion force. Known for its uniquely askew takes on all-American dressing, Telfar\u2019s presentation is sure to offer a welcome jolt to the Italian event.\n\nSpeaking of the decision to invite Telfar to take the stage, Lapo Cianchi, Pitti Imagine\u2019s Director of Communication & Special Events, praised the designer\u2019s \u201cfifteen years [of] promoting with tenacity an idea of inclusive and accessible fashion and business, with a project in which there is an unexpected blending of aesthetics, art, genre identity and functionality. We are happy to offer him the opportunity to present himself to the Pitti Uomo community, and I am sure that the event in Florence will provide further meaning to a message that is already strong and vibrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are honoured to be invited to show at Pitti Uomo, where the deep sense of history and continuity sets the scene perfectly for something entirely new,\u201d added Telfar.\n\n2020 can\u2019t come soon enough!", "description": "The Florentine menswear fair will be the brand\u2019s next stop on its world tour.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db176c9cc977f008dac99a0/lede/1571911460590-unnamed-2019-10-24T110346009.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7718xh;0xw,0.1474xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
