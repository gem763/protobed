Brexit is his Iraq", "language": "en", "text": "David Cameron has had three long years to ruminate on what it was that went so badly wrong with the whole EU referendum thing. And yet, even now, he exudes the air of a man who brought a cake to a coffee morning because no one told him it was in fact a knife fight to which everybody else would be bringing a gun.\n\nITV\u2019s Tom Bradby is one a very small number of people who have been allowed to read Cameron's memoirs prior to their release next week. And like everyone else who has done he has come to the same crucial conclusion, which is that, spread over 800 long pages, the chap that led the remain campaign, \u201cComes across as a raging Eurosceptic.\u201d\n\nThat, really, is the heart of the matter. That, nice, polite David Cameron thought he could win a nice, polite referendum, in which he could nicely and politely say that the EU isn\u2019t great but ho, hum, life\u2019s not so bad, is it?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd then, to his considerable surprise in roared Michael Gove and Boris Johnson from left field, telling wild lies about Turkey and immigration and \u00a3350m a week and suddenly all was lost.\n\nAnd that, fundamentally, is the story. Over half an hour of conversation, Cameron remained the honest, decent, fundamentally rather likeable chap that he is.\n\nThe sort of honest, decent, fundamentally likeable chap that, for a generation or so, was what you had to be to win an election on these honest, decent, fundamentally likeable islands, before everything went so irredeemably mad.\n\nThere were gentle attempts at settling scores. Bradby pointed out that in the book Cameron calls Gove and Johnson, \u201cambassadors for the post-truth age.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Cameron announced his resignation after Britain voted to leave the European Union after a bitterly divisive referendum campaign AP\n\nBut the scores will not be settled, overall. The ledgers can\u2019t be made to match. Cameron has lost, in pyrotechnic fashion, and no number of salty words in a memoir can level the scores.\n\nIn his early years, Cameron liked to describe himself as the \u201cheir to Blair\u201d and never has it seemed more true.\n\nTo listen to Cameron reason out why he was sorry but not sorry about the referendum, why it was the wrong decision but also the right one, was not merely de ja vu, but actively haunting. Like you\u2019d left one of Tony Blair\u2019s many interviews on Iraq on the bedside table overnight and it had auto-downloaded a new operating system. It looks different, it feels different, but essentially it's still the same.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m deeply sorry about all that\u2019s happened, there isn\u2019t a day that goes by when I don\u2019t think about all the decisions I made and all that has followed,\u201d he said, the \u2018but\u2019 limbering up in his larynx like a champion sprinter.\n\n\u201cBut when I go back to that decision, that Britain\u2019s position needed to be sorted and we needed a renegotiation and a referendum; I believe that was the right approach.\u201d\n\nDoes that, perchance, remind you of anybody? The carefully honed phrases, the same epistemological half confession, structured like its been tested on a hundred bedroom ceilings wide eyed at 2am.\n\nAs Cameron made his case that Europe couldn\u2019t just be ignored, that the second you become prime minister, there\u2019s a eurozone crisis, or European banks need bailing out, and you can\u2019t just ignore it, it was, just about, believable, plausible.\n\nBut these are afflictions which have always cursed the Tory Party far more than the country. These are perceived slights that Tories feel more acutely than the rest of us.\n\nAnd, in the end, what he did was to give his party\u2019s problem to the people and ask them to solve it for him, something they, or rather we, could never solve but only make worse.\n\nIt was a terrible strategic decision, and a crushing failure of leadership.\n\nWhich is why, honest, decent likeable chap though he is, he has been so prematurely expelled from British politics.\n\nStill, it was, at least, a thirty minute long reminder that, not so long ago, you had to at least be able to affect the air of being an honourable person to hold the highest office in the land. The question that remains is whether such a time will come again.\n\nFor the time being at least, nothing has seemed further from reality.", "description": "David Cameron has had three long years to ruminate on what it was that went so badly wrong with the whole EU referendum thing.
