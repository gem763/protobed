(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nPresident Trump began his weekend defending his \u201cperfectly fine and routine\u201d conversation with the Ukrainian president in which he reportedly asked the foreign leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump references his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but makes no mention of whether he brought up Biden during the conversation. Instead, he blames the news media for its coverage of the story.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won\u2019t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn\u2019t want to report!\u201d he said in a pair of tweets.\n\n[How Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s rivals]\n\nHe later tweeted that the news was an extension of the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d carried out by Democrats, his frequent reference to the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and firing of James B. Comey as FBI director.\n\n\u201cNow that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone \u201cbust\u201d on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments echo a defense first laid out Thursday night by his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who argued that the president could ask a foreign leader anything he wanted and that the real story was related to Biden\u2019s pressuring the Ukrainian government in 2016 to fire its top prosecutor who at the time happened to be investigating a company in which Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had a stake.\n\nTrump made similar comments on Friday to reporters at the White House, saying \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed\u201d with Zelensky and that \u201csomeone ought to look into\u201d the former vice president.\n\n[Trump\u2019s freeze on Ukraine aid draws new scrutiny amid push for Biden investigation]\n\nBiden\u2019s efforts to get the top Ukrainian prosecutor removed was related to the United States\u2019 belief that he wasn\u2019t weeding out corruption in the country. No evidence has been found that Biden was trying to help his son.\n\nAfter Trump tweeted complaining that the media wouldn\u2019t cover the Biden story, he tweeted a video montage showing the media covering the Biden story.\n\nAn intelligence official who on a phone call with Trump and Volodymyr in July reported to the intelligence agency\u2019s inspector general that Trump had made a promise to the foreign leader that unnerved the whistleblower.\n\nSubsequent reporting found that during the call Trump pressured Volodymyr to look into Biden\u2019s son. Then, Giuliani followed up with a more specific request that the country examine both the Ukrainian natural gas company who had Biden\u2019s son Hunter on his board as well as whether Democrats had colluded with Ukraine to get information about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report.", "description": "The president, in a series of tweets, makes no mention of whether he brought up Biden during the conversation.
