By which of course I mean a giant Ebenezer Scrooge-style nightgown built to catch all of my tears. Turns out I don\u2019t need such a contraption because This Is Us isn\u2019t interested in eliciting my tears this week. No, it\u2019s more interested in \u201cexpanding the TIU universe\u201d and \u201cintroducing new characters\u201d and \u201cattempting to tell a meaningful story in an interesting way by sidelining our favorite characters.\u201d All of that is a gosh darn shame, because I really need my weekly cathartic cry and this is just not doing it for me.\n\nIt\u2019s not like This Is Us didn\u2019t warn us. For weeks now, the trailer has promised a season full of unfamiliar faces. It\u2019s a confusing tactic and even the trailer, set to Mandy Moore\u2019s Rebecca ruminating on how strange it is that \u201ca complete stranger can become such a big part of your life,\u201d had me wondering if instead of a season four we were about to get some House reboot. Alas, Omar Epps and Jennifer Morrison do not share the screen\u2026yet. It\u2019s possible they will in the future because both of them are playing characters who are in the Pearson family\u2019s orbit.\n\nIt\u2019s a risky move to devote 75 percent of your premiere episode to characters we\u2019ve never met before\u2014don\u2019t worry kids, Mom and Dad get a storyline tonight\u2014and it\u2019ll be interesting to revisit this episode at the end of the season. Who knows, maybe by the time this whole series ends the people we met tonight will be so entwined with the Pearson clan, their introductions will be rendered incredibly moving. For now, it sort of feels like This Is Us is showing off some new tricks. I have to admit that I thought the show would string us along for several episodes before revealing how these people were tied into the main story, but good on This Is Us\u2014by the end of \u201cStrangers\u201d we know how they\u2019re initially connected. I\u2019m sure not everything is as straightforward as it seems, and there will be some twists along the way, because dear lord there\u2019s nothing This Is Us loves more than to parse out information and then toss in a big twist that is emotionally manipulative and set sad music. I mean that as a compliment? I think? I mean, I\u2019m still here for Pearson shenanigans after all these years, and so are you.\n\nWell, should we meet the newbies? Let\u2019s start with Cassidy Sharp (Morrison), currently the most depressing of the new characters, which means she\u2019ll fit in great here. Cassidy is a marine deployed in the Middle East with a husband, Ryan (Nick Wechsler\u2014and as a person who watched Roswell and tolerated Revenge solely for the Emily-Jack romance, can we get this dude a lead role on a show already?), and young son, Matty, waiting for her at home. We see a little of her life during deployment, and even then, she is not in a great way. Once she\u2019s home, things get even worse: She can\u2019t get a job, she\u2019s drinking A LOT, her marriage is basically non-existent, and one day while completely out of it and frustrated she ends up hitting her son. In short, the woman has PTSD.\n\nAnd so she ends up seeking help at the local Veterans\u2019 Affairs. In a group therapy session, she opens up about the fact that she\u2019s stopped feeling anything since being home and the guilt she feels for hitting her son. It\u2019s all very moving (Morrison is great, no?)\u2026 until a chair comes crashing through the window, thrown by a very drunk old vet walking around. That drunk old vet is Nicky Pearson.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, Kevin gets a phone call telling him that his uncle has been arrested and gave the police his number for bail money. And just like that, Kevin Pearson is booking a flight to Pittsburgh that will put him right in the path of Cassidy Sharp.\n\nWe also meet Malik (Asante Blackk), a teenager in Philadelphia with an infant daughter. We meet his parents, played by Omar Epps and Marsha Stephanie Blake, who are helping to raise their granddaughter while also doing very cute things like flirting over breakfast and generally giving Randall and Beth a run for Best Married Couple\u2014don\u2019t tell them I said that. Malik is grappling with being both a parent and a teenager. He works for his father, Darnell, at his body shop but also entertains the idea of getting into some very shady business in order to make money to support his daughter. Darnell catches wind of what Malik\u2019s getting into and has a heart-to-heart with his son. Darnell almost went down a dark path, but when Malik\u2019s mother wound up pregnant, it put Darnell on the straight and narrow\u2026 and the straight and narrow isn\u2019t such a bad place to be. He also wants his son to know that his life isn\u2019t over because he has a baby, and even offers to babysit so that Malik can go to his friend\u2019s end-of-summer barbecue. It\u2019s a good thing, too, because it\u2019s at this party that Malik is introduced to the new girl in town. Her name is Deja.\n\nYou guys! Malik and Deja are so flirty and cute over hamburgers, it warms my cold, dead heart. You know what warms it even more? When Deja goes home to her new house and Randall asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with your face?\u201d She is smiling and she cannot help herself. Deja is in love and she doesn\u2019t care who knows it! I mean, she\u2019ll probably care once Randall knows it, because can you even imagine Randall dealing with his daughters going on dates?\n\nOh, speaking of a love story, we still have to meet our third new character: Naked Blind Musician. We find this young guy very hungover one morning, cooking breakfast for himself and his dog, Sam. Sam unfortunately breaks the dish the Blind Musician\u2019s food is on, thus ruining breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so the Musician heads over to a diner where he meets a waitress named Lucy. He immediately falls for her and she seems into him and the Musician goes home and writes a new song. We watch their relationship in hyperspeed: they hook up, they hang out with their dog while wearing comfortable clothes, they get engaged (this is the natural progression of relationships, I think). We find them again one evening after they\u2019ve been married and have just opened up a restaurant\u2014Lucy\u2019s dream\u2014and Lucy informs her husband that she\u2019s six weeks pregnant and she is scared. He assures her it\u2019ll all be okay because man, this dude is so insanely in love with his wife and confident that they can tackle anything together and hm, that\u2019s weird, don\u2019t we know someone like that?\n\nBack in the present-day timeline, Kate and Toby are at the doctor\u2019s office and have just learned that despite multiple surgeries, their infant son is blind. Hmm?\n\nAnd then it\u2019s revealed that the Musician is wildly successful and about to perform to a sold-out stadium and he\u2019s introduced as, that\u2019s right, Jack Damon. Living out his grandmother and mother\u2019s dreams and acting all Jack Pearson-y. Oh, we should add that to the list of things This Is Us loves: parsing out information, emotionally manipulative twists, and bringing things full circle. This show hasn\u2019t met a full circle it doesn\u2019t love!\n\nThis parade of new faces is framed by two of our favorite faces: Jack and Rebecca. And it\u2019s their bright, shiny, young faces, not the \u201cI\u2019m ancient and dying and I will surely suck out your soul\u201d Ancient Rebecca face that haunts my dreams, so that\u2019s nice! No, we find Jack and Rebecca returning from their road trip to Los Angeles where Rebecca\u2019s dreams were crushed, but also she hung out with the love of her life, so it\u2019s a toss up of a vacation, really.\n\nWe always knew Jack and Rebecca were INTENSE. All the monologuing they do throughout their marriage alone is insane. But we didn\u2019t fully know the extent to which they were intense from the beginning. Yes, obviously going on a cross country road trip for your third date is intense, but their fourth date is even more so: Jack agrees to have dinner with Rebecca\u2019s parents at! The! Country club! This is possibly the worst decision these two have made as a couple, which you know is really saying something because these are the people who decided to use a defective crockpot for 17 years. WE ALL KNOW HOW THAT ENDED.\n\nThis wild fourth date, at the very least, leads us to maybe the cutest meet-cute in the history of the show: Jack needs a sport coat for the dinner and who does he find to help him at the store? The greatest suit salesman in all the land: Miguel Rivas. Guys! This is how Jack and Miguel meet and honestly, I clapped when it happened. When Miguel realizes Jack can\u2019t afford to buy the blazer, he lets him borrow it for a week. Dear, sweet, Miguel, remember how wrong I was about you in the beginning?\n\nAnyway, the dinner is awkward as hell. We already knew Rebecca\u2019s mom Janet was a certain level of she-beast, but her father (welcome, Tim Matheson) is a stealth villain. Jack gets off to a rocky start, but after a quick bathroom break in which he gives himself his own sort of pep talk (very Jack), he comes back to the table and gives an early version of a patented Jack Pearson Speech about how his parents are awful to each other, about losing Nicky, and about how sorry he is that the first impression he made on Rebecca\u2019s parents was him whisking their daughter across the country for two weeks, but that he\u2019ll be able to work on it because he\u2019ll be around for a while. The entire time, you can see Rebecca falling more and more in love with Jack, and that\u2019s cool for them, but honestly, if a dude rolled up to my family\u2019s dinner and gave an intense speech like that, my family would be like \u201cno, no, hard pass here.\u201d That\u2019s more or less what Rebecca\u2019s dad says when he pulls Jack aside after the meal. He\u2019s been more than lovely to Jack\u2019s face, but alone he tells him that he\u2019s damaged goods and he wants more for his daughter\u2014there\u2019s no way this is happening.\n\nWe already know who wins this war, but it should nonetheless be fun to watch Jack fight for his relationship with Rebecca. And by fun, obviously I mean emotionally gutting because hi, hello, nothing on this show is fun. All those new characters have been warned!", "description": "It\u2019s a parade of new faces, framed by two of our favorite faces.
