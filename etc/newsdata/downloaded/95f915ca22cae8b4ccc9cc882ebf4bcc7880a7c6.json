FOX, +2.42% FOXA, +3.08% . President Trump has been increasingly critical of personalities on Fox News that he views as disloyal.\n\nOn his afternoon newscast, Smith had frequently given tough reports debunking statements made by Trump and his supporters \u2014 even the Fox News opinion hosts that rule the network\u2019s prime-time lineup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Smith clashed with Tucker Carlson when an analyst on Smith\u2019s program, Andrew Napolitano, said that it was a crime for Trump to solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government, in this case the Ukraine. Later that night, Carlson asked his own analyst, Joseph diGenova, to comment, and diGenova called Napolitano a fool.\n\nThe next day, Smith said that \u201cattacking our colleague who is here to offer legal assessments, on our air, in our work home, is repugnant.\u201d", "description": "Shepard Smith had been with Fox News since the network was launched in 1996.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
