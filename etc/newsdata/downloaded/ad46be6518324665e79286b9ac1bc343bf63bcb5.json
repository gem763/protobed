One month later, Chris popped the question on Southport Pier where the couple had enjoyed one of their first dates.\n\nThe pair organised to get married in June 2019 \u2013 two months after they first met \u2013 and tied the knot at Shoreline Church, Southport, surrounded by 60 family and friends.\n\nChris and Viktorija have now returned from their honeymoon in Barcelona and can\u2019t wait to start the rest of their lives together.\n\n\u2018The moment I saw his profile I felt a connection to him \u2013 his photos made him look open and kind,\u2019 Viktorjia said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I spoke to a few people on the site but after I met Chris on there I stopped my other conversations and put all my attention onto him.\n\n\u2018He had such a strong passion for ministry and it just felt right. I knew there was something special and we went for it.\u2019\n\nViktorija joined the dating site in March 2019 after her sister encouraged her to sign up. She had only been a member for two weeks when Chris came across her profile and struck up a conversation with her.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t sure about joining the dating site but I\u2019d moved home after travelling in Thailand and my sister suggested it would be a good way to meet people \u2013 even just to make some friends,\u2019 said Viktorija.\n\n\u2018I spoke to a few people and then Chris started a conversation with me and it just felt right. To be honest I was planning to stay alone for a while \u2013 I didn\u2019t expect to meet someone so quickly.\n\n\u2018At the time I started applying for jobs in the UK and I planned to go over for the some interviews. It tied in together and I could also finally meet Chris.\n\n\u2018I remember being at the airport with my mum and she could already see how happy I was, giggling on the phone to him.\n\n\u2018I already felt like I was in love with him when we were talking online.\u2019\n\nThey got married two months after meeting (Picture: Viktorija Vakulenko / SWNS)\n\nViktorija moved to Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, to stay with a friend before travelling up to meet Chris first the first time over Easter weekend in April 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018There was a postcard in my host\u2019s house of Southport and [I] thought: \u201cThat looks so nice, what a cool place\u201d.\n\n\u2018It felt like there were lots of signs for us to be together and I was taking those signs as direction. I was super nervous but there were lots of sparks the moment we met at the train station.\n\n\u2018He took me to the pier and it was such a romantic first date.\n\n\u2018We started talking about marriage that day \u2013 we both knew that\u2019s what we wanted. We joined that dating app because we were hoping to meet someone to have a future and because we both have the same faith.\n\n\u2018Chris had a spare room for me to stay in that weekend and we knew nothing else romantic was going to happen. We were both prepared to wait until we got married because it felt right.\u2019\n\nAfter their first weekend together, Viktorija started looking for work in Southport so she could be closer to Chris.\n\nChris decided to pop the question on 15 May \u2013 less than four weeks after they first met face-to-face. He hatched a plan to take her to the pavilion restaurant, Southport, where they had one of their first dates and he asked staff to film the moment he popped the question.\n\nThey\u2019re very happy together (Picture: Lee McLean / SWNS)\n\nViktorjia said: \u2018I knew we were going to get married because we talked about it but I didn\u2019t know when it would happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Chris took me to the restaurant and it was a beautiful sunset. When he asked me I was so surprised and excited \u2013 it was all perfect.\u2019\n\nThe couple couldn\u2019t wait to make things official and set a date for the big day on 15 June this year.\n\nShe said: \u2018My mum and sister came over from Riga but my dad couldn\u2019t make is so Chris\u2019 dad offered to walk me down the aisle.\n\n\u2018We had only just met and he said I was \u201cperfect\u201d for Chris \u2013 it meant so much. Everyone had a great day and although it started cloudy it got sunny.\n\n\u2018It was a perfect day and it never felt like it was too soon, it felt like it was just the right time.\n\n\u2018We want children and I\u2019m looking forward to the future and for now we\u2019re looking for a place to live and focusing on our ministry.\u2019\n\nChris, who had been on the dating site for a couple of years, recalls the moment he first came across Viktorija online.\n\nHe said: \u2018We were both on the site because we wanted to meet someone and get married, I just hadn\u2019t met that person yet, not until I found Viktorija.\n\n\u2018The moment I saw her pictures I thought: \u201cWho is this girl? I have to speak to her\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We were so similar and we both had a strong belief in our Christian faith which brought us closer together.\n\n\u2018The moment I met her I knew we were going to get married \u2013 we wanted to get to know each other a bit and become best friends. The day I proposed I didn\u2019t have much of a plan, I just knew I wanted to take her to the pier where we had one of our first dates.\n\n\u2018The sunset was incredible and I knew I had to do it then.\n\n\u2018I told the staff I was going to propose and asked them to film us. It was perfect and they helped make the day really special for us.\n\nAfter getting hitched, the pair went off to Barcelona for a honeymoon.\n\nSince returning, they\u2019ve been on the hunt for a home to call their own.\n\n\u2018Everything\u2019s a bit up in the air at the moment, we\u2019re looking for somewhere to live to get settled.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re taking each day at a time and enjoying getting to know each other more.\u2019\n\nMORE: Dad\u2019s heartwarming appeal after only two friends show up to autistic daughter\u2019s birthday\n\nMORE: Rescue baby koala given the cutest little arm cast after falling from a tree\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Christopher Rimmer and Viktorija Vakulenko met on a Christian dating app and fell in love instantly.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89842236_1571073433.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
