That didn\u2019t work out, either.\n\nThe book Slate did write, which Little, Brown will release on Nov. 5, is more autobiographical than sociological or critical, but it doesn\u2019t quite fall into the category of personal essays. The word \u201cdivorce\u201d only appears a few times in its pages. Disclosures are often cushioned by whimsical rhetorical devices. Proper nouns, even the name of her dog, have been largely left out. She writes about nurture and nourishment: returning to the (almost certainly haunted) house where she grew up; drinking a beer alone in the airport; saying hello to the dog first, and the human second, if at all; admiring the ferocity of other women; watching the solar eclipse in a crowd of strangers; picking the perfect flower to fill her window boxes. You might call them personal abstractions.\n\nImage \u201cLittle Weirds\u201d is out Nov. 5. Credit... Patricia Wall/The New York Times\n\n\u201cLittle Weirds\u201d has retained some of its original feminist underpinnings, in its reverence for nature and the female body, and its condemnation of male arrogance. Slate, who is 37 and was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton, said she couldn\u2019t have written like this in her 20s. \u201cEven though I grew up in a privileged situation \u2014 I went to private school, and my parents are both artists, and I had access to a lot of literature and art, and I had a really caring family and good health and safety \u2014 I don\u2019t really feel like anybody directly spoke to me about feminism,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that it was important to say directly that you are a feminist, and I didn\u2019t know what it meant.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she was cast in the 2014 film \u201cObvious Child,\u201d which revolves around a comedian\u2019s unplanned pregnancy, that she came to understand the relationship between her body, her voice and the rest of the world. She credits her feminist awakening to that film\u2019s director, Gillian Robespierre. They have become serial collaborators, ever since Robespierre identified something sensitive about Slate\u2019s stand-up.", "description": "\u201cLittle Weirds,\u201d a new collection by the actress and comedian, isn\u2019t the funny memoir you might have expected.", "authors": ["Bonnie Wertheim"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/books/18Slate2/18Slate2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
