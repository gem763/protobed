Gabbard, a noted non-interventionist who, like President Trump, isn\u2019t fond of the idea of endless, pointless, unwinnable wars across the ocean when there is so much to deal with on our own shores, predictably took issue with Clinton\u2019s Friday podcast characterization of her as a \u201cfavorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman hit back hard, calling Clinton out as the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d who has the blood of those killed in Iraq, a \u201cwar she championed,\u201d unequivocally \u201con her hands.\u201d\n\nIt was the best story of the weekend, by far, and kept the talking heads busy commenting on the exchange and even speculating on why Hillary would choose Gabbard of all candidates \u2013 someone who, despite being the most photogenic of the bunch by far, hasn\u2019t managed to break two percent in the polls \u2013 to pick on in what should have been a pretty mundane podcast appearance. Some opined that the notably vainglorious former first lady merely wants to stay in the spotlight and, given their differences on foreign policy, Gabbard is an easy mark. Others speculated that Clinton may be prepping or testing the waters for her own run. Gabbard herself told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson she knows \u201cexactly why,\u201d because she is \u201cstanding up and speaking out strongly against the Hillary Clinton legacy, the warmongering legacy of waging these regime change wars.\u201d\n\nSure, it could be all or any of those, to some degree. But what seems to have gotten little or no coverage in all the fireworks is, oddly enough, a full analysis of Clinton\u2019s statement in its entirety. And that\u2019s surprising, actually, because I believe it reveals a lot about the Democratic Party establishment\u2019s mindset at this point in the campaign season. Consider: the Russians, according to Hillary, are \u201cgrooming\u201d Gabbard \u201cto be the third-party candidate.\u201d In the same exchange, Clinton called 2016 Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant quote: \u201cI think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it is going to be but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\u201d\n\nTulsi got all the headlines, but why did Hillary also bring up Jill Stein, especially when the Green Party candidate isn\u2019t even officially running yet? Like everyone else involved in the brouhaha, Stein offered up her own theory, except this one was the most accurate by far:\n\n\u201cTulsi has said that she is dedicated to running as a Democrat and has been for her whole life. So that\u2019s pretty believable. I am not running for office. Somehow Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t do her Google research or she would know that I am not running,\u201d Stein said in a CNN interview. \u201cI think it speaks to Hillary\u2019s need to try to explain perhaps to herself, you know, why her campaign was not successful.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019re getting somewhere. In 2016, Stein won enough votes in the key states of Wisconsin and Michigan to keep those states blue, had she been able to magically gift them to Hillary. In other words, it\u2019s a pretty fair statement that, all other things being equal, a third party candidate, Jill Stein, may very well have cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election.\n\nAnd the only way to explain THAT, at least in Hillary\u2019s warped mind, is those bastardly RUSSIANS!\n\nNevermind, of course, that third party candidates have cost Republicans too. Nevermind that Hillary Clinton herself would have never become First Lady, and consequently a national political figure, had it not been for Ross Perot\u2019s 1992 Reform Party candidacy. Nevermind that, in 2016, libertarian candidate Gary Johnson won over three times as many votes in Michigan as Stein did, most of which would arguably have gone to Trump. Still, when one doesn\u2019t feel like taking accountability for one\u2019s own campaign mistakes and increasing irrelevancy, it\u2019s always good to blame and call out Russians ... and Jill Stein ... and \u2026 Tulsi Gabbard?\n\nWhy Gabbard, especially considering the Hawaii congresswoman has never stated any sort of intention to launch a third party bid? Is it just the foreign policy differences that have Hillary\u2019s attention, or is she simply using Gabbard \u2013 the candidate with whom she shares the least in common politically \u2013 to attempt to inoculate the Democratic Party against a potential third party run? If so, it\u2019s actually a pretty brilliant move. By bringing in Stein and preliminarily calling her, and Gabbard \u2013 and by insinuation anyone who decides to go rogue \u2013 \u201cRussian assets,\u201d Clinton is possibly making it less likely that anyone of note will launch a third party bid and potentially cost the Democrats in key swing states.\n\nSuch an effort always has the chance of backfiring, obviously. Already, Gabbard\u2019s national profile is at least twice what it was before the weekend. Keep it up, and she could be hopping mad enough to go third party just to spite a Democratic establishment that long ago lost its non-interventionist way.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Trump supporter, wouldn\u2019t that be marvelous? And wouldn\u2019t it be equally grand to not dilute our own vote with quixotic, self-aggrandizing bids by anti-Trump virtue signallers? As crazy as the Trump era has been, wouldn\u2019t it be fun to sit back and watch the Democrats fracture while we back our guy - faults and all - in a cruise to victory?\n\nAnd THAT, ladies and gents, would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s greatest fear.", "description": "In case you just woke up from a four day .10/21/2019 0:08:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/91a64dbb-6549-4545-be71-b3201d31f72a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
