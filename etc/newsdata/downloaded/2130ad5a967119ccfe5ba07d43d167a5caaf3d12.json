A whistleblower complaint by an intelligence officer suggested Trump also held back nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine as additional leverage, which Trump has denied doing.\n\n\u2014 The Justice Department is now investigating its own probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow. Attorney General William Barr and another senior department official traveled to Europe in recent months to investigate the theory that the FBI investigation, first launched during the presidential campaign in 2016, was actually a plot to stop Trump from becoming president.\n\nThe president's tendency to say untrue things, particularly on Twitter, has caused headaches for his administration before. Until now, however, the government had largely taken pains to distance itself from such statements.\n\nAs recently as last year, the Justice Department argued in a series of court cases that when it came to national security, the president did not necessarily know what he was tweeting about.\n\nHere are the three cases in which Trump has publicly advanced views of uncorroborated conspiracies behind episodes damaging his presidency.
