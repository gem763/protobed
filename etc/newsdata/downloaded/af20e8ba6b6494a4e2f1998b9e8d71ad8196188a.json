Even so, the agency cautioned that flour has a long shelf life and could still be in consumers' pantries. Of the 21 illnesses in that outbreak, three required hospitalization, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile most strains of E. coli are harmless, that particular strain involves E. coli 026, a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. Seniors, the very young and those with compromised immune systems are the most vulnerable to foodborne illnesses.\n\nJ.M. Smucker Co.'s recall of Robin Hood All Purpose Flour is also due to E. coli concerns. The recall involves five-pound bags with \"best-if-used-by\" dates in June 2020. Product codes can be found here.\n\nRecalled product Hand-out\n\nConsumers should not consume the recalled products, and those with questions can call 888-569-6728, Monday through Friday, between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. E.T., the company said.", "description": "The recall of some bags of Unbleached All-Purpose Flour comes after a series of flour recalls earlier in the year", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/f56ad20b-370f-440e-9f34-d2c2b244cfcf/thumbnail/1200x630/6ede8f500c61854ad65ce6e1733c8c7e/front-9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
