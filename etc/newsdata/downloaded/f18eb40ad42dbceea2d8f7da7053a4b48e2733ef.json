Here are our picks for Sept. 23-29, including the best deals we could find for each.\n\nYeezus\u2019s gospel-leaning ninth solo studio album, which was originally announced as Yandhi and missed two release dates last year, is seemingly finally coming out. Reportedly inspired by Kanye\u2019s weekly Sunday Service programs \u2014 which have attracted such celebrities as David Letterman, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, Courtney Love and Tyler the Creator \u2014 and recorded intermittently in Uganda and Wyoming, the record will feature an array of guest artists, including Ty Dolla Sign and Ant Clemons.\n\nKanye, who recently announced he is a born-again Christian, publicly previewed two Jesus Is King tracks, \"Water\" and \"Garden,\" at his Easter Sunday Service concert at Coachella earlier this year, though other songs that leaked during the long and confusing evolution from Yandhi don\u2019t seem to have made this album\u2019s final tracklisting. \u2014 Lyndsey Parker\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger is truly sensational as Judy Garland in this Rupert Goold-directed biopic, and looks to be the early frontrunner in the Best Actress Oscar race, where a nomination would mark the past winner's first in 16 years. But the better news for Garland fans is that while too many biopics can't measure up to their lead performances as a whole, the film itself is illuminating and deeply poignant. It follows Garland's troubled residency in a London nightclub in the year that preceded her tragic death, flashing back to the Wizard of Oz's formative years in which she was carefully controlled by Louie B. Mayer and Hollywood's studio system. Her success was bittersweet, which is why her faithful will be laughing one minute, cringing the next and crying by the end. \u2014 Kevin Polowy\n\nJudy opens in theaters on Sept. 27; visit Fandango or Atom Tickets for showtime and ticket information.\n\nYou probably heard by now that the Ghost and G.I. Jane actress, 56, has written a memoir about her nearly four decades in Hollywood. While many books are classified as \"tell-alls,\" this one truly is \u2014 from her unstable upbringing with an addict mother who betrayed her in the most devastating way to the drug-induced seizure she suffered at almost 50 that was the impetuous for her to get sober again.\n\nChecking her vanity at the door, Moore details her three failed marriages \u2014 including to Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher \u2014 in a warts and all way. The latter, she said, was a May-December relationship plagued with problems from the start because she broke her sobriety to make herself more appealing to her young beau. Moore also revealed that she agreed to threesomes, which she said later blurred the lines in their relationship when he allegedly started cheating when she wasn't there. They also lost a baby when she was six months pregnant.\n\nMoore also writes about her estrangement with her daughters with Wills \u2014 Rumer, Scout and Tallulah \u2014 after her marriage to Kutcher ended and her addiction troubles spiraled out of control, bravely tearing down the facade that she has been a perfect mother. The book also talks about how she was a pioneer in the movie industry, demanding equal pay for her work long before Time's Up made it OK \u2014 and being publicly branded greedy (\"Gimme Moore\") for it. Moore said she wrote the book to help others who may be struggling and to reclaim her life. \u2014 Suzy Byrne\n\nInside Out: A Memoir is available on Amazon.\n\nRyan Murphy\u2019s first Netflix series stars Tony-winner Ben Platt as a Tracy Flick-like high school politician with his eyes on a higher office \u2014 specifically one that\u2019s oval-shaped. Murphy regulars Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange are also part of the show\u2019s A-list ensemble, alongside Zoey Deutch, Bob Balaban and Bette Midler. \u2014 Ethan Alter\n\nThe Politician premieres Friday, Sept. 27 on Netflix.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the How to Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda franchises in the rearview, the house that Shrek built is hunting for their next generation of franchises. The 2016 hit Trolls is already one of the building blocks for the studio\u2019s future, and Dreamworks\u2019s newest feature, Abominable, has the goods to become an ongoing series as well. Co-produced with China\u2019s Pearl Studio, Abominable is the first major Hollywood cartoon since Disney\u2019s Mulan to feature a predominantly Asian vocal cast. Set in present day Shanghai, the film follows disaffected teenager, Yi (Chloe Bennet), who re-connects with the world after embarking on a grand adventure to return a rambunctious Yeti to his Himalayan home, all while staying one step ahead of the super-rich tycoon (Eddie Izzard) who wants to keep the furry creature \u2014 nicknamed Everest \u2014 locked away in his own private zoo.\n\nStory-wise, Abominable largely follows the boilerplate structure of most kiddie cartoons, with the characters racing from scene to scene with an occasional time-out for a tender moment or revealing confession. (No songs, though \u2014 Dreamworks likes to distinguish itself from Disney by not going the musical route.) But writer/director Jill Culton hits many of the expected beats with unexpected poignancy, thanks to her charming ensemble of actors; Bennet in particular does a fine job charting Yi\u2019s personal growth and emerges as a heroine that kids of all ages can relate to and root for. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Everest is an ideal animated animal companion, remaining silent, but speaking volumes with his physicality and facial expressions. Abominable isn\u2019t a new animated classic by any means, but it\u2019s ideal entertainment for a family afternoon at the movies. \u2014 E.A.\n\nAbominable opens in theaters on Sept. 27; visit Fandango or Atom Tickets for showtime and ticket information.\n\nREAD IT: Jonathan Van Ness goes Over the Top in candid new memoir\n\nIn Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love, Queer Eye\u2019s bubbly, encouraging hair expert Jonathan Van Ness, often for the first time, delves into the not-so happy parts of his life, including being sexually abused at 4, struggling with addiction and living with HIV. Van Ness has explained that he debated whether to share those parts of his story, and credited the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of the LGBT community with having convinced him to do so. \u201cThese are all difficult subjects to talk about on a makeover show about hair and makeup,\u201d Van Ness told the New York Times. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean Queer Eye is less valid, but I want people to realize you\u2019re never too broken to be fixed.\u201d \u2014 Raechal Shewfelt\n\nOver the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love is available on Amazon.\n\nWATCH IT: Return to The Good Place for the last time\n\nFans of NBC\u2019s heavenly series about the afterlife aren\u2019t ready to say goodbye (neither is the cast for that matter), but Good Place creator Mike Schur is standing firmly by his decision to wrap things up after four brilliantly-plotted, and hilariously funny, seasons. The final batch of 14 episodes picks up in the immediate aftermath of the Season 3 finale, with Kristen Bell\u2019s Eleanor in control of the seemingly utopian neighborhood created by Ted Danson\u2019s evolved demon, Michael. It\u2019s the final time that Eleanor and her three pals \u2014 Chidi (William Jackson Harper), Tahani (Jameela Jamil) and Jason (Manny Jacinto) \u2014 will be able to prove they deserve admission to the real Good Place, and she\u2019s got to make her way towards that happy ending while also rebuilding her relationship with the memory-wiped Chidi. Based on how Schur has ended such shows as The Office and especially Parks & Recreation, you can expect a little heartbreak and a lot of humor on the way to a blissful final scene. \u2014 E.A.\n\nThe final season of The Good Place premieres Thursday, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m. on NBC.\n\nHEAR IT: David Hasselhoff\u2019s Open Your Eyes LP is an eclectic mix of tunes and talent\n\nSorry, Norm McDonald, but it\u2019s not just Germans who love David Hasselhoff! In what might be the Hoff\u2019s most unexpected (and coolest) career reinvention yet, he teams with luminaries like Todd Rundgren, James Williamson of the Stooges, Elliot Easton of the Cars, Charlie Daniels, Ministry and A Flock of Seagulls for a collection of alt-rock covers by artists like Echo & the Bunnymen, David Bowie and the Jesus & Mary Chain. The title track is even a little-heard \u201880s gem by Lords of the New Church. \u2014 L.P.\n\nDownload on iTunes; buy on CD/vinyl at Amazon.\n\nWATCH IT: This Is Us returns, so prepare for nothing less than an emotional rollercoaster\n\n\u201cIf you think you know what's coming next, you don't know us,\" as NBC teases in the Season 4 trailer (watch above) for This Is Us. If you're a fan of the hit drama, then you'll know that you can never truly prepare for what's to come, but here's what we do know: We\u2019re going to meet some new faces, including Jennifer Morrison, Omar Epps and director M. Night Shyamalan, to name a few. The premiere episode titled \"Strangers\" will see a young Jack Pearson meet Rebecca's parents. As for what's in store the rest of the season \u2014 What happens to Beth and Randall? And Kevin and Zoe? And is Kate alive in the future or what!? \u2014 we'll just have to wait and see. For now, just enjoy and let the tears flow. \u2014 Jen Kucsak\n\nThis Is Us returns Tuesday, Sept. 24 at 9 p.m. on NBC and Hulu + Live TV.\n\nHEAR IT: Boyz N the Hood soundtrack gets first vinyl reissue since '91\n\nBoyz N the Hood soundtrack album cover. More\n\nThe entertainment world lost one of its most beloved visionaries when John Singleton passed away earlier this year at the age of 51. Singleton not only directed Boyz N the Hood but was the executive producer on the memorable soundtrack for his breakout film. So its reissue on vinyl this week \u2014 its first re-up since 1991 \u2014 is in itself a tribute to Singleton's legacy. The collection features an admirably eclectic mix of vintage West Coast gangsta rap (Ice Cube's \"How to Survive in South Central,\" Compton Most Wanted's \"Growin' Up in the Hood\"), New Jack swing (Tevin Campbell and Chubb Rock's \"Just Ask Me To,\" Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!'s \"Me and You\"), smooth-out soul (Quincy Jones's \"Setembro\") and heavy jazz-fusion (Stanley Clarke's \"Black on Black Crime\"). The soundtrack is available on double vinyl in two different color options: black and translucent blue.\n\nBuy Boyz N the Hood soundtrack on vinyl on Amazon.\n\nWATCH IT: Can you guess the celebrities on the new season of The Masked Singer?\n\nAmerica\u2019s most bonkers new guessing game is back, with more elaborate costumes, tighter \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d security, and \u2014 because Fox executives now realize that most of the TV-viewing public has access to Google and Wikipedia \u2014 much tougher, vaguer clues. As host Nick Cannon declares on the season premiere, \u201cTime to get weird!\u201d \u2014 L.P.\n\nSeason 2 of The Masked Singer premieres Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 8 p.m. on Fox and Hulu + Live TV.\n\nWATCH IT: Time for another round of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nIt\u2019s bonkers to think that the demented, hilarious story of the gang at Paddy\u2019s Pub is entering its 14th season. Its kid could be in high school! And, after this season, the series will be tied with The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet for the most seasons of a live-action sitcom. Look for new episodes of the irreverent show that never seems to take itself too seriously to tackle global warming and whether Dee should be allowed to cut her own hair, among other crucial subjects. \u2014 R.S.\n\nIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia returns Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 10 p.m. on FXX.\n\nHEAR IT: Adam Lambert drops Velvet: Side A album, the part one of his two-part project\n\nThe Queen frontman takes a break from his day job to release his first extended collection of solo material since 2015\u2019s The Original High. The swaggering collection of disco bangers recalls Bryan Ferry, George Michael, Scissor Sisters and his American Idol glam-rock roots. Side B will follow next year. \u2014 L.P.\n\nDownload on iTunes; buy on CD/vinyl at Amazon.\n\nWATCH IT: The Voice returns for Season 17 minus coach Adam Levine\n\nThe Voice is back... but for the first time in all 17 seasons, Adam Levine is not. After exiting the show abruptly (and seemingly acrimoniously) this past May, the Maroon 5 star has surrendered his red chair to his former bromance partner Blake Shelton\u2019s showmance girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. However, last season\u2019s coaches, John Legend and Kelly Clarkson, are returning, so the show will still presumably have that old button-pushing magic. \u2014 L.P.\n\nThe Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on NBC and Hulu + Live TV.\n\nWATCH IT: Musical fairy tale Yesterday from danny Boyle hits all home entertainment formats\n\nWe've been excited about Yesterday since way back when it was called the Untitled Danny Boyle Musical. You knew the Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire director was cooking up something special, and that was confirmed once we finally got a hold of its supremely clever plot: A young man (Himesh Patel) suffers a head injury and wakes up in a world where The Beatles never existed, free to claim their songs as his own and become a global sensation. The film, which proved a nice hit for Universal this summer, is a genuine crowdpleaser, full of sweetness and laughs and great music (obviously), even if it doesn't always quite know what to do with its high-concept premise. But it's perfect for a Friday night movie at home.\n\nBuy Yesterday on Blu-ray, DVD or digital on Amazon.\n\nWATCH IT: Transparent goes out singing with Musicale Finale\n\nIn lieu of a final season, Jill Soloway ends Amazon\u2019s groundbreaking series with a feature-length musical starring the entire cast\u2026 except Jeffrey Tambor, who was fired from the Emmy-winning show last year following harassment accusations. In the aftermath of Maura\u2019s death, the rest of the Pfeffermans \u2014 including Judith Light, Amy Landecker and Jay Duplass \u2014 turn their feelings into original songs, written by Faith Soloway. \u2014 E.A.\n\nTransparent Finale Musicale airs Friday, Sept. 27 on Amazon Prime.\n\nBUY IT: Feel the Force of Hasbro\u2019s Hyperreal 8-inch Darth Vader\n\nHasbro\u2019s popular Black Series line of Star Wars action figures blasts off into hyperspace with the new \u201cHyperreal\u201d collection. And what better character to lead the charge than a certain heavy-breathing Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord? The toy giant\u2019s new 8-inch Darth Vader will highlight what\u2019s unique about the \u201cHyperreal\u201d line, including ultra-poseable articulation, movie-accurate costumes and multiple accessories, including seven different hand variations and his signature red lightsaber. No question about it: This is the Darth Vader figure you\u2019re looking for. \u2014 E.A.\n\nPre-order Hasbro\u2019s Star Wars: The Black Series Hyperreal 8-inch Darth Vader on Amazon, Entertainment Earth and Gamestop.\n\nHEAR IT: The Roots's Things Fall Apart gets new vinyl release with added remixes\n\nThe Roots announce Things Fall Apart 20th anniversary reissue. More\n\nIt's hard to believe it's been 20 years since the release of Things Fall Apart from The Roots, often considered among the descendants of the Native Tongues sector of Golden Age Hip-Hop despite the fact that their first release (Organix) came way back in 1993 and Things was actually their fourth album. It remains one of the best and dynamic releases \u2014 and it's also their most successful, hitting gold status on the strength of burners like the Grammy-winning love ballad \"You Got Me\" (featuring Erykah Badu and Eve) and \"The Next Movement.\" So it's no wonder the album is getting a fresh reissue on wax this week. Better yet, it features hordes of remixes, including drum-and-bass and Latin-style versions of \"You Got Me.\" In regards to the latter, you know a remix is golden when it strips out Miss Badu and somehow doesn't miss her.\n\nBuy Things Fall Apart on vinyl on Amazon.\n\nHEAR IT: Sophia Bush's Work in Progress podcast is an inspiration\n\nFans of the incomparable Terry Gross and her NPR podcast Fresh Air will appreciate the actress and advocate\u2019s latest project, in which she interviews people who inspire her about what they\u2019ve done and how they\u2019ve done it. She\u2019s also not afraid to fangirl out, either, as she does in the first episode, which features feminist icon Gloria Steinem. \u2014 R.S.\n\nWork in Progress with Sophia Bush is available from Apple Podcasts.\n\nHEAR IT: Duo Tegan and Sara launch their debut memoir High School and ninth studio album Hey, I'm Just Like You\n\nThe alt-pop twin sisters reinterpret two recently unearthed cassette tapes of their first songs \u2014 written when they teenagers \u2014 for their ninth studio album. The record coincides with the release of their memoir, High School, also out this week. \u2014 L.P.\n\nDownload on iTunes; buy on CD/vinyl at Amazon.\n\nREAD IT: Barbie Forever recounts more than a toy story\n\nRobin Gerber, who\u2019s previously written books on no less than Eleanor Roosevelt and former Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, looks at the life of another powerful female, through vintage ads (many, if not all, of which are sure to be laughable today) and photos, new interviews and a timeline of Barbie history. Fun fact: The iconic doll, who\u2019s evolved into quite the career woman since her 1959 debut, has now worked in more than 200 professions. \u2014 R.S.\n\nBarbie Forever: Her Inspiration, History, and Legacy is available on Amazon.\n\nHEAR IT: Kristin Chenoweth pays homage to her favorite female singers in For the Girls\n\nThe consummate entertainer covers the songs of Patsy Cline, Carole King, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand and others, and duets with fellow divas like Ariana Grande, Dolly Parton, Jennifer Hudson and Reba McEntire, for this girl-powered collection. \u2014 L.P.\n\nDownload on iTunes; buy on CD at Amazon.\n\nYahoo Entertainment may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.", "description": "The It List is Yahoo\u2019s weekly look at the best in pop culture, including movies, music, TV, streaming, games, books, podcasts and more.
