The service will be initially available to Android users who already have Binance accounts registered for at least 30 days, with support for iOS to follow.\n\nBinance\u2019s active product range expansion\n\nOn Oct. 7, the exchange also announced the launch of the eighth phase of its lending product. Subscribers will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. The subscription period begins on Oct. 10 and ends on Nov. 10, while interest will be paid immediately after the term matures.\n\nBinance\u2019s new market maker program launched in late September, targeting users whose monthly trading volumes exceed 1,000 BTC \u2014 or can reach such volumes \u2014 and who also have quality market-making strategies.\n\nThat same month, the exchange rolled out a dedicated staking platform, enabling users to deposit their token holdings and earn staking rewards, but without having to set up their own nodes to fulfill minimum staking amounts and/or time lengths.", "description": "Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has begun accepting fiat currencies through online payment service Alipay and mobile messaging and payment app WeChat", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZTk3YWM5MzFmOTc0YWMwYmU1NjIxZDYwNzAzZmY3MWYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
