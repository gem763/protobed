(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A whistle blew, an impeachment inquiry swung into motion and the president at the center of it all rose defiantly to his own defense, not always in command of the facts.\n\nA CIA officer, in a complaint filed under federal whistleblower protections that preserve anonymity, alleged President Donald Trump abused his office in pressing for a Ukrainian investigation of a Democratic rival, Joe Biden. That revelation persuaded Democrats to move ahead with an inquiry that could produce articles of impeachment. Trump has reacted with anger, with weekend tweets that made the groundless accusation that Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman taking the lead in the impeachment review , criticized him \"illegally.\"\n\nA look at Trump's recent words on impeachment, Ukraine and other subjects:\n\nUKRAINE\n\nTRUMP: \"Liddle' Adam Schiff ... fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up & twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong. He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people, defaming & libeling me.\" \u2014 tweets Saturday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He is exaggerating Schiff's exaggerations. The California Democrat, in what he said was a parody during a committee hearing, mocked and overstated the president's pleas in his July 25 call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as Trump does with his critics routinely. Schiff's remarks are not illegal nor would it be defamatory or libelous, because lawmakers are shielded from liability for comments made in the course of Congress under the \"speech or debate\" clause in the Constitution, which seeks to foster political debate.\n\nDuring Thursday's House intelligence committee hearing, Schiff made clear he was providing an account that was in \"essence\" what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy when \"shorn of its rambling character.\"\n\nNo exact transcript of Trump's comments with Ukraine's president actually exists, just a rough transcript released by the White House.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, describing the July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart: \"Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call.\"\u2014 tweet Thursday.\n\nTRUMP: \"My call was perfect.\" \u2014 remarks to reporters Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: It's a big stretch for Trump to say he placed no pressure on Zelenskiy in that phone call \u2014 a conversation marked by Trump's blunt remark: \"I would like for you to do us a favor,\" according to a White House account of the call.\n\nTrump repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy to help investigate Biden and son Hunter, as well as to look into a cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and concluded it was carried out by Russia.\n\nThe call followed a monthslong campaign by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, conducted on Trump's behalf to get Ukrainians to scrutinize Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine when Joe Biden was vice president. It also followed Trump's abrupt suspension of military aid for Ukraine that Congress had approved. The aid was recently released.\n\nWhen Zelenskiy thanked Trump for past U.S. aid and suggested his country might need more, Trump switched the topic to the investigation he wanted Ukraine to do. He asked Zelenskiy to work with Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani on the matter.\n\nAs for the call being \"perfect,\" it was actually worrisome enough so that White House attorneys moved a rough transcript of it to a highly secure system where fewer officials would have access to it than is normally the case for conversations between Trump and world leaders.\n\nThe call and the broader effort to win a foreign government's help on a matter that could benefit Trump's reelection are what sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, denouncing information from the whistleblower: \"All second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate.\" \u2014 tweet Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The whistleblower's accusations have not been shown to be incorrect. Several key details have actually been corroborated. For example, the White House account of the July 25 phone call showed that the whistleblower had accurately summarized the conversation, as relayed by unidentified U.S. officials, in the complaint sent to the acting director of national intelligence.", "description": "A whistle blew, an impeachment inquiry swung into motion and the president at the center of it all rose defiantly to his own defense, not always in command of the facts.
