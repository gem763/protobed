In his latest tweet, Donald Trump sympathized with Tulsi Gabbard and Jill Stein, whom Hillary Clinton called Kremlin assets and tools.\n\nIn case anyone forgot, the White House is Kremlin-controlled territory right now, and the US leader was just one tiny step away from openly admitting it by showing compassion for collateral victims of the Russiagate craze \u2013 the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein, and the Hawaiian congresswoman and 2020 Democratic hopeful, Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nSo now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard \u201ca Russian favorite,\u201d and Jill Stein \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d As you may have heard, I was called a big Russia lover also (actually, I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary\u2019s gone Crazy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nFailed 2016 presidential contender, Hillary Clinton, who is still blaming anyone but herself for the fiasco, suggested last week that \u201cthe Russians\u201d were \u201cgrooming\u201d Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate next year to split the Democratic vote. Stein is \u201ctotally\u201d a Russian asset as well, she claimed.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption': Tulsi Gabbard DRAGS Hillary Clinton after 'Russian asset' claim\n\nIn response, Gabbard scorched Clinton with a devastating put-down, calling her \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThis resonated among her fans, who were impressed by the comeback, and the #IamTulsi hashtag went viral on Twitter on Saturday \u2013 but that must be work of Russian bots. What else could it be, if not an elaborate Kremlin plot, when even the puppet-in-charge has (almost) blown his cover and intervened to deflect heat from another couple of Russian assets?\n\nAlso on rt.com You didn\u2019t really think all Russian assets & Kremlin puppets in the US have already been exposed, did you?\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
