There\u2019s no tweet, no Instagram post, nothing. No explanation, he just rolled out of bed and decided to make a shirt with Justin\u2019s photo on it. Cool, cool, yep, got it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t some recent thing either, the photo on his shirt is from way back in July when Justin innocently donned a Jonas Brothers shirt while minding his own business.\n\nAccording to Teen Vogue, Justin wore the nostalgic Jonas Brothers shirt to a spa-date with Hailey back on July 27th. The shirt also featured his iconic Drew House logo, but hasn\u2019t ever been released under his label.\n\nAre we getting a Jonas Brothers x Bieber collaboration? Music or fashion, I don\u2019t care. Just give the people what they want.\n\nBut regardless, 30-year-old Joe has officially declared war on Biebs and began what can only be described as shirtception 2.0.\n\nYour move, Justin.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
