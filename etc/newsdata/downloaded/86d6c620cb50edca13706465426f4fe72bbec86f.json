She doesn't identify that way anymore and has faced accusations from Republicans that she once did so to advance her academic career.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is facing scrutiny over another potential inconsistency found in the stories she tells about how she rose in prominence from a consumer advocate to progressive standard bearer and presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Peter Doocy", "Peter Doocy Is Currently A Washington D.C.-Based Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc .", "He Joined The Network In As A General Assignment Reporter Based In The New York Bureau."], "top_image": "https://secure.media.foxnews.com/BrightCove/990505083001/990505083001/2019/10/08/990505083001_6093168524001_6093166800001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
