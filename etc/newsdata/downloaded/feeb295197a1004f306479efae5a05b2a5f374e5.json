Ankara launched its incursion against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a week ago, days after the Republican announced he was withdrawing American troops from the area. The SDF had been US allies in the fight against Isis.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan\u2018s government regards the YPG, which makes up a large portion of the SDF, as an extension of the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party \u2013 a banned separatist group based in Turkey and Iraq.\n\nAddressing reporters in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday, Mr Trump touted the agreement his administration had reached with Mr Erdogan, for a 120-hour pause allowing Kurds to retreat from where they had been living, as an \u201cincredible outcome\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of the United States, I want to thank Turkey, I want to thank all of the people that have gotten together and made this happen. This is an incredible outcome.\n\n\u201cSo you have a 22-mile strip, that for many, many years, Turkey, in all fairness, they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem with it, they had terrorists, they had a lot of people in their that they couldn\u2019t have. They\u2019ve suffered a lot of loss of lives also, and they had to have it cleaned out. But once you start that it gets to be to a point where a tremendous amount of bad things can happen.\n\n\u201cSo, a process started and we started to negotiate, and I think that obviously the sanctions and tariffs were going to be very biting, I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to do it, we\u2019ll be taking them off very quickly, as soon as this is finalised.\n\n\u201cBut this is an incredible outcome, this outcome is something they\u2019ve been trying to get for 10 years, everybody, and they couldn\u2019t get it, other administrations, and they never would\u2019ve been able to get it unless you went somewhat unconventional. I guess I\u2019m an unconventional person. I took a lot of heat from a lot of people, even some of the people in my own party, but they were there, in the end, they were there.\n\n\u201cSo we have a five-day ceasefire. During that five days the Kurds and other people, they\u2019re going to be taken great care of, they\u2019re going to be moving around, moving out of a safe zone, which is something that Turkey has always wanted. The Isis, they call them Daesh, but we call them Isis, the Isis fighters that we have captured, they\u2019ll be under very, very strict control of various different groups, but we will be watching, we will be in charge.\u201d\n\nMr Trump\u2019s opponents seized on his use of language, after politicians of all stripes had condemned his initial decision to withdraw troops.\n\nTim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, said in a statement on his website: \u201c[Mr Trump\u2019s] explanation that \u2018They had to have it cleaned out\u2019 is chilling. I\u2019ll have numerous questions for the administration about how they will protect against ethnic cleansing in the region.\u201d\n\nAnd Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the left-wing Democratic congresswoman with whom Mr Trump has carried on a bitter feud, tweeted: \u201cThe President of the United States is using the language of ethnic cleansing. If we allow him to continue, who would he use it on next?\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks came just hours before he held a rally in Dallas where he described Turkey\u2019s invasion as like \u201ctwo kids in a lot\u201d. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight,\u201d he told supporters.\n\nAnd despite the ceasefire, fighting continued in a key northeast Syrian border town on Friday. Shelling and gunfire could be heard around Ras al-Ayn as smoke rose from points near the border with Turkey and the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nRead more\n\nHow Turkey may have committed a war crime against a protest convoy", "description": "Donald Trump has been accused of employing \u201cthe language of ethnic cleansing\u201d over remarks he made about Turkey\u2018s invasion of northern Syria.Democrats described as \u201cchilling\u201d the way Mr Trump set out his backing of Ankara\u2019s violent creation of a \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria, which was triggered by the president", "authors": ["Jon Sharman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uKoJqq1gkHi6uiX.wK5mgw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/831954b1a2b823257e46929ea27cd696", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
