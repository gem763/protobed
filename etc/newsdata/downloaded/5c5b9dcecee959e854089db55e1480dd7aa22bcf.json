Eyes that were gazing dreamily over the rolling English countryside are now focused on the scrap between the mount of popular jockey Frankie Dettori and Japanese outsider Deirdre.\n\nThe red, white and blue silks seem to merge in a flash of color and as they duel to the line. The gentle hubbub from the stands builds into a roar. British cut-glass accents switch to guttural urgings. Panama hats and ladies' bonnets nod like wild flowers in the wind as they exhort their favorite for one last push.\n\nStride by stride, the charging Deirdre -- ridden by jockey Oisin Murphy -- hunts down Dettori's front-running Mehdaayih. She surges up the inside nearest the rail, and when the white flash on her nose draws alongside she accelerates again. To groans from the Dettori faithful, she scores a famous victory for Japan to land the \u00a3600,000 ($728,000) Nassau Stakes, first staged in 1840.\n\nBack in the stands, Ladies' Day is in full swing at a sun-kissed Qatar Goodwood Festival, more commonly known as \"Glorious Goodwood,\" the traditional finale to Britain's social season.\n\nOisin Murphy and Deirdre (left) overhaul Frankie Dettori on Mehdaayih at Goodwood.\n\n'Glorious'\n\nThe \"glorious\" moniker was added by the Victorian press, but as well as being handy alliteration it perfectly encapsulates the feeling as your eyes look out across the hilltop racecourse and take in the lush landscape of woods, fields and folds of the Sussex Downs in the far south of England. Glorious, indeed.\n\nJUST WATCHED Royal Ascot's glamour and appeal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Royal Ascot's glamour and appeal 01:35\n\n\"The whole vista up here on top of the Downs with the backdrop of the rolling English countryside is spectacular and the light is fabulous,\" says Racing Post photographer Edward Whitaker\n\n\"It's the prettiest track in England,\" adds David Parkinson, a member of the Royal Ascot Racing club syndicate.\n\n\"I love this place, it's beautiful. Royal Ascot is the pinnacle of horse racing, but Goodwood is a very close second.\"\n\nRacegoers relax at Glorious Goodwood.\n\n'Garden party'\n\nRacing began at Goodwood in 1802, instigated by the third Duke of Richmond, whose ancestor the first Duke -- an illegitimate son of King Charles II -- bought the estate in 1697. The meeting grew thanks to a combination of its setting, society scene, and proximity to London. King Edward VII was a regular visitor from the 1860s and dubbed it \"a garden party with racing tacked on.\"\n\nStill on a high after a truly remarkable five days...only 358 days until we can do it all again!

In the latter half of the 19th century, huge amounts of people went to Scotland to enjoy the sport, while some headed south to Cowes for the sailing regatta.\n\n\"Does the season still exist? I think it does to a certain extent although it's not so exclusive anymore.\"\n\nPhotos: 10 of the most picturesque racecourses Meydan Racecourse, Dubai \u2013 Boasting the world's first five-star trackside hotel, restaurants and a museum, Dubai's Meydan Racecourse is a first-class racing destination.

There is still hierarchy, in terms of price and privileges, but the word bandied about by most is \"relaxed.\"\n\nOn this sweltering summer's day, a voice sounds over the upmarket Richmond Enclosure tannoy ahead of the first race: \"Gentlemen, you may remove your jackets.\"\n\nPhotos: Longines Prix de Diane Photos: Longines Prix de Diane Chantilly racecourse to the north of Paris is the home of French racing and hosts some of Europe's most prestigious events.

Goodwood is all about relaxed elegance,\" adds Whitaker. \"It's much more relaxed than Royal Ascot. It's all about linen suits for the men and ladies in floaty floral dresses.\"\n\nDisappointment from Dettori fans and excited shrieks from Deirdre backers bubble around the grandstands, but soon the genteel air settles and conversations resume.\n\n\"Goodwood has a lovely, friendly feel and brings people together,\" said Nicky Reed, whose family are long-time members.\n\n\"There's something for everyone -- you can be as posh as you like.

It employs a staff of about 700 and had an annual turnover of nearly \u00a3100 million ($121 million) in 2017, according to a report filed at Companies House.\n\n\"The challenge is always to create a sustainable business that feels relevant in the modern world but is also authentic to the place,\" said the Duke in an interview with the London Evening Standard.\n\nJockeys leave the weighing room at Goodwood.\n\n'Sense of welcome'\n\nBehind the grandstands, looking south towards the cathedral city of Chichester and the silvery fingers of Chichester Harbour heading out towards the English Channel, the Duke is on hand in the winner's enclosure to present the prizes.\n\nIn light linen suit and brown-rimmed glasses, the former advertising executive marshals the women who competed in the Magnolia Cup, a charity race for amateur riders won by 18-year-old Muslim Khadijah Mellah.\n\nThis is what it means to Japan. \ud83d\udc4f\n\n\n\nDeirdre's biggest supporters lift her over the line in the Nassau Stakes. #\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30c9\u30e9 #JRA #\u7af6\u99ac pic.twitter.com/yseSRwgpQD \u2014 World Horse Racing (@WHR) August 4, 2019\n\nThe media buzz has barely died down by the time Murphy steers Deirdre into the winner's circle. Every vantage point in the surrounding open and glass-fronted bars and restaurants is taken up. Murphy is forgiven for defeating Dettori, and racegoers cheer for Japan's first top-flight success in Britain for 19 years. Judging by later videos posted on social media, the team responsible for Deirdre are ecstatic.\n\n\"Goodwood is an amazing place. I've never seen such a beautiful racecourse, and it's completely different to the tracks in Japan,\" said Seiko Hashida Yoshimura, the racing manager for Deirdre's owner Toji Morita and daughter of trainer Mitsuru Hashida.\n\nMehdaayih's philosophical trainer John Gosden adds: \"It's good for the game.\"\n\nLater, free strawberries and cream are handed out and judging by the queues its a welcome treat. As racing draws to a close, the party has already started on the Earl's Lawn, with an ever-growing throng dancing to DJ beats in the afternoon sun. For others, thoughts turn to dinner back in London or elsewhere.\n\nSome racegoers retire to country pubs in the picturesque villages of Singleton, Charlton or East Dean down in the valley behind the course. In lengthening shadows, a cricket match on a leafy oval in Singleton adds to the quintessential English scene.\n\n\"Glorious Goodwood\" is over for another day, but the memories will linger, according to Peill.\n\n\"There is that sense of welcoming people in to enjoy the beauty and the sport so it's not just exclusive to friends and family of the Dukes of Richmond. It's open to everyone,\" he adds.\n\n\"People build up happy memories and it becomes part of their own story, their own family history.\"", "description": "The lush green landscape blurs into the background.
