(AP) \u2014 For over a decade, things had been quiet in Atlantic City, the seaside gambling resort known as much for its colorful political corruption as for its slot machines and salt water taffy.\n\nBut that came to an end earlier this month when Mayor Frank Gilliam Jr. pleaded guilty to wire fraud, admitting in a federal courtroom that he had stolen $87,000 from a youth basketball club he founded and spent much of the money on himself.\n\nHe became the fifth Atlantic City mayor to be busted on corruption charges since the 1970s. The city\u2019s history of graft and dirty-dealings at City Hall is so rich that HBO based the award-winning TV series \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d on it, focusing on turn-of-the-century politicians and crooks.\n\nTuesday evening, Atlantic City will get its next mayor, and it\u2019s expected to be a councilman who lost to Gilliam in a bitterly fought primary two years ago.\n\nCouncil President Marty Small took over as acting mayor when Gilliam resigned on Oct. 3 and is expected to be chosen by the City Council to serve as mayor for just over a year. In the November 2020 general election, a candidate will be elected to serve the remaining final year of Gilliam\u2019s term.\n\nOn Tuesday, the council will choose among three nominees put forth by the city\u2019s Democratic party: Small, Pamela Thomas-Fields and Gwendolyn Callaway Lewis. Both women have said they support Small\u2019s bid, and a majority of the nine-member council has said it will vote to install Small as mayor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled and honored that the Democratic committee nominated me,\u201d Small told The Associated Press. \u201cIt shows they have confidence in me. I\u2019m going to do the best job I can do if I\u2019m selected by the council. I asked all of them for their support, and I hope I receive that support.\u201d\n\nThe next mayor faces an array of tough problems, including a state takeover of most important functions of government. New Jersey, under former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and a Democrat-controlled Legislature that concluded the city either could not or would not make the painful choices necessary to get its fiscal house in order.\n\nMeanwhile, a group led by a former state senator and the head of Atlantic City\u2019s main casino workers union is conducting a petition drive to change the way Atlantic City governs itself.\n\nAtlantic City Residents for Good Government\u2019s wants to force a referendum on downsizing the council and eliminating a directly elected mayor. Instead, the council would hire a city manager. That effort is already meeting resistance from some elected officials and residents long wary of outside control of the city and the millions in taxes it generates.\n\nThe tax burden on property owners has drastically increased in recent years, discouraging home ownership and investment in the city.\n\nAnd the casino industry, the city\u2019s main employer, is dealing with the effects of last year\u2019s expansion that added two more gambling halls to the seven that were already in existence, resulting in lower profits for the industry as a whole.\n\n___\n\nFollow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\n\nAtlantic City\u2019s City Council is expected to name Council President Marty Small as mayor at a special meeting.\n\nSmall has been serving as acting mayor since former Mayor Frank Gilliam Jr. resigned earlier this month.\n\nGilliam pleaded guilty in federal court to stealing $87,000 from a youth basketball club he had founded.\n\nIf Small is selected Tuesday night by the council, he would serve as mayor until the November 2020 general election.\n\nTwo other nominees for the position have already said they back Small for the job.\n\nGilliam became the fifth Atlantic City Mayor to leave office following corruption charges since the 1970s.", "description": "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.
