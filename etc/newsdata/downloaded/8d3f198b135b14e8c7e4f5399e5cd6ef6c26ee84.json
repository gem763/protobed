You go girl.\"\n\n\"Deffo on about Ms Vardy xxx,\" another posted.\n\nA third joked: \"Is that really you tho.. or has your account been hacked too? #convenient.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIt all kicked off when Coleen publicly accused someone using Rebekah's account of taking posts from her private Instagram and selling them to the press.\n\nShe said she'd had suspicions that it was her and so blocked everyone from viewing the posts except Rebekah's account to see if the posts leaked - and they did.\n\nRebekah denied selling stories, claiming that her Instagram account had been hacked.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nDanielle waded into the row when she said she believed Rebekah was behind the leaks because she'd had \"run-ins\" with her.\n\nShe said on This Morning: \"It's definitely come out of Becky's account. I think she did it. Sadly I really do. It's a shame as she probably didn't think she was going to get caught out.\"\n\nRebekah was furious, branding her a liar and saying she had begged her to find her a husband like Jamie Vardy.", "description": "Danielle is milking the drama for all it's worth as she spoke about 'negative people' in a selfie caption last night", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Instagram", "Lia Toby Wenn.Com", "Pa", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558273.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Danielle-Lloyd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
