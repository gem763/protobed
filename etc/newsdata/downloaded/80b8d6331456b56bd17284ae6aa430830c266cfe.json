Through The Hague Forum and by reinforcing regulatory cooperation, we aim to ensure that these safeguards and measures apply to all consumers and public authorities living and operating in the EEA.\"", "description": "Microsoft promises EU customers new revisions to the terms of its cloud contracts.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/2757c8c4-3d2e-45b1-95ae-8ad35e573a77/thumbnail/770x578/1cda9d85b4c3dda41c09aeb8d5fd8f0c/confusionistock-600418774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
