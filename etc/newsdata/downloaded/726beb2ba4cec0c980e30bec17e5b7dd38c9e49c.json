Leonov had health issues for several years, according to Russia media.\n\nShowing just how much of a space pioneer Leonov was, Nasa interrupted its live televised coverage of a spacewalk by two Americans outside the International Space Station to report Leonov\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cA tribute to Leonov as today is a spacewalk,\u201d Mission Control in Houston said.\n\nNasa astronauts to carry out first all-female spacewalk Read more\n\nLeonov was an icon both in his country as well as in the US, so much so that the late science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke named a Soviet spaceship after him in his 2010 sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin,sent his condolences to Leonov\u2019s family, calling him a \u201ctrue pioneer, a strong and heroic person\u201d.\n\nLeonov staked his place in space history on 18 March 1965, when he exited his Voskhod 2 space capsule secured by a tether.\n\n\u201cI stepped into that void and I didn\u2019t fall in,\u201d the cosmonaut recalled years later. \u201cI was mesmerised by the stars. They were everywhere \u2013 up above, down below, to the left, to the right. I can still hear my breath and my heartbeat in that silence.\u201d\n\nSpacewalking always carries a high risk but Leonov\u2019s pioneering venture was particularly nerve-racking, according to details of the exploit which only became public decades later.\n\nHis spacesuit had inflated so much in the vacuum of space that he could not get back into the spacecraft. He had to open a valve to vent oxygen from his suit to be able to fit through the hatch.\n\nLeonov\u2019s 12-minute spacewalk preceded the first US spacewalk, by Ed White, by less than three months.", "description": "The Soviet cosmonaut almost didn\u2019t make it back into his capsule in 1965 when his suit inflated in the vacuum of space", "authors": ["Associated Press In Moscow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/180ed5c6b7796a4ef0c9702478be3c9029453c12/0_12_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=257fb631b0dc93e253c9ee81a66ce3f2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
