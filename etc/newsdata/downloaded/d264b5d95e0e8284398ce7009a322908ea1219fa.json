Possible cases have been identified across 33 states and one US territory.\n\nMichigan becomes first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes Read more\n\nSymptoms of the illness include vomiting, nausea, shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. All confirmed cases appear to have a kind of non-infectious pneumonia, called lipoid pneumonia, developed when oil is inhaled.\n\nIn all confirmed cases, patients vaped either nicotine or the marijuana constituent THC in the last 90 days. An estimated 9 million adults and 3.6 million US teenagers vape, including 20% of high school students.\n\n\u201cOne of the things found in common was all patients were using vaped substances in e-cigarettes,\u201d said Dr Daniel Fox of WakeMed Health and Hospitals in North Carolina, where several cases were identified. \u201cThey all had abnormal chest x-rays and developed a need for a lot of oxygen.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A chest x-ray showings lung opacities, densities or whitish cloudlike areas which are typically seen with unusual pneumonias, fluid in lungs or lung inflammation.

So far, no single device, constituent or product has been common across all cases.\n\nThey also have not determined the best way to treat the condition. In nearly all cases, the patients were started on antibiotics and many later on steroids, but it is not clear whether these treatments helped patients improve.\n\nOfficials asked doctors to collect samples in cases where they suspect a patient could have the ailment. The samples are then sent to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe FDA is testing more than 120 samples for a \u201cbroad range of chemicals\u201d, including \u201cnicotine, THC, cannabinoids, cutting agent or diluents, additives, pesticides, opioids, poisons and toxins\u201d, said Mitch Zeller, director of the Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA.\n\n\u201cFDA is going to leave no stone unturned in following any potential leads,\u201d said Zeller.\n\nThe illnesses have all been reported this year, and the number has been growing quickly in the last month as more and more states have begun investigations. A week ago, US officials pegged the number at 215 possible cases in 25 states. The most recent death due to the illness was in Indiana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all wondering if this is new or just newly recognized,\u201d Dr Dana Meaney-Delman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters on Friday.\n\nAlso on Friday, the New England Journal of Medicine released a series of articles which give medical details about cases reported in Illinois, Wisconsin and Utah.\n\nAn article on 53 illnesses in Illinois and Wisconsin noted nearly one-fifth of cases were people who said they vaped nicotine alone, and nothing containing marijuana oils.\n\nFor that reason, doctors and health officials are continuing to suggest people stay away from all vaping products until the investigation establishes exactly what is at the root of the illnesses.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Officials are investigating more than 450 possible cases of a severe breathing illness among otherwise \u2018healthy young people\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd6a6690eb99b6c8deba58e5488e1276f191001/0_17_3404_2044/master/3404.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64850ba47afe3856051a868e45eb3334", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
