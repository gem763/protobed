(NASDAQ: ) is set to release third-quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Oct 22. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is a profit of $1.62 a share on revenues of $5.86 billion.\n\nPACCAR\u2019s shares have gained around 26% year to date compared with the 4% rise recorded by the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the factors that are likely to have played key roles in the company\u2019s quarterly performance.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nStellar economy and freight growth will likely have aided demand for PACCAR\u2019s Class 8 truck in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the company, global deliveries are expected to have improved 5-7%, year on year. The third-quarter gross margins for Truck, Parts and Other are expected to be in the 14.5-15% range compared with the year-ago quarter\u2019s 14.09%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR\u2019s third-quarter consolidated revenues is pegged at $5.85 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 7.98%.\n\nHigher build rates are anticipated to have boosted truck deliveries in North America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for truck deliveries in the United States and Canada is currently pegged at 33,703 units, indicating a rise of nearly 18.7% year over year.\n\nPer management, while production in Europe might have dropped 5-10% sequentially amid summer shutdown, truck deliveries will likely have improved year on year. Notably, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for truck deliveries in Europe is pegged at 14,917 units, which suggests 4.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Financial Services segment\u2019s third-quarter revenues is $349 million, which indicates a 2.6% improvement year over year.\n\nHowever, rising commodity prices amid tariff woes, along with material and labor costs due to supply constraints might have been one of the key issues affecting PACCAR\u2019s margin growth in the September-end quarter.\n\nWhile higher truck deliveries, especially in the United States and Canada, are likely to have buoyed the company\u2019s performance, rising costs may have limited its profits.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Says?\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PACCAR this season.
