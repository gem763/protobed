It was attributed simply to someone in Johnson\u2019s office.\n\nIt blamed the EU\u2019s refusal to move on the Irish border question, which has stalled talks for more than a year, on Parliament for passing a law that aims to stop Johnson taking the U.K. out of the bloc without a deal. As a result of that, the author claimed Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar had decided not to make concessions on the border.\n\nThe message suggested that the main way Johnson would try to avoid delaying Brexit would be to try to get an EU country to veto one. It said Britain would offer rewards to any country opposing an extension to negotiations. According to the Spectator, the U.K. would also threaten cooperation on areas including defense and security if it stays in the EU.\n\nJohnson Warned Against Big Tax Cuts as U.K. Faces No-Deal Shock\n\nNevertheless, the author seemed to accept that an extension was likely, and that Johnson would then fight an election, promising a no-deal Brexit immediately if he won.\n\nTalks about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, announced last week, are due to continue Tuesday in Brussels. The U.K. side has given more legal detail about how its plan would work, but EU leaders are still demanding that Britain drop its plan to introduce a customs border on the island of Ireland. There\u2019s an informal deadline for the talks of the end of this week. Johnson yesterday called counterparts in what Brexit minister James Duddridge told Parliament was an attempt to \u201cwhip up enthusiasm for the deal and avoid no-deal.\u201d\n\nRules and Questions\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson\u2019s government has delayed publishing its rules for when it would be able to intervene to help businesses after a disagreement over what those rules should be.\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the plans, speaking on condition of anonymity, changes to state aid rules were going to be published Tuesday. That has now been held back.\n\nThe precise nature of the disagreement isn\u2019t clear, but for months there has been an argument within government on the issue. The Treasury has argued that the European Union\u2019s rules should be copied into British law, to give businesses continuity, and to promote competition. EU rules aim to prevent governments from distorting markets by helping particular companies.\n\nOn the other side of the argument are ministers who want the government to be able to help businesses struggling in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. Without the constraints of the EU\u2019s rule, the government would be able to back national champions, potentially undercutting rival European firms.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson\u2019s government is preparing for Brexit talks to collapse, a move for which it will blame Ireland and European Union leaders, according to a text message from one of the prime minister\u2019s officials reported by the Spectator magazine.The message, which ran to nearly 800 words,", "authors": ["Robert Hutton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
