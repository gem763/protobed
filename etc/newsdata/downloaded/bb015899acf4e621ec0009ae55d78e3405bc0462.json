In case you\u2019re not familiar with this phenomenon, gangs of younger people (not all of whom are actually \u201cchildren\u201d by the way) show up at city intersections with traffic lights carrying buckets of presumably soapy water and squeegees. The deal is that if they run up to a stopped car that is trapped in traffic at the light and wash the windshield, they expect the driver to give them money.\n\nThe problems with this should be obvious and the city has made some efforts in the past to discourage this activity and find other things for the kids to do. But there are too many of them. Now the Baltimore PD is assigning more officers to clear them out and keep things under control, including the use of SWAT Team members if they are severely understaffed. This has some of the locals up in arms, assuming that heavily armed men in riot gear will be showing up to chase the little vandals away. (CBS Baltimore)\n\nBaltimore police are patrolling the intersections where \u201csqueegee kids\u201d normally conduct business. Each police district is responsible for manning the intersections in their districts that are regularly used to conduct business. If the district doesn\u2019t have enough staff to man the corners, then bike patrol, traffic enforcement officers or SWAT will assist. Late Friday, police called to inform WJZ that if SWAT officers are assigned to this detail, they would not be acting in a SWAT capacity.\n\nAs to the complaints being heard, I think the cops have made it pretty clear. SWAT Team members are only being used when the PD is stretched too thin and can\u2019t cover all of the corners. And when that happens, they are not showing up in riot gear with heavy weapons. They\u2019re wearing regular uniforms and just helping out the regular beat cops to cover all the action.\n\nBut maybe they should be a bit more heavily armed. As usual, the local news coverage doesn\u2019t cover this situation very well, describing what these \u201ckids\u201d are doing as \u201cconducting business.\u201d\n\nI wrote about this last winter and there\u2019s a reason the police are needed on these corners. First of all, these kids are not \u201cconducting business\u201d and this isn\u2019t a \u201cjob.\u201d There is no customer requesting these services, or if there is, it\u2019s rare in the extreme. They run up to the cars unbidden and just start slopping water on the windshield. And then most of them do not \u201cask\u201d for money. They demand it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t pony up, they frequently become abusive and threatening. Some of them have vandalized the cars of people who don\u2019t want to pay. People have been attacked, particularly if they get out of their vehicle when it\u2019s being damaged. One man named Jon Coles and his wife had their car vandalized and the couple was then attacked by multiple squeegee kids, causing injuries. No arrests were made.\n\nThis \u201cbusiness\u201d is not a social justice project to help underprivileged kids. It wasn\u2019t set up by any government agency. It\u2019s an extortion racket that they dreamed up themselves and it\u2019s been tolerated for too long. Don\u2019t assume that tourists will keep coming back to the area if this is what they encounter every time they drive through town.", "description": "Good luck with that", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BaltimorePolice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
