She's thriving in her own way, not everyone\u2019s idea of the dream lifestyle, but it\u2019s hers.'\n\nOn the premiere of New Lives in the Wild's tenth season, Ben travels to Sweden to meet with Annalisa (right), a single mother-of-own who left comfort behind for a life of busing, dumpster diving and hard work\n\nAnnalisa used to be a Grade A student in languages and literature, but the pressure proved too much when she started studying at university.\n\n'I felt this heavy stone of responsibilities on my shoulders,' she told Ben. 'Pressure all the time.'\n\nAnnalisa added that opening books made her feel sick, even though she scored the highest grades for three of the tests she took while at university.\n\n'I just couldn\u2019t breathe, so three months in, I thought \"maybe I should try to find a way to escape from here\",' she explained.\n\nAnnalisa lives with her son Nico (right) who is 22 months old. Ben is impressed by the fact the mother manages to work around the house while always keeping an eye on her son\n\nAnnalisa traveled to Spain, where she befriended a Polish homeless man who showed her how to survive on very little.\n\nAfter biking to Holland, she bought a van with her savings and drove to Sweden, where she settled down.\n\nDuring Ben's visit Annalisa showed Ben how she gets by for food by dumpster diving, saying that sometimes the food is out of date or spoiled.\n\n'Sometimes it's neither of them,' she explained. 'Sometimes it was a big package that had a lot of cartons, but then one breaks and all the others are sticky. They throw them, so [you get] that non-expired, non-broken beautiful stuff.'\n\n'That's what you're aiming for. Or vegetables that still look great.'\n\nBen holding on of Annalisa's roosters. The young woman explains she wants to be completely self-sufficient\n\nWhen Ben asked whether she's an opportunistic outsider, Annalisa replied: 'The closer I'm getting to my goal of being self-sufficient, the less I'm going there,' she explains.\n\nAnnalisa grows fruit and vegetables next to her cabin, including broccoli, zucchini, kale, and even watermelons.\n\n'There was a time where it was my only source of food,' she explained.\n\n'Now I feel it's such a pity to leave all this good food there to give money to a system that produces so much trash, when I can skip it and go to the trash,' she added.\n\n'When we decide to produce such big amounts of things to keep the prices low, we\u2019re gonna have so much waste, it\u2019s normal that it goes like this, it makes me angry.'\n\nAnnalisa used to be a brilliant literature student in Turin, but dropped out of university aged 19 to escape the pressure\n\nWhile Annalisa is satisfied with her way of life, there are challenges involved, such as baby-proofing the well where she gets water so that Nico can run safely near the house.\n\nWhen Ben voiced concerns, Annalisa replied: 'I think the safest is where there is less man-made things, but when you\u2019re out on the grass, what can happen?'\n\nNico cooks, uses knives and drills just like his mother, but Annalisa is always watching, which impressed Ben.\n\n'It is fascinating to watch Nico doing everything that his mom does, and I mean everything, knives, drills,' Ben said.\n\n'He's like a mini wild man and I think some people night be slightly horrified by that. But she's a very sensitive and sensible mum. She's always there, she's always watching, she's always thinking.'\n\nBen calls Annalisa an 'amazing woman' as he observes her fend for Nico and herself without a large support system\n\nAnnalisa's only regret is that she could have been a bit more sensitive towards her parents, who she left behind in Italy.\n\n'They are nice people but at that time, I didn\u2019t want to share so much of my life with them,' she recalled of her late teenage years.\n\nAnnalisa added that she appreciates the fact her parents tried to change the way they saw the world rather than try to make her behave differently.\n\n'It brought us closer,' she said.\n\nThey are still in her life now, and even gave her some money to help her settle in Sweden and provide a good life for her and Nico.\n\nAnnalisa makes money busking once a month, in order to gather the 300 euros (\u00a3258) she needs to survive\n\nAnnalisa has never had a job, apart from working in a supermarket aged 16, but insists she'd be miserable with a 9-5.\n\n'Going back is not an option,' she told Ben. 'It makes me miserable and I need to be thriving for Nico.'\n\n'I've learned to not worry about the future. People fear this for their whole life. They put themselves through slavery because they are so afraid that they\u2019re gonna end up on the street, and I did that and it was fine,' she says.\n\nWhile Annalisa goes busking, playing her ukulele on the streets of a nearby city, Ben reflects on his encounter with Annalisa.\n\nBen Fogle: New Lives in the Wild airs tonight on Channel 5 at 9pm.", "description": "Annalisa, 24, from Italy, features on tonight's New Lives In The Wild on Channel 5 where she introduces Ben Fogle to her off-grid lifestyle in the Swedish wilderness with her son Nico, 22 months.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20326500-0-image-a-16_1572355267090.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
