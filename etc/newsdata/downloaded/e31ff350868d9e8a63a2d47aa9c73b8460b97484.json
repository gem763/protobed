They harm animals because they may eat parts of them or become tangled or trapped in them. Sharp parts of them can tear and puncture an animal\u2019s throat or stomach causing internal bleeding. Animals can become entangled in fallen lantern frames and suffer from injury and stress struggling to get free, or starve to death. Marine life is endangered by lanterns falling into the sea. People releasing a sky lantern (Picture: Martin Dimitrov/Getty) They can also cause fires, and litter wherever they land as even so-called \u2018biodegradeable\u2019 bamboo lanterns take decades to degrade. Some countries have already banned them and there are calls for the UK to do the same. Landowners have called for a ban following cases of livestock injured or killed from eating lantern parts accidentally chopped into animal feed during harvest, or getting caught in wire frames that have landed in fields.\n\nThe RSPCA listed some of the other animals killed by sky lanterns:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA foal had to be put to sleep after his legs were so badly injured from bolting through a fence having been terrified by a lantern.\n\nHolly, a nine-month-old goat died after the frame of a lantern punctured her throat.\n\nA farmer in Chester told how a cow died when the wire from a sky lantern punctured her oesophagus after ingestion, saying \u2018in effect she spent a long, painful 48 hours suffocating on her own feed.\u2019", "description": "This is why you should think twice about letting off sky lanterns.
