Towards the tail-end of Ball\u2019s campaign that year, party photos of her in a racy Santa costume and her then-husband dressed as a reindeer with a dildo for a nose popped up on the internet.\n\nAccording to Limbaugh\u2019s recollection, however, these images were nude pictures of a teenaged Ball.\n\n\u201cRemember the name Krystal Ball with a K?\u201d Limbaugh told his audience. \u201cSome thought she was attractive. She was running for Congress, and she got elected, and some tweets came out.\u201d\n\n(Ball, again, did not win her election.)\n\n\u201cShe posed nude when she was 14 or 15,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe was outraged. \u2018How dare you!\u2019 I said, \u2018What do you expect to happen? You Put a picture of yourself nude on Facebook or MySpace or, you know, My Butt, whatever it is. Somebody\u2019s gonna find that stuff.\u2019\u201d\n\nLimbaugh concluded by saying he believes some of that is going on to \u201cblackmail\u201d members of Congress and \u201cRepublicans can do this too\u201d and may be doing it in \u201ccertain places.\u201d\n\nBall, a former MSNBC host, fired back during the broadcast of her morning Hill TV show Rising.\n\n\u201cSo, first of all, I did not pose nude when I was 14 or 15,\u201d the 37-year-old noted. \u201cFacebook and MySpace did not even exist when I was 14 or 15. I didn\u2019t tweet to anything related to that.\u201d\n\nShe explained that Limbaugh was likely referencing, in a \u201cvery bizarre way,\u201d the party photos that emerged during her congressional run, adding that since we are in the \u201cTrump age\u201d Limbaugh probably felt a need to make this far more \u201csalacious in order to titillate his audience.\u201d\n\nBall went on to say that she decided against just ignoring Limbaugh since he has an audience of millions, pointing out that she felt the need to \u201ccorrect the record\u201d because she has a platform to call him out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like he can just slime whoever he wants and get away with it with no accountability,\u201d she declared. \u201cBut if I did have some naked photos from when I was 14 or 15 or whenever, who frickin\u2019 cares?! It\u2019s not your job to be the moral police or to shame me or any other young woman who is out there who MAY have nude photos that come out!\u201d\n\nBall reiterated her message on Twitter after the Rising broadcast aired, but this time uncensored.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to think he could just slime anyone with impunity. Most importantly though, if I did \"pose nude\" at 14, so fucking what?\u201d Ball wrote. \u201cShould women be barred from public service because they have bodies and sexuality?\u201d\n\nInterestingly, when the Ball controversy first landed in October 2010, Limbaugh opined on it. And he knew at that time that they weren\u2019t nude images of a teenaged Ball.\n\n\u201cSo, anyway, she\u2019s 30 years old, and those pictures were four, five, six years ago?\u201d Limbaugh said on-air. \u201cI mean she\u2019s running as a Democrat. I don\u2019t understand the big deal anyway. I mean this stuff is r\u00e9sum\u00e9 enhancement for Democrats. I don\u2019t understand the controversy here at all.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like he can just slime whoever he wants and get away with it,\u201d she declared. \u201cBut if I did have some naked photos... who frickin\u2019 cares?!\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1303,w_2317,x_0,y_43/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568306149/GettyImages-824371822_jw3ifs"}
