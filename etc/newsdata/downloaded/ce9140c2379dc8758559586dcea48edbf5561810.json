Teenagers today find themselves, he said, with \u201cthree major crises all coming to a head at the Gen Z moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentials are more expensive than ever before, we pay 50 percent of our income to rent, no one has health insurance,\u201d said Mr. Citarella. \u201cPrevious generations have left Generation Z with the short end of the stick. You see this on both the left, right, up down and sideways.\u201d Mr. Citarella added: \u201cThe merch is proof of how much the sentiment resonates with people.\u201d\n\nRising inequality, unaffordable college tuition, political polarization exacerbated by the internet, and the climate crisis all fuel anti-boomer sentiment.\n\nAnd so Ms. Kasman and other teenagers selling merch say that monetizing the boomer backlash is their own little form of protest against a system they feel is rigged. \u201cThe reason we make the \u2018ok boomer\u2019 merch is because there\u2019s not a lot that I can personally do to reduce the price of college, for example, which was much cheaper for older generations who then made it more expensive,\u201d Ms. Kasman said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I can personally do to restore the environment, which was harmed due to corporate greed of older generations. There\u2019s not much I can personally do to undo political corruption, or fix Congress so it\u2019s not mostly old white men boomers who don\u2019t represent the majority of generations.\u201d\n\nMs. Kasman said she plans to use proceeds to pay for college. So do others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll definitely use the money for my student loans, paying my rent. Stuff that will help me survive,\u201d said Everett Solares, 19, who is selling a slew of rainbow \u201cok boomer\u201d products. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen any gay stuff for \u2018ok boomer,\u2019 so I just chose every product that I could find in case anyone wanted it,\u201d she said.\n\nGavin Deschutter, 17, reimagines famous logos for companies like FedEx, Budweiser, Google, and KFC with the catch phrase, and has been selling t shirts and phone cases emblazoned with the message. He hasn\u2019t made very much \u2014 \u201cI sold a hoodie yesterday for $36,\u201d he said \u2014 but his designs have been shared across meme pages on Instagram.", "description": "Now it\u2019s war: Gen Z has finally snapped over climate change and financial inequality.", "authors": ["Taylor Lorenz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/fashion/oakImage-1572300722721/oakImage-1572300722721-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
