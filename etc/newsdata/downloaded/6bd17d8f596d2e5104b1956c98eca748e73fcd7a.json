The interview team found her detailed allegations to be credible.'\n\nThe next day, 'Lauer admitted to engaging in sexual activity with the complainant.'\n\nThe memo goes on to state: 'The Company determined that his conduct violated Company policy and terminated Lauer\u2019s employment on November 28, effective immediately.'\n\nThere is no mention however of the fact that Nevils was intoxicated when Lauer allegedly assaulted her, and that she had said not to his demand for anal sex.\n\nNevils was also soon identified by colleagues due to the network revealing the incident happened in Sochi, which narrowed the pool of women.\n\nFarrow writes that Nevils did not wish to take a settlement, but soon realized it was her only option.\n\nThe network stretched out the negotiations and argued Nevils was upset over the recent death of her mother.\n\nNevuils eventually had to go on medical leave and was hospitalized for alcohol abuse.\n\nShe eventually got seven figures in exchange for her silence, along with the silence of her lawyer and others close to her.", "description": "Ronan Farrow writes in his new book Catch and Kill that Brooke Nevils 'attempted suicide', 'was hospitalized for post-traumatic stress disorder' and 'descended into heavy drinking", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19742444-0-image-a-3_1571146250630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
