I'll enjoy this one. You don't get too many shutouts.\"\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins and Connor McDavid were stopped in the shootout.\n\nThe overtime period was highlighted by tight goaltending.\n\nEdmonton goalie Mike Smith robbed Mark Scheifele in close and Hellebuyck followed that up by denying Connor McDavid on a breakaway.\n\n\"That's what 3-on-3 hockey does with the best players in the world out there,\" said Smith, who made 23 saves. \"It's exciting for you guys, not so much for the goalies.\"\n\nWinnipeg (5-5-0) was playing its fourth game of a five-game homestand.\n\n\"It's good to get a result,\" Jets captain Blake Wheeler said. \"Obviously, it's been tough around here. I think the quality of our play isn't reflective of the results we're getting recently. So, it's good to finally get one.\"\n\nThe Jets are undefeated in regulation in their last seven games against the Oilers. Their last loss was Dec. 1, 2016.\n\nThe victory also marked Winnipeg head coach Paul Maurice's 700th career win. He's seventh all-time and third behind active NHL coaches Joel Quenneville of the Florida Panthers (893) and New York Islanders' Barry Trotz (815).\n\nJets defenseman Carl Dahlstrom appeared to score his first NHL goal at 8:23 of the third period, but the play was reviewed, and Scheifele was ruled offside. The goal was wiped away.\n\nEdmonton outshot Winnipeg 7-2 in the first period.\n\nThe Jets didn't get their first shot on goal until 8:06 and finished with another 11 attempts in the period, five that missed the net and six that were blocked.\n\nThe Oilers went on a power play with 1:56 left in the opening period and had one shot that Hellebuyck turned aside.\n\nWinnipeg went on its first power play seven minutes in the second period and got four shots on Smith.\n\nMcDavid was then called for slashing Blake Wheeler late in the second. Winnipeg managed three shots on goal.\n\nShots on goal after the middle frame were 15-12 in Edmonton's favor.\n\nWinnipeg had its third power play of the game 26 seconds into the third and Smith stopped Laine's low, one-timer blast and a shot from Dmitry Kulikov.\n\nLess than a minute after Dahlstrom's goal was disallowed, the Jets went on the power play again. Smith denied three shot attempts, including two quick ones from close in.\n\nNOTES: Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl had his point streak end at eight games. He had six goals and 10 assists in that span. ... Edmonton defenseman Kris Russell played his 800th NHL game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOilers: At Minnesota Wild on Tuesday.\n\nJets: Finish a five-game homestand against Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
