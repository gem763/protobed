Kaepernick wants to play football again and isn't happy just selling shoes.\n\nHere are some of the facts purported by the Kaepernick team:\n\n\u201cHas Colin been offered a job by an NFL team? No, not a single team has offered Colin a job since the 2016 season, in which he began his peaceful protest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you reached out to every team on Colin\u2019s behalf? I have reached out to all 32 teams about Colin\u2019s employment, with little to no response from teams about an opportunity for Colin. In 25 years, I have never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Colin still want to play? Yes, he has been working out 5 days a week, for 3 years, in preparation to play again.\u201d\n\nIn the NFL, Kaepernick infamously took a knee anytime he heard the National Anthem. Kaepernick said his protest of our nation\u2019s flag was somehow about racial injustice in the United States -- and in no way a political distraction designed to keep attention away from his poor performance on the field.\n\nThe protests of the American Flag by NFL players, started by Kaepernick, helped drive down viewership for the NFL. But Kaepernick\u2019s team just can\u2019t figure out why a single NFL team isn\u2019t itching to give the controversial player a new platform.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just athletes that Kaepernick inspired with his protest. A public school teacher in New Jersey repeatedly took a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance in his classroom. In the NFL\u2019s case, viewers could turn off the T.V. But taxpayers continue to pay this activist\u2019s salary. Demonstrating how hard it is to ever fire a public school teacher, the perpetual kneeler has since been reassigned to \u201calternative duties,\u201d according to reporting by the Daily Journal.\n\nKaepernick now sells shoes for Nike, which has not been without controversy. But he can\u2019t be surprised that a poor-performing athlete who drove down ratings with his antics isn\u2019t wanted by a single team in the NFL.", "description": "To correct all the false narratives regarding Colin Kaepernick, his team put out a factsheet, obtained by TMZ..10/10/2019 20:12:26PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/242/c5dfb6cc-f0cd-4209-afe8-f11e31d9bc5d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
