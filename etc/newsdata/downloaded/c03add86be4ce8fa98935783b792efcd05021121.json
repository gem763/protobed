The path Francis has been taking, though, leads directly into a larger culture war, one that pits progressives against traditionalists.\n\nAnd so the synod offered ample opportunity for Francis\u2019s many vocal critics\u2014including conservative Catholics in the United States, who are intertwined with the political right\u2014to accuse the pope of breaking orthodoxy and watering down Church doctrine, such as the bishops\u2019 recommendations to allow more room for indigenous traditions in Catholic ritual. These critics also see Francis\u2019s papacy as flirting dangerously with paganism, pantheism, and even Marxism, because they view the pope\u2019s emphasis on attending to the poor as often at odds with the exigencies of global capitalism.\n\nThe environment was the central focus of the meeting. In their final document, the bishops warned of the risks of deforestation, which they said now put almost 17 percent of the Amazon forest in danger, and also of the displacement of indigenous groups because of the deforestation. \u201cAttacks on nature have consequences for the lives of peoples,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey defined what they called \u201cecological sins of commission or omission against God, against one\u2019s neighbor, the community and the environment.\u201d They called these \u201csins against future generations \u2026 manifest in acts and habits of pollution and destruction of the harmony of the environment, transgressions against the principles of interdependence and the ripping of network of solidarity among creatures and against the virtue of justice.\u201d\n\nIn practical terms that means better coordination in the region for advocacy against environmental catastrophes, such as toxic spills related to mining, Bishop David M. De Aguirre Guinea, one of two special secretaries overseeing the synod, said at a news conference yesterday. \u201cThis has become part of the social doctrine of the Church, taking care of our common home,\u201d he said.\n\nFrancis set the Amazon as the theme for the meeting three years ago, long before the devastating fires that swept through the region in August, the result of targeted deforestation to clear farmland. \u201cThe fires brought the thing home to us in a way that graphs or other visuals didn\u2019t,\u201d Cardinal Michael Czerny, a Canadian Jesuit and the other special secretary behind the synod, said. \u201cIf we insist on tearing up the trees and digging up the land because we can\u2019t live without the metals and the gold and the wood for our fancy furniture, you can fill out the rest.\u201d\n\nCzerny is one of 13 new cardinals whom Francis appointed this month and who will one day elect his successor, the clearest way any pope shapes the future of the Church. Czerny, for instance, runs a Vatican office dedicated to migrants and refugees at the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, and his promotion is a clear sign of the importance Francis places on migration.", "description": "A three-week conference that prioritized the environment highlights a culture war in the Catholic Church.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2T1KC/facebook.jpg?1572180723", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
