But what of the sexist men behind the assaults and the degradation \u2013 are their minds changing?\n\nThis week\u2019s Panorama saw journalist Myles Bonnar go undercover and join one of the UK\u2019s \u201cseduction boot camps\u201d \u2013 weekends during which men desperate for sex set themselves back as much as \u00a31,500 to learn how to persuade women to go to bed with them, making the \u201ccold approach\u201d on the street and securing \u201csame-day lays\u201d.\n\nGuided by so-called coaches Richard Hood and Eddie Hitchens, Bonnar is taken to Oxford Street to seek out prospective \u201ctargets\u201d. The coaches mic up their students and listen in as the men adopt one of several manipulation techniques in order to keep the women talking. Many of these recordings are then uploaded onto their YouTube channels alongside footage of the encounters shot from afar.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

I mean that they want like a written permission slip from her like, you know?\u201d Another interaction sees Hood explain that once a woman\u2019s hand touches your penis, that\u2019s \u201cthe point of no return\u201d.\n\nThe coaches use acronyms like LMR (last-minute resistance) to explain how to disarm and manipulate women into sleeping with them. Resistance to sex, they explain, is only performative, adopted by women as a means of appearing less promiscuous. It\u2019s all part of the \u201cgame\u201d.\n\nOf course, none of this is new. So-called \u201cpick-up artistry\u201d, as it is embarrassingly named by its advocates, has been widely known since infamous pick-up artist (PUA) Neil Strauss wrote about it in his chart-topping 2005 manual, The Game. Strauss described a world in which men are taught to target, approach and seduce women using a set of rules.\n\nThe manual included, but was not limited to, tactics designed to insult and undermine women (or \u201cneg\u201d them) in order to put them on the back foot and desperately seek the man\u2019s approval; it included encouraging men to ignore their \u201ctarget\u201d when they initially approach a group, so that she craves his attention; then to \u201cisolate\u201d her, separating her from her social group in order to move onto the next phase. In The Game, Strauss proudly recounts getting celebrities\u2019 mobile numbers, including Britney Spears.\n\nIn 2014, feminist protesters marched against American pick-up artist Julien Blanc being let into the UK. His website, Pimping My Game, promised to help men develop \u201cpanty-dropping masculinity\u201d and to teach them how to \u201cmake girls beg to sleep with you after short-circuiting their emotional and logical mind\u201d. The Home Office later banned Blanc from entering Britain. In 2015, Strauss published The Truth, in which he wrote about how he\u2019s since been treated for sex addiction and is now a changed man \u2013 a husband and a father.\n\nThe Panorama episode reveals just how popular pick-up artistry continues to be, and how far the legal system has to go to catch up with it. Far from catering to a minute number of men, Bonnar explains, the pick-up industry is booming, worth over \u00a380m globally, and spans the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and India.\n\nThese are more than just a few predatory men adopting manipulation techniques to make women sleep with them out of self-hatred and a need for validation. These groups target unconfident men and deliberately teach them to adopt predatory behaviour and a mindset that poses a direct threat to consent.\n\nFollowing Bonnar\u2019s investigation, YouTube deactivated two channels operated by PUAs for violating its regulations: those of \u201cAddy A-Game\u201d and \u201cStreet Attraction\u201d. Adnan Ahmed, the 38-year-old behind Addy A-Game, is currently remanded in custody for harassing young women. He will be sentenced this month. One of his \u201ctargets\u201d, 17-year-old Beth, told Panorama that she found his comments \u201creally crude\u201d and said he had \u201cjust a horrible manner, and he was really quite touchy\u201d with her. Ahmed\u2019s advice had included: \u201cListen to her actions \u2013 her body \u2013 not her words.\u201d\n\nContrary to what we might think, #MeToo and discussions surrounding consent haven\u2019t deterred these men; they\u2019ve apparently fired them up, presenting an added hurdle over which they want to leap.\n\nConsent is just one part of the threat posed by this type of subgroup. You just have to look at how, in recent years, unsuccessful PUAs have become embittered and angry, morphing into an altogether more concerning group: incels, or self-proclaimed \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d, who direct their rage at female, and wider societal, rejection.\n\nThis was the rage expressed by 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, who pulled a gun on the University of California campus, killing six people and injuring another 14, then turning the gun on himself. Before doing so, Rodger had written a manifesto about the women who had rejected him.\n\nIn 2018, Scott Beierle channelled his rage when he walked into a Florida yoga studio and shot two women, injuring four others. Beierle, who posted videos online in which he called women \u201csluts\u201d, cited Rodger as an inspiration.\n\nInceldom, PUAs and \u201cmen\u2019s rights activists\u201d alongside them are the darkest extremes of misogyny. They are what happens when sexist jokes trickle into a pool of inappropriate touching, unequal pay, discrimination, objectification and sexual harassment, by which point sexism has transcended unconscious bias to become a fully fledged ideology.", "description": "Has #MeToo helped stamp out sexism?
