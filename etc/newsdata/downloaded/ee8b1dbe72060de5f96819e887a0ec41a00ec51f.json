Hinch said.\n\n\u201cComing to a new venue, certainly an unbelievable environment, getting back in the series, putting a little bit of momentum in our clubhouse and our dugout, will go a long way.\u201d\n\nHinch praised Altuve\u2019s batting efforts that produced pivotal runs for the Astros.\n\n\u201cJose has been fantastic for us,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight he was a catalyst for us. Jose is the heart and soul of what we do.\u201d\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez also saw Altuve as the critical hitter in the outcome.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best. I love the way he plays the game,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cWe gave him good pitches. That\u2019s probably one of the best hitters in the game. He just made hits.\u201d\n\nThe loss ended an eight-game Nationals win streak, matching the longest one-year playoff run in MLB history.\n\nWashington had outscored foes 56-19 in the span, part of an 18-2 overall run since September 23.\n\nThe Astros won an MLB-best 107 games but have been tested by an upstart club that began the season 19-31 and battled into the last week of the season just to reach the playoffs.\n\n\u2013 Electric atmosphere \u2013\n\nA vocal sellout crowd of 43,867 watched the first World Series game played in Washington since 1933, nine years after the original Senators won the city\u2019s only crown, a feat recalled in black and white highlights on the stadium videoscreen.\n\n\u201cThe fans were awesome,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt was electric. The boys in the dugout were fired up. Bring it again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWashington catcher Kurt Suzuki suffered a right hip flexor injury and his status was uncertain for game four.\n\nThe Nationals, baseball\u2019s best at scoring with two outs, stranded 12 runners and went 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\u201cLittle bit aggressive outside the strike zone,\u201d Martinez said. \u201c(Astros starter Zack) Greinke got out of some jams and we couldn\u2019t capitalize.\u201d\n\nHouston\u2019s George Springer opened with an infield single but centerfielder Victor Robles robbed Altuve of an extra-base hit with an amazing catch, prompting a frustrated Altuve to toss an object against the dugout wall, the moment summing up the series.\n\nThen things started going Houston\u2019s way.\n\nThe Astros seized a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Carlos Correa doubled to the left-field wall and scored on Josh Reddick\u2019s bloop single to left.\n\nIn the third, Altuve doubled down the left-field line, took third base on a fielding error by 21st-birthday celebrant Juan Soto and scored on Michael Brantley\u2019s single for a 2-0 Astros lead.\n\n\u201cI saw some good at-bats. I just liked the competitiveness of our at-bats,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe were kind of pretty focused on handing the baton to the next guy. We\u2019re at our best when we do that.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Baby Shark\u2019 toothless \u2013\n\nWashington scored in the fourth when Ryan Zimmerman walked and came home on Robles\u2019s triple down the left-field line.\n\nSafely on third base, the Dominican flapped his hands in a shark jaws motion to spark the crowd and team with what has become a Nats talisman move, although Robles was stranded after two failed bunts produced outs.\n\nHouston answered in the fifth when Altuve doubled and scored on a Brantley single for a 3-1 Astros edge, Altuve becoming the first second baseman since 1910 to hit two doubles and score twice in a World Series game.\n\nChirinos homered in the sixth for the final run.\n\nIn the sixth, Nationals fans began slapping hands to the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d children\u2019s song when Gerardo Parra, who uses the music for his walk to the plate, entered.\n\nBut the pinch-hitter struck out and the Nats stranded two more runners, another in the eighth and another in the ninth.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 An explosive Jose Altuve hitting performance powered Houston back into World Series contention on Friday as the Astros beat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/324e2b_hat-tip-jose-altuve-sparked-houston-victory-washington-in-game-world-series-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
