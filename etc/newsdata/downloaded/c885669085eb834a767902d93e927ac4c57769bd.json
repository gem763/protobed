Mario Pasalic was also on target, as was 17-year-old substitute Amad Traor\u00e9 on his debut.\n\nIlicic almost completed a hat trick too but curled an effort onto the bar.\n\nSPAL HOLDS NAPOLI\n\nNapoli drew 1-1 at relegation-threatened Spal.\n\nThings appeared to be going to plan when Arkadiusz Milik fired Napoli in front in the ninth minute but Jasmin Kurtic leveled seven minutes later.\n\nNapoli remained fourth, six points behind eight-time defending champion Juventus. Carlo Ancelotti's side hosts Atalanta on Wednesday.\n\nSpal is in penultimate position in Serie A, one point from safety.\n\nMORE MISERY\n\nAC Milan's defensive woes let it down again as it lost 2-1 at Roma.\n\nMilan left Edin Dzeko completely unmarked to head in a corner which had been flicked on by Gianluca Mancini to give Roma the lead in the 38th minute.\n\nTheo Hern\u00e1ndez leveled in the 55th but Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo restored Roma's advantage four minutes later after Milan again gave the ball away.\n\nIt would have been even worse for Milan had it not been for several impressive saves from Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nRoma moved fifth, a point below Napoli. Milan is 12th.\n\nOTHER MATCHES\n\nLazio moved up to sixth with a last-gasp 2-1 victory at Fiorentina.\n\nBoth teams disputed some refereeing decisions, including Ciro Immobile's winner a minute from time as there appeared to be a foul in the buildup.\n\nFiorentina winger Franck Rib\u00e9ry could risk a lengthy ban after TV footage showed him pushing an assistant referee after the final whistle.\n\nThe Italian league has confirmed that Ribery was given a red card.\n\nRibery, who set up Fiorentina's equalizer, had already been substituted with 15 minutes remaining and the score still 1-1.\n\nIt was almost 3-1 at the end but Bartlomiej Dragowski saved a stoppage-time penalty, awarded for a Luca Ranieri handball. Ranieri was shown a second yellow card and sent off.\n\nCagliari drew 1-1 at Torino, while Bologna beat Sampdoria 2-1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
