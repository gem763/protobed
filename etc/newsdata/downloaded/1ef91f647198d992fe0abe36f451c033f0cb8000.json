Martha McSally in Arizona, raised $5.5 million in the third quarter and has $9.5 million on hand. Ms. McSally raised about $3 million last quarter and had about $5.6 million on hand at the end of September.\n\nSara Gideon, a Democratic challenger to Republican Sen. Susan Collins in Maine, raised $3.2 million and had $2.8 million on hand. Ms. Collins raised about $2 million, though she had more than $7 million on hand.\n\nIn Iowa, Democrat Theresa Greenfield raised $1.1 million, outpacing Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, though Ms. Greenfield has several opponents for the party nomination. Ms. Ernst had close to $4 million on hand, compared to $1.2 million for Ms. Greenfield.\n\n\u201cAs vulnerable Republicans continue to face blowback for their toxic records and consistent failures of leadership, strong Democratic candidates are holding them accountable and building winning campaigns that will carry them to victory across the country next November,\u201d said Stewart Boss, a spokesman for Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.\n\nStill, it\u2019s early in the proceedings since many challengers are still emerging and key races aren\u2019t defined, said Anthony Corrado, professor of government at Colby College in Maine.\n\n\u201cBut some of the Democratic challengers have been unusually successful for this point in the campaign and a number of the Republican incumbents are not showing much fundraising momentum at this point,\u201d Mr. Corrado said.\n\nDemocrat Amy McGrath raised close to $11 million last quarter in her bid to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, finishing September with $6.8 million on hand. Mr. McConnell, who easily won reelection in 2014, raised about $1.9 million and had banked $9 million as of the start of October.\n\n\u201cRepublican candidates did well by posting impressive quarters \u2014 it\u2019s just their counterparts on the Democrat side happened to just outpace them,\u201d said one GOP strategist. \u201cRepublicans need to remain focused on making sure that we match the base enthusiasm out there.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee, coupled with President Trump\u2019s campaign and associated fundraising committees, raised a record-breaking $125 million in the most recent fundraising period and finished last quarter with $158 million on hand.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s record of accomplishment is generating tremendous enthusiasm and the Democrats\u2019 reckless, illegitimate, partisan impeachment farce has his supporters even more fired up,\u201d said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. \u201cThe campaign and our partnership with the RNC have never been stronger.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are eyeing at least several pickups of their own and are bullish on defeating Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama and Sen. Gary Peters in Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan, Republican John James outraised Mr. Peters $3 million to $2.5 million, though Mr. Peters\u2019 $6.3 million war chest was larger than Mr. James\u2019 $3.8 million.\n\nRecent surveys have shown Mr. Peters and Mr. James neck-and-neck in a state that will be critical to the president\u2019s reelection chances next year. The Cook Political Report on Friday moved the race from \u201clikely Democrat\u201d to \u201clean Democrat.\u201d\n\nMr. James\u2019 strong third quarter \u201cshows that Michiganders are excited to see a bit of light and compassion infused into this very dark and divisive political environment,\u201d the Republican candidate said. \u201cAction and authenticity are resonating.\u201d\n\nMr. Jacobson predicted that no House or Senate candidate with even a modest chance of winning will lack for resources next year.\n\n\u201cBut their fates will depend much more on how voters respond to the top of the ticket than to local campaign resources,\u201d he said. \u201cTicket splitting and split outcomes have become quite rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf recent elections are the guide, the competitive Senate races will attract as much outside \u2018independent\u2019 spending as candidate contributions, and these crucial numbers will not be known until relatively late in the election year,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Mr. Parscale alluded to, one wild card is the effect House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push could have on both fundraising and energy on both sides heading into next year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe Republican strategist said impeachment is \u201ccertainly a base motivator\u201d for both sides.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a segment of the Republican electorate [and a] segment of the Democratic electorate that are very, very passionate about this issue and willing to contribute to express their views,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
