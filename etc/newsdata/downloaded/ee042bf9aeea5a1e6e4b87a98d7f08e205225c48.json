My clients have always been millionaire-types, \"masters of the universe,\" CEOs, owners of hedge funds, entrepreneurs, partners in law firms, investment bankers, and entertainment executives.\n\nI have helped thousands find love, and I have always had a sixth sense about knowing who goes well with whom. As a result, I have really come to understand how the mind of a millionaire works.\n\nA lot of women ask me why a millionaire will wind up marrying one woman over another, especially when the first woman seemed to be more his type. What I have found is that while some millionaires will marry a woman with whom they fall in love without a method to their madness, a large majority will ultimately get married because of these seven reasons.\n\n1. Timing can be everything.\n\nFor millionaires, sometimes taking that walk down the aisle can actually be chalked up to timing. I have seen many instances in my matchmaking business where millionaires end up marrying \"the unexpected woman\" because the time was right and nothing more.\n\nPerhaps he has become the only board member at his company who isn't married, perhaps the last of his friends from his Wharton cohort has tied the knot, or perhaps he is the last single one standing in his group of bachelor friends. Any time a triggering event like this happens, a millionaire bachelor can decide to become a married man very quickly.\n\nRead more: 'With money, your brain thinks differently': 5 elite matchmakers on what millionaire men look for when they date\n\n2. The woman seems like she would be the right mother to his heirs.\n\nMillionaires see their children as the next CEOs of their company, so they are very particular in choosing who will be the mother of their heirs-to-be.\n\nMany millionaires have told me that even if they think one woman is excellent in every other way and even if they are in love with that woman, if they don't see her as a good mother with a strong moral compass, then ultimately they won't marry her.\n\nSome millionaire men look for the right mother to raise the heir to his company. Paul Childs/Reuters\n\n3. The woman just fits into his life.\n\nI have seen many millionaire men marry women who just fit; she is the pot to his lid, the yin to his yang.\n\nMany millionaires have expressed to me that because their lives are so busy and they have so many responsibilities, they ultimately want to marry someone who just works in their life; i.e. had a similar upbringing, travels in the same social circles, and has the same ideas on life in general so that things are just easy.\n\n4. The woman is supportive and understanding.\n\nA lot of millionaire men are attracted to women who are very understanding of their lifestyle and how busy they are and are willing to put his interests first when necessary.\n\nMany women think that playing hard to get is the way to land a wealthy man. However, what I have seen is that many times, it's quite the opposite. Millionaire men actually end up marrying women who are more easy-going, empathetic, and a team player; they tend to ultimately break up with or blow-off the \"difficult\" women.\n\nRead more: The 3 biggest mistakes millionaires make when dating, according to 6 elite matchmakers who help the ultra-wealthy find love\n\n5. He decides he is ready to start having kids pronto.\n\nA lot of very wealthy men like freedom when they are dating, but they still have old-fashioned values when it comes to child-rearing and family. If a millionaire wakes up one morning and has the \"I need to have a child now\" itch, the woman who has his attention at that moment will be the one he marries.\n\nMillionaire men want a woman who is organized and is the full package. John Sibley/Reuters\n\n6. The woman is very organized.\n\nA lot of very wealthy men like to marry a woman who is organized, can juggle a lot of things at once and can \"tend to the household.\" This might sound caveman-like, but many successful men tell me that they ultimately want to marry a woman who can can take care of the house and the family matters effortlessly.\n\nThis doesn't mean you can't be a boss-babe, but you also need to be able to be in charge of that part of your lives as a family unit.\n\n7. The woman is the full package.\n\nMillionaire men are overachievers by nature so, of course, they want to marry the woman who they see as the cream of the crop, who they believe has it all. For each wealthy man, having it all is different, but they all want to be with someone who they see as both beautiful and sexy, smart, family-oriented, understanding, and kind.\n\nThe owner of bicoastal matchmaking service, Samantha's Table, Samantha Daniels has been a professional matchmaker and dating and relationship expert for nearly 20 years.
