Biden in an interview released Wednesday over his pitch for beating President Trump in 2020.\n\nMr. Yang, an entrepreneur seeking the Democratic nomination, discussed the former vice president\u2019s rivaling campaign during an interview with CBS News set to air Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to Joe talk about it, his main argument is that his election is going to be a restoration of the Obama-Biden administration, in essence,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cWhich is a move, literally, backwards in time. And so to me, saying that we can somehow erase not just Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, but all of the reasons why people voted for Donald Trump, to me is not correct.\n\n\u201cI mean, these things have happened, and we\u2019re going to have to address them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected, one, if we\u2019re gonna win, and two, if we\u2019re gonna move the country forward.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nSeveral recent polls have placed Mr. Biden, the vice president for eight years during the Obama administration, as the preferred candidates among Democrats hoping to stop Mr. Trump from winning a second term in 2020.\n\nDespite polling well behind the former vice president among registered Democrats, Mr. Yang said that he is the only other candidate capable of drawing votes away from Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say that they would support,\u201d Mr. Yang told CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m focused on solving the problems that they see around them every day. And I\u2019m laser-focused on trying to make their lives better. That\u2019s why I\u2019m getting thousands of Trump voters as well as independents and libertarians and Democrats and progressives. If I\u2019m the Democratic nominee, we win. That\u2019s the math.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden and Mr. Yang have both qualified to participate in the Sept. 12 primary debate in Texas, organized by the Democratic National Committee. They have reserved spots alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
