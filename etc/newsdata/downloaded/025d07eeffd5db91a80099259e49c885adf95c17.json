Though he meant it as an insult, it appears she used it as a badge of honor on her own page soon after.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone in this response. Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg recently used a comment from President Trump to update her Twitter bio.\n\nThis is far from the first time Pelosi has gone viral among her supporters. From her sunglasses moment to the way she clapped during President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, the California congresswoman\u2019s moments often launch memes.", "description": "The House Speaker is at it again", "authors": ["Rachel E.
