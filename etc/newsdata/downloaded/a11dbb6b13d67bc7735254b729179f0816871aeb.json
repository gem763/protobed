Young voters proved critical for Trudeau in 2015, but Currie is voting for the Conservatives. He says the Liberal Party has moved too far to the left, and he\u2019s put off by Trudeau\u2019s \u201chistory of scandals,\u201d particularly the SNC-Lavalin affair.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe way he handled it highlighted his arrogance,\u201d Currie said.\n\nScheer, an affable social and fiscal conservative, faces his own hurdles. Since becoming party leader in 2017, he has struggled to expand his party\u2019s appeal beyond its base and remains somewhat unknown to voters. Foes have attacked him for his antiabortion views, for misrepresenting his work experience and for not disclosing his dual U.S.-Canadian citizenship until it was revealed this month by the Globe and Mail.\n\nAD\n\nNo single issue has dominated the campaign, but the environment stands out as a key area of disagreement. Scheer has pledged to \u201cuse every legislative tool\u201d to repeal the Liberal government\u2019s levy on carbon. Trudeau has committed Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050. Critics to the left of Trudeau say both leaders have unambitious plans that are scant on details.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts say the election\u2019s results will hinge on whether progressive voters coalesce around Trudeau as they did in 2015, and on whether disillusioned voters choose to sit this one out.\n\nFour years ago, Elena Kazias voted for the Liberals. This time, the retired teacher is all in on the New Democratic Party. She was already smarting over the Trudeau government\u2019s decision to buy an oil pipeline last year given its pledge to fight climate change. Singh\u2019s debate performances sealed the deal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSingh gave forthright answers,\u201d Kazias said. \u201cI was very disappointed in Trudeau not answering the questions that the moderators posed to him.\u201d\n\nChatter about a looming minority government has bubbled on the campaign trail and beyond.\n\nAt a campaign event in Montreal, Trudeau delivered the conventional Liberal warning to voters who could split the progressive vote by casting their ballots for the NDP or Greens: Don\u2019t do it, unless you want to wake up Tuesday morning to Prime Minister Scheer.\n\nAD\n\nSingh, 40, has ruled out supporting a Conservative minority government and said last week that he\u2019d \u201cabsolutely\u201d form a coalition, in which the parties shared cabinet seats \u2014 to block Scheer. But he has since walked those comments back. He urged voters Thursday in Brampton, Ontario, to \u201cvote for what you believe in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nScheer, appearing at a freight trucking facility in Brampton earlier in the day, warned that a Liberal-NDP coalition would be one \u201cthat you cannot afford.\u201d\n\nPollster Bruce Anderson, chairman of Abacus Data, says the Conservatives would have few natural allies in a minority scenario and could face pressure from the other parties to make concessions on issues such as the environment to earn their support.\n\nThe election in Canada, a close security and trade partner, has implications for the United States \u2014 and at least one American political figure has been paying attention. Former president Barack Obama offered a rare cross-border endorsement of Trudeau\u2019s reelection bid last week, tweeting that \u201cthe world needs his progressive leadership now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhatever the outcome, Christopher Sands said, Canada is likely to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement if and when the U.S. does. Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said there is potential for greater cooperation on issues such as energy infrastructure with a Conservative government.\n\nScheer has pledged to tighten the U.S.-Canada border by closing a loophole in a law that allows asylum seekers who cross into Canada at an unauthorized point of entry to file a claim. He did not say what he would do if President Trump opposed such a proposal.\n\nCanadians complain that the campaign has been dull and atypically divisive. Trudeau, who took the unusual step of wearing a bulletproof vest at a campaign event this month in Mississauga, Ontario, because of an unspecified security threat, accused the Conservatives of running \u201cone of the dirtiest, nastiest campaigns.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPartisanship isn\u2019t new in Canada, but this idea of \u2018I don\u2019t like you just because you\u2019re from that party\u2019 is something we\u2019re seeing more than before,\u201d said Melanee Thomas, a political scientist at the University of Calgary.\n\nSands expected the campaign to be more positive.\n\n\u201cAs an American, I look at it and say, \u2018There\u2019s another bad idea they\u2019ve imported from us.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "Trudeau\u2019s Liberals are locked in a tight race with Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives as Canadians head to the polls Monday.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BI9cLL6mKR1t3zG7XNlRDTjn_KU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR3E6CXSCQI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
