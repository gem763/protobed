The only sandstone university vice-chancellor was Dawn Freshwater from the University of Western Australia, who has since been replaced by ANU's Brian Schmidt.\n\nUniversity commentators say Professor Wellings, who was host to 40 university vice-chancellors when his report was handed down, is not only an adviser to Mr Tehan, he is reflecting back to universities the thinking of the Education Minister, with whom he has a strong working relationship.\n\nProfessor Wellings is not a member of the group which is developing a strategy on foreign interference in universities but said collaboration with China came up before the reference committee because of university relationships with with business.\n\nMost universities operated under acts which were \"very liberal\" about where they could do business. This had been complicated since China became Australia's biggest trading partner while the US remained its key security ally.\n\nReplying to a question, Professor Wellings said he did not foresee a showdown coming with China.\n\nChina will nudge us into a more formal framework to ask: should we evaluate the route to market for technology? \u2014 Paul Wellings, Wollongong University vice-chancellor\n\n\"There is a shift in the language and policies we might need to use. I sat on the commercialisation committee for CSIRO. The question we faced then was: will the technology be held here and create jobs? Or where the route to market means, if it has to be developed elsewhere, will Australia be the first equal to market with the technology?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"China will nudge us into a more formal framework to ask: should we evaluate the route to market for technology? At the moment we are just required to ask is there a defence implication.\n\n\"This other test is a slightly more commercial test around: is there a benefit for Australia as well? And that may well be what we need to reflect on and build policies for.\"\n\nPrivately some sandstone-university vice chancellors have said they are concerned that, with the exception of the University of South Australia and ANU, the institutions that have strongest relationships with business are not represented on Professor Wellings' committee.\n\nSome Group of Eight universities are said to be ready to push back against recommendations from the committee if they don't like its findings.\n\nProfessor Wellings rejected this, saying the minister had multiple sources of advice on business and eduction.\n\n\"I'm happy to talk to any of the groupings or any of the individuals. If Deborah Terry [chair of Universities Australia] asked me to say something collectively to colleagues, I'd be more than happy to. I did that during the performance review.\n\n\"The thing the minister was able to do with [my] report was to get 40 universities to broadly align with the report. We didn't scatter to the four winds.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said it would be a mistake to think just the Group of Eight had carriage of the larger corporations.\n\nIn the context of the steel industry, Wollongong had as strong an interest in business relations as the University of NSW, Monash or Queensland, all of which were members of the Group of Eight.\n\nGiven the importance of networks in the relationship between universities and Canberra, some vice-chancellors have speculated Wollongong has added political clout. Its government relations adviser is Canio Fierravanti, brother of the Liberal senator for NSW, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.\n\nProfessor Wellings said Mr Fierravanti had been at the university nearly three decades, since long before his sister became a Liberal senator.\n\n\"He knows the history and genesis of every adviser in every ministerial office in every state and commonwealth government and opposition. And so we've had cordial relationships with Labor and Liberal and National parties for 20 odd years,\" he added.\n\n\"We don't belong to a mission group. We've been in a group of one so we've had to build our own government relations function. You need long-term links.\"", "description": "Wollongong University vice-chancellor Paul Wellings has his ear to the ground for government signals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3947%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_647%2C$y_479/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fa89d6776d15fa43c63e4b8429fdb3d08f58a927", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
