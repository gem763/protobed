He used it as his primary guitar until it was stolen in 2009 and traded in at a Las Vegas pawn shop. A guitar collector bought it, and after investigating its provenance, returned it to King later that year.\n\nIt was one of the guitars King named Lucille, a tradition that began in 1949. King \u2013 who went on to become one of the most celebrated blues guitarists of all time \u2013 was playing in an Arkansas dance hall when a fight between two men caused a fuel tank to catch fire; King escaped, but ran back in to save his guitar. He later found out the men had been fighting over a woman named Lucille, and gave her name to every guitar since.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest BB King\u2019s Gibson ES-345 prototype guitar.
