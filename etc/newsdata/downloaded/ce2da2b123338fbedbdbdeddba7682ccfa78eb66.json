Consequently those states pay proportionally less in net terms than some poorer ones.\n\nThe Commission has called the rebate system \"opaque\" and \"skewed\".\n\nA European summit next week was meant to tackle the issue of the long-term budget, known as the MFF, for \"multiannual financial framework\".\n\nBut Brexit now looks certain to suck up all the air in the room.\n\nAnd if Britain leaves by an October 31 deadline, as London wants, then there will be less money in the pot -- and five countries including Germany are against having to dig too deep to help make up the shortfall.\n\n\"The current challenges are considerable and Europe cannot allow itself to delay adopting its long-term budget,\" the EU budget commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, told a media briefing.\n\n- The Brexit gap -\n\nMember states have already been intensely negotiating since mid-2018 on the basis of a Commission proposal calling for a multi-year budget of 1.3 trillion euros ($1.4-trillion) .\n\nThat equates to each member state contributing 1.114 percent of its gross national income (GNI).\n\nAt that level, it would cover only half the budget gap left by Britain's absence. The other half of the missing British contribution is meant to come from cuts to EU spending.\n\nOettinger said that the budget gap left by Brexit would be 12 billion euros the first year, then 84 billion over the following seven years.\n\nBut the five frugal countries want the contribution capped at 1.0 percent of GNI, Austria's finance minister, Eduard Mueller, said before a budget meeting in Luxembourg.\n\nThat would leave far less money for \"new priorities\" the EU wants to finance, such as common defence and migration, unless spending is drastically cut on traditional outlays such as building infrastructure in poorer member states and supporting agriculture.\n\nOettinger said that, \"at 1.0 percent, we won't make it\".\n\nSome ideas for new revenue streams include tapping the carbon trading scheme or creating a tax on non-recyclable plastics.\n\nThe European Parliament has expressed concerns that the budget situation could become even more complicated if the new Commission taking office next month announces costly new initiatives, notably on tackling climate change.", "description": "The European Commission on Wednesday urged EU states to drop the system of asking for rebates from their budget contributions if and when the UK leaves under Brexit.
