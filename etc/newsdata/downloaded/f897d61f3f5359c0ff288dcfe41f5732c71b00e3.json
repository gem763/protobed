Thus began two decades of the Avalon being a quiet barge amounting to automotive NyQuil. Toyota is now trying desperately to shed the sedan's old-person, Japanese-Buick image for one that is decidedly less tranquil.\n\nThe latest Avalon\u2014the sharpest driving and most aggressively designed ever\u2014was Toyota's first bid to eradicate thoughts of grandparents anytime someone uttered the word \"Avalon.\" The sporty new-for-2020 Avalon TRD trim level takes things from there. While you might still think of grandpa when seeing this updated large sedan, this gramps will show up to Thanksgiving dinner and down a few whiskey sours, and then take off his shirt.\n\nPhoto credit: Toyota More\n\nAmbitious Execution\n\nWe're reaching for bizarre analogies here because, well, it was pretty weird sitting in the Avalon TRD's cabin, buckled in with its red seatbelts, awaiting our turn to speed through an autocross circuit in the infield of Texas Motor Speedway. Thank Toyota Racing Development, the brand's in-house tuning outfit, for giving Toyota the confidence and chutzpah to park our butts in a heretofore sleepy family sedan on a coned-off autocross course.\n\nThe Avalon TRD's mechanical highlights include lightweight 19-inch wheels that are a half-inch wider, a 0.6-inch-lower ride height, springs that are 10 percent firmer in front and 15 percent firmer in the rear, stiffer anti-roll bars, revised nonadaptive dampers with internal return springs, beefed-up underbody braces, 0.9-inch-larger front brake rotors with two-piston calipers (versus the one-piston calipers on lesser models), and a seductive-sounding exhaust system for the otherwise unchanged 3.5-liter V-6 engine.\n\nPhoto credit: Toyota More\n\nThe Avalon TRD also wears a black-painted body kit with red pinstriping, a rear spoiler, a diffuser element in the lower rear bumper, and blacked-out exterior trim. Inside, there are those silly red seatbelts, plus additional red accents and stitching throughout, as well as \"TRD\" logos on each front headrest. At $43,255, the Avalon TRD isn't the priciest Avalon (the Touring trim costs more), but it's up there. The TRD is similarly equipped to the one-level-down XSE, with standard automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitoring, but lacks the Touring's heated steering wheel and heated rear seats. The only option is a $1760 bundle that brings a JBL audio system and built-in navigation.", "description": "Toyota Racing Development's efforts prove to be welcomingly less hardcore on the full-size Avalon than on the smaller Camry.", "authors": ["Alexander Stoklosa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hp_k7aQbiUQpKqomgUIk3g--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/4d09c7438f647c5c845eef2a77f4ad61", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
