Here are some of the best options for mulled wine, traditional wooden toys, ice rinks and much more.\n\nBath\n\nNovember 28 to December 15\n\nOver 180 light-strewn stalls will line the streets of Bath this year around the iconic Roman Baths and the Abbey. Nearly everything on sale is either sourced or made locally. Ceramics, glasswear, clothes, personalised presents, toys and homeware are among the items you'll find here \u2013 as well as plenty of food and drink.\n\nWhen you've done enough shopping, head for the ice rink and glow-in-the-dark crazy golf course at nearby Royal Victoria Park (bathonice.com - their biggest ever this year; Nov 15, 2019 to Jan 5, 2020), take a tour of the Roman Baths, or catch this year's pantomime of Peter Pan at the Theatre Royal (Nov 26 to December 1). You can also head out on the Christmas Tree Carol Trail to spot the ten uniquely-decorated trees and guess the musical theme of each.", "description": "", "authors": ["Telegraph Travel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2018/November/Nottingham-christmas-market-iStock-636624952-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
