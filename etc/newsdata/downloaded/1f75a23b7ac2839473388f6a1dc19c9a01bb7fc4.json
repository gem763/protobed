Morgan Stanley's stock has had a volatile year, only up about 7% since January, lagging its peers. Goldman Sachs is up 24%, J.P. Morgan is up 22% and Wells Fargo is up 8% year to date.\n\nBarclays expects Morgan Stanley to report earnings per share of $1.18, slightly below consensus of $1.19. Barclays said it expects lower net interest income, a profitability gauge, largely attributed to the current low interest rate environment.\n\nWhile most banks have beaten Wall Street's estimates for earnings, many bank executives have warned that low rates, with the potential of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could hurt fourth-quarter margins.", "description": "We'll get a pile of economic data, Morgan Stanley earnings and Netflix earnings reaction on Thursday", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106027061-1563472600346gettyimages-1126759074r.jpg?v=1571247490", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
