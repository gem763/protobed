REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe move against the Conservative Party grandee marks one of the most bizarre turns in the three-year Brexit crisis that has gripped a country once touted as a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability.\n\nSoames was one of 21 Conservative lawmakers who rebelled, including Ken Clarke, 79, the longest continuously sitting British lawmaker in the House of Commons, and former finance minister Philip Hammond. All are to be expelled.\n\nWhen Soames was asked if this was the end of the Conservative Party his grandfather would have known, he said: \u201cNo. But it\u2019s a bad night.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity - a great pity - that this has in my view all been planned: this is exactly what they wanted and they will try to have a general election which is what they wanted.\u201d\n\nSince he took office as prime minister six weeks ago, Johnson has been ruthless: He oversaw one of the biggest purges of cabinet ministers in modern British history and has cut short a session of parliament to increase the likelihood Britain will leave the EU, with or without a deal.\n\nAfter a defeat at the hands of an alliance of opposition lawmakers and rebels in his own party, Johnson\u2019s enforcers will speak to those who defied his order and expel them, a Downing Street spokesman said.\n\nIn total, lawmakers with more 330 years experience in parliament will be expelled from Johnson\u2019s party - the same party which lost its working majority on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI have been told by the chief whip, who is my friend and who I like very much, that it will be his sad duty to write to me tomorrow to tell me I have had the whip removed after 37 years as a Conservative member of parliament,\u201d Soames said. \u201cThat\u2019s fortunes of war. I knew what I was doing.\u201d\n\nSoames, 71, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2014, has been a member of parliament since 1983 and previously served as a junior defence minister. He is the son of Mary Soames, the youngest of Churchill\u2019s five children.\n\nCHURCHILL\n\nChurchill occupies a special place in British culture as the victor of World War Two and by far the most powerful British statesman of the 20th Century - a \u2018British bulldog\u2019 who could hold his own with Josef Stalin and Harry Truman.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly spoken of his admiration for Churchill, and in 2014 published a biography called \u201cThe Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History.\u201d\n\nIn the introduction, Johnson, then mayor of London, wrote: \u201cWhen I was growing up there was no doubt about it. Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced.\u201d\n\nAs a young boy, Soames said he was unaware of his grandfather\u2019s significance and has recounted how, when aged five, he once visited Churchill in his bedroom and asked him: \u201cGrandpapa, is it true that you are the greatest man in the world?\u201d\n\nChurchill replied: \u201cYes, now bugger off.\u201d\n\nAndrew Adonis, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said Churchill would have deselected from Conservative if it was run like it is now because he opposed then prime minister Neville Chamberlain attempt to secure peace with Germany\u2019s Adolf Hitler a year before World War Two.\n\n\u201cChurchill himself would have been deselected,\u201d he said. \u201cChamberlain bitterly attacked him for \u2018undermining his negotiating position\u2019 at Munich and there was a deselection attempt.\u201d\n\nA source close to the group who have voted against the government said Tuesday\u2019s vote is the first step in a process to avert an economically damaging no-deal exit.\n\n\u201cNo. 10 have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson,\u201d the source said. \u201cWhat has happened to the Conservative Party?\u201d", "description": "Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Britain's World War Two leader Winston Churchill, will be expelled from the Conservative Party after voting against Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425914145&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821NJ"}
