Government cranes began appearing ominously over Hui mosques. A video surfaced on social media showing workers taking apart the Gazhuang mosque\u2019s gold dome, then smashing it into the prayer hall. Local Hui saw an unmistakable metaphor: The Communist Party, which once handled religious life here with a light touch, now ran roughshod over it.\n\n\u201cWomen were crying; others, like me, couldn\u2019t believe what was happening,\u201d said Ma Ha, a 40-year-old owner of a noodle shop. \u201cWe had 40 years of religious freedom. The winds are changing.\u201d\u2026\n\nThat tide of \u201cSinicization,\u201d as Chinese policymakers call it, is surging nationwide.
