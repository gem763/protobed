Kamala D. Harris weighed in with her plan Wednesday, ahead of a CNN forum on climate, vowing to make polluters pay with a new pollution fee \u2014 part of a $10 trillion plan to get the U.S. to a \u201cclean\u201d economy by 2045.\n\nWhere Ms. Harris used sticks, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, offered a plan laden with carrots, including a $200 billion fund for workers displaced in the transition to cleaner energy, a tax rebate to partially offset the cost of changes to homes and apartments, and World War II-style \u201cclimate action bonds\u201d to help fund clean-energy projects.\n\n\u201cFor too long Washington has chosen denial and obstruction as we\u2019re faced with the imminent catastrophic effects of climate change,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cMy plan ensures that no community is left behind as we meet the challenge of our time with the urgency and unity it demands.\u201d\n\nClimate activists are embracing the far-reaching approaches.\n\n\u201cWe have seen, I think, an arms race now in a good way of candidates competing to have the most effective plans, and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who emphasized climate change in his since-ended presidential run, said on CNN on Wednesday. \u201cI think we\u2019re now in a place that is really healthy, where the Democratic Party is, I believe, going to produce a candidate to really make climate change a focus.\u201d\n\nMr. Inslee was one of a still-crowded field of Democratic candidates until dropping out several weeks ago. He had offered a campaign built chiefly around raising the profile of climate change, but that position lost some potency as the field as a whole steadily moved toward support for drastic action.\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Julian Castro said he will empower the EPA to aggressively pursue \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d against corporate polluters, make it easier for affected people to sue, and require state governments that receive EPA assistance to meet certain federally-mandated civil rights standards, according to the $10 trillion proposal he laid out this week.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders, meanwhile, has advocated his \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to combat climate change that includes plans to \u201cmassively\u201d increase taxes, increase penalties on fossil fuel-related pollution, and require \u201cfossil fuel infrastructure owners\u201d to buy federal bonds that would finance cleanup associated with spills and accidents.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019 campaign said that unlike other candidates\u2019 plans, the Vermont senator\u2019s $16 trillion vision doesn\u2019t rely on the public-private partnerships others are floating to spur investment in cleaner technology and other priorities.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to banning fracking, achieving 100% renewable energy or taking Wall Street and the fossil fuel industry to task for their roles in creating this crisis \u2014 there is no middle ground,\u201d said Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir.\n\nThat last line is a nod to a news story from earlier this year that said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden was weighing a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approach on climate change.\n\nBut Mr. Biden later embraced the tenets of the Green New Deal and rejected \u201chalf measures\u201d on the issue when he released his own proposal in June to move toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren released a $3 trillion proposal this week that pulls from Mr. Inslee\u2019s plans and aims to move toward zero carbon pollution for new commercial and residential buildings by 2028, zero-emissions for new light-duty passenger vehicles by 2030, and zero-emission energy in electricity generation by 2035.\n\n\u201cWe need to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Ms. Warren said.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s plan calls for $1 trillion over 10 years to help subsidize the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. She also wants to provide job training and benefits for displaced workers in industries like coal.\n\n\u201cThe tenets of just transition say that we\u2019re going to protect your salary, we\u2019re going to protect your pensions, we\u2019re going to protect your health care, and we\u2019re going to get you trained into the renewable energy economy,\u201d said Anthony Rogers-Wright with the Climate Justice Alliance. \u201cQuite frankly, I would say go a step further and say we\u2019re going to retrain you in whatever it is that you want to do.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang, meanwhile, has said the country has already missed the proper window for meaningful action and recently rolled out a $4.9 trillion climate plan that would, among other things, help people relocate their homes or literally move to higher ground, echoing a line from the last presidential debate.\n\nWhile people like Mr. Inslee are embracing the debate, analysts have warned of unintended consequences of the costly proposals \u2014 particularly the plans that rely heavily on federal regulations to get there.\n\nCompletely eliminating coal from the U.S. energy picture would eradicate a substantial portion of America\u2019s electricity resources, said Nick Loris, an economist at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s forced and happens as a result of market forces that\u2019s fine, but if it\u2019s arbitrarily and artificially forced out of the market as a result of excessive regulations that are devoid of any meaningful environmental benefit, that\u2019s problematic for the market and for consumers [in] the overall economy,\u201d Mr. Loris said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
