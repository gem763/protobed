And it\u2019s up $5,000 since Mr. Trump took office. Up $5,000!\n\nIn the 16 years before the Trump era, household income rose just $1,500. Trump: up $5,000 in three years. Bush and Obama: up $1,500 in 16 years!\n\nThat is a newly prosperous Middle America and it\u2019s Middle America that decides elections.\n\nYou haven\u2019t heard much about this of course. Anything good about the Trump years is ignored and the socialists running for president repeat the tired old clich\u00e9s about the rich getting richer and having to work two or three jobs to make ends meet.\n\nThey can't say that tax cuts, deregulation and cheap energy have brought prosperity. To acknowledge that means acknowledging the success of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, and that\u2019s something no Democrat can do.\n\nIt\u2019s the Democratic dilemma; how do you run against prosperity? Well, you call the president names. You try to impeach him. You stamp your feet and say you just can't stand him.\n\nDoes all of that beat extra money in Middle America\u2019s pocket? And will Middle America take a leap in the dark for socialism? Hard to believe that we'll abandon the system that\u2019s made this country wealthy, just because of the president's style and tone!\n\nConsider this; President Trump will easily win re-election if the economy holds up. That\u2019s from Moody\u2019s \u2014 a big Wall Street analytical firm. They've been right about every presidential election since 1980, except for 2016 when they forecast a narrow win for Hillary.\n\nThey are saying prosperity wins. And unless something goes badly wrong, we will remain a prosperous nation in November next year. And yes, it\u2019s very hard to run against prosperity.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "'The great American middle class is coming back strong, and this may be the most important factor in the 2020 election.'", "authors": ["Stuart Varney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Trump-Rally-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
