Photo: Getty Images\n\nFinally, there will be a halftime show worthy of following Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s, though just a few years late. Jennifer Lopez, her abs, Shakira, and her abs will be joining forces at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show in Miami next year. Our abs will be over by the snack stadium. Each superstar shared a post of the other woman, eyes cut off, just to play tricks on us, \u201cBeautiful Liar\u201d style. But one thing is for sure, the Pepsi logo will not not be in the promo. It\u2019s wrapped around Shakira\u2019s bicep, on a ring on J.Lo\u2019s finger, and on J.Lo\u2019s belt. We get it! Thank you to our corporate overlords. And a special shout-out to Jay-Z, who, through a deal finalized in August, is a producer for the halftime segment. Jay-Z actually came through on this one! Someone let Blue Ivy know.\n\n\u201cEver since I saw Diana Ross fly off into the sky at the Halftime Show, I dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl,\u201d J.Lo said in a statement. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s made even more special not only because it\u2019s the NFL\u2019s 100th anniversary, but also because I am performing with a fellow Latina.\u201d Super Bowl LIV takes place on Sunday, February 2, 2020, which, if you need help remembering, is exactly a week before the Oscars \u2014 and Shakira\u2019s birthday!", "description": "Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, and both of their abs are set to perform at the 2020 Super Bowl LIV halftime show.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-shakira-jlo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
