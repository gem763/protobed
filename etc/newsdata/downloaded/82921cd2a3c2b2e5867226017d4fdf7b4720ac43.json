Scooters from Lime, Bird, Lyft, Uber, and Razor are parked along the main path. People can even rent tiny electric bikes from a company called Wheels.\n\nJohn Heinkel, a professional repo man with a full head of graying hair and a small and scrappy build, hoists a Lime scooter on its back wheel, setting off the alarm underneath the scooter\u2019s brake. Heinkel muffles the annoying sound with his hand.\n\n\u201cYou want to throw a couple?\u201d he offers at one point, gesturing toward the dumpster, halfway jokingly.\n\nDan Borelli, his business partner, says that towing scooters is no different than writing parking tickets. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just grabbing scooters off the street and throwing them in a yard,\u201d Borelli insists. \u201cWe write a parking ticket for every single one we have.\u201d\n\nThey say that they have impounded thousands of dockless e-scooters around San Diego\n\nTogether, the two men run an operation called ScootScoop. They say that they have impounded thousands of dockless e-scooters around San Diego on behalf of business owners and landlords who are fed up with the deluge of dockless two-wheelers.\n\nScootScoop is a simple, low-budget concept, making use of a tow yard and flatbed truck that Heinkel already owns. Their advertising is word-of-mouth. They have no employees and no outside funding. But they seem to pose an existential threat to the multibillion-dollar scooter industry.\n\nFirst came the lawsuits. Heinkel and Borelli are accused in a lawsuit filed in California Superior Court in late March of improperly impounding Bird\u2019s scooters and then ransoming them back to the $2 billion company. Lime filed a nearly identical suit soon after.\n\nThe same companies that had raised hundreds of millions of dollars working around any local permits or regulations are now demanding protections under the California Vehicle Code, asking a judge to intervene and save their dockless scooters from ScootScoop. Depositions are scheduled to take place at the end of July.\n\n\u201cThe people of San Diego are being bamboozled by a local tow company scheme,\u201d Bird\u2019s press team says in an emailed statement. \u201cScooter Removal aka ScootScoop, orchestrated by Talon Auto Adjusters,\u201d the name of Heinkel\u2019s repossession business, \u201cis unlawfully impounding micro-mobility devices and demanding a ransom for their return.\u201d\n\nRansom is a word \u201cthat we don\u2019t really particularly like,\u201d Borelli told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a fake bully word that\u2019s been made up to make our character look worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fake bully word that\u2019s been made up to make our character look worse.\u201d\n\nThen came the chargers, or the freelance contractors who work in the cutthroat industry of charging scooters with low batteries. (Lime calls its contractors \u201cjuicers, while Bird calls them \u201chunters\u201d). Heinkel and Borelli and one of their ScootScoop clients tell me that they\u2019ve recently caught juicers breaking into a ScootScoop impound storage unit, going after the Lime scooters specifically. The juicers allegedly became violent when confronted. (\u201cThis is a disturbing report and such aggressive behavior is never tolerated on the Lime platform,\u201d Lime said in a statement.)\n\nBut today, on this sunny afternoon in April, with scooters zipping by everywhere, it\u2019s hard to imagine how a device that was supposed to be fun and healthy took such a dark turn.\n\n\u201cTheir app specifically says you can ride it \u2018anywhere\u2019 and leave it \u2018anywhere,\u2019\u201d Borelli says as he pushes a Bird scooter through the Pacific Beach neighborhood. If he sounds slightly bitter, it\u2019s only because he owns a bike shop nearby and believes that dockless scooter companies are trying to steal his customers.\n\nNobody cares or tries to stop the men as they push the scooters along. There are too many scooters in circulation for anyone to miss these two. In fact, a few minutes later, a construction worker cheers Heinkel and Borelli on. \u201cThose things are annoying!\u201d he yells. \u201cThey started showing up at my house. I live in the suburbs, I was like...\u201d He shakes his head disapprovingly.\n\nBorelli says the experience is universal. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Where did they come from?\u2019\u201d\n\nLast April, Heinkel and Borelli met me on the boardwalk in matching blue collared shirts, with a crossed-out scooter embroidered on the left breast pocket, to demonstrate what it means to be a scooter-tower. They have dreams of expanding, perhaps by going to another city or working with investors. But for now, it\u2019s just the two of them in San Diego, working around 12 hours a day, seven days a week. They have small tow yards around town and a larger lot in the suburbs that is guarded by security cameras, dogs, and razor wire. They also rolled out an app that clients can use to order a tow.\n\nBefore scooters consumed his life, Heinkel, 55, specialized in hunting down cars and other valuables south of the border. Among the many items he has retrieved on behalf of banks and other clients over his 25-year career: a celebrity\u2019s yacht from Cabo San Lucas, a Hertz rental car that a Russian tourist left in Cancun, and a Ferrari that a con artist abandoned in Mexico City. He characterizes his repo work as a relatively low-risk job because he has the backing of the court system.\n\n\u201cI was good at the job of taking stuff from people in the middle of the night or during the day.\u201d\n\nHe started out as a young man looking for work after a stint in the Marines. \u201cI discovered that I was not really good at college,\u201d Heinkel says. \u201cI was good at the job of taking stuff from people in the middle of the night or during the day. I can speak, I can think. I realized that it comes down to the ability to de-escalate the problem. Because nobody\u2019s happy when you\u2019re taking their stuff.\u201d\n\nBorelli, 43, has 29 percent ownership of a bike rental shop in the neighborhood, just off the boardwalk. The first time he saw dockless e-scooters, around February or March of last year, they were brazenly left outside his store.\n\nBird, Lime, and their supporters believe that dockless electric scooters can help reduce car dependency. But to Borelli, it seemed that the scooter industry was really trying to replace bicycles. He threw the offending scooters in the dumpster, but they were quickly replaced by more scooters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to take away my customers on a daily basis,\u201d he tells me.\n\nThe two men hit it off last year after Heinkel took his daughter for a bike ride in the neighborhood. He needed to put air in her tires and walked into Borelli\u2019s shop. They eventually got to talking about the scooters that seemed to be taking over the boardwalk. Heinkel noted it wasn\u2019t really safe for him to let his two-year-old ride a bike there anymore.\n\nBorelli pointed out to Heinkel that he already owned a flatbed truck and a tow lot. The next step was obvious. Their first client was Borelli\u2019s frustrated landlord. From there, more business followed.\n\n\u201cWe did not seek anybody out, those property owners came to us,\u201d Heinkel says.\n\nFor the last 54 years, Jim Bostian has managed day-to-day operations at the Crystal Pier Hotel, a hotel property of small cottages built on top of a pier in Pacific Beach. The pier is smack dab in the middle of an especially touristy strip and has a driveway for hotel guests that feeds into the boardwalk.\n\nIn the midst of the scooter explosion, Bostian noticed that people were littering the hotel driveway with scooters, blocking guests from driving in and out. He\u2019s tried asking riders to move the scooters elsewhere. About half have agreed. The other half threw f-bombs.\n\nBostian says that he has nothing against scooters. He insists that he likes the idea of emissions-free transportation. But, like others in town, he\u2019s found that dockless scooters have a disturbing ability to reflect the ugliness in people.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care. I mean, they just don\u2019t care where they leave them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. I mean, they just don\u2019t care where they leave them.\u201d\n\nNot far away, a restaurant owner in Mission Beach tells me that she hired ScootScoop after riders started leaving scooters in front of a wheelchair lift that she built for her disabled customers, blocking access. And a federal lawsuit that a disability rights group filed against Bird, Lime, Razor, and the City of San Diego in January says that scooters are being left in front of wheelchair ramps, curbs, and crosswalks. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the scooters are a menace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve almost been knocked over several times,\u201d Alex Montoya, a San Diego-based motivational speaker who wears three prosthetic limbs, tells me. Montoya is the lead plaintiff in the disability lawsuit. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to eliminate the scooters. We\u2019re trying to make sure people ride them responsibly.\u201d\n\nOn July 1st, the City of San Diego implemented new regulations to address the scooter complaints. The regulations will require scooter companies to obtain insurance policies, free the city from all legal liability, cap speeds on the boardwalk, and obtain permits for every scooter in circulation. It\u2019s still too early to tell whether the new regulations will make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that people are still riding on sidewalks, we are aware that people are colliding into people and then taking off,\u201d San Diego Police Department Lt. Shawn Takeuchi says.\n\nBostian, the hotel operator, called ScootScoop last year after reading an article about them in a local newspaper. He tried contacting the scooter companies first, but says they never did anything about the scooters blocking his driveway. Since then, he\u2019s been happy with ScootScoop, and even let them keep some of the impounded scooters in a storage unit on his property.\n\nHe remembers they looked like they had been beaten up\n\nBut information about where the scooters are stored seems to have made it to the juicers \u2014the freelancers paid a small fee to find scooters with low batteries, charge them overnight, and then drop them back off in the streets. Bostian has noticed that some Limes have gone missing from storage, and he believes that juicers have been cutting the brake cables on scooters to free them from impound in the middle of the night.\n\nAbout a month ago, Bostian says that he caught a juicer red-handed, trying to walk off with a scooter that had already been impounded. Bostian ordered him off his property. They got into an argument, and then the juicer pushed him while he was walking away.\n\nA few weeks later, on June 22nd, Bostian came to work at 5:15 in the morning. Heinkel and Borelli were there, and they told him the police were on the way. He remembers they looked like they had been beaten up.\n\nWhen Heinkel and Borelli lead me on a scooter-towing tour, it takes about ten minutes to find a dozen or so scooters parked on a property belonging to a hotel owner they work with. They write \u201ctickets\u201d in their app, pick up the scooters, and bring them to their nearby tow closet. It\u2019s around noon, but dozens of scooters are already impounded, neatly organized by brand. Their larger lot in the suburbs, the one guarded with razor wire and dogs, holds the thousands of leftover scooters that Bird and Lime are refusing to pick up, on the basis that ScootScoop is demanding \u201cexcessive fees.\u201d\n\nHeinkel counters the charge is far lower than what tow companies typically ask for when they are towing cars. ScootScoop charges the scooter companies $30 for pick-up and an additional $2 for each day that the scooter is in storage, capping the daily fees off after a month.\n\nInitially, Bird agreed to play along, after ScootScoop had impounded 1,800 Bird scooters from July through November of 2018. When Bird finally showed up to collect them, it wasn\u2019t a contentious meeting. In fact, company representatives handed over a $40,000 check to cover the towing fees. Then they all took friendly pictures together.\n\nInitially, Bird agreed to play along, after ScootScoop had impounded 1,800 Bird scooters\n\nAfterward, Bird sent ScootScoop an invitation to invoice through Bird Pays, the app that the company uses to pay its contractors. In their lawsuit, Bird admits that it initially paid the $40,000 fee because the company was confused about its rights.\n\nIn hindsight, \u201cit looked like they thought we were going to go away, and we weren\u2019t going to do this anymore, so they tried to play nice guy with us,\u201d Borelli says. He submitted invoices, as instructed, but Bird never paid them again. So ScootScoop stopped releasing its scooters. Lime also discussed a possible settlement with ScootScoop, Borelli says, but never followed through.\n\nIn its complaint, Bird claims they have learned that ScootScoop is actually grabbing scooters from public sidewalks and other city property where they aren\u2019t authorized to do business. (Heinkel and Borelli dispute this.)\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 improper impoundment scheme has caused\u2014and continues to cause\u2014Bird harm,\u201d Bird says in its complaint. \u201cBird has suffered\u2014and continues to suffer\u2014lost business, not to mention reputational harm, from having fewer scooters in circulation.\u201d\n\nBird is demanding that ScootScoop stop doing business, release all Bird scooters, and pay Bird back four times the amount of the fees that they are attempting to bill Bird for the scooters. The company is also demanding punitive damages and \u201cany profits made by Defendants\u201d in the course of their entire scooter-towing career.\n\nBorelli says that the towing has hardly made a dent in the flow of scooters in town. \u201cThey have more devices out there than anybody possibly could think.\u201d (The City of San Diego does not have an official count of how many scooters are out in the wild because they are still reviewing permitting applications.)\n\nAs we walk toward the Pacific Beach boardwalk, a perfectly tan 20-something who looks like he is on his way to the gym passes by. Heinkel says the man works for Wheels and flags him down, to confirm that ScootScoop gets along with the young contractors who work for big scooter. \u201cKeeping it clean,\u201d the Wheels worker says of the scooter towers.\n\nBut not all of their interactions are so friendly.\n\nhe refused to back down and, as a result, was run over by the scooter\n\nOn June 22nd, hours before hotel operator Jim Bostian saw into the ScootScoop guys, Heinkel was at the Crystal Pier property in the middle of the night to pick up an order of shipping containers to use as security at his impound lots. He saw that two Lime juicers were already there. They had broken into his storage unit and were holding scooters, he says. Heinkel confronted them, trying to grab the scooters back. He says that one of the workers, a man who towered over Heinkel, punched him a few times. Then he got on the scooter and started riding it toward Heinkel, who says he refused to back down and, as a result, was run over by the scooter. Borelli, who showed up shortly after the fight had started, says he got sideswiped. In a video that Heinkel captured partially of the fight, a man\u2019s voice is heard saying that he works for Lime, and a Lime scooter is clearly visible in the video.\n\n\u201cWe are looking into the incident and will ensure this individual is removed from our platform, and we stand ready to support however we can,\u201d a Lime spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n(Lt. Takeuchi with the San Diego Police Department confirms that Heinkel filed a police report describing a fight over stolen scooters, but the report does not name a specific scooter brand.)\n\n\u201cAll over something that is $4.50 each,\u201d Heinkel says.\n\nHeinkel sounds confident that the new shipping containers will keep the juicers away for good. And neither he nor Borelli sound very worried about the lawsuit. They\u2019ve responded to Bird\u2019s lawsuit with a counter-complaint, and their attorney tells me that their defense will focus on private property rights because there is some ambiguity over whether scooters are considered vehicles under the California Vehicle Code.\n\nWhen I call them in July, Heinkel and Borelli say that they recently celebrated impounding their 10,360th scooter with some donuts and large coffees from 7/11. Then they got back to work.\n\n\u201cIf you take all the BS that they\u2019ve thrown out, and you take our BS, and you take it down, it\u2019s a very simple concept,\u201d Heinkel says. \u201cThey have taken their stuff and placed it on someone else\u2019s property without permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s them, and here\u2019s us. We\u2019re two guys who went to the property owners and got permission with that property owner to remove that stuff off their property. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d", "description": "A team of repo men are being targeted by the multi-billion dockless scooter industry for alleging \"impounding and ransoming\" electric scooters in San Diego, two companies Bird and Lime claim in a new lawsuit.
