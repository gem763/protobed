Not for this card, but shortly after. We'll speak to your man and then let you boys have some fun.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAli replies by saying: \"I'm f****** excited\" and laughing, while Hearn jokes \"get in the gym mate!\"\n\nBoth AnEsonGib and Jake Paul almost came to blows during the KSI v Logan Paul press conference, and it appears the two YouTube stars are desperate to get at each other in a fight.\n\nJake Paul spoke to Sky Sports and confirmed he is looking to settle matters with AnEsonGib despite some claiming he is trying to avoid the potential bout.\n\n(Image: Simon Dael/BPI/REX)\n\nHe said: \"The UK fans, KSI fans, they all say I'm ducking him, and my message to you is this guy sucks at fighting, I'm going to beat his a** one day and he's 5'8, got tired in five minutes in his last fight and punched himself in the face two times. What is this kid doing?\"\n\nAnEsonGib replied by saying: \"You can't run from big Gibber no more, I'm everywhere baby! That's all I've got to say.\"", "description": "With KSI vs Logan Paul set to take place in Los Angeles on November 9 Hearn is already thinking ahead to the next bout", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Simon Dael Bpi Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566805.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-v-Logan-Paul-2-Press-Conference-Troxy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
