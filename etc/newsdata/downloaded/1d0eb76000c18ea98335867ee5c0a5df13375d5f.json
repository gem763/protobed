Speaking before this weekend\u2019s race in Russia, the 21-year-old admitted his obsession with victory had overcome his control at Marina Bay. Ferrari have won the last three races and Lewis Hamilton warned in Sochi they hold the advantage as the season enters its final third.\n\nFerrari might have cracked it but F1 gimmicks get short shrift | Giles Richards Read more\n\nLeclerc won at Spa and Monza and was leading in Singapore when Ferrari\u2019s pit strategy helped enable his teammate, Sebastian Vettel, to take the lead and ultimately win. Leclerc was repeatedly vocal in his frustration on track, which he conceded was wrong.\n\n\u201cMy reaction was well over what it should be and that shows I\u2019ve still got a lot to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen again in the future. In the car it\u2019s always very difficult. There\u2019s a lot of adrenaline. I wake up in the morning thinking about victory, I go to sleep thinking about victory, so sometimes it might be hard.\n\n\u201cBut I need to control myself more and, how can I say it politely? Just shut up instead of speaking on the radio. I\u2019ll learn from it, and try for it not to happen again.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nFerrari were unexpectedly quick in Singapore, their car performing strongly through the slow corners, and appear to have made a real step forward. Hamilton, who leads the drivers\u2019 standings by 65 points from his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, and is 96 points ahead of Leclerc in third, said the Scuderia were on the front foot.\n\nSebastian Vettel wins F1 Singapore Grand Prix in Ferrari one-two Read more\n\n\u201cWe will not be favourites at the next six races,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how fast Ferrari have been on the straights, so for us there isn\u2019t a short-term fix, but there are other areas we can do better in.\u201d\n\nMercedes made the wrong pit call for Hamilton in Singapore and the world champion said his team needed to rediscover the form that took them to 10 wins from 12 races this season. \u201cAt the last three races, we haven\u2019t extracted 100%. That is what we need to get back to,\u201d he said.\n\nMercedes, he insisted, would continue in an incessant pursuit of improvement. \u201cEven if this weekend doesn\u2019t go as planned \u2013 and the long straights are likely to suit Ferrari \u2013 it is not going to change my opinion as to what we will achieve. We will make it difficult for every other team this year, next year, and potentially the years after.\u201d", "description": "Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc has said he needs to shut up over the radio after he reacted angrily to his team during the Singapore Grand Prix", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae38ff7fcd8da57f8e2d9d40f1805bf8a6c8609/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3266b0b257a5ed0b2f7a332e43f2bd3b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
