Pernod Ricard RI, -0.14% , the French drinks group under pressure from U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management to improve profit margins, announced plans at the end of August for a \u20ac billion share buyback program and new investments in China and the U.S. In July, Anglo American AAL, +2.56% announced announced plans to return $1 billion to investors via a buyback which it said reflected the \u201ccurrent levels of cash\u201d the London-listed miner was generating.\n\nMoody\u2019s said that after falling for two years in a row to \u20ac200 billion in 2017 from \u20ac232 billion in 2015, the cash holdings of the top 10 companies leapt by 30% in 2018 to \u20ac260 billion.\n\nSaudi Aramco was the region\u2019s largest holder of cash with \u20ac43 billion at the end of last year. The state-owned oil producer is preparing an initial public offering of up to a 5% stake by 2020-2021. The sale of the stake is part of a wider initiative by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the Saudi kingdom\u2019s oil-dependent economy.\n\nHowever, as of June 30 this year, Saudi\u2019s reported cash balance fell to \u20ac35 billion after a step up in dividend payments, narrowing the gap with the other top 10 companies.\n\nVolkswagen VOW3, +0.81% the German carmaker, had the second biggest cash pile, up to \u20ac37.5 billion in 2018 from \u20ac27.3 billion a year earlier thanks to a solid operating performance and lower payments in 2018 related to its diesel emissions scandal. Electricite de France EDF, +0.31% had the third biggest cash pile with \u20ac34.2 billion sitting on its balance sheet, compared with \u20ac28.3 billion the previous year.", "description": "European companies would rather hang onto their cash despite the low interest rate environment, as they delay making investments amid growing uncertainty...", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ759_ricard_ZG_20190905115719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
