For decades, people from Kenya have posed as Somalian refugees to take advantage of resettlement opportunities in the US and elsewhere. And CNN reports that middlemen collect large sums of money in order to bribe UN officials to make sure their clients have the best chance of being relocated.\n\nFor decades, the chaos in Kenya\u2019s troubled neighbor, Somalia, pushed wave after wave of refugees across the border. They came in buses, on donkeys, and sometimes by foot. But as the number of people moving to what was once the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Dadaab, Kenya swelled from thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands \u2014 there were many who registered as refugees who didn\u2019t qualify\u2026 All told, there are at least 40,000 Kenyans registered as refugees in the Dadaab camps alone, according to both UNHCR and government numbers, in what officials euphemistically term \u201cdouble registration.\u201d\u2026\n\nA UN spokesman told CNN, \u201cI am not aware of any Kenyans being resettled as refugees.\u201d Similarly, a spokesman for the US State Department says it has a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for such fraud. However, CNN identified several \u201cSomali\u201d refugees who are actually Kenyan and even quotes one anonymous individual who admits his father faked their identities in the 1990s to gain resettlement in the United States.\n\nA \u201cfacilitator\u201d who gets paid between $10,000 and $20,000 for every client he can help get resettled abroad, claims he has bribed corrupt UN officials for years to make sure his clients get approved.\n\n\u201cIt is at the very beginning of the process \u2014 before the applicant even gets to the US embassy vetting, the selection has been done at the UN level,\u201d said one facilitator who said he has been exploiting corruption within the UN to game the resettlement system for years\u2026 \u201cThe UN will know the criteria and make sure the paying clients match all the requirements. So, it can be cooked at the UN level,\u201d he said\u2026 \u201cBefore the Trump ban it was a booming business,\u201d he said. His business is now focused on other countries, where refugee resettlement quotas are higher. He said his last case was just a few months ago.\n\nThe story quotes a UN official who compares resettlement to \u201cwinning the lottery.\u201d That seems like an apt comparison, not just in Kenya but in Central America where we\u2019ve seen hundreds of thousands of people make a long journey to the US border, often with children, for a chance to claim asylum. Most of those people are coming for the same reason as the Kenyans pretending to be Somalian, i.e. they want a better life. And if all they have to do to get it is lie a bit about their circumstances, they\u2019ll do that. Our immigration system needs to account for the fact that, for a lot of people around the world, illegal immigration is playing the lottery.", "description": "\"Before the Trump ban it was a booming business.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/refugee-camp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
