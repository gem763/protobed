Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) went after CNN during their own debate, accusing the network of smearing her for being an Assad apologist and a Russian asset.\n\nGabbard said while Trump has \"Kurdish blood on his hands\" after pulling U.S. forces out of northern Syria, allowing Turkey to invade, so do politicians on both sides of the aisle. She also said the media, like the New York Times and CNN, are responsible for the \"regime change war\" in Syria.\n\n\"Not only that but, the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,\" Gabbard continued. \"Just two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I\u2019m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\"\n\nGabbard said that if she is elected, then she will end the \"regime change wars.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/15/2019 23:55:59PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/288/68d07494-0eec-4fba-ae0c-8bb8f1f924b6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
