When pressed again by BBC journalist Andrew Marr, Johnson added: \u201cThere was no interest to declare.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The authority said Friday it had a \u201cstatutory duty\u201d to record the matter because Johnson served as police commissioner during his 2008-2016 tenure as London\u2019s mayor.\n\nThe probe is the latest sign of animosity that has consumed British politics since the country narrowly voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Three years later, Britain and its politicians remain bitterly divided over how, or even whether, to leave the 28-nation bloc.\n\nJohnson took power two months ago with a \u201cdo-or-die\u201d promise that Britain will leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 \u2014 even if there\u2019s no divorce deal outlining Britain\u2019s commercial relations with the other 27 EU nations. His foes in Parliament are determined to avoid a no-deal exit, which economists say would plunge Britain into recession.\n\nIn unusually heated debate Wednesday, Johnson referred to an opposition law ordering a Brexit delay as the \u201cSurrender Act\u201d and said postponing the country\u2019s departure would \u201cbetray\u201d the people. He also brushed off concerns that his forceful language might endanger legislators as \u201chumbug.\u201d\n\nOpponents accused him of fomenting hatred in the country with his populist, people-versus-politicians rhetoric.\n\nAs tempers smoldered, Johnson rejected the notion that he himself had played a role in whipping up tensions.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been a model of restraint,\u201d Johnson said Sunday. \u201cBut I think everybody should calm down.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied wrongdoing over links to an American woman who allegedly received money and favorable treatment", "authors": ["Danica Kirka"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/boris_johnson_denies_wrongdoing_u.s._tech_entrepreneur.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C20px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
