Of the 193 matches, 79% of the hate crime incidents related to race.\u201d\n\nThe most common arrest type was for public disorder, with 524 arrests made last season, followed by 260 for violent disorder and 158 arrests for pitch incursions.\n\nChampionship side Stoke City had the highest number of supporters arrested (80) followed by Leeds United (49) and Aston Villa (42).\n\n\u201cThe latest Home Office statistics do not make for pleasant reading but to provide some context 62 of the 80 arrests were as a result of anti-social behaviour that occurred both during and after the Checkatrade Trophy fixture against Port Vale in December 2018,\u201d a Stoke City representative told Reuters.\n\n\u201cOf the other 18 arrests, only five of those were made at home fixtures at the bet365 Stadium.\n\n\u201cWorking in partnership with the police and authorities, we are continuing to do everything we can to try and eradicate anti-social behaviour from football.\u201d\n\nThere were also 1,771 football banning orders in force \u2014 down from 1,822 last season \u2014 but the number of new banning orders increased by 19%. Newcastle United have the most number of banning orders with 71 in force.", "description": "The number of soccer matches in England and Wales where hate crime incidents were reported increased by 47% in the 2018-19 season, a British government study published on Thursday said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431675925&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1LV", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
