It\u2019s not too late to show compassion,\u2019 Deborah Teazis said.\n\nTaking to the witness box to read a heartbreaking victim impact statement, Mrs Teazis said her family felt anger towards Lindholm.\n\nThe former stripper, 46, was found guilty of murdering her ex-fiance last month.\n\n'It's not too late to tell the truth': Family of murder victim confront Robyn Jane Lindholmin court on Thursday\n\nThe former stripper, 46, was found guilty of murdering her ex-fiance last month.\n\nThe sister-in-law of murdered man George Templeton, Deborah Teazis, leaves the Supreme Court of Victoria on Thursday. She stared down Robyn Lindholm and asked that she reveal where Mr Templeton's body is hidden\n\nShe is already serving time for the remorseless killing of another man in 2013.\n\n\u2018We accepted you into our family as George\u2019s partner,\u2019 Mrs Teazis said.\n\n\u2018We respected you as a human being.\u2019\n\nLindholm looked uncomfortable as Mrs Teazis called her out, but apart from a quick gaze maintained a steely stare forward.\n\n\u2018You have an opportunity to do something right and tell us where George\u2019s body is,\u2019 Mrs Teazis said.\n\nEarlier, the devastated family member had explained the importance of her strict Greek Orthodox family having a proper funeral and burial for their loved one.\n\nTempleton was 38 on May 2, 2005 when he disappeared from the Reservoir home, in Melbourne's north, that he shared with Lindholm and his teenage son.\n\nLindholm had been in a volatile, six-year relationship with the former crook who had been working hard to go straight as a carpet layer.\n\nTempleton was 38 on May 2, 2005 when he disappeared from the Reservoir home, in Melbourne's north, that he shared with Lindholm and his teenage son.\n\nBut she had also been in a relationship with another man by the name of Wayne Amey aka 'Batman'.\n\nThe pair decided Templeton needed to go.\n\nMrs Teazis pleaded with Lindholm to reveal to the family where the pair disposed of Mr Templeton\u2019s body.\n\n\u2018Give us some closure. Give us the right to say goodbye,\u2019 she said.\n\nOn the night he would vanish, witnesses claimed he had been happy and lovingly kissed Lindholm's wound after she burnt her hand.\n\nThe jury heard Lindholm made sure he got plastered drunk and likely helped him along with some sleeping pills.\n\nWhen she cooked up a reason to leave, Amey - assisted possibly by some mates - attacked Templeton on the couch.\n\nDetectives believe he was disposed of at sea.\n\nCrown prosecutor Ray Gibson QC told the court on Thursday it was an aggravating factor that Lindholm had had her lover killed in his own home.\n\nHe described it as a breach of trust and condemned her for covering up the crime for 14 long years.\n\n\u2018There is little scope for rehabilitation and a complete absence of remorse,\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Gibson said a life sentence was within range, but Justice Christopher Beale was quick to dismiss that suggestion.\n\n'It's not a submission I find attractive,' he said. 'I won't be imposing a life sentence, I'll be imposing a substantial sentence.'\n\nMrs Teazis described Mr Templeton as a loving father of two who was a hard worker and determined to care for his kids.\n\nHis son Ross had been in the home when his father was attacked and vanished.\n\nHe has suffered from \u2018survivor\u2019s guilt\u2019 ever since, she said.\n\nBoth he and his sister have struggled over the years with depression, grief and loss.\n\nMrs Teazis said her husband John - Mr Templeton\u2019s older brother - continued to suffer from nightmares.\n\n\u2018The mind plays tricks when it has no answers,\u2019 she said.\n\nMrs Teazis said the family had never given up on finding what happened to him that horrible night.\n\n\u2018We stayed strong,\u2019 she said. \u2018We made sure he was not forgotten ... he did not deserve to die in such a horrific way.\u2019\n\nRobyn Lindholm has dispatched several of her lovers and is considered an evil serial killer\n\nRobyn Lindholm is friendly with prison staff and known to chat with them happily and she is led to and from court. They know not to get too close to her because she is also deadly\n\nPolice believe Lindholm killed Mr Templeton so she could have an open relationship with Amey, whom she would later order be killed.\n\nHe stood in the way of her being able to pursue her relationship with the fit, sexy, leather pants wearing Amey \u2018 Mr Gibson said during her trial.\n\nPolice believe Lindholm killed Mr Templeton so she could have an open relationship with Wayne Amey (pictured), whom she would later ordered killed.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not too late to tell the truth. It\u2019s not too late to show compassion,\u2019 Deborah Teazis told Lindholm in court on Thursday\n\nOn Thursday, Lindholm\u2019s barrister John Kelly SC argued his client ought to get a discount because she was absent when the actual murder took place.\n\nShe had conveniently taken off with a friend in order to give herself an alibi.\n\nHe further suggested she had been a victim of domestic violence - a notion that was rejected by the judge.\n\nMr Gibson maintained it was Lindholm who orchestrated the murder.\n\n'We say she instigated this murder ... it was planned, premeditated and violent,' he said.\n\nPolice conceded months after Templeton disappeared that he may not have wanted to be found but held grave concerns because he had not used his mobile phone or bank accounts and had been looking forward to a prepaid Queensland holiday with Lindholm.\n\nPolice long suspected he had been murdered by Amey at the instructions of Lindholm, but the case went cold when Victoria Police's Missing Person's Squad was disbanded.\n\nAmey wouldn't live long enough to rat on her.\n\nHis body was found in central Victoria in December 2013; beaten and stabbed.\n\nTorsten Trabert and John Anthony Ryan were later found guilty of his murder after Lindholm confessed to police she had ordered him dead.\n\nLindholm was sentenced to 25 years in jail in 2015 over Amey\u2019s murder.\n\nShe quickly moved on from the world of men and took up a lesbian lover at Dame Phyllis Frost women's prison just outside of Melbourne.\n\nIf she couldn't get her hands on a man, well, a woman would do just as nicely, a source said.\n\nPolice also believe Lindholm may have been involved in the disappearance and murder of exotic dancer Shari Davison, 26, in 1995.\n\nLindholm was working under the professional name Collette at the same stripper agency, Simply Irresistible, as Davison before she went missing.\n\nIt's said they were close friends.\n\nIt was reported in The Age in 2016 that Templeton had been named at the inquest into the 1995 disappearance and murder of Davison as having at one time put a gun to a woman's head during a discussion about drugs.\n\nNot long after she vanished, Lindholm became an item with another soon-to-be dead identity: Alphonse Gangitano.\n\nAt best, Lindholm would have been eligible for parole in 2035.\n\nShe now faces even more time behind bars when she is sentenced on November 7.", "description": "The family of a man murdered by serial killer stripper Robyn Lindholm has begged her to reveal where his body is.", "authors": ["Wayne Flower In Melbourne"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/02/20111594-0-image-a-2_1571879749552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
