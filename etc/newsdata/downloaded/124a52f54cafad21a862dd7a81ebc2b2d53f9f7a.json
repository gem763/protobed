The NHS states: 'Eating fish is good for your health and the development of your baby, but you should avoid some types of fish and limit the amount you eat of some others.' The body state avoiding more than two portions of oily fish a week as it can contain pollutants like dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Tuna should also be limited to two steaks or four medium-sized cans per week because it contains mercury. Shellfish \u2013 including mussels, lobster, crab, prawns, scallops and clams \u2013 should always be eaten cooked and not raw when pregnant, as they can contain harmful bacteria and viruses that can cause food poisoning. Cold pre-cooked prawns are fine. Smoked fish, which includes smoked salmon and smoked trout, is considered safe to eat in pregnancy. It's fine to eat raw or lightly cooked fish in dishes like sushi, as long as any raw wild fish used to make it has been frozen first. This is because, occasionally, wild fish contains small parasitic worms that could make you ill. Freezing kills the worms and makes raw fish safe to eat. Cooking will also kill them. Sushi from shops should be fine to eat because the fish would normally have been frozen before preparation. Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and member of the British Dietetic Association, said: 'My advice to pregnant women would be to enjoy oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and pilchards no more than twice a week for the heart and brain healthy omega 3 essential fatty acids, in addition to white fish such as cod and haddock, which are excellent sources of protein too, within the context of a healthy and balanced diet.'\n\nBrain development takes place mainly in pregnancy, through complex biological processes such as the formation of cells and the pathways between them.\n\nOily fish contain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are nutrients thought to play a fundamental role in these processes.\n\nDr J\u00falvez said: 'Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are the main omega-3 PUFAs involved in neurological development, and seafood is the main source of both of them.'\n\nThe NHS urges pregnant women to avoid more than two portions of oily fish a week as it can contain pollutants like dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).\n\nTuna intake should also be limited to two steaks or four medium-sized cans per week because it contains mercury, officials say.\n\nNichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and member of the British Dietetic Association, said the findings are not strong enough to warrant change in UK guidelines.\n\nShe told MailOnline: 'Although this was a fairly big study, it was conducted in Spain, and in general Spanish diets are very different to those in the UK. The data was also self-reported, which in itself could have flaws.\n\n'The authors of the study also warn that previous research have reported a link between the consumption of fish during pregnancy and childhood obesity and increased blood pressure.\n\n'My advice to pregnant women would be to enjoy oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and pilchards no more than twice a week in addition to white fish such as cod and haddock, which are excellent sources of protein.'\n\nThe researchers focused on attention function because attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) is common at school age.\n\nA person with ADHD is less able to sit still, follow directions or concentrate. A possible cause, according to the Mayo Clinic, is problems during key moments of development in the central nervous system.\n\nAround five per cent of children in the UK and US are believed to have ADHD.\n\nThe researchers also found genetic variations affect how well children can process fatty acids, and hence develop healthy attention spans.\n\nDr J\u00falvez said: 'Children with, for example, the rs1260326 CC genotype - which has been associated with lower PUFA levels - had worse attention scores if their mothers had not eaten much seafood during pregnancy.\n\n'But their outcomes improved if their mothers consumed more seafood.'\n\nThe team insist on the need for more research on this subject to determine exactly which species of fish and what quantities may be beneficial to foetal development.\n\nThe findings were published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.", "description": "Fatty or 'oily' fish, such as salmon and mackerel, is the most beneficial, according to the study in Spain.
