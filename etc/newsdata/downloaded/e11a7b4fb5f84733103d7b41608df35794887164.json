Back comes the reply: \u201cGood work but take some of the potatoes off and add some more broccoli. You\u2019re smashing it. Have a great evening.\u201d\n\nAt another top club there is an academy player who doesn\u2019t think the meals at the club provide the right nutrition (he is right). He gets up early to make his own lunch, packs it up and takes it to training. The coaches routinely mock him, calling him the \u201cfucking packed lunch boy\u201d, and they encourage his fellow players to hide or take his lunchbox. He tops all of the club\u2019s fitness tests.\n\nThe first player is now fully contracted and a standout performer, while the second had to battle against negative cultures right at the start of his career when he should have been in an environment that would inspire him. He has now left the game.\n\nKearnan Myall: \u2018Several England players I know dread training camp\u2019 Read more\n\nThose two stories and many similar ones were at the forefront of my mind as I read Robert Kitson\u2019s brilliant interview with Kearnan Myall.\n\nThese cases might sound unconnected to Rob\u2019s piece but they serve as an example of just how vital it is to provide an environment that gets the best out of those within it. Do that and the results will come as a ripple effect. Still, so many clubs in all sports don\u2019t get that right. They try but they get it only partially correct. Metres run, tackles made, kilograms squatted, calories consumed, hydration levels met, hours of opposition analysis logged. They will get every ounce of energy from a player to maximise those returns but what about their psychological safety?\n\nNot a sense of false safety, that your door is always open as head coach but if I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m hearing then there will be another door leading you to your exit. Not a coach high-fiving you down the corridor and sending you late-night messages telling you how much they value you after you put in a man\u2011of\u2011the\u2011match performance, then later that month ignoring you as you walk down that same corridor, because you missed a tackle in the last game. And not a coach who calls one of the management at 11pm and tells you to have a presentation prepared for a 7am meeting. You do it but not to the level the head coach wants, and he stops you after a few seconds, berates you and cancels the meeting.\n\nThese are not made-up stories, just the thin end of the wedge and they are just the printable ones to give you a flavour. But valuing the psychological safety of a team or how happy they are isn\u2019t sufficiently prioritised and certainly is not measured, so in many cases it simply is not managed. I have talked about this with some head coaches and I can see in some of their eyes they think it\u2019s all a pile of shit. \u201cHappy clappy\u201d I think one director of rugby called it once. They totally miss the point, just as they will ultimately miss their team goals and in the future, I hope, miss their jobs as they are flushed out of the system. They confuse framework with processes.\n\nCreating clear boundaries in behaviour isn\u2019t suddenly redundant if you want to listen to a player or give them more autonomy. Being on time, being off your phone at team meals, cleaning the changing room, helping the kit man \u2013 all of these things are part of a team\u2019s clear behaviours that form your guardrails for culture. But within those guardrails, it is vital to treat people well, consistently. Listen to understand, not to answer.\n\nStop the suffering and ditch the lip service to mental health in sport | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nUnfortunately there is a tendency in professional sport for those at the top to feel they must behave in a certain way, so others clearly see they are in charge. The professional game has never been harder. On the field we all know the physical commitment it now requires. Away from the echoes of the stadium on match day is a daily struggle for many.\n\nYou grow up dreaming of being a professional. You often sacrifice your education and future financial wellbeing to make the grade. Then you get there and it\u2019s nothing like you thought. You fall in line because speaking up will make it worse. Your love of the game decreases. Your mental wellbeing nosedives. You look for other escapes. You look to self-sabotage and give yourself and others an excuse to be deselected. This used to be a rarity and, in the amateur game, you had other distractions and the head coach had lower pressures. Your bills were paid via other avenues. You looked forward to playing at weekends with your mates in a sport you loved.\n\nThe finances may have changed but that feeling still exists at some of the best sports clubs in the world. I\u2019m lucky enough to see it in the consultancy work I do now. At the best places they embrace the individual and put their happiness first. Perhaps the rest need to pack up their lunch and go on that journey, too.", "description": "The mental wellbeing problems highlighted by Kearnan Myall recently are rife in rugby and other elite-level sport \u2013 a cultural shift is badly needed", "authors": ["Ben Ryan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e41519c94d5fad684abc47323c3754d6d1cc956c/0_212_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c7571026a1ff9dcce92e583553b72664"}
