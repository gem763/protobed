The New Zealand native found that the entertainment scene in Los Angeles left him feeling unfulfilled creatively, and he began arranging flowers and selling bouquets from his 1980 Volkswagen van in Venice Beach.\n\nFalls, 30, now owns his business, The Unlikely Florist, and has more than 31,000 followers on Instagram, where he showcases reclaimed wood in his arrangements and uses his flowers as \u201cunlikely\u201d garnishes in cocktails. Falls designs floral arrangements for weddings and events, but he also offers readymade arrangements on his website, which range from $75 to $180, or flower subscriptions that start at $45 for a bi-weekly subscription. He also creates bespoke \u201cfloralierre\u201d lighting fixtures with plant materials, which start at $1,000. He is known for his organic, overgrown designs, including a moody wall of roses that graced Kim Kardashian\u2019s cover of Vogue India in 2018.\n\nFalls, who is working as a partner with Tanqueray gin to create botanical cocktail recipes, spoke with Penta about his favorite places and things.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is\u2026 I\u2019d have to say Venice Beach. It\u2019s the neighborhood I know the best, the one that has taught me the most and I\u2019m so grateful to its community for the support it\u2019s shown me as I\u2019ve taken on this venture, albeit accidentally.\n\nThe one thing in my kitchen I can\u2019t live without is\u2026 probably my cast iron pan. I can saut\u00e9 with it and roast with it, and it only gets better with time.\n\nI always travel with\u2026 overalls are key, many pockets, my Olympus film camera, a notebook, some headphones, and a stash of various sunnies.\n\nMy favorite scent is\u2026 that\u2019s a difficult one. I love the scent of wax flower, lavender, Sandalwood, White O\u2019Hara Rose. There\u2019s too many to think of really. In fact, I\u2019m currently workshopping a fragrance.\n\nThe thing I always do when I have guests over is\u2026 I always have drinks ready to greet them. I\u2019ll typically have Tanqueray and tonics ready in Copa glasses with whatever combination of fresh fruit I\u2019m feeling like serving for the garnish that day. Though being a bit of a showman,\n\nI leave the garnish creation to when they arrive so they get the full experience.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by\u2026 Alejandro Mias. He\u2019s a Spanish painter with an incredible eye for perspective and composition.\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 Michael Chabon\u2019s The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. It\u2019s just an epic tale of two cousins and their journey through life predominantly in New York City. It\u2019s a period piece and Chabon does a great job of intertwining his fiction with real historical events.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is\u2026 I have a real love for doing things that benefit my community. That may sound broad or abstract. However, I know how great it makes me feel when I put my time, energy, and resources into something like a \u201cJazz Night\u201d and then see the response from those that attend. Their appreciation to have something so fresh and unique in their backyard is all I need to motivate me to put in the time and do it all again.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again\u2026 I\u2019m a real sucker for Spain. I can\u2019t get enough of the culture, the people, the food, and the language. I\u2019ll go back there time and time again.\n\nThe next destination on my travel itinerary is\u2026 I\u2019m actually really happy to be home right now [in Venice Beach]. Though, there are a few places I\u2019ve been giving thought to\u2014besides going home to New Zealand and back to Spain, I\u2019d say Japan is knocking.\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is\u2026 I get up every day just to smell the flowers!\n\nThe restaurant in my hometown that I love to take a visitor is\u2026 Five Loaves in Herne Bay, Auckland, has the best eggs Benedict.\n\nA person who inspired me to do what I do is\u2026 my parents are a great inspiration to me. My mum is incredibly creative and my dad is the hardest worker you\u2019ll ever meet. I try to incorporate those characteristics in how I carry myself and in my work.\n\nIf I could have a drink with anybody, anywhere, it would be\u2026 perhaps Richard Branson on that Island of his. I met him once years ago and we had some great chats.", "description": "The 30-year-old New Zealander loves art by Alejandro Mias, all things Spain, and eggs Benedict in Auckland", "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120014/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
