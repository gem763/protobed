Enter Crawford, who takes Gillies on a road trip to learn about local artists past and present.\n\nThe road trip begins at Crawford's home in Penticton, B.C., where every inch of wall is covered with Canadian art.\n\nMany of Crawford's pieces are found at thrift stores and auctions, including a photograph by famed Armenian-Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh, whose iconic profile shots include Winston Churchill and a young Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe duo then head to the coast, where Crawford takes Gillies to a thrift store in Victoria and shows him some of the tricks of the trade when it comes to finding quality art in bargain shops.\n\nGillies sees the grave of famous local painter Emily Carr and meets award-winning Canadian artist Michael Morris.\n\nThe duo then travel north on Vancouver Island to Duncan, known as the City of Totems, to try to solve an art mystery.\n\nCrawford has a small oil painting on cedar and is looking for someone who can help him identify the Indigenous woman depicted in it.\n\nThe painting has what Crawford thinks is the name \"Mrs. Affleck\" scrawled on it and, with the help of some locals, the mystery unravels:\n\nIn the fourth film, the friends head to the mainland and meet Wade Baker and his family in North Vancouver.\n\nBaker is a Coast Salish carver, designer and sculptor and direct descendent of Third Lieutenant Joseph Baker, mapmaker on the HMS Discovery captained by George Vancouver in the late 1700s.\n\nBaker and his wife Mary Tasi are authors and art historians and share stories with Crawford and Gillies:\n\nThe fifth film follows the men as they visit Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Parisa Azadi to discuss her work and that of other Canadian women.\n\nThe final film spotlights the influence of contemporary and historical women artists and the stories they have told through their work:\n\nAll five films in the Art is A Story series are permanently available here.", "description": "The documentary film series Art is a Story follows art historian Paul Crawford and filmmaker Stuart Gillies on a road trip as they learn about local art and artists, past and present, across the province.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266006.1567187885!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/art-is-a-story.JPG"}
