Some progress has certainly been made over recent years in improving connectivity to the farm, but there is still a long way to go before connectivity across the farm is improved to the standard required,\" Keogh said.\n\nHe noted that the Australian and state governments' mobile black spot programs, alongside the deployment of the Sky Muster satellite service, \"still appears to be the best available option to increase regional access to the internet \u2014 at least to the farm\".\n\nSee also: Top 5 things to know about farm tech (TechRepublic)\n\nKeogh added that limited interoperability of different systems and applications also presents a continuing challenge. However, he noted the emergence of third-party monitoring and data systems are beginning to provide a solution, at least in the cropping sector.\n\n\"The emergence of an agriculture-wide digital platform that accommodates a variety of different systems and enables easy integration of data could reduce some of these concerns, and also reduce the risk of inadequate support services and unsupported orphan systems,\" he said.\n\nOn the point of data, Keogh believes the lack of portability of data from one system to another is harming the efficiency of farms. He has suggested the way around this would be to broaden the Consumer Data Right to include the agriculture sector.\n\n\"While there are no plans to include agriculture in this regime at present, the principals involved will likely be expanded in the future, with potential implications for those involved in the ag-tech sector,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, Keogh highlighted the importance behind ensuring that farmers do not get left behind, and that digital agricultural companies need to be aware of data rights and understand the rights customers hold over their data.\n\n\"It is essential to maintaining a competitive market for digital agricultural technology services that user agreements are expressed in very clear and unambiguous language, that data rights are spelled out unambiguously, and that as a matter of principle, that there should not be unnecessary barriers preventing farmers moving their data to another service provider,\" he said.\n\nDuring his speech, Keogh also took the opportunity to highlight how the way public and private sector cooperate in agricultural research and development (R&D).\n\n\"My personal view is that public sector agricultural R&D agencies and universities in Australia are actually quite poor at transitioning R&D insights into commercialised products and services that are ready for adoption by farmers,\" he said.\n\n\"There is room for significant reform in this regard, starting with reducing the complexity and timescales associated with negotiating public and private sector collaborative research efforts, and removing some of the administrative deadweight that discourages cross-sectoral collaboration.\"\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Connectivity, interoperability, data portability, and data rights are hindering how agricultural businesses adopt digital technologies.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/10/1798548e-b6aa-4038-8e0b-e1707a45e32d/thumbnail/770x578/9a2e68651821d01bcc523e2fa779f6d3/farmtech011618-still002-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
