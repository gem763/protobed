REUTERS/Baz Ratner\n\nThe port, built in 1895, is the main trade gateway for the Eastern Africa region, serving Kenya and seven neighbours, including Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\nThe investment is driven by growing demand for imported cargo in the region, where most economies are growing by at least 5% per year, said Daniel Manduku, the managing director of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA).\n\nExports make up just 15% of the cargo that goes through Mombasa every year, with a third of the total belonging to neighbouring countries, while Kenya, the region\u2019s biggest economy, takes up the lion\u2019s share.\n\nAnnual cargo traffic through the port is projected to jump to 47 million tonnes in 2025 from 32 million tonnes last year, Manduku said in an interview at the port.\n\n\u201cWe are currently undertaking major expansion programmes... We are trying to be ahead of the game.\u201d\n\nThe volume of cargo handled is expected to rise to 34 million tonnes this year, including 1.4 million 20-foot containers. Popular imports include clinker for cement manufacturing, steel, fertiliser and grains.\n\nThe European Investment Bank and French development agency AFD have offered to finance the modernisation of the berths at commercial rates, Manduku said.\n\n\u201cWe think it is something we should consider, as opposed to normal commercial bank loans,\u201d he said, adding that work will start in mid-2020.\n\nMombasa port, ranked Africa\u2019s fifth busiest according to the KPA after Morocco\u2019s Tangier Med, Egypt\u2019s Port Said, South Africa\u2019s Durban and Nigeria\u2019s Lagos, wants to rise to number three, Manduku said, without giving a timeframe.\n\nKPA is spending an additional 39 billion shillings to build a new oil terminal, to replace its existing facility that dates back to 1968.\n\nChina Communication Construction Co. is the contractor for the project, which will triple the port\u2019s annual capacity for oil and liquid gas to 1 million tonnes.\n\n\u201cThe demand for liquid oil is high,\u201d Manduku said, adding the facility could also help with Kenya\u2019s crude oil exports.\n\nBritain\u2019s Tullow Oil and partners, including the Kenyan government, are expected to make a final investment decision on crude oil production from fields in the far northern county of Turkana next year.\n\nCurrent investments by KPA are part of a 310 billion shilling ports investment program, aimed at boosting annual capacity to 110 million tonnes by 2040, Manduku said.\n\nThis includes 55 billion shillings for building three berths at a new port in Lamu on Kenya\u2019s northernmost coastline, close to the Somalia border.\n\nConstruction is expected to be completed in the next year and 10 foreign firms, including from Singapore and China, have expressed interest in running the new port by leasing it from the government, Manduku said.\n\n\u201cWe are thinking of giving it to a private sector player on a concession model,\u201d he said.\n\n($1 = 103.4500 Kenyan shillings)", "description": "Kenya's port of Mombasa will spend 20 billion shillings ($193 million) to modernise four berths to handle both container cargo and goods not packed in containers, the head of the state port operator said.", "authors": ["Duncan Miriri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444409989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0H6-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
