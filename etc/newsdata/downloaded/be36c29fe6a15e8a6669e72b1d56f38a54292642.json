But he also said he agreed with his surviving son Brandt, who amid extraordinary scenes in court in Dallas on Wednesday offered forgiveness to former police officer Amber Guyger.\n\nAmber Guyger: ex-officer sentenced as murdered man's brother urges healing Read more\n\n\u201cI felt the same way as Brandt,\u201d Bertrum Jean told CNN. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve extended that same courtesy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to see her rot in hell. I don\u2019t want to see her rot in prison.\u201d\n\nGuyger shot Botham Jean dead last September, after entering his apartment thinking, she said, it was hers on a lower floor and he was a dangerous intruder. The 26-year-old accountant was sitting on his couch, eating ice cream.\n\nGuyger, 31, was fired by Dallas police. Convicted of murder, she received a 10-year sentence. The maximum sentence available was 99 years. Prosecutors had asked for 28 years, based on the age Jean would have attained had he been alive today.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, Brandt Jean, 18, told Guyger: \u201cI forgive you \u2026 I don\u2019t even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you. Because I know that\u2019s exactly Botham would want you to do.\u201d\n\nHe then asked permission to embrace Guyger, and did so. Film of the moment went viral. The judge in the case, Tammy Kemp, embraced Guyger and also gave her a Bible.\n\nAsked on CNN what allowed him and his son to be so forgiving, Bertrum Jean said: \u201cThat\u2019s what Christ would want us to do. If you will not forgive, neither will your Father forgive you.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see her rot in hell. I don\u2019t want to see her rot in prison. I hope this will help her to change and recognize the damage, the hurt that our family\u2019s going through.\n\n\u201cSo I wish her well and I will pray for her family and pray for her as well.\u201d\n\nAsked about the sentencing, he said: \u201cWe expected a conviction, and I felt the sentence may not have been sufficient based on the crime. I think it could\u2019ve been a little more. But the jury has spoken.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Crump, an attorney for the Jean family, said he had not seen anything similar in a courtroom.\n\n\u201cThis was an extraordinary moment from an extraordinary family,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a very godly family and what Mr Bertrum and Brandt were talking about was her internal grace, even though Alison, the mother, has expressed that there must be worldly consequences.\u201d\n\nCrump said the case was historic, as it was believed to be the first time a white female police officer has been convicted of murder for killing a black man.\n\nFurther controversy was sparked, however, when it emerged that the judge, Tammy Kemps, also embraced Guyger after the jury had left, and gave her a copy of the Bible, recommending a verse.\n\nOn Thursday, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a secular Wisconsin-based advocacy group that challenges religious displays in government, accused her of proselytizing from the bench. The group filed a complaint with a Texas state agency that investigates judicial misconduct.\n\nMeanwhile, like many others in recent years, the case sparked protests about police treatment of black Americans. Dallas county district attorney John Creuzot said he had expected a longer sentence but he respected the jury\u2019s decision.\n\nBertrum Jean told CNN that Botham had been \u201ca gentle giant, because of his size. But he was so soft. He just embraced everyone.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Bertrum Jean says \u2018I don\u2019t want to see her rot in prison; I will pray for her\u2019 after Botham\u2019s brother Brandt hugged Guyger in emotional courtroom scene", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc32601adb003fde422301b86b1cf799167d984e/0_0_3318_1991/master/3318.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b77b32d07f9e3b34acc09311d3acb098"}
