REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nCompared with the deal his predecessor Theresa May reached last year - which parliament rejected three times - Johnson\u2019s deal aims for less regulatory alignment with the EU, and greater trade barriers between Britain and its largest trading partner.\n\nJohnson now faces a fight to convince parliament, where his Conservative Party lacks a majority, to approve the deal in a vote due to take place on Saturday.\n\n\u201cEven if Boris Johnson does manage to close the deal, investor celebration of this might soon be dampened by the recognition that this is a fairly hard Brexit,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, a fund manager at Janus Henderson.\n\nBritain\u2019s finance ministry and almost all external economists have forecast that increased trade barriers will cause the British economy to grow more slowly than if it were to stay in the EU, and the damage increases as trade barriers rise.\n\nBased on what was known of Johnson\u2019s plans last week, UK in a Changing Europe estimated that they would make Britons more than 6% poorer on a per capita basis than staying in the EU - equivalent to 2,000 pounds ($2,570) per year in the medium term.\n\nMay\u2019s deal would have reduced income by just under 5% per head, while a so-called no-deal Brexit - which would leave Britain trading purely on World Trade Organization terms - would lower incomes by just over 8%.\n\nAnand Menon, UK in a Changing Europe\u2019s director, said the estimates did not need to be changed significantly after Thursday\u2019s deal. He expected Johnson to push back against the \u2018level playing field\u2019 requirements on regulatory alignment that the EU wants in a close future trading relationship.\n\nBy contrast, the opposition Labour Party has said it would seek a closer trading relationship with more alignment with EU rules on the environment and worker protections if it was in charge of talks after Britain left the EU.\n\nBritish finance minister Sajid Javid rejected attempts to show Johnson\u2019s deal would have a bigger hit on the economy than May\u2019s one, saying it was \u201cself evident\u201d that it would end the uncertainty that has held back company investment.\n\nJavid, speaking to reporters in Washington, also said Johnson\u2019s plan offered more promise for striking trade agreements with countries around the world because of the more distant proposed relationship with the EU.\n\nIf Britain leaves the EU on Oct. 31, as scheduled, Johnson\u2019s agreement ensures a transition period lasting until at least the end of 2020 during which there will be no big economic change.\n\nThis period can be extended until the end of 2022, while Britain and the EU negotiate a new trade arrangement with fewer shared rules and new restrictions on cross-border trade in goods and services.\n\nFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nFinancial markets have reacted positively to the deal, as it lowers the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut Dean Turner, an economist with UBS Wealth Management, said that although it might give a brief fillip to British growth, there was too much uncertainty about the longer-term trading environment to revive moribund business investment.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be getting the flags out just yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we will see a little bump in activity, but not anything that will be meaningful enough to get the UK out of a weak growth trend.\u201d\n\nThe Centre for European Reform estimated that Britain\u2019s economy was already nearly 3% smaller than it would have been if it had voted to stay in the EU in June 2016\u2019s referendum.\n\nWhile the bulk of the Johnson deal was seen as largely the same as that agreed between the EU and May, analysts noted that May\u2019s aspirations for a close future trading arrangement had been watered down in the political declaration accompanying it.\n\nWhereas the May version aspired to \u201cas close as possible\u201d a future trading relationship with the EU, that line was replaced by merely \u201cambitious\u201d in the revised text.\n\n\u201cTheresa May\u2019s deal would have ended up in a softer arrangement than just a free trade agreement,\u201d Alex Stojanovic of the Institute for Government said.\n\n\u201cThis government appears to want an FTA and that is very different: that means there would still be regulatory barriers particularly in goods between Great Britain and the EU.\u201d\n\nRachel Kent, a financial services lawyer at Hogan Lovells, said the original political declaration already tied regulatory alignment to market access in a future UK trade deal with the EU, Britain\u2019s biggest financial services customer.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks past The Gherkin and other office buildings in the City of London, Britain November 13, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nBut the revision made this more explicit, she said. British regulators have said they do not want to become \u2018rule takers\u2019 rather than rulemakers after Brexit, increasing the chance of divergence and barriers between British and EU financial services markets.\n\nStojanovic added that Britain\u2019s new freedom to sign its own bilateral trade deals around the world was unlikely to offset the lost economic activity.\n\n\u201cIf the UK did a deal with everybody ... it would benefit in 15 years the UK GDP by 0.2%. Most free trade agreements do not benefit GDP very much.\u201d", "description": "Britain will be on course for more distant economic ties with the European Union, making the country poorer, if Prime Minister Boris Johnson wins parliamentary backing for the Brexit deal he clinched with Brussels on Thursday.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442056536&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1TL", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
