Supplied.\n\nAudit firm tenure and the quantum of fees arising from audit and non-audit services are traditional fodder in this discussion, as are interpersonal relationships that may arise between an audit client and an audit firm if former partners or staff are employed by an entity they previously audited.\n\nThese issues are covered in detail in ethical standards, and firms are required to observe these in the conduct of their practices while also being required by law and ethics to comply with audit and accounting standards.\n\nEnforcement by firms themselves, professional bodies and, indeed, the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), become the critical elements in pulling errant practitioners into line.\n\nWhat is less clear to an outsider is what happens if non-compliance is detected in the context of an audit engagement.", "description": "ASIC will sharpen firms' focus on audit quality if it begins to send more auditors to the disciplinary board when breaches of auditing rules are uncovered.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.2156%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bbd727f340ef67b11df91e66ad6bc2926b56873e", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
