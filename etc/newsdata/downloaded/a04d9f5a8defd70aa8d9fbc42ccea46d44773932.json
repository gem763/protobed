Volker's testimony came as House Democrats probe allegations that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nHere are three takeaways from Volker's opening remarks to the trio of House committees leading the impeachment inquiry:\n\nBiden's name never came up?\n\nVolker told lawmakers that he had no idea Trump or Giuliani were specifically seeking an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. He said the president never mentioned Biden's name in their conversations, nor did Giuliani specifically talk about the former vice president.\n\n\"As you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion,\" Volker told the lawmakers.\n\nThat may be true, but Giuliani had made it clear to Volker that he wanted the new Ukrainian government to state publicly that it would investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had ties to Hunter Biden. And Volker acknowledged he was aware of \"public accusations\" against the vice president.\n\nThat's because Giuliani had spoken publicly about his campaign to get the Ukrainian government to provide damaging information on the Bidens as early as May 9, when the New York Times published a story detailing the former New York mayor's efforts.\n\nBiden a 'man of integrity'\n\nVolker flatly contradicted Trump and Giuliani's assertions that Joe Biden engaged in unethical or illegal activity.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have repeatedly argued that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to thwart an investigation into Burisma, the Ukrainian company linked to his son Hunter Biden.\n\nGiuliani has said Shokin's ouster benefited Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board of directors \u2013 a post for which he was paid $50,000 a month.\n\nVolker told lawmakers that Giuliani appeared to be getting information from unreliable sources about Shokin, Biden and Burisma, and Volker never believed there was any wrongdoing.\n\n\"I have known former Vice President Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me,\" he said. \"I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country.\"\n\nVolker's choice: 'do nothing, and allow this situation to fester; or try to fix it'\n\nVolker said he realized that U.S.-Ukraine relations were in jeopardy because of Trump's negative perception of the country, which he believed Giuliani was fueling. Trump was refusing to schedule a meeting with Zelensky, and he'd ordered a freeze on U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"It was clear to me that we had a growing problem in the negative narrative about Ukraine ... that was impeding the development of our bilateral relationship,\" he told the impeachment investigators on Thursday. \"I therefore faced a choice: do nothing, and allow this situation to fester; or try to fix it. I tried to fix it.\"\n\nThat meant connecting Giuliani with Ukrainian officials. Volker said he introduced them only after a top adviser to President Zelensky, Andrey Yermak, asked him to do so.\n\nHe said he \"made clear to the Ukrainians, on a number of occasions, that Mayor Giuliani is a private citizen and the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and that he does not represent the United States government.\"\n\nBut that initial connection grew into a broader effort by Volker and other diplomats to get the Ukrainians to make a public statement about Zelensky's willingness to probe Burisma and the 2016 presidential election. Text messages that Volker shared with the House committees show State Department officials believed Trump would only agree to a meeting with Zelensky if he made those commitments publicly.\n\nYermak, Zelensky's aide, eventually told Volker that demand was untenable.\n\n\"I agreed \u2013 and further said that I believe it is essential that Ukraine do nothing that could be seen as interfering in 2020 elections,\" Volker said. \"It is bad enough that accusations have been made about 2016 \u2013 it is essential that Ukraine not be involved in anything relating to 2020.\"\n\nThe plans for a Zelensky statement were shelved. And Volker's efforts to repair U.S.-Ukraine relations did not work out as he'd hoped.", "description": "Volker's opening statement to lawmakers offers a remarkable account of the tightrope that Volker walked in dealing with the president and Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/03/USAT/1a8f6d91-0998-4eaf-9998-dc45d78c0005-AP_Trump_Impeachment.JPG?crop=1767,994,x521,y124&width=1675&height=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
