Per 100g: Calories, 318; saturated fat, 23.5g; protein, 0.7g; sugar, 0.5g; salt, 6.25g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: This is plant-based, making it dairy-free and suitable for vegans.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: It\u2019s made with coconut oil, water, starch, flavouring and carrot juice concentrate (for colour) to mimic a hard cheese.\n\nCoconut oil is very high in saturated fat. In fact, despite being vegan, this cheese contains more saturated fat than full-fat dairy Cheddar, with around a third of the recommended daily limit per matchbox-sized 30g portion.\n\nHowever, some say the saturated fat in coconut oil is less harmful than other forms, as it boosts levels of the \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol, HDL. But this still only makes it \u2018less bad\u2019 than other types of saturated fat.\n\nThis cheese is also extremely salty, with 1.9g salt per portion \u2014 more than in five small bags of ready salted crisps, and nearly a third of your daily maximum.\n\nOn the plus side, it\u2019s fortified with calcium for strong bones and teeth and has added vitamins D and B12. These are important for a healthy immune system and useful additions for vegans who get little or none of these two nutrients in their diet.\n\nTaste: Like coconut, rather than cheese, though the texture is akin to a real Cheddar.\n\n1/10\n\nLO-COL\n\n\u00a32.30 for 195g, waitrose.com. Per 100g: Calories, 400; saturated fat, 5g; protein, 22.5g; sugar, trace; salt, 1.75g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: Made with vegetable oil in place of milk fat, this also contains plant sterols \u2014 compounds found naturally in small amounts in grains, nuts and pulses that have a structure similar to cholesterol, so they lower cholesterol by competing with it for absorption in the gut.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Levels of total fat, calories, protein and calcium in this Cheddar-like cheese are similar to the real thing, but it has 75 per cent less saturated fat as it\u2019s made with fat-free milk.\n\nThe maize oil used to replace the milk fat is high in plant sterols, but you\u2019d need to eat 65g of the cheese daily, in two matchbox-sized portions (to reduce cholesterol absorption at two meals), to properly harness their effect.\n\nThat\u2019s 260 calories out of the 2,000 or so required by the average person a day. But, even in smaller amounts, it\u2019s a healthy alternative to Cheddar if you\u2019re concerned about heart health.\n\nTaste: Similar to a typical Cheddar.\n\n9/10\n\nEATLEAN PROTEIN\n\n\u00a34 for 350g, tesco.com. Per 100g: Calories, 169; saturated fat, 1.3g; protein, 37g; sugar, trace; salt, 2g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: It\u2019s much lower in calories and fat, including saturated fat, than standard Cheddar.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Like Cheddar, this contains just milk and salt, but zero-fat milk is used to make it (and the milk fat isn\u2019t replaced with any other fat source).\n\nThe maker focuses on the higher protein content of the cheese \u2014 removing the fat from milk concentrates the protein.\n\nThere\u2019s 11.1g protein in a 30g portion, versus 7.6g in standard Cheddar, but it is the nearly 95 per cent lower saturated fat content and 60 per cent fewer calories that are more significant.\n\nRemoving the fat also means the calcium content is higher than normal, as there is no calcium stored in fat.\n\nA 30g serving has 298 mg (42 per cent of your recommended daily intake), compared with 222 mg in standard Cheddar.\n\nA small 30g chunk provides 0.6g salt (10 per cent of your daily limit), which is a little higher than the 0.54g average found in standard Cheddar.\n\nTaste: Rubbery and no good for melting.\n\n7/10\n\nBIOTIFUL DAIRY KEFIR QUARK\n\n\u00a32.69 for 400g, ocado.com. Per 100g: Calories, 68; saturated fat, 0.2g; protein, 12.8g; sugar, 3.5g; salt, trace\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: Kefir is milk fermented with a specific \u2018kefir\u2019 culture of gut-friendly bacteria and yeasts to help with healthy digestion.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Although it\u2019s officially a cheese, because the liquid whey is separated off during its production, quark is actually quite close in texture to a thick Greek yoghurt.\n\nThis version, which is made with skimmed milk, is waistline friendly and has probiotic (healthy bacteria) cultures that can be good for the immune system and might help keep gut trouble at bay.\n\nYou could eat it like yoghurt with fruit or use it to make tasty savoury dishes, such as a creamy tomato pasta.\n\nOne 160g serving contains 20.5g of appetite-curbing protein (about 40 per cent of the recommended daily intake) and a quarter of your daily calcium needs. It\u2019s free from added salt, too.\n\nTaste: Mild and creamy.\n\n10/10\n\nARLA LACTOFREE MATURE CHEDDAR\n\n\u00a31.89 for 200g, waitrose.com. Per 100g: Calories, 416; saturated fat, 22g; protein, 25g; sugar, trace; salt, 1.8g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: It is made with a lactose-free milk.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: A cheese such as this will ensure you don\u2019t get gut symptoms if you are intolerant to lactose (milk sugar).\n\nIt won\u2019t help if you have an allergy to the protein parts of milk though, and it has just the same amount of saturated fat, calories, salt and calcium as Cheddar.\n\nIn any case, people who have only a mild lactose intolerance can often cope with the small amount of lactose in standard Cheddar. They may even want to actively keep some lactose \u2014 below the level that causes symptoms \u2014 in their diet.\n\nThis will help ensure that some lactase \u2014 the enzyme that breaks down lactose \u2014 is still produced and so prevent them from losing their ability to digest the sugar completely.\n\nTaste: Nice and mellow.\n\n5/10\n\nCICIONI FERMENTED NUT CHEESE\n\n\u00a38.50 for 160g, planetorganic.com. Per 100g: Calories, 426; saturated fat, 5.1g; protein, 16.7g; sugar, 0g; salt, 1.47g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: It\u2019s free from dairy.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: This unusual, Italian-made product is the result of fermenting cashews and almonds to make a semi-firm octagonal-shaped \u2018cheese\u2019 that\u2019s suitable for vegans and people with dairy intolerances or allergies.\n\nIt has the nutritional attributes of nuts, rather than cheese \u2014 so, while it will provide zinc (needed for cognitive function), iron (important to help red blood cells carry oxygen around the body, reducing tiredness) and essential fatty acids (mainly omega 6s, needed for cell growth and development), it won\u2019t provide as much calcium as dairy cheese.\n\nNon-dairy cheeses also don\u2019t have naturally occurring vitamin B12, which is vital for releasing energy from food and keeping the nervous system healthy.\n\nThis has more calories and less protein than full-fat Cheddar, but it\u2019s more than 75 per cent lower in saturated fat and has around 18 per cent less salt.\n\nTASTE: Bland with a crumbly texture.\n\n4/10\n\nPRIMULA LIGHT\n\n\u00a31.50 for 150g, iceland.co.uk. Per 100g: Calories 169; saturated fat, 6.1g; protein, 13.9g; salt, 1.5g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: It\u2019s lower in fat than hard cheese.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Made with 50 per cent cheese, plus skimmed milk and whey powder, this squeezy cheese may be a bit plasticky.\n\nHowever, it is a good source of calcium, with 17 per cent of the recommended intake in a 25g squeeze (enough for a small slice of bread). Nevertheless, it contain less calcium than Cheddar does.\n\nThe saturated fat content is more than a third lower than in full-fat Cheddar, and the salt content around a sixth lower.\n\nTASTE: Savoury and cheesy.\n\n5/10\n\nLOW LOW GRATED CHEDDAR\n\n\u00a31.65 for 160g, ocado.com. Per 100g: Calories, 302; saturated fat, 14g; protein, 28g; sugar, trace; salt, 2g\n\n\u2018HEALTHY\u2019 BIT: This is a semi-skimmed version of cheese.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: This grated cheese is made with semi-skimmed milk, producing a version of Cheddar that\u2019s around 35 per cent lower in saturated fat and 10 per cent higher in protein.\n\nCalling it Low Low is a bit misleading, though, since a 30g serving (two rounded tablespoons) has 21 per cent of a woman\u2019s daily limit of saturated fat and 10 per cent of the daily salt limit.\n\nHowever, this still offers a saving of around a third of the calories and saturated fat in traditional cheddar \u2014 and grating cheese makes it go further.\n\nIt\u2019s a great source of calcium, with a 30g serving providing more than a quarter of your daily calcium needs. It\u2019s also an overall healthier option if you keep your portion size in check.\n\nTASTE: Not as flavoursome as a full fat Cheddar but melts OK.\n\n6/10", "description": "Dietitian Helen Bond tests whether the new 'super' cheeses, that are billed as being able to lower cholesterol and are even suitable for lactose intolerance, are worth a slice of the action.", "authors": ["Helen Bond For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19710028-0-image-a-2_1571085866867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
