Especially when you thought that you were truly, madly and deeply in love with each other. And when you realise that there is no way you can salvage the relationship, the pain of breaking up would be akin to that of getting a limb severed from your body. So, how do you cope with this seemingly unbearable pain?\n\nDon't try to suppress the negative emotions. It's okay if you feel angry, humiliated, hollow, desperate and utterly directionless. These feelings are likely to come and go in a cycle. Give in, for the time being. The storm within is bound to subside after a while. Time does heal wounds.\n\nTry to get rid of anything that reminds you of your ex. The first thing to do, stop checking up on him on social media. Block him, if you must.\n\nYes, you need alone time to recover. But try avoid being on your own all the time during this phase. Be with your family or close friends. Let people in, don't withdraw into a shell.\n\nDon't put your travel plans on the back burner just because you are used to travelling as a couple. Make a plan with your friends. Involve yourself in planning a fun trip, maybe to a place you haven't yet explored.\n\nFeeling hurt and lonely can take a toll on your health. So, no matter how lethargic you feel, take good care of yourself. Eat well and don't quit exercising. Pamper yourself as much as you can. You cannot be careless about your own well-being.", "description": "If you have been in a long term relationship, breaking up with your beloved can tear your heart into pieces.
