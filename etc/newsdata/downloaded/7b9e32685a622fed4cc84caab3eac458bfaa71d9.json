It would get repetitive if he wasn\u2019t so good at it\n\n\u2018I realise that this show is me complaining a lot,\u201d says Josh Widdicombe, \u201cbut that is what my job is.\u201d I\u2019m not sure \u201ccomplaining\u201d quite covers the possibilities of standup comedy. But it accounts for most of what Widdicombe does on stage. And it limits him: there are points in his touring show Bit Much when the peevishness feels mechanical, more affectation than authentic. A change of tone would be welcome. But then again, he does peevishness so very well. The show may be short on variety, but it\u2019s not short on laughs.\n\nNone of them are Widdicombe\u2019s: he raises barely a ghost of a smile throughout. Deadpan isn\u2019t the word, his protests \u2013 at vegetable delivery boxes, advent calendars, canapes \u2013 are too agitated for that. His voice escalates, higher and squeakier, with his alarm. But the unflickering expression \u2013 part sternly disapproving, part stupefied at the world\u2019s illogic \u2013 is part of the joke, too.\n\nHis gaze never elevates above the everyday, as driving tests, Deliveroo and \u2013 now he\u2019s a dad \u2013 baby monitors are given the observational comedy treatment. It\u2019s always a notch above \u201chave you ever noticed \u2026?\u201d, and at his best, The Last Leg man develops his irritation with the mundane into arresting visions, like the 2D baby detected by the 3D scan or the mass exodus from an overpopulated WhatsApp group, \u201clike when the Berlin Wall came down.\u201d One lovely routine on the opening hours of his local park makes not just hay but whole haystacks with the idea of \u201cdusk\u201d, while wielding the word itself, over and over, like the most ticklish of comic instruments.\n\nThere are big laughs, too, in his closing set-piece on weddings. But the returns \u2013 and the credibility \u2013 diminish as we realise the routine will work through every single wedding-day convention, expressing equal vexation at all of them. It\u2019s not the only instance where Widdicombe\u2019s exaggerated dismay feels too much like a professional requirement. But if now and then he\u2019s going through the motions, well, they\u2019re always very funny motions to go through.", "description": "The focus stays on the everyday as the standup works himself into a shrill rage.
