But a 5% growth in overall loans helped it overcome the impact of lower rates.\n\nAlong with that, strong performance in investment banking and equities trading boosted total revenue past Wall Street expectations.\n\nRevenue from investment banking fees jumped 40%, while consumer banking revenue rose 3%. The bank's equity trading business outperformed its peers with a 13% jump.\n\nNet interest income also came in higher at $12.34 billion and accounted for more than half of its total revenue.\n\nNet income applicable to common shareholders fell 21% to $5.27 billion, or 56 cents per share, hit by a $2 billion impairment charge. Excluding the charge, the bank earned 75 cents per share.\n\nRevenue, net of interest expense, rose slightly to $22.96 billion.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a profit of 51 cents per share and revenue of $22.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Anirban Sen in Bangalore and Imani Moise in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Sweta Singh)", "description": "The lender's shares rose 3% as consumer banking, BofA's biggest business, showed strength in the face of worries over slowing economic growth and added to signs from JPMorgan  and Citigroup  that U.S. household finances remained healthy.  \"In a moderately growing economy, we focused on driving", "authors": ["Anirban Sen", "Imani Moise"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W3zoZNR5PScHso08KDubxA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/c4f139a91caa5f714cde56671ec0e8a2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
