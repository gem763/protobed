The piece, \u201cEnigma,\u201d was also written for video artist Sigurdur Gudjonsson, a frequent Thorvaldsdottir collaborator, and will be expanded to be shown on planetarium screens. It will have its premiere at Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium in June. Just don\u2019t expect bright lights and laser shows; this work is a lot smarter and subtler than that, and far more static.\n\nThe images on screen, black and white and suspended for long periods, are truly enigmatic. We know only that they are enlargements of images captured through microscopic lenses. But because there was no way of knowing what exactly we were seeing, we were left with evocation and association: One looked like a moss-covered rock face, another, an aerial view of a landscape. Meanwhile, Thorvaldsdottir teases additional mystery from the strings, masking them until at times you\u2019d swear you were hearing electronic instruments, or a wind ensemble or percussion.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful work, not at all flashy, and a planetarium might be a perfect space for it: a room that is demarcated as a space apart from normal life. Like other pieces of Thorvaldsdottir\u2019s I\u2019ve heard, \u201cEnigma\u201d sits on the border between concert music and installation art; it marshals sounds in ways that have little to do with the conventional pathways of Western classical music.\n\nOpening with a low, whistling rumble, like white noise through a speaker, it hardly leaves any sound unmodified. Even the few pure notes it allows the violin are transformed into swallowed, stifled whispers by the end of a phrase. It\u2019s not something you want to describe using musical vocabulary; talking about col legno, the use of the wooden part of the bow to create a quiet, sexless sound, is less pertinent than comparing the experience of the piece to walking along a windswept seashore, looking at what the tide has exposed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe premiere was the finale of an appealing program which, according to quartet violinist Clara Lyon, was meant to evoke the experience of looking up at the night sky, studded with a range of disparate stars. The Chicago-based quartet juxtaposed, on the first half, music by Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria, the 16th-century priest-composer; Eliza Brown, also from Chicago; and Beethoven, represented by his final quartet, Op. 135. The quartet gave the latter an engaging reading: warm-blooded and communicative, emphasizing humanity over admiration of the Greatness of the Work.\n\nIn the prevailing spirit of the idea that engaging the audience is of paramount importance, Doyle Armbrust, the quartet\u2019s violist, wrote quirky, personal program notes encouraging nonmusical comparisons. (\u201cThis may be a good time to consider the last time you were struck dumb hiking the Grand Canyon,\u201d he wrote of the Victoria piece, an arrangement of \u201cO magnum mysterium,\u201d the composer\u2019s most famous work.)\n\n\u201cThis is all experiential music,\u201d Armbrust said from the stage, \u201cand however you choose to encounter it is the right way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI took him at his word more than he may have intended, since a child-care hitch meant that my 8-year-old, already in his pajamas, was my date for the evening, and we arrived in the middle of the Brown. My son pushed the concept of \u201cexperiential music\u201d to its limits, enthusiastically observing, in whispers and gestures, the way that Brown\u2019s first quartet went from passages of big engagement down to a tiny thread of sound. At least I can say with authority that the program was a fine point of entry for listeners of all ages.\n\nAD", "description": "Spektral Quartet takes on Anna Thorvaldsdottir\u2019s expansive piece in an appealing potpourri of a program.", "authors": ["Anne Midgette", "Classical Music Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B3UTs183eywmp9f90-DNzzdNw7w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6R7RVDH3H4I6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
