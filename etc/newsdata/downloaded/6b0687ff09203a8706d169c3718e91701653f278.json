Well, Lionel Messi for a start.\n\nOh, and the latest elite-level \u00addefender to come up against him, Thiago Silva. Both believe the Liverpool forward has reached the summit of the global game in 2019, and the stats back that up.\n\nLast season, Mane was voted the Reds\u2019 best attacking player by the fans after inspiring them to the Champions\u2019 League final and then starring in that showpiece.\n\nHe was man of the match against Tottenham , and also in the epic \u00addismissal of Barcelona in the semis.\n\n(Image: Soccrates/Getty)\n\nYet so far this season, his numbers are off the scale \u2013 an improvement on an already world class level in every single measurable indicator.\n\nLast \u00adseason Mane finished joint top scorer in the Premier League alongside team-mate Mo Salah and Arsenal \u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n\nBut he has improved from 0.6 to 0.7 goals per game, and reduced from 140 minutes per goal to 122 minutes this season.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t end there. His shots on target ratio is better, and his conversion rate has improved.\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\nRemarkably, Mane has also found time to \u00adimprove on his chances created for others too \u2013 an area where Salah, \u00addespite the talk of greed, has always been stronger.\n\nThe Senegal international\u2019s chances created per game has leapt from 1.3 last season to 1.9, while his successful dribbles has also glided gracefully past the previous season\u2019s \u00adlevels.\n\nSadio Mane - Selected stats Goals Per Game (PL only) 2018-19: 0.6 2019-20: 0.7 Minutes Per Goal 2018-19: 140 2019-20: 122 Chances Created Per Game 2018-19: 1.3 2019-20: 1.9 Key Passes Per Game 2018-19: 1.3 2019-20: 1.6\n\nThe question is, why?\n\nHow has he improved on an \u00adalready stellar campaign to get Messi suggesting: \u201cHe\u2019s so talented, he deserves to win the Ballon d\u2019Or.\u201d\n\nSilva, after facing him for Brazil \u00adduring the international break, agreed, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s world class, almost \u00adperfect, he deserves to be in the \u00addiscussion for the Ballon d\u2019Or.\u201d\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nBoth Messi and Silva were reacting to the surprising decision not to \u00adinclude Liverpool\u2019s best player in \u00adLiverpool\u2019s best year on the UEFA and FIFA best player lists.\n\nAnd yet Mane\u2019s reaction to missing out on both perhaps suggests why he has continued to improve this season.\n\nAsked about Virgil van Dijk and Salah getting shortlisted ahead of him this week, his reply was typical.\n\n\u201cI am happy for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is a reflection for the team. And I am more focused on trophies for the team than individual honours.\u201d\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThis current Liverpool side means so much to Mane, and allows his talent to flourish while still providing him with the privacy he craves.\n\nHe is a religious man, a family man, and he believes in helping others. When asked this week about a well publicised spat with Salah, after his team-mate didn\u2019t pass at Burnley , his response was perfect.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nHe explained: \u201cMo Salah asked me why I was angry, I said because we wanted to score more goals for the team.\n\n\u201cHe said he has nothing against me, and I know that. We talk on the phone sometimes, we text each other and we don\u2019t have a problem. So we talked, and everything was like before.\n\n\u201cWe talked between ourselves, and then the manager called me into his office and we spoke. I told him it was already sorted and he was pleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nJamie Carragher has likened Mane to John Barnes, saying: \u201cA world class wide player who is the difference now for Liverpool... And to be compared to Barnes shows how well he\u2019s doing!\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nRobbie Fowler, who played with Barnes, agrees and believes he is Liverpool\u2019s best player.\n\n\u201cYou put him ahead of Salah in terms of impact over the past year,\u201d said Fowler. \u201cHe\u2019s stepped up, proved the defining influence.\u201d\n\nYet Mane doesn\u2019t crave the limelight his success brings.\n\nHe is happy to be part of a successful team, happy that his talent can do good. In an interview with Canal+ Sport Afrique, he explained his logic.\n\n\u201cI enjoy being here, I enjoy being a part of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI am grateful I can put my heart and soul into it, and see the results for Liverpool. I remain humble about that, because I want to work every day.\n\n\u201cI am happy I can give back. I help people, I prefer to build schools and give food and clothes to poor people.\n\n\u201cWhy do I want 10 Ferraris 20 watches with diamonds and two planes, what would that do for the world.\n\n\u201cI went hungry, worked in a field, played barefoot and did not go to school. Today I can help people.\u201d\n\nIt is that philosophy which has taken Mane to the summit of world football, and could yet see his name on an important list on Monday.", "description": "As his form and statistics continue to improve, both Messi and Thiago Silva have backed Mane for the Ballon d'Or", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Soccrates Getty", "Wyscout Spa", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20393770.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-v-FC-Red-Bull-Salzburg-UEFA-Champions-League-Group-E-Anfield-21019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
