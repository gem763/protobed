At the moment where singer Chad Kroeger holds up a photo frame, the image was edited to show Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and a Ukrainian gas company board member, seeming to cast doubt on assertions by Biden that he never spoke to Hunter about his business overseas.\n\nHe accompanied the video with a line from the song: \"LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH.\"\n\nIt is not clear who made the copyright claim: it could be Nickelback, Warner Media Group (who have copyright over the video), whoever took the photo showing the Bidens, or somebody else altogether.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Twitter and Warner Media Group for more information.\n\nRead more: Here's who is in that photo from the Nickelback meme Trump tweeted to take a swing at Joe Biden\n\nBut it means that Trump's tweet no longer shows the video, and instead there is an alert: \"This media has been disabled in response to a report by a copyright owner.\"\n\nTwitter removed the video after a copyright claim.

Twitter/Donald Trump\n\nTrump shared the video at the height of his pushback against the impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats, which have also involved him publicly threatening the whistleblower and calling the investigation a \"hoax\" and \"BULLSHIT.\"\n\nThe inquiry is based on Trump's call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden, who is now his election rival in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump accuses Biden of trying to push out Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2016 over an investigation of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings, which Hunter was then on the board of.\n\nBut Trump's theories about Biden's actions have been debunked. Ukrainian authorities have said they found no evidence of lawbreaking by the Bidens.\n\nRead more: There's a glaring loophole in Trump and Giuliani's allegations of corruption against Joe Biden\n\nThe video began with a clip of Joe Biden saying he never discussed business dealings with Ukraine with Hunter, before cutting to the clip of the Nickelback video with the edited photograph.\n\nAlongside the Bidens were an unnamed man and Devon Archer, a previous business partner of Hunter who was on the board of Burisma before Hunter was invited to join.\n\nThis isn't the first connection between Trump and Nickelback.
