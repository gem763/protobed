Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.\n\nThere is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.\n\nMost candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some \u2014 including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.\n\nClimate Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency \u2014 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll \u2014 and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.\n\nAll the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it \u201cthe right beginning,\u201d while Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign website endorses it as a \u201ccrucial framework.\u201d\n\nBut the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it\u2019s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found.", "description": "Polls show Democrats broadly support liberal policies like the Green New Deal and an assault weapons ban.
