Daniel to a knee injury in the opening game of the season.\n\nOn the second play from scrimmage against Utah, Slovis took a shot in the chest from the 335-pound Fotu right after releasing a pass. Slovis stayed down after trying to get up. Medical staff came out to attend to him and he walked off the field under his own power.\n\nMatt Fink replaced Slovis and completed three passes on the drive, including a 29-yard touchdown to Tyler Vaughns.\n\nFink remained in for USC\u2019s second series and threw another TD pass.\n\nSlovis did not return to the sideline and USC spokesman Tim Tessalone said coach Clay Helton would update the quarterback\u2019s condition after the game.\n\nUtah also lost a key offensive player in the first half when Zack Moss went to the locker room with an undisclosed injury. Moss, the Pac-12\u2019s leading rusher, did not return for the second half. He had six carries for 20 yards after averaging 124.3 in the first three games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Southern California quarterback Kedon Slovis was knocked out of the Trojans' game against No. 10 Utah on Friday night after taking a legal but hard hit from Utes defensive tackle Leki Fotu.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/utah_usc_football_51528_c0-191-2355-1564_s1770x1032.jpg?e8a1ac1da2fdfdc299ddb12472fd73f55376042a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
