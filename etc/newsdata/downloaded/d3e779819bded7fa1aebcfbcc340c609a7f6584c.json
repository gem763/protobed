I am embarrassed because my family, friends and colleagues view me as a very intelligent person. I act like someone who has it all together, but deep down I feel otherwise.\n\nI have lived with my husband since 1998, first as boyfriend and girlfriend, then as partners. We got married in 2014. Over the years I have trusted him with money. Each of us has our own bank accounts and we do whatever. I have always have earned at least twice what he makes, but it has never been an issue, as far as I\u2019m aware.\n\nAlso see: A letter from a reader on the poverty line: \u2018I know what it means to go hungry for five days until you get your next paycheck\u2019\n\nI pay all the bills and take care of everything financially. But after all of these years, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in his bank account. I do know he is into stocks, but I am afraid to ask. On a few occasions I have asked that we talk about retirement and future money plans, and he has ignored me. I regularly forward him articles about money and retirement, etc., and he simply ignores them.\n\nI am starting to worry because we are almost 50 and have a 16-year-old child who is about to go to college. Should I continue trusting him or gather courage and just push the subject, risking a potential cold war that drags on for weeks?\n\nP.S. We struggle with communication in this relationship. I know he is a loner and a miser. He doesn\u2019t spend much.\n\nSilent Wife in Olathe, Kan.\n\nDear Silent,\n\nI\u2019ve had letters about husbands who were the main breadwinners keeping the family finances under lock and key, but I\u2019ve never had a letter from a wife who was the primary breadwinner whose husband kept her in the dark. It seems like a role reversal that benefits one party only: the husband. He is literally having his cake and eating it, and probably investing in the cake company and \u2014 who knows \u2014 freezing slices for a rainy day.\n\nIf your husband is willing to sit back and allow you to pay the bills \u2014 while he keeps his savings and investments a closely guarded secret \u2014 his problems go way beyond money. People will often get away with what they can get away with: You pay all the bills because you allow him to pay none of the bills. He keeps his finances a secret because you don\u2019t call him out and tell him to sit down and go through them like any other family.\n\nIf he were a house husband and you were the only breadwinner, that would be different. But even then you need be able to plan for the future. I don\u2019t know what goes on inside his mind that enables him to justify this kind of secrecy. Maybe he was raised to be king of the world and do as he pleases. Perhaps he levies a \u201cwage tax\u201d \u2014 you pay the bills because you earn twice his salary.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My mother has always lived off others and now she lives off me \u2014 she needs to sort out her life before I snap\n\nMost people are open about their finances, but money secrets are not that uncommon. Nearly 20% of people are keeping a savings, credit-card or checking account hidden from their live-in partner, according to this survey. Millennials (ages 18 to 37) are twice as likely to say they\u2019re hiding a bank or credit-card account from their partner (28% versus 15%). More than half of people who live with their partner say keeping a secret bank or credit-card account is as bad as cheating.\n\nRead MarketWatch\u2019s Moneyist advice column on the etiquette and ethics of your financial affairs. This week: \u2018I earn twice what my husband makes and pay all the bills, but have no idea how much money he\u2019s saved?\u2019\n\nIn remaining silent because you fear his reaction, you will not only condemn yourself to a lifetime of uncertainty, you may very well be jeopardizing your child\u2019s future education and your own retirement. Is this the kind of man you want to spend the rest of your life with? Do you know how many good, responsible, honest and open-hearted people out there would love to meet a woman like you? More than either of us could imagine.\n\nYour husband must start contributing to the family finances. Your child\u2019s college education and your desire to start planning for your respective retirements are both good places to start. This is non-negotiable. It\u2019s unhealthy to live with secrets. They too often lead to lies. In relationships and friendships, I have a series of red, white and \u2014 well \u2014 amber lines. Lying, lying by omission or keeping secrets is a red line.\n\nYou hold all the cards. It\u2019s time to see yourself in a position of power. If necessary, seek therapy and/or financial therapy to find your voice. Remember this: Life will be a lot more expensive for your husband without you.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
