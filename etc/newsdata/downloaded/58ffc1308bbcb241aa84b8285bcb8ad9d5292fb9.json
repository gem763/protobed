He probably did it in less than a minute,' Hopkins said Monday.\n\nA man took the $20,000 Salvador Dali 'Burning Giraffe' piece from Dennis Rae Fine Art\n\nThe 1960s hand-colored, limited-edition surrealist work, was stolen on Sunday afternoon\n\nThe California gallery has a video camera, but it wasn't on at the time of the 4.30pm incident, Hopkins said.\n\nHowever, surveillance video from the Handlery Hotel showed the man strolling down Geary Street with the artwork in his hand, KGO-TV reported.\n\nIt's reported a woman who was standing outside may have been been his accomplice.\n\n'They just popped into the gallery, probably distracting one of my coworkers,' said Angela Kellett, also a Gallery Director. 'It was our showcase item. We have a special Salvador Dali show right now and yeah they just ran off with it, too quick for anyone to do anything about it.'\n\nThe etching normally was secured with a tether, but it wasn't at the time of the theft, Hopkins said.\n\nKGO-TV said the etching would have been secured with a lock and cable that are missing and may have been cut off by the crook. But Hopkins said he doubted that.\n\nHe suggested the tether might have been removed a day earlier for a showing and not replaced.\n\nGallery says it was taken in 32 seconds, from an easel facing the front window of the store\n\nThe etching is normally secured with a tether, but wasn't at the time of the theft\n\nInterior video camera wasn't on at the time but the thief was seen on surveillance camera with a female accomplice who waited outside\n\n'They just popped into the gallery, probably distracting one of my coworkers,' said Angela Kellett, a Gallery Director\n\nAlthough art thieves sometimes have clients who pay for certain pieces, 'I think it was a theft of opportunity,' Hopkins said.\n\nThe etching was insured, he said. It was one of about 30 pieces on display for the gallery's ongoing Dali exhibition.\n\nHopkins said the etching is relatively rare. 'I'd say it's one of the most desirable pieces out of that period,' he added.\n\nIt is very well-known and is also numbered, Hopkins said.\n\nThat made it unlikely to be sold online, Kellett, told KGO-TV.\n\n'It's quite important as far as the period of etchings,' said Kellett. 'It's very, very well known. It's a beautiful piece. It was inspired by Picasso first.\n\n'I think that people would know. It's a very small edition of etchings, so the number, we know exactly what piece it is, so now it's a very hot item.'\n\nAnyone with information on the theft can contact police.\n\nThe thief was seen walking down Geary Street with the artwork after the incident", "description": "Video shows a woman waiting outside Dennis Rae Fine Art in San Francisco, California as the man takes the Salvador Dali etching valued at $20,000 in a mere 32 seconds", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19741796-0-image-a-5_1571145341748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
