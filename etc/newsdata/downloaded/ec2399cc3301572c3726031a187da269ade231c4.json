It was the biggest ever climate mobilisation, and it\u2019s only the beginning. The momentum is on our side and we are not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A climate protester in Wellington.

High turnouts were expected in Canada, where Greta Thunberg \u2013 who kickstarted the school strike movement with a solo protest in Sweden 12 months ago \u2013 was due to join demonstrators in Montreal.\n\nMay Boeve from 350.org, which has helped organise the demonstrations, said: \u201cWe will keep fighting until the politicians stop ignoring the science, and the fossil fuel companies are held responsible for their crimes against our future, as they should have been decades ago.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students on a Fridays For Future march in Kolkata, India.

This is our home.\u201d\n\nStrikes and demonstrations followed in scores of other countries from Ghana to Samoa, the Philippines to Indonesia, South Korea to Taiwan.\n\nIn some countries, protesters have had to go to extraordinary lengths to express their message to resistant authorities or an indifferent public.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A climate striker in Pushkin Square, Moscow, where protesters have found it \u2018almost impossible\u2019 to get permission for a mass demonstration\n\nMakichyan Arshak has been staging a solo school strike in Pushkin Square, Moscow, for 29 weeks.\n\n\u201cIn Moscow it is almost impossible to get permission for a mass demonstration so we protest in a queue. One person holds a poster for five minutes, then hands over to the next person who is waiting nearby. That way, we don\u2019t have any problems because it is a series of solo strikes rather than a group gathering,\u201d said the 25-year-old violinist, a graduate of the Moscow Conservatory.\n\nDemonstrations also took place across South America, from Mexico City\u2019s vast Z\u00f3calo square to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.\n\nOn Bogot\u00e1\u2019s high Andean plain, the environmental movement has faced a severe crackdown. In July, protesters across Colombia pleaded for an end to the violence that has resulted in numerous activists being killed, with the peace and development thinktank Indepaz putting the figure at 734 deaths in the first seven months of 2019.\n\nPlay Video 2:06 Greta Thunberg: the speeches that helped spark a climate movement \u2013 video\n\n\u201cWe want to keep fracking out of our country and demand an immediate change towards decarbonisation,\u201d said the activist Susana Muhamad, who was planning to march past the offices of the country\u2019s largest petroleum company, Ecopetrol.\n\nIn Brazil, organisers said there were climate protests in S\u00e3o Paulo and at least nine other cities. In Rio de Janeiro, a group of university students rallied in the city centre bearing banners urging: \u201cSystem change not climate change\u201d and chanted: \u201cWhat do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now!\u201d\n\nNayara Almeida, a 21-year-old student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said the group\u2019s demands to the government included greater protection of the Amazon rainforest. \u201cOur future is threatened and they are insensitive to that. We need politicians to make this a priority.\u201d\n\nThe global climate strikers say their action is a sign of the growing awareness and anger of the severity and scale of the climate crisis among people around the world.\n\nThis week Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people after the New York summit failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating.\n\nThe climate activist told governments: \u201cYou are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.\u201d", "description": "Week of strikes and demonstrations is \u2018only the beginning\u2019, say organisers", "authors": ["Matthew Taylor", "Jonathan Watts", "Kate Aronoff", "Nick Lowles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab96370425f47318ce3f077b1e8418964381f31/0_262_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a099a9a97f6852bd9f3adc18882845b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
