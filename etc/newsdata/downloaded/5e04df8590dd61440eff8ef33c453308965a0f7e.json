The DUP have 10 votes. The British parliament is due to meet on Saturday in an extraordinary session - the first such meeting since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nSterling slid as much as 0.6% to $1.2748, and also declined 0.5% versus the euro to as low as 86.81 pence, before steadying and recouping some of those losses.\n\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Kate Holton; editing by Andrew MacAskill)", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said it could not support the last-ditch Brexit deal being proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union, a serious blow to Johnson just hours before the bloc's leaders meet at a summit.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
