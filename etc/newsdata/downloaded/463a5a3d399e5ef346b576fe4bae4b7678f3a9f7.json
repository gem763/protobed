Millions of people have taken to the streets to demand wider democratic reforms.

Pictured, members of media (right) were hit by petrol bombs during a clash between protesters and police in Wai Chai on Sunday\n\n'Apple jumped into this on its own and mixed together business with politics and commercial activity with illegal activities,' People's Daily slammed the US tech company in a commentary\n\nBeijing has pressed companies including Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways to take the government's side against the protests, which are in their fourth month.\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHKmap.live allows users to report police locations, use of tear gas and other details that are added to a regularly updated map. Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.\n\nThe programme also has a web-based version.\n\nThe app's developers last week claimed that Apple had rejected the app during a reviewing process.\n\nThey said on Twitter the process had resumed after an appeal.\n\nHKmap.live is currently available in Apple's app store as pictured. Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.

Tech-savvy activists have been using software to organise rallies\n\nAsked whether the Chinese government had asked Apple to remove HKmap.live from its online store, a foreign ministry spokesman said he had no information about that.\n\n'What I can tell you is that these radical, violent crimes in Hong Kong have seriously challenged the legal system and social order in Hong Kong, threatened the safety of Hong Kong residents' lives and property, and undermined the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,' said the spokesman, Geng Shuang.\n\n'Anyone who has a conscience and justice should resist and oppose instead of supporting and indulging those actions,' Geng said at a regular news briefing.\n\nThe picture shows an icon of Apple app 'HKmap.live' which is designed by an outside supplier\n\nProtesters set barricade on fire at a demonstration in Causeway Bay district on Sunday\n\nThe demonstrations began over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include other grievances and demands for greater democracy.\n\nCriticism of Apple followed government attacks starting last weekend on the Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey's post in support of the protesters. China's state TV has canceled broadcasts of NBA games.\n\n'Apple jumped into this on its own and mixed together business with politics and commercial activity with illegal activities,' People's Daily said.\n\nThe newspaper warned Apple might be damaging its reputation with Chinese consumers.\n\nBrands targeted in the past by Beijing have been subjected to campaigns by the entirely state-controlled press to drive away consumers or disruptive investigations by tax and other regulators.\n\nYesterday, another Chinese state-controlled newspaper Global Times issued a stern warning to global brands in response to the controversy surrounding NBA and Daryl Morey, telling worldwide firms to stay away from politics.\n\nMr Morey on Friday tweeted 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong' before swiftly deleting the post and apologising to China.\n\nGlobal Times claimed it was 'ridiculous' to suggest that Mr Morey was entitled to free speech.\n\n'The incident shows an expanding worldwide culture gap,' it wrote.\n\n'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,' Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey (pictured) tweeted as he apologised to Beijing\n\nMorey's initial tweet included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong'\n\nChina has long been critical to Apple's business.\n\nThe mainland is Apple's second-biggest market after the United States, but CEO Tim Cook has said since 2013 it will eventually become No. 1.\n\nSales in China declined 4 per cent in the quarter ending in June, but that was an improvement over the 25 per cent contraction in the first half of its fiscal year.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) from the United States has been slammed in China after Houston Rockets' manager voiced support for Hong Kong. Pictured, two men sit outside an NBA store in Beijing, the capital city of the country proven to be a huge sports market\n\nAdam Silver, Commissioner of the NBA, has shown his support for freedom of speech amid the controversy surrounding a post by Daryl Morey regarding the demonstrations in Hong Kong\n\n'This recklessness will cause much trouble for Apple,' People's Daily said. 'Apple needs to think deeply.'\n\nApple also is an important asset to China.\n\nMost of its iPhones and tablet computers are assembled in Chinese factories that employ hundreds of thousands of people. Chinese vendors supply components for Mac Pro computers that are assembled in Texas.\n\nSupporters surround a police bus carrying political activist Edward Leung as it leaves the High Court in Hong Kong on Wednesday.

He appealed to the decision in a hearing.\n\nAs a prison service bus with mesh-covered windows drove 28-year-old Leung away after the hearing, supporters pressed up against the vehicle, briefly blocking traffic, and held five fingers up in their air.\n\nThat symbolises the five demands of Hong Kong's protest movement.\n\nThe fate of his appeal was not immediately clear.", "description": "Apple has become the latest firm targeted by China over products or comments related to anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
