Reboots are usually reluctant to do any actual writing until they have the entire original cast onboard, BuzzFeed has predicted the plot, and James Corden has hummed the theme song in a Jeep Wrangler with Adele. But now that Shannen with an E has finally signed on and the cast photo has gone viral, Anna is feverishly at work developing a script for the pilot. But the cast is way harsh about the first draft and scrambling because the shoot is fast approaching.\n\nLast week IZ was grabbed by his misogyny and taught that women are people, too, but there is just something about Anna: ambition? Brain? Lack of interest? Steve Sanders always liked someone who could cut him down to size (we don\u2019t tell lies), so we guess it\u2019s fitting that IZ is downright titillated by a woman who gives him the business. So much so that he decides to help Anna fix the show by sending her videos of the cast bickering behind the scenes as script inspiration.\n\nJason has nothing to do this week except rally the troops at his \u201cclub\u201d to work on the rewrite. That\u2019s enough for us, though, as it kept the gang together for the majority of the 44 minutes and held most of the extraneous characters and their plotlines at bay. Except BAG, of course, who is dealing with the fact that his wife is reeling from having her upcoming single leaked. The problem is that this is the premixed, pre-Auto-Tuned track. Like if Britney\u2019s vocals were released without Keri Hilson\u2019s vocals layered on top. The question mark is what blackmailing heathen would leak the track? Is it her stylist? Or is it perpetually creepy, all-access-pass Beautiful Boy?\n\nWhich brings us back to the thrills and chills that BH90210 has been trying to deliver all season. As expected, by the end of the episode, red herring BB is cleared as the track leaker, but ratted out as BAG\u2019s son thanks to Shay\u2019s private investigator. This reeked of \u201cYou ARE the father\u201d from the beginning, so we\u2019re glad for the reveal, Maury.\n\nDespite some of the clunky feminist logic of Ian embracing a more equitable workplace \u2014 by essentially doing the female head writer\u2019s job for her \u2014 we also got to spend more time with the women of BH90210 as a whole this week. Let\u2019s relish in that.\n\nGab, feeling out of body as she attempts to dip her toe in the lavender lagoon, is a living, breathing Andrea Zuckerman story line come to life. We are transported into her fever dream and once again find ourselves in a Bizarro Peach Pit sequence where Gab relives the sad, ostracized story lines gone by of Andrea. The witches from Macbeth mispronounce her name and remind her that she\u2019s just an urchin from Van Nuys. She pushes through to find her savior, Brandon Walsh, but really it\u2019s Christine Elise, n\u00e9e Emily Valentine, in Brandon drag. We are so here for Gab\u2019s continual queer evolution, which this week includes a few awkward almost-date moments with Fox exec Christine. But Gab worries that their lesbian connection might be less Cara and Ashley and more Rosie and Mo.\n\nJennie\u2019s wannabe actress daughter Kyler has returned, and it turns out she\u2019s a god-awful actress. Jennie and Tori don\u2019t know how to break the news to her, so they decide to cast her as Donna\u2019s daughter because that may require less acting, or less good acting at least? Consider us officially onboard with Kyler, who calls Ms. Spelling \u201cAunt Tori\u201d and later admits to slashing Jennie\u2019s tire in an attempt to get Bodyguard Wyatt to stay a little longer. Carrie Underwood taught baby girl so well.\n\nAnd of course Shannen\u2019s holding out boils over once more when she arrives at Jason\u2019s club looking like Carmen Sandiego by way of Linda Perry, still unsure whether it\u2019s spiritually sound for her to revisit her Beverly Hills roots. Only her iPhone meditation app can know for sure. When Christine reveals that Shannen held out so she could negotiate a better deal, the three other women saddle up to take her to task. When they find Shannen in her lanterned meditation room, Shannen\u2019s not chanting, but listening to the My Favorite Murder podcast. (She\u2019s hippie-dippie, but also into true-crime comedy, so multitudes!)\n\nThanks to Shannen\u2019s Eckhart Tolle vibe, the four women dig in to start healing nearly 30-year-old wounds that originated from the rumored mean-girl atmosphere on the original 90210 set. All the old \u201chigh school\u201d drama and resentments are rehashed in a woman-to-woman floor sesh: Shannen wasn\u2019t resentful of Tori\u2019s 56,000-square-foot family manse, or Jennie pulling out her hair and never getting any bad press for it, or Gab\u2019s talk-show deal (OMG how we watched Gabrielle). But she did throw a script at Jennie\u2019s head. Don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game.\n\nLucky for those of you who, like us, recorded the Beverly Hills, 90210 E! True Hollywood Story on a VHS, the women reconcile and the cast is complete! Ian effectively Cyrano\u2019d Anna into whipping up a brilliant revision (and in his car at that), and just in time because the shoot starts tomorrow.\n\nSo the pieces of this reboot seem to be falling into place \u2014 and by piece we mean hot piece Gab Carteris, who gets aggro enough to finally seal the deal with Christine. (Insert character actress of your choice screaming \u201cGay Rights\u201d here. Ours would be Mary Kay Place.) But the set quite literally all goes up in flames just as the cast slo-mo walks to the studio, ready to tackle the pilot. On the stage door, scrawled in murder-y red font, is \u201cStop acting like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d\n\nSo who is left to blame? Poolside blackmailer? Tori\u2019s wet-blanket husband, Nate? Is this the long-awaited cameo of Joe E. Tata? We\u2019d love for it to be the work of a woman, but we just don\u2019t see it. Whoever it is, we ask that you reveal yourself in episode five in time for Shannen to throw a script square at your head. Just beware, Ian may be taping the whole exchange as fodder for the next episode of BH90210.\n\nPeaches\n\n\u2022 We are swooning for Ian and Tori in their dark-rimmed glasses they wear while \u201cat the office.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Gab turned herself out.\n\n\u2022 Jennie gets in a quick sick burn when she mistakenly says Gab played her mom on the original.\n\nPits\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe real question is what is this thing about a dildo?\u201d If Gab Carteris was really exploring queerness like the eggheaded union boss we know her to be, she\u2019d be versed in the most basic of sex toys. At least give her \u201cstrap on.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The push and pull with Shannen has been dragged out over four episodes, so fingers crossed we get the Full Doherty in episode five.\n\n\u2022 Tori casually mentions that she\u2019s got feelings for BAG. We say yes, divorce your loser husband who\u2019s just dead weight, but don\u2019t shit where you eat. And certainly not where you\u2019ve already shat, Tor!", "description": "Ian Ziering is now the Cyrano de Bergerac of BH90210, and it\u2019s the wildest gift we\u2019ve ever received.
