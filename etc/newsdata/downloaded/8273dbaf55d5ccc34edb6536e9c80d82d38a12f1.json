Photo: Getty Images\n\nAs the criminal case against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein wages on, the New York Times has obtained a damning excerpt from She Said, a book by reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who first broke the story in 2017 about Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior. Among other details that the Times excerpted, Kantor and Twohey unearthed that Weinstein\u2019s short-lived adviser, victims\u2019-rights attorney Lisa Bloom, hatched a plan with Weinstein in late 2016 to discredit one of his most prominent accusers, Rose McGowan.\n\n\u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them,\u201d Bloom wrote in a memo to Weinstein, before outlining a plan for how to undermine and intimidate accusers, or make them look like liars. \u201cWe can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued,\u201d Bloom suggested for McGowan, \u201cso that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d As the Times notes, Bloom and Weinstein visited the newsroom a day before the first sexual-abuse expos\u00e9 against him was published in October 2017, where the duo tried to discredit other accusers \u2014 including Ashley Judd. Bloom would go on to quit as Weinstein\u2019s adviser, saying she \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d representing him.\n\nMcGowan, who has now read the Times excerpt, said in a statement to Variety that Bloom should be immediately disbarred. \u201cHer email is staggering. Staggering!\u201d she said. \u201cThis woman should never work again.\u201d Bloom has also tweeted an apology to the women she worked to discredit.\n\nWhile painful, I learn so much more from my mistakes than my successes.\n\n\n\nTo those who missed my 2017 apology, and especially to the women: I am sorry.\n\n\n\nHere are the changes I've made to ensure that I will not make that mistake again. pic.twitter.com/FSSl3qrFjQ \u2014 Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) September 8, 2019", "description": "In the new book \u201cShe Said\u201d about Harvey Weinstein and his alleged crimes, it\u2019s revealed that his lawyer, Lisa Bloom, actively worked in malicious ways to discredit accusers.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/09-lisa-bloom-rose-mcgowen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
