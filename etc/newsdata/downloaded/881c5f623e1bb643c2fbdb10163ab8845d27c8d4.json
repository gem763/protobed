Nikakhtar was nominated to head the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) by Trump in April and has been awaiting confirmation.\n\nNikakhtar has decided to return to her role as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Analysis \u201cwhere she will continue to advance the Administration\u2019s trade and national security policy priorities,\u201d a spokesman said. Nikakhtar was confirmed by the Senate for that position in March last year.\n\nReached by Reuters, Nikakhtar said she was \u201creally proud to have served,\u201d and committed to serving Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross any way possible. \u201cI am going to speak with leadership about how I can best serve the country,\u201d she added.\n\nThe BIS is at the forefront of Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which the United States started last year in part over allegations Chinese companies steal American intellectual property.\n\nAfter the U.S. government accused Huawei, the world\u2019s top telecoms equipment maker, of stealing U.S. technology and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, BIS put Huawei on a so-called entity list, effectively banning firms from selling U.S. goods to the Chinese company without special licenses.\n\nSince then, companies have submitted over 130 applications for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but have received no responses, even though Trump promised to allow some sales to the firm at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June.\n\nBIS was also leading the process of setting rules to make it harder to export certain critical technologies deemed essential to national security to countries such as China. Many companies are waiting impatiently for rule proposals to find out what technologies will be affected by the regulations.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said internal divisions at the bureau may have hamstrung Nikakhtar, known as a China hawk, as she sought to define policies.\n\nNikakhtar is seen as aggressively prioritizing national security concerns, which often put her at odds with industry, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, another person credited her with being very open to accepting meetings with the private sector.\n\nHer nomination faced headwinds early on. At a U.S. Senate banking committee hearing in June, two senators said they could not advance her confirmation until seeing a report she contributed to that said auto imports threatened U.S. national security.", "description": "President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee the U.S. Commerce Department's bureau that controls exports of technology to foreign firms, such as China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, said on Thursday she is renouncing her acting duties but has not withdrawn from the confirmation process.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
