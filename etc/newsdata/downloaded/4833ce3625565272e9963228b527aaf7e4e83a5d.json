That means all other phone makers combined accounted for only one percent of profits.\n\nJust two years ago, Chinese smartphone makers did not even come close to Samsung in terms of profitability. Apple enjoyed much the same distant lead, but Samsung accounted for 28.8 percent of global profits and the four Chinese manufacturers for a paltry 7.9 percent.\n\nBut Samsung wrote them off too fast as minor players interested only in selling cheap products in emerging markets. Instead, they added premium models to their lineup and produce hundreds of millions of handsets annually, posing an increasing threat to Samsung.\n\n", "description": "Samsung's Smartphone Profitability Falls Behind Chinese Rivals'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2018/09/17/2018091701338_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-17"}
