(Robert F. Bukaty/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nThere have been 22 shootings at U.S. schools in 2019 alone. Active-shooter drills are a back-to-school activity. America\u2019s children are under attack.\n\nAnd President Trump has moved to protect them by banning \u2026 flavored vape pods?\n\nApparently, it\u2019s a mint-flavored Juul that stands as the biggest threat to children today.\n\nOn Sept. 11, a day on which we memorialize lives lost to senseless violence, the administration announced plans to ban most flavored e-cigarettes after a rash of vaping-related lung illnesses claimed six lives. The exact cause of illness has yet to be pinpointed, but the looming threat apparently spooked the Trump administration into rapid action. As of this week, the Department of Health and Human Services is publicizing its intention to \u201cclear the market\u201d of flavored vapes, hoping to finalize a plan in the next several weeks that would likely go into effect a month later.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have our youth be so affected,\u201d the president said as he announced the new initiative from the Oval Office. Ah, the youth! They must be protected at speed! Six deaths and new policy is barreling down the tracks! Thank you for keeping our country safe!\n\nIt\u2019s something of a shock, then, to remember that this administration and the Republicans that back it can\u2019t even bring themselves to cast a sideways glance at a gun, even though firearms cause an average of 1,500 children\u2019s deaths each year. According to the University of Michigan, middle- and high-school-age children are now more likely to die as the result of a firearm injury than from any other single cause of death. Every day an average of 100 Americans are killed by guns. What about the youths affected by that?\n\nAfter last month\u2019s mass shooting in Odessa, Tex., (the third mass shooting in August alone), Trump told reporters that \u201cwe\u2019re looking at a lot of different things\u201d to control gun violence. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of different bills, ideas, concepts.\u201d Naturally, no legislation supported by Republicans has appeared \u2014 or is likely to. After all, Trump said two weeks earlier that there was \u201cno political appetite\u201d for banning assault-style weapons \u2014 in contrast to the enormous political appetite for going after marshmallow-flavored vape cartridges?\n\nTo be clear, e-cigarette danger is afoot. There\u2019s been a massive uptick in teen vaping over the past several years, and while it may help some adults quit smoking, it\u2019s clear that teens vaping for fun have picked up a foolish, addictive and potentially dangerous habit.\n\nBut common sense should tell all of us that there are bigger fish to fry. Too bad it\u2019s a message the White House refuses to receive.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: How many more names will be added to the list before Mitch McConnell acts on guns?\n\nAlexandra Petri: On giving up\n\nDayton\u2019s mayor: We owe it to mass shooting victims to take action on gun control\n\nRobert Gebelhoff: The e-cigarette hysteria is getting out of hand\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Everyone should be alarmed by the vaping crisis", "description": "Who\u2019s going to tell President Trump?", "authors": ["Christine Emba", "Columnist Focused On Ideas", "September At Pm", "Christine Emba Is An Opinion Columnist", "Editor For The Post.
