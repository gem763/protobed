But you don\u2019t have to buy a unit to get a positive cashflow,\" he said.\n\n\"House markets such as the Gold Coast suburbs of Carrara, Nerang and Pacific Pines are currently getting an average of 5.3 per cent gross yields.\"\n\nMr Dilleen, who has already amassed a $4.6 million property portfolio across NSW, South Australia and Queensland, agreed that there are many options in Brisbane to get cashflow properties.\n\n\"I recently bought a three-bedroom house on a 600 square metre block for $285,000 in Moreton Bay, 53 kilometres north of the Brisbane CBD,\" he said.\n\n\"This house was rented for $325 per week, so it was getting 5.9 per cent gross yield that covered all my expenses and earning me $63 per week on top. This was cashflow positive from day one.\"", "description": "Despite the slowing rental market and higher prices squeezing rental yields, investors are now seeing their cashflow improve thanks to falling interest mortgage rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7844%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_3277%2C$y_1239/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2877c4347119e41aca48770f615846eb0c1ffc45", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
