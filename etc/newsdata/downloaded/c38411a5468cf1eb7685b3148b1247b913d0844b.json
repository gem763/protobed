David Cicilline said talk of gun confiscation doesn\u2019t help the push to pass stronger gun control bills.\n\nThe Rhode Island Democrat was responding to a particular moment from this week\u2019s presidential debate when former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke called for a mandatory buyback of AK-style guns.\n\n\u201cI think that message doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. There\u2019s no proposal like that in the Congress.\u201d\n\nRather, he said, the focus for Democrats is on getting the Senate to take up their universal backgrounds check bill that passed on a partisan vote earlier this year. It would extend background checks to private sales, something conservatives feel goes too far.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell has shot down that particular bill, but is waiting to act on legislation until President Trump announces what he could support.\n\nCounselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that the president is considering a number of bills, including \u201clie and try\u201d that cracks down on those that put misinformation on forms when trying to buy a gun.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Conway noted the president is concerned that some measures to extend background checks could be used an a cover to try and enact buyback-types of laws.\n\n\u201cWere not going to allow bad actors who should not have firearms in the first place \u2026 to be the excuse that a bunch of liberals and socialists have to confiscate firearms from law abiding citizens who has legally procured them,\u201d she said on Fox News.\n\nDespite the blowback from both sides of the aisle, Mr. O\u2019Rourke doubled down on his position, saying fear of the NRA has paralyzed lawmakers in the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI think this just shows you how screwed up the priorities in Washington, D.C. are,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press. \u201cI refuse to even acknowledge the politics or the polling or the fear or the NRA. That has purchased the complicity and silence of members of Congress. And this weak response to a real tragedy in America, 40,000 gun deaths a year, we\u2019ve got to do something about it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
