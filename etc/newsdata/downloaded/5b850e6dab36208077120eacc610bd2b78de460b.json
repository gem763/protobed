REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\n\nMorales, 59, who swept to power in 2006 as the country\u2019s first indigenous leader, hailed the official result of Sunday\u2019s vote as another historic triumph for his leftist movement and accused the opposition, without evidence, of trying to stage a coup d\u2019etat with foreign backing.\n\nMorales faced a fifth day of street protests in La Paz and other cities that begun after an official quick count of votes was suddenly suspended on Sunday when it revealed Morales heading to a riskier run-off election against rival Carlos Mesa.\n\nA confident Morales said then his socialist party MAS would get an outright win as rural votes trickled in.\n\nThe tabulation of ballots at 100% on Friday confirmed his prediction, giving him a 10.57-point lead over Mesa, less than a point above what he needed to avoid a second-round vote.\n\nElection monitors, the opposition and some foreign governments criticized the election for lacking transparency.\n\nThe European Union, the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia called for Bolivia to convene a second-round vote to ease the unrest.\n\nBrazil\u2019s foreign ministry said it would not recognize Morales\u2019 win while an audit of the vote count by the regional group Organization of American States (OAS) was still pending.\n\nThe only countries that have congratulated Morales on his win were Venezuela, Cuba and Mexico.\n\nAfter nightfall, Bolivians banged on pots and pans in a traditional form of protest. Earlier, roads were blocked and demonstrators surrounded the headquarters of the country\u2019s electoral board, guarded by rows of police in anti-riot gear.\n\n\u201cEvo Morales had an acceptable administration,\u201d said protester Jose Callisaya, 38. But \u201cit\u2019s healthy in a democracy to change leaders.\u201d\n\nMesa, a former president who leads the Citizen Community party, has called for indefinite protests until a second-round vote is convened, which Morales has ruled out as unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe government is despising the popular vote,\u201d Mesa told local television channel Unitel on Friday.\n\nSTEADY GROWTH\n\nA former union leader for coca farmers, Morales has overseen steady growth and relative stability in one of South America\u2019s poorest countries and is now the region\u2019s longest-serving president. He has accused the opposition of trying to stir up unrest and denied charges of vote-rigging.\n\nOfficials and diplomats raised concerns the conflict could hit Bolivia\u2019s ties with global trade partners and hurt an economy already straining under declining gas exports.\n\nThe country\u2019s electoral board denied any political interference in its count and invited anyone to examine voting sheets posted on its website.\n\nMesa\u2019s campaign has said it had found irregularities on the website that swung some 100,000 votes in favor of Morales.\n\nBolivia\u2019s electoral system was \u201cabsolutely transparent,\u201d said Idelfonso Mamani, one of the five remaining members of the board following the resignation of its vice president in protest this week. \u201cWe have the means to prove the results,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nThe office of the country\u2019s ombudsman, which monitors conflicts, said 57 people have been arrested and 29 people wounded in this week\u2019s protests. Prosecutor Juan Lanchipa said 40 people have been investigated for vandalism.\n\nInterior Minister Carlos Romero called for calm. \u201cThere are people out for blood...to say there\u2019s a dictatorship here.\u201d\n\nThe OAS, a regional group that sent an observer mission to Bolivia, has said it had \u201cserious doubts\u201d about the election and earlier this week accepted an invitation by Morales\u2019 government to audit it to clear them up. It was unclear when the audit would begin.", "description": "Bolivians banged on pots and pans from windows and rooftops in the capital La Paz on Friday, protesting a controversial election count handing President Evo Morales a fourth consecutive term that would extend his rule to nearly two decades.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445073908&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P03Y", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
