So, it could be argued that gold is holding up surprisingly well following the Fed\u2019s hawkish cut (relative to market expectations anyway). That said, Powell did go on to say during the press conference that \u201ca more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate\u201d if the economy does turn down which places them in a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, perhaps a more pressing concern for investors is the liquidity squeeze in short-term funding. Whilst the Fed took the additional steps of lowering IOER (interest on excess reserves) by 30 bps to 1.8% and repo function rate to 1.7%, the fact they had to intervene is likely unnerving investors and supporting gold prices. Therefore, gold could face headwinds if the Fed convinces markets they have the liquidity squeeze under control, so traders will continue to monitor their repo actions closely this week.\n\nGold Spot/USD Daily Chart\n\nFor now, gold is holding above a pivotal support zone around $1480, which comprises of a 50% retracement level, the 50-day MA and structural lows.\n\nBears are likely to take note of the bearish RSI which has been forming since June and the potential head and shoulde rs top pattern.

If successful, the target projects an initial target around $1400, and bears could look for a clear break below $1480 to confirm the bearish reversal.\n\nIf the support zone hold, bulls could look for a break above $1524.24 to invalidate the head and shoulders scenario and assume a bullish continuation.\n\nto invalidate the head and shoulders scenario and assume a bullish continuation. The $1557.10 high becomes the initial target, although we\u2019d be skeptical of too much upside in the current environment; unless liquidity is restored and data improves, we could envisage gold trading in a broader sideways range whilst holding key support.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
