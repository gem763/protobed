He became a household name after he called bullshit in a discussion with Kanye West in which the rapper said that slavery was \u201ca choice.\u201d\n\nPage Six reported earlier this week that Lathan had confronted Babcock in the newsroom after the segment and told him there would be trouble if he \u201cever embarrassed [Lathan] like that again,\u201d however reports emerged suggesting that Lathan also placed his hands on Babcock\u2019s neck area.\n\nIn true TMZ style, there are even photos, which were posted to a random twitter account on October 9.\n\nThe sequence of four pictures appear to be screenshots from the show.\n\nA source who was in the room told Page Six that Lathan was finished shooting and was way on the other side of the room before he decided to return to confront Babcock. \u201cHe walked all the way across the room, came from behind [Babock] and grabbed him,\u201d said the insider.\n\nApparently the row was triggered by a discussion about the photographs of Ellen Degeneres seated with George W. Bush at a game.\n\nBabcock, Lathan and reps for TMZ have not commented.", "description": "Pictures have emerged of the encounter between the TMZ star Van Lathan and his co-presenter Michael Babcock, which it is reported led to Lathan\u2019s firing.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_719,w_1280,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571827370/Screenshot_2019-10-23_11.03.09_rkbq45", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
