They decided it was the right time to move on and focus that show online \u2013 and also, in TV terms, to keep the whole focus on the main show.\n\n\" BGT \u2019s younger audience have a huge appetite for consuming content via digital platforms - clips of the show now reach millions of people so it\u2019s a no brainer for producers to make this move.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"The decision was nothing to do with Stephen, he is the heart and soul of BGMT and a much-loved member of the BGT family \u2013 and everyone loved him on the show. And he is, of course, still incredibly busy with lots of exciting projects for ITV.\"\n\nA BGT spokesperson said: \"As our 18-34 audience share continues to grow and viewing habits are changing, naturally we are listening to our viewers and focusing more on digital platforms in support of the main show.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
