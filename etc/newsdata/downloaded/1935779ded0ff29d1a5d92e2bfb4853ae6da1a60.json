It is believed World Rugby will consider on Monday whether any punishment is warranted but, given the precedent set with France eight years ago, it would be a surprise if England were not sanctioned in a similar manner.\n\n\u201c[Joe Marler] said he got confused,\u201d Mako Vunipola said. \u201cHe thought he was supposed to go all the way around it and go to their 10. But because of that, he\u2019s the one who has to pay the fine. He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.\u201d", "description": "England could face a fine for their V-formation response to New Zealand\u2019s haka before the World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da4cb80d08e025c13ad8dc4f34d1e4ec573890f/53_0_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9aeeb889766174c99f920119492f708e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
