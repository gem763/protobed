(Image: Mike Morley)\n\nFor thousands of years, Siberia\u2019s Denisova Cave was home to various bands of Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans. But as new research shows, animals occupied this cave more frequently than not, showcasing the pains, perils, and complexities of paleolithic life.\n\n\u201cBasically, the story that we are telling is full of shit,\u201d said Mike Morley, an archaeologist at Flinders University and the lead author of the new study, in an email to Gizmodo.\n\nWell, to be fair to Morley and his colleagues, their story is also full of charcoal fragments, ash, bits of bone, and flakes from stone tools \u2014 all of which were dredged from 3 to 4 metres of sediment at the bottom of two chambers in Denisova Cave. By performing a micromorphological analysis of all the stuff embedded within this dirt \u2014 both geological and biological \u2014 the researchers were able to reconstruct a history of habitation in the cave over the course of 300,000 years, a timespan that included no less than three interglacial cycles. Their research is published today in Scientific Reports.\n\n\u201cNon-human animals were using the cave for much of its occupational history, and early humans were only occasional users.\u201d\n\nDenisova Cave, located at the foot of Siberia\u2019s Altai Mountains, is famous for hosting two now-extinct hominin species: Neanderthals and Denisovans.\n\nEarlier this year, an extensive survey of fossils and other evidence found in the cave traced the history of human occupation at the site, showing that Denisovans \u2014 a sister species to the Neanderthals \u2014 first ventured into this cave around 287,000 years ago, followed by their Neanderthal brethren around 140,000 years ago.\n\nGenetic evidence from 2018 suggests the two groups cohabited and co-mingled in the cave, as evidenced by the discovery of a half-Denisovan, half-Neanderthal individual. Artefacts found in the cave dating to between 49,000 and 43,000 years ago are ambiguous in terms who produced them, though it\u2019s highly likely they were left behind by modern humans, adding a third possible occupant of Denisova Cave. The last bits of definitive evidence from either Denisovans or Neanderthals stop around 52,000 years ago.\n\nThese timelines are extensive, encompassing literally hundreds of thousands of years. What these fossils and artefacts haven\u2019t been able to tell us, however, is whether these hominin occupations were continuous or interrupted. The new research corroborates the previous work done in Denisova Cave, but it also helps to fill in some unknown gaps, showing that archaic humans were not present in the cave for significant swaths of time. In their place were several species of carnivorous animals, including hyenas, wolves and sometimes even bears, according to the new research.\n\nFlinders University archaeologist Mike Morley sampling sediment in Denisova Cave. (Image: Mike Morley)\n\n\u201cWe already knew from the fossil bone record that other animals were present in the cave, but it was a surprise just how much hyena \u2014 and to a lesser extent, wolf \u2014 poop there would be in the sediment record,\u201d said Morley. \u201cIt really shows that non-human animals were using the cave for much of its occupational history, and early humans were only occasional users.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the sheer volume of coprolites \u2014 the fancy archaeological term for fossilised poop \u2014 along with traces of animal bones within the various sedimentary layers suggests the cave was occupied by animals \u201cnear-continuously,\u201d in the words of the authors, and that the cave was off limits to humans for extensive periods, though it\u2019s not immediately obvious as to why. Importantly, there\u2019s no evidence that humans came into conflict with these animals.\n\nThat said, Morley said there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d competition existed for this precious space. The copious amounts of poop from \u201ccave-dwelling carnivores is ubiquitous and suggests that the site often served as a den for hyenas and, to a lesser extent, for wolves,\u201d the study authors wrote.\n\nA block of dirt taken from Denisova Cave. (Image: Mike Morley)\n\nAt the same time, the \u201ccave was visited sporadically by hominins, who appeared not to have been prolific users of fire,\u201d according to the paper. This juxtaposition \u2014 lots of carnivores, few hominins, and little evidence of fire \u2014 means archaeologists should take extra caution in determining how human bones reached the bottom of the cave. As Morley pointed out to Gizmodo, some humans bones may have been brought into the cave by scavenging hyenas from the outside, so in some cases the presence of hominin fossils may not be indicative of hominin occupation at the site.\n\nThis new paper marks the first time that dirt from Denisova Cave has been analysed in such fine detail. By doing so, Morley and his colleagues were able to detect materials in the sediment not normally visible to the naked eye, such as evidence of coprolites, small bits of bone, microscopic and macroscopic fragments of charcoal from fire pits, and traces of ash and flakes from stone tools.\n\nTo conduct the study, the archaeologists \u201cremoved blocks of sediment from the trench walls at the site and took them back to the laboratory,\u201d said Morley. These blocks were then soaked in plastic resin for hardening, which allowed them to be cut into exceptionally thin slices, some measuring just 30 microns in depth. These slices were analysed with an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope to \u201clook for micro-traces of human and animal occupation,\u201d along with features indicative of a changing climate, he said.\n\nMicroscopic images of coprolites (fossilized poop), including those from hyenas, wolves, and some unindentified species.

Broadly speaking, the climate \u201cswitched from cold and arid, open steppe environments during glacial periods to warmer and usually wetter periods with forest steppe during interglacial periods,\u201d explained Morley. Neanderthals and Denisovans were probably well adapted to the cold weather, and both groups were likely living in the area even during the colder periods, said Morley.\n\nArchaeologist Katerina Douka from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, who was not affiliated with the new research and is an expert on the Denisova Cave, said the new study is important because it provides \u201cbackground information\u201d about the stuff buried within the cave\u2019s sediment.\n\n\u201cStudying the succession of layers at the microscopic level, it is amazing to discover a wide range of materials, from bone fragments to hyena coprolites and even stone tool chips,\u201d Douka wrote to Gizmodo in an email. \u201cIt also indicates that humans and animals would alternate as the site\u2019s occupants, highlighting how challenging and precarious life was in the Palaeolithic period.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the new paper raises some important questions about both Denisovans and Neanderthals in the area, such as why they only lived here sporadically and how the presence of other, potentially dangerous animals influenced their movements. Denisova Cave continues to intrigue, and it undoubtedly has more stories to tell.", "description": "For thousands of years, Siberia\u2019s Denisova Cave was home to various bands of Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans.
