I\u2019d never related what I did to now. I didn\u2019t realise that I was the last person. 59 years. Time flies too quickly\u2026\u201d\n\nThose achievements are only now being equalled and yet just as striking is how her international career ended in 1965, aged only 23 (Asher-Smith\u2019s current age), after being paid \u00a3150 to write an autobiography, Sprint to Fame. She was ready to stop then, but was judged to have lost her amateur status and so could not later return.\n\nHyman has found herself approached again on the street over recent days by local friends wanting to relive a sprint career that also included Commonwealth and European gold, as well as winning the prestigious BBC Sports Personalty of the Year in 1963.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always had to work full-time and I had also run for 10 years and it got to be more trouble for me than my job,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere was no money. It cost you money to compete. Life became training, work, bed.\u201d Hyman was from Cudworth where the local working men\u2019s club had once even formed a committee to raise money to buy her a pair of track spikes. It was her father, Jack, a coal-miner, who first had the foresight to recognise that she had a particular talent for running whilst watching her in a school sports day competition.", "description": "Dorothy Hyman had just got back from her sister\u2019s last Sunday night to her home near Barnsley when she turned on the athletics and got a pleasant surprise.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212072844-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcCUlY4ecowelYv5R9cM4V-1aaeS_2RELnoTgDIBVneg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
