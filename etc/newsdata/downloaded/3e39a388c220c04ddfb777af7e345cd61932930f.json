Photo: KIMBERLEY FRENCH / TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM\n\nTaika Waititi never did get used to looking into mirrors and seeing Adolf Hitler staring back at him. \u201cI\u2019m usually quite lively on set, and I like to make everyone feel comfortable,\u201d he recalls of his days shooting Jojo Rabbit. \u201cI\u2019d just be waltzing around and then catch a glimpse of myself. Oh, right, I\u2019m dressed as one of the most evil people in human history.\u201d\n\nTechnically speaking, Waititi (who, let the record state, was born in New Zealand to a Maori father and a Jewish mother) doesn\u2019t play the historical Hitler in Jojo Rabbit. Rather, he plays a buffoonish, make-believe version of the F\u00fchrer who serves as an imaginary best friend to 10-year-old Johannes, played by Roman Griffin Davis, a hapless but eager member of the Hitler Youth \u2014 as all boys considered \u201cracially pure\u201d had to be at the time \u2014 and the protagonist of Waititi\u2019s film.\n\nThose are a lot of words that maybe shouldn\u2019t all exist in the same sentence, and they speak to the wild tonal balancing act that the writer-director-actor-comedian is attempting here. Jojo Rabbit is a goofy and colorful and occasionally harrowing comedy set in a small town in Germany in the closing months of World War II; it follows Johannes, nicknamed Jojo, as he discovers, much to his horror, that his beautiful and lively mother (Scarlett Johansson), who has been raising him on her own, has been secretly harboring a Jewish teenager named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) inside the walls of their tasteful bourgeois home. It\u2019s a conundrum for the boy: If he turns in Elsa, he\u2019s also turning in his mother. Injured while trying to show the other kids in the Hitler Youth how tough he is, Jojo has been recuperating, mildly disfigured, at home. There, he and Elsa begin to engage in a battle of wits. The film has moments of broad slapstick, surreal visual gags, and silly dialogue. (Early on, Hitler tells Jojo that he\u2019s \u201cthe bestest, most loyal little Nazi I\u2019ve ever met \u2026 Heil me, man.\u201d) There are also scenes of corpses hanging in the tidy town square.\n\n\u201cIt was a really hard story to explain to people,\u201d Waititi says of his attempts to describe the movie over the years. \u201cYou could just see their faces start to drop, like, \u2018Oh God, Taika\u2019s lost it.\u2019\u201d On the day we meet, he\u2019s sporting a luxurious mustache and a tuft of curly hair as he lies barefoot on a couch in a sparsely decorated, dimly lit \u201cmeditation room\u201d at the Marvel offices on the Disney lot, where he has started work on Thor: Love and Thunder, a sequel to his 2017 hit Thor: Ragnarok (the success of which presumably gave him the cover \u2014 and the clout \u2014 to get Jojo green-lit). A passerby might think we\u2019re having a therapy session. And indeed I do have a lot of questions on my notepad about why he decided to make a heartwarming coming-of-age comedy in which he co-stars as Hitler. Why\u2019d he take that role? \u201cI don\u2019t usually need much encouragement \u2014 I\u2019m happy to put myself in my films \u2014 but this one felt weird because I\u2019m Polynesian and I do not look like him at all.\u201d But, he says, Fox Searchlight insisted. \u201cI went for a meeting, and I was like, \u2018Okay, now we have to go and ask actors, \u201cWho wants to be Hitler?\u201d\u2019 And they were like, \u2018Well, we actually would be more interested in making it if you played that role.\u2019\u201d\n\nJojo Rabbit has already proved divisive among critics. In a time when authoritarianism is being met with enthusiasm around the world and the lessons of the past seem less distant and settled, making a satire about a kid who loves being a fascist is a tricky endeavor. There will certainly be those who feel Waititi hasn\u2019t treated the evil of the Third Reich with the gravity it deserves, especially since he\u2019s making a high-profile project being released by Disney (which bought Fox while he was working on the film) in the heat of awards season, when every ambitious movie gets subjected to extra layers of hype, scorn, and backlash.\n\nIn some ways, Waititi might have had an easier time of it if he\u2019d made the film back in 2010, when he had only two indie features to his name and he first read Christine Leunens\u2019s novel Caging Skies, on which Jojo Rabbit is based. His mother had told him about the book, and before reading it, he imagined a comedy from what she had described to him. He\u2019d also been reading about the Bosnian War, in which fascist violence rose up again in the aftermath of the Cold War. \u201cIt just struck me that we were doomed to keep repeating these things,\u201d he says.\n\nTo be clear: Caging Skies is in no way, shape, or form a comedy. It\u2019s a densely researched, melancholy historical drama set in Vienna and told through Johannes\u2019s delusional eyes. There\u2019s no imaginary Hitler egging him on or high-fiving him. Leunens wrote the book over a five-year period at the M\u00e9morial de Caen in Normandy, a World War II museum where her husband was working. \u201cFor five years, every five minutes, I heard the bombers going off, and I had a Hawker Typhoon hanging over me,\u201d she recalls of her immersion in the period. Each day to get to work, she had to pass by life-size \u00adphotos of Holocaust victims. She\u2019s also haunted by stories of her own family members who were in the camps, including one great-uncle whom the Nazis injected with petrol after he\u2019d dared to pray over the body of a boy that was being eaten by dogs.\n\nAt the time Waititi and Leunens met in 2010, Leunens had seen the director\u2019s early shorts and his second feature, Boy, about a young Maori\u2019s idolization of his crooked, deadbeat father (played by Wai\u00adtiti). \u201cI found Boy incredibly sad even though it\u2019s considered a comedy,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt that Taika and I were pretty much from the same artistic family, with the difference being that I lean more toward drama and I put some laughs inside, and he leans more toward humor and he puts the harder bits inside.\u201d\n\nLeunens gave him the freedom to do what he wanted with the movie. She understood that there was no way for him to simply replicate her dense, detailed, and very internal story. (The book also covers a wider swath of history, including the postwar period in its second half.) \u201cGoing from my medium to his medium,\u201d she explains, \u201che had to do something more powerful because you experience a film much the way you yourself dream.\u201d Waititi toiled on the screenplay for years, often tossing out entire drafts and starting all over again. He eventually sent her the script with the message, \u201cIt\u2019s still your baby. I\u2019ve just changed the clothes.\u201d Leunens says she loves the film and still finds it profoundly sad beneath the surface humor.\n\nThat\u2019s because it is profoundly sad. Jojo Rabbit is about a young boy\u2019s awakening to the fact that everything he knows to be true is instead a monstrous illusion. He\u2019s a 10-year-old who wants to fit in and be liked, and he has been seduced by the vibrant, colorful \u00adpropaganda \u2014 the sense of a collective master-race \u00admission \u2014 of the time. One of the film\u2019s earliest scenes is a montage set to \u201cKomm Gib Mir Deine Hand,\u201d the Beatles\u2019 German-language recording of \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d in which we see black-and-white documentary footage of crowds \u2014 largely young people \u2014 going mad for Hitler. Watching it, I get chills wondering if my own child could one day be possessed like this. Though Jojo Rabbit is billed as an \u201canti-hate satire,\u201d its real power lies in showing how the moral compasses of the most innocent among us can easily be twisted in evil new directions, especially if the adult world around them has also gone mad.\n\nWell, not all the adults, exactly. Jojo\u2019s mother, Rosie, works for the Resistance, though she doesn\u2019t dare reveal this to her son. She seems perplexed by his enthusiasm for Nazism, but she understands that keeping up appearances \u2014 like making sure Jojo shows up for his Hitler Youth camping trip \u2014 will keep him safe. Given the reality of a fascist police state, Rosie has to be careful in how she confronts his childish beliefs. When they see a group of bodies hanging from nooses in the square, she makes sure he doesn\u2019t turn away. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d the boy asks. \u201cWhat they could,\u201d the mother replies.\n\nAlmost all Taika Waititi films portray someone \u2014 usually a child \u2014 slowly realizing their world is built on lies. Even Thor: Ragnarok, for all its irreverent intergalactic action, turns on Thor\u2019s discovery of the horrifying past of his beloved home planet, Asgard. (Waititi calls Ragnarok a film \u201cabout imperialism collapsing\u201d and describes the Asgardians as \u201ca civilization of conquerors. They went out and visited other worlds and drained their resources and put them back to build their castles out of gold.\u201d)\n\nTo place us in his protagonist\u2019s delusional, optimistic state of mind, Waititi pursued a dynamic, cheerful aesthetic in Jojo Rabbit\u2019s early scenes. \u201cA child experiences the world through color and sounds and excitement, so the introduction of the colorful palette was necessary to explain that perspective,\u201d says production designer Ra Vincent, who\u2019s worked with the director on several films, including Ragnarok and the 2014 vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows.\n\n\u201cA lot of WWII films,\u201d Waititi says, \u201cit\u2019s just very dull, muted tones \u2014 a lot of browns, and grays, and it\u2019s desaturated, and it\u2019s always raining. And while you don\u2019t want to paint this period as a bright, happy time, it was a very vibrant world. For a kid, it was like growing up in a circus or a candy store. Everything is designed to make the world seem amazing and like the greatest place on earth \u2014 even though these atrocities are happening underneath it all.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cTowards the end of the war, when everyone knew that it was basically over, people would go out every day thinking that was the day they were going to die. So they\u2019d wear their best clothes. The women would put on all their makeup, put on their stockings. The message was, \u2018If I\u2019m going to go out, I\u2019m going to go out looking good and at a party.\u2019\u201d\n\nA different kind of vibrancy could be found in Jojo\u2019s family\u2019s house. Waititi and Vincent imagined it as a typically baroque structure filled with modern, Art Deco designs and beautiful pieces of art \u2014 the kind the Nazis wouldn\u2019t have liked \u2014 to indicate not just the \u201cwell-off, socialite\u201d origins of the boy\u2019s parents, but also to hint at the mother\u2019s spirit of resistance.\n\nThese settings also allowed Waititi to modulate Jojo Rabbit\u2019s tone in subtle ways, such as cut-aways at key moments to make it look like the very houses around them were spying on the characters. The production was based mostly in Prague and the small, well-preserved Czech towns of Zatec and Ustek, which had escaped bombing during the war and were filled with houses that seem to spy on you. \u201cIn the Czech Republic, over generations, they\u2019ve had dictators come in and kind of ruin the country overnight,\u201d says Vincent. \u201cAnd even the windows look like they\u2019ve got suspicious-looking eyes.\u201d\n\nDavis, Waititi, and Johansson. Photo: KIMBERLEY FRENCH / TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM\n\nIt would be silly, however, to claim that Jojo Rabbit is an authentic portrait of life in Nazi Germany. \u201cIf we treat it like something that happened 80 years ago and we keep it in that historical box, then we assume it can never happen again,\u201d Waititi says. The characters move and talk like people from today\u2019s world. Sam Rockwell\u2019s Hitler Youth camp leader, Captain Klenzendorf, reminds you of Bill Murray in any number of Wes Anderson films.\n\nFor McKenzie\u2019s Elsa, \u201cI wanted it to feel like she could have been in Heathers,\u201d Waititi notes. \u201cShe might have been part of this cool crew at school, but now she\u2019s the last one left and she\u2019s got to hang out with a 10-year-old Nazi. Can you imagine how annoyed you\u2019d be?\u201d Much of the film\u2019s pathos \u2014 as well as its humor \u2014 comes from the give-and-take between the confident Elsa and the half-baked racism of Jojo, as the boy, having been brainwashed by ideas about Jews having horns and eating babies and controlling people\u2019s minds, tries to get the girl to tell him more about, and even draw pictures of, all the other terrible things Jews do. (\u201cI said to draw where Jews live. This is just a stupid picture of my head.\u201d \u201cYes. That\u2019s where we live.\u201d) Of course, he gets a crush on her.\n\nTo hammer home his anachronistic approach, Waititi also cast recognizable comic actors like Rebel Wilson, who plays a particularly overzealous Hitler Youth camp counselor, and Stephen Merchant, who plays a creepy Gestapo official whose face lights up when he sees all the Hitler paraphernalia in Jojo\u2019s bedroom. In keeping with the director\u2019s style of working, the cast improvised endlessly. Waititi recalls shooting lots of alternate death scenes for Hitler at the end. (Spoiler alert: Hitler dies.) \u201cOne of them was just two minutes of me doing bad acting, dying in this room and rolling around on the floor and going out the doors.\u201d He says he enjoyed making Hitler suffer.\n\n\u201cIt was very tempting to use all of that improvisation because it was funny at the moment,\u201d says editor Tom Eagles. \u201cBut as soon as you sit down in front of the film, the realities of what you\u2019re representing kick in as well.\u201d Waititi likes to test lots of different cuts of his pictures. He recalls doing edits of What We Do in the Shadows that had all the jokes removed to develop the characters better, then doing versions that were almost nothing but jokes. (\u201cNobody cared about the characters,\u201d he says of those cuts.)\n\nEditing Jojo Rabbit was treacherous. Waititi worried: \u201cHave we pushed it too far into the absurd? And is that undermining the profundity of what I\u2019m trying to say? Or has it become too dramatic and now it\u2019s just not entertaining at all?\u201d One of their biggest challenges, says Eagles, was \u201cgiving people permission to laugh without making light of the subject matter.\u201d They screened different cuts of the film repeatedly \u2014 first to friends, then to test audiences and focus groups. \u201cMost people were down with it,\u201d says Eagles, \u201cbut there was a certain section of the audience who were just like, \u2018We can never laugh at this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe breakthrough came with the opening, a pep talk Hitler gives to Jojo. Originally, Hitler wasn\u2019t in the scene, and the boy had to express both his fanaticism and his self-doubt. Only in reshoots did Waititi decide to add Hitler \u2014 well, himself as Hitler. \u201cThe moment that we gave him someone to bounce off of and express those doubts to, you immediately saw the nature of the relationship and understood why Hitler\u2019s even in the film,\u201d says Eagles. \u201cIt also planted a flag out front and said, \u2018This is going to be a film about Nazis, and it\u2019s going to be completely ridiculous \u2014 and either you\u2019re going to walk out of the cinema right now or you\u2019re with us.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAbout that last part: When Jojo Rabbit premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in early September, it was met with a combination of raves and pans. Some thought it didn\u2019t go far enough. Some thought it had gone too far. Some enjoyed being conflicted. (\u201cEven if I don\u2019t love Jojo Rabbit, I love that it exists and that Waititi has forced me to reexamine my own responses,\u201d wrote New York\u2019s David Edelstein.)\n\nAnd some thought it was just right. It was the surprise winner of the festival\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Award, which over the past decade has become a reliable predictor of future Oscar glory. (Previous victors include Green Book, La La Land, 12 Years a Slave, and The King\u2019s Speech.) The win was so unexpected that it took more than a dozen calls from Fox Searchlight executives and Waititi\u2019s personal assistant to even locate the director, who was in California at a friend\u2019s wedding. Eventually, they had to call some other friends, who were staying with him, early on a Sunday morning to get Waititi to respond. \u201cDo those guys understand weekends?\u201d he recalls thinking. \u201cThere was a strong chance I was going to turn that phone off.\u201d\n\nSo maybe the timing is good, after all. Waititi is not unaware of this uneasy historical moment when some form of fascism \u2014 in Hungary, in Austria, in Brazil, in America \u2014 appears to be ascendant, and he says he\u2019s glad he waited until now to make his film. He grimly recalls learning of the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand while editing Jojo Rabbit. \u201cThey\u2019ve been there for years,\u201d he says of white supremacists in New Zealand, though, let\u2019s be fair, he could be talking about white supremacists anywhere. \u201cPeople would say we learned our lesson after World War II. Turns out we didn\u2019t learn shit.\u201d\n\nJojo Rabbit opens October 18.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
