(Picture: Jason Merritt/Getty Images)\n\nHollywood icon Jane Fonda was arrested in Washington DC on Friday 11 October on the steps of the US Capitol building.\n\nWearing a long red coat, a hat and dark boots, police officers further accessorised her look by placing plastic ties around her wrists before walking her to their vehicle.\n\nAs it happened, people around her cheered and called: \u2018We love you Jane\u2019.\n\nWhy was Jane Fonda arrested?\n\nFonda, 81, was arrested during a climate change protest.\n\nThe actress said: \u2018I\u2019m going to take my body, which is kind of famous and popular right now because of the [television] series and I\u2019m going to go to D.C. and I\u2019m going to have a rally every Friday.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be called Fire Drill Friday. And we\u2019re going to engage in civil disobedience and we\u2019re going to get arrested every Friday.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 9 to 5 star told the Washington Post that she has been inspired by Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who was recently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nFonda said that Greta had \u2018realised what was happening and that this was barreling at us like an engine\u2019.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It so traumatised her that she stopped speaking and eating. And when I read that, it rocked me because I knew that Greta had seen the truth. And the urgency came into my DNA the way it hadn\u2019t before.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018Greta said we have to behave like it\u2019s a crisis. We have to behave like our houses are on fire.\u2019\n\nFonda\u2019s actions have been met with support from members of the public and from her fellow celebs, including Russell Crowe, who tagged her in a tweet which read: \u2018On fire at 81.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, singer Cyndi Lauper said: \u2018She still cares and now we all know about #FireDrillFriday thank you for fighting for us\u2019.\n\nShe still cares and now we all know about #FireDrillFriday thank you for fighting for us @Janefonda https://t.co/I2tVp54rlw \u2014 Cyndi Lauper (@cyndilauper) October 12, 2019\n\nall jane fonda does is get arrested, smoke weed, be ambiguous about her sexuality and make old ugly piece of shit republicans mad \u2014 valentina ! #freejanefonda (@prsephn) October 12, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHas Jane Fonda ever been arrested before?\n\nIn 1970, Fonda was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, where she was arriving after being a part of an anti-war speaking tour in Canada.\n\nFonda absolutely slaying in a mug shot following her arrest in Cleveland, Ohio in 1970. (Picture: Kypros/Getty Images)\n\nFonda told the authorities that the pills which had been found in her luggage were just vitamins, however, according to Fonda, the officers who arrested her told her that they were acting on orders from the White House, where Richard Nixon was serving as president at the time.\n\nHer website reads: \u2018I told them what they were but they said they were getting orders from the White House\u2013that would be the Nixon White House. I think they hoped this \u201cscandal\u201d would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\n\n\u2018I was handcuffed and put in the Cleveland Jail, which is when the mug shot was taken. (I had just finished filming \u201cKlute\u201d so, yes, it was the Klute haircut).\u2019\n\nShe was later released on bond and the charges were dismissed.\n\nDecades later in 2017, she started selling merch adorned with her mugshot to raise funds for the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential.\n\nlily tomlin waiting for that jane fonda mugshot to drop so she can organise new merch to wear to red carpet events pic.twitter.com/2TdaTJpgqS \u2014 ellie \u03df (@griiffinskane) October 11, 2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
