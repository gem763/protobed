The three main U.S. stock indexes all closed with gains on Monday, ending the third quarter on an upbeat note. Investors were relieved as the Treasury Department said it has no plans to limit portfolio investments in China \u201cat this time.\u201d A report that Treasury was considering such an idea rattled stocks on Friday. Investors continued to watch the political drama surrounding the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. WeWork\u2019s parent company is formally withdrawing from a planned initial public offering, after CEO Adam Neumann stepped down. Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s (ticker: BUD) Asian business climbed after its Hong Kong trading debut. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nwatch stocks bounce back after the Treasury denied a report that it\u2019s considering limiting investment in China;\n\ncheck on China\u2019s better-than-expected manufacturing data and the normalization of crude prices following the Saudi attack;\n\nand wonder how October might unfold now that the third quarter is behind us.\n\nAnother Quarter With Gains\n\nStocks rose on Monday as worries about an escalated U.S.-China tension were partly eased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96.58 points, or 0.36%, to close at 26,916.83. The S&P 500 gained 14.95 points, or 0.50%, to finish at 2976.74, and the Nasdaq Composite grew 59.71 points, or 0.75%, to close at 7999.34.\n\nAfter last Friday\u2019s report that the Trump administration is weighing limiting U.S. portfolio investments in China, a Treasury Department spokeswoman denied such report, saying the department has no current plans to do so. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro called the Friday report \u201cfake news,\u201d which noted various measures under the Trump administration\u2019s consideration, including delisting Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges, limiting U.S. government pension funds\u2019 exposure to Chinese market, and putting caps on Chinese companies in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nInvestors were encouraged by the news and stocks jumped on Monday, the last day of the third quarter. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow are up 1.19% over the past three months, rising for three consecutive quarters this year.\n\nChina\u2019s better-than-expected economic data also lifted stocks. The country\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose by 0.3 points to 49.8 in September, coming ahead of economists consensus. Still, the number is below the 50 threshold that indicates economic contraction\u2014the fifth straight month in a row.\n\nOil prices have largely fallen back to levels preceding a drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s key infrastructure two weeks ago. Saudi Aramco has fully recovered and is now producing more than 9.9 million barrels of crude per day, according to the state-owned facility. Aramco said it\u2019s committed to meeting all demand from customers, and won\u2019t miss any contracted shipments. Traders are now focusing on weaker global demand, building U.S. supplies, and the potential uncertainties brought by the U.S.-China trade tensions. International benchmark Brent crude oil fell 1.83% on Monday to settle at $60.78 per barrel, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate dropped 3.29% to $54.07 per barrel.\n\nAs the fourth quarter begins, investors are setting their sights on October, a historically strong month for stocks. October is the third best-performing month over the past 20 years, but some are still worried since this September\u2014historically a more volatile month\u2014has been fairly calm this year. The S&P 500 didn\u2019t have a single 1% daily drop, and only two 1% daily gains in September. \u201cIf we know one thing, it is that markets don\u2019t stay calm forever and after a dull market last month, we could be due for some usual October volatility,\u201d wrote Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, in a Monday note.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "The three main U.S. stock indexes all closed with gains on Monday, ending the third quarter on an upbeat note.
