Made with rice noodles, this beef noodle soup is a must-try on the streets of Hanoi -- not to mention readily available overseas.\n\nBut there's much more to the city's diverse food scene.\n\nHere are five dishes every Hanoi visitor -- not just global leaders -- should try. (And yes, we know, we've barely scratched the surface.

Dan Tham\n\nHanoians consider cha ca to be so exceptional that there is a road in the capital dedicated to these fried morsels of fish -- Cha Ca Street.\n\nAlong the busy road, where spiderwebs of exposed electric wires hang overhead, dozens of specialists compete to sell the best cha ca -- crispy turmeric-marinated fish that's fried tableside in a pan with herbs.\n\nThe most famous restaurant on this strip is Ca La Vong -- one of the oldest eateries in Hanoi -- and the first to set up shop on Cha Ca Street, over a century ago.\n\nThe dish itself dates back more than 130 years. It was first invented by the local Doan family, who served the special meal to troops during French colonial rule.\n\nCa La Vong, 14 Cha Ca Street, Hanoi\n\nRelated content Cha Ca: An entire Hanoi street dedicated to one special dish\n\nBanh Tom (shrimp cake)\n\nFor Hanoi's best fish cakes, head to Thanh Nien Street. Christina Choi/CNN\n\nDeceptively time-intensive, Hanoi-style banh tom, or shrimp cakes, have just a few main ingredients: freshwater crayfish or shrimp from West Lake, flour and sweet potato.\n\nInstead of grinding the shrimp into a paste (like a fish ball), the fried seafood is usually left whole -- sitting atop the crunchy cakes.\n\nIt's typically served with lettuce leaves for wrapping, plus chili, lime juice and fish sauce for dipping.\n\nBanh tom is thought to have become common in the 1930s when small street vendors began congregating along Thanh Nien Street -- a road that separates West Lake (T\u00e2y H\u1ed3) and Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake.\n\nWhen the hawkers garnered popularity, the government later combined many of the stalls and opened one big restaurant along the waterfront.\n\nEnter Banh Tom Ho Tay . Today, the restaurant remains a fixture on Thanh Nien Street and still draws a steady stream of friends and families, gathering for slow afternoons full of crispy, savory shrimp cakes, chilled bia hoi (local draft beer), and front-row seats to the lake.\n\nRelated content West Lake shrimp cakes: The one food you have to try in Hanoi\n\nBun Ca (fish noodle soup)\n\nBun ca is a popular choice for lunch in Hanoi. Dan Tham\n\nFresh and light, bun ca combines fried fishcakes, dill, tomatoes, green onions, and perilla -- a mint-like herb.\n\nA lunchtime staple in Hanoi, you can find bun ca (fish noodle soup) just about anywhere.\n\nBut Mark Lowerson, founder of Hanoi Street Tours, points to a vendor west of the Old Quarter called Van, that specializes in the dish.\n\n\"This is one of the best in town,\" he tells CNN Travel. \"There are two types of noodles, and then your choice of steamed or fried fish.\"\n\nWhile in other countries, adding salt could be considered an insult to the chef -- Lowerson says that's not the case in Vietnam.\n\n\"Here, you are expected to use the condiments on the table,\" he explains.\n\n\"Add a little lime, vinegar, chili and herbs to achieve the essential balance of salty, sour, sweet and spicy.\"\n\nBun Ca Van, 105 Qu\u00e1n Th\u00e1nh, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 167 937 7964\n\nBun Rieu Cua (crab noodle soup)\n\nCrabmeat is the star of B\u00fan ri\u00eau -- a meat or seafood vermicelli soup. Dan Tham\n\nBun rieu is a meat or seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color. The broth gets its appearance from tomato paste and annatto oil, made from achiote tree seeds.\n\nFreshwater crabmeat and blanched tomatoes are the soup's star players. Tamarind paste lends sourness to the broth, while airy bits of fried tofu contribute crunch.\n\nDepending on the region, bun rieu might also come topped with beef, pork, snails or fish.\n\nVermicelli noodles swim in the soup, adding balance to a dish that's both colorful and light. Add to that the requisite plateful of lime wedges, chili and greens -- like banana blossoms and mint -- and you have a perfect meal.\n\nWhere to try it? There's an excellent bun rieu street stall run by Ms. Thu, located in Th\u1ecd X\u01b0\u01a1ng Alley, near St. Joseph's Cathedral.\n\nCa Phe Trung (egg coffee)\n\nWould you like some eggs with your coffee? In Hanoi, ca phe trung -- or egg coffee -- is a local favorite.\n\nVietnamese \"egg coffee\" -- or Ca Phe Trung -- is a Hanoi specialty in which a creamy soft, meringue-like egg white foam is perched on dense Vietnamese coffee.\n\nWhile destinations across the city now serve it, Hanoi's humble Cafe Giang cafe claims to have invented it.\n\nRelated content Egg coffee in Hanoi: Where to get your caffeine fix\n\nThere are hot and cold versions. The former is served as a yellow concoction in a small glass. It's consumed with a spoon and tastes almost like a coffee flavored ice cream -- more like a dessert than coffee.\n\nThe hot version comes resting in a small dish of hot water to maintain its temperature. The strong coffee taste at the bottom of the cup seeps through the egg -- the yellow layer on top -- and is quite thick and sweet, though not sickly.", "description": "Hanoi food is delicious.
