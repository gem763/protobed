The union said it was the first time workers for Metro had gone on strike in more than 40 years.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure these workers get the contracts they deserve,\u201d said Brian Wivell, a political organizer for ATU Local 689. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the choice of the company and the choice of the workers, too, to decide if they\u2019re being respected at the bargaining table.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCinder Bed is a privately run Metrobus garage managed by Transdev, a French multinational company. The affected routes make up about six percent of Metro\u2019s 325 total bus routes in the D.C. region.\n\nRoutes shut down on Thursday included 17B, 17G, 17H, 17K, 17L, 17M, 18G, 18H, 18J, 18P, 29C, 29G and 29W. Those same routes will not run on Friday, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel.\n\nAD\n\nRoutes 29N, 29K and REX will also continue to operate on a less-frequent schedule. Metro urged riders to take Metrorail, other transportation or to go to its website to find other route options.\n\nMetro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said that the labor dispute was between Metro\u2019s contractor and the workers and that the transit authority had no plans to intervene. Transdev, he said, was contractually obligated to have a contingency plan to keep routes open. He said Thursday, about eight hours after the strike began, that it was too early to tell whether or when service on the routes could be restored.\n\nAD\n\nMitun Seguin, the vice president for marketing and communications at Transdev, said in an email that the company was \u201cdisappointed to learn that the ATU\u201d chose to strike. Seguin said Transdev was \u201cnegotiating in good faith with the ATU for an initial collective bargaining agreement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSeguin called the union\u2019s strike premature and said it \u201cneedlessly inconveniences the passengers.\u201d Transdev apologized to customers \u201cfor the hardship caused by the union\u2019s tactics.\u201d\n\nMore on bus driver strike vs #wmata contractor: Striking are all operators, mechanics & utility workers at the Cinder Bed @metrobus garage which is operated by Transdev. Wivell of union estimates about 50 on picket lines since around 4am \u2014 Justin George (@justingeorge) October 24, 2019\n\nUnion officials said they\u2019ve been in negotiations with management since February. In August, the union said workers voted to authorize a strike if its bargaining team thought that was necessary.\n\n\u201cCinder Bed workers are fed up with being mistreated,\u201d Raymond Jackson, ATU Local 689 president and business agent, said in a statement. \u201cThese workers are going to stand strong and show Transdev and [Metro] that they deserve nothing less than what every other bus operator makes in this area.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nATU Local 689 represents more than 13,000 members and retirees who work for Metro, Transdev, MetroAccess, DASH and the DC Streetcar.\n\nUnion officials said they want workers to \u201creceive the same pay and benefits that other regional bus operators make.\u201d They said operators work on the \u201csame routes, on the same roads, with the same buses\u201d as Metro but \u201cearn $12 an hour less than other operators in the region just because they work for a private contractor.\u201d\n\nOperators at Cinder Bed typically make $20 an hour \u201cacross the board,\u201d Wivell said. Metrobus operators at other sites \u201cmax out\u201d at $33 an hour, and DASH operators make upward of $34 an hour, he said.\n\nAD\n\nTransdev officials said its wages and benefits were \u201cconsistent with similar 80-100 bus operations across the region.\u201d\n\nA group of striking workers showed up at Thursday\u2019s regularly scheduled Metro board meeting and called on board members to end privatization. Some alleged that their Transdev-paid supervisors ignore safety concerns.\n\nAD\n\nAlbert Ruffin, a Metrobus operator, told board members he is not being given enough time to do pre-trip inspections, while Latrice Smith, another operator, said buses are running with expired registration tags \u2014 indicating they aren\u2019t being regularly inspected.\n\nRider advocates also complained about Metro\u2019s response to the strike, saying commuters should have been given more warning about Thursday morning\u2019s route delays and closures. Metro\u2019s first service alerts on social media came out about 7 a.m.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is yet another issue with WMATA communications where you got something that was theoretically going to happen today but the warning, the alert on this, wasn\u2019t sent out until early this morning after a lot of people who have already started their commute,\u201d said Andrew Kierig, vice chair of Metro\u2019s Riders\u2019 Advisory Council.\n\nWiedefeld said Metro got word out as quickly as it could after Transdev assessed just how many workers it had available Thursday morning.\n\nAD", "description": "The workers, who plan to continue the strike on Friday, are from the Cinder Bed Bus garage in Lorton, a privately run Metro bus garage managed by Transdev, a French multinational company.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "Justin George", "Transportation Reporter Focusing On National Transit", "Metro", "The D.C.-Area Public Transportation System"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mByBvgYHkhxZizoEGc1WvMSZvjo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LHALKGCCS5CXDJPMWTHFFZNU24.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
