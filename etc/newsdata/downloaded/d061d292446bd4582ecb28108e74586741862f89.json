But everyone is complicit in that.\"\n\nThe actor made clear that he doesn't want to tell anyone how to live their life and we can all make our own \"individual choices.\" But, he offered some guidance for those who want to see change.\n\n\"You have to put pressures on your government to try and structure something that gives us and our children some kind of a future of hope that is in action and not just words,\" Cumberbatch said.\n\nSome of those actions, he urged, is a reduction in carbon emission before we \"run out of time.\"\n\nCumberbatch recently joined thousands of climate change protesters at an Extinction Rebellion protest in London's Trafalgar Square last week. They have been popping up all over the city, including at the Canning Station tube top, where one protester climbed atop a train, only to have Londoners throw him to the ground and pummel him for interrupting their commutes.\n\nMichael Shannon, who stars opposite Cumberbatch in \"The Current War\" as George Westinghouse, joined him at \"The View\" to chat about his own climate change activism. He shared photos from a recent trip where he took his children to hear a speech from Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nOther celebrities like Jane Fonda and Sam Waterston, who star together on the Netflix series \"Grace and Frankie,\" have been willing to go to jail for the cause. Fonda has been arrested two Fridays in a row now protesting in front of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Waterston joined her this past Friday.", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:19:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/177/f789288c-8854-48a7-a567-8f5157b65745.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
