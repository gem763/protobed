Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have gone above and beyond past Democrat candidates in their vows to drive a large migration to the country.\n\nThat increase in immigration would likely have significant consequences for states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. As research by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Axios, experts, and demographers has repeatedly discovered, an increase in the foreign-born population via immigration inevitably translates to an increase in likely Democrat voters.\n\nAt current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is already on track to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters\u2019 swing towards Democrats has already been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nWarren has portrayed her run for president as a populist movement, similar to that of Sanders\u2019 and Trump\u2019s campaigns in the 2016 presidential election, but her immigration platform is a carbon copy of the donor class\u2019s and Washington, D.C. beltway\u2019s longtime effort to force down wages for Americans by increasing legal immigration levels.\n\nAside from promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and provide free taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, Warren is seeking to gift the big business lobby with a massive increase in legal immigration \u2014 levels which are already historically high, as at least 1.2 million legal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year.\n\nThat increase in legal immigration, Warren has said, will include an increase in chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. Today, chain migration makes up more than 70 percent of all legal immigration, and in the last decade the process has brought almost 10 million foreign nationals to the U.S.\n\nLike her legal immigration agenda, Warren plans to surge refugee resettlement to the country by at least 700 percent. As Breitbart News has chronicled, mass fraud is prevalent in the refugee system, with African refugees often fraudulently obtaining refugee status.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nBiden has been less direct about his plan to increase immigration to the U.S.\n\nLike the majority of 2020 Democrats, he has endorsed providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, a plan that healthcare experts have said will drive a migration of illegal aliens with \u201cserious health problems\u201d to the country.\n\nBiden\u2019s strategy to increase immigration, though, has been to provide green cards to all foreign students who graduate from American universities and to bring as many legal immigrants to the country as feasibly possible \u2014 regardless of its impacts on U.S. citizens and workers.\n\nBiden said in August:\n\nWe could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need \u2026 is absolutely bizarre \u2026 I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, while speaking to the financial industry, Biden touted a plan to increase the number of H-1B foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to replace American workers.\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nSanders has on occasion denounced the idea of open borders, calling such a policy a \u201cKoch brothers proposal\u201d to drive down the wages of American workers by forcing them to compete against the world\u2019s workforce.\n\n\u201cIt would make everybody in America poorer,\u201d Sanders said in 2015 of open borders. Sanders has revisited that sentiment in his 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 even calling for more detention space for border crossers to end Catch and Release \u2014 but his broader immigration plan reflects that of the open borders lobby.\n\nFor example, Sanders\u2019 latest plan ends deportations of illegal aliens and border crossers, decriminalizes illegal immigration, and promotes the DREAM Act, which would provide amnesty to the majority of illegal aliens currently living in the U.S., creating a new flood of legalized foreign labor that American workers would be forced to compete against.\n\nWhere Sanders has differed from his two top contenders is on his plan to make subtle changes to the H-1B visa system and prevent American workers from having to compete against illegal aliens for U.S. jobs.\n\nLike Trump, Sanders has warned against corporations using the H-1B visa program to import cheaper foreign workers instead of hiring qualified and job-ready Americans.\n\nOut of all the 2020 Democrats running for president, Sanders is the only candidate who earns a \u201cmixed\u201d review from NumbersUSA\u2019s scorecard, the organization that tracks the records of politicians on whether or not they support less immigration to boost wages and job opportunities for Americans.\n\nSanders is the only 2020 Democrat that has mostly endorsed nationwide mandatory E-Verify to ban U.S. companies from hiring illegal aliens over American citizens. Nonetheless, Sanders\u2019 support for mass amnesty, critics have said, will mean that those illegal aliens currently in the country would be able to eventually compete against Americans in the workforce and pass through the E-Verify system.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
