Schalke, who ended a four-game winning streak in the league, are also on 14 points.\n\nBorussia Moenchengladbach, on 13, take on Augsburg on Sunday and will go top with a win.\n\nHoffenheim had a golden chance after four minutes in Munich but Adamyan, who joined this season from second division Regensburg, hesitated in his one-on-one with keeper Manuel Neuer to allow Jerome Boateng to clear at the last moment.\n\nBayern did not come near their midweek European form and apart from some good chances in the first half never showed the kind of clinical finish that saw them fire seven goal past Tottenham.\n\nAdamyan made amends in the 54th minute when he fired in from a tight angle to surprise Neuer after Corentin Tolisso had lost possession in his own half.\n\nLewandowski grabbed his 11th goal of the campaign with a well-timed header after Bayern upped the pressure in search of an equaliser.\n\nAdamyan, however, crowned his first start for Hoffenheim with his second Bundesliga goal in the 79th, beating Neuer once more with a low shot, to give his team their first win in Munich and their first three points since late August.\n\nSchalke thought they had won their game when Suat Serdar nodded in at the far post in the 75th minute but, like their Ruhr valley rivals Dortmund earlier on Saturday, they failed to hang on to their lead.\n\nSchalke\u2019s Guido Burgstaller hit the post in the 88th but it was Cologne who scored with Hector\u2019s header in stoppage time for a deserved equaliser. Hector had earlier almost scored an own goal, heading a clearance on to the post.", "description": "Hoffenheim's Sargis Adamyan scored his first two Bundesliga goals to stun hosts Bayern Munich 2-1 on Saturday and earn his side's maiden win in Munich.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437469579&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940HG", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
