The building will have player and coaches\u2019 access to the adjacent XFinity Center.\n\nThis training facility will keep both our basketball programs ahead of the curve and at the top of their games,\u201d Maryland women\u2019s basketball coach Brenda Frese said in a statement. \u201cWe always strive to be the best and this facility will represent that. In my 17 years at Maryland, the support we\u2019ve received is incredible and I know our fans will love seeing our programs work out of the best facility in the country.\n\nThrough private funds, the school has reportedly raised $19 million for the project, which does not have a scheduled completion date.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
