Washington sees the Kurdish militias as key allies against ISIS, but Ankara regards them as enablers of the Turkish Kurd separatists that have been battling with Turkey since the 1980s.\n\nThe announcement omitted any meaningful details, such as key parameters for the zone or who will be in charge of actually maintaining security within the area. Perhaps that should not be too surprising. After all, the problem the agreement seeks to resolve is excruciatingly complex and impervious to easy answers or quick solutions.\n\nUpwards of four million Syrian refugees have flooded into Turkey. Turkey wants to establish a safe area so it can start to relocate refugees, easing the strain it has put on Turkey\u2019s domestic resources, not to mention the political problems it would rather not have. But in Turkey\u2019s calculations, the safe zone doubles as an opportunity to push the Syrian Kurds farther away from Turkey\u2019s border, thus making it harder for some monolithic Kurdish entity to assert itself in claiming Turkey\u2019s eastern lands. So the agreement represents a potential double-win for Turkey, but at the expense of the Kurds.\n\nThe Kurds are beset on all sides. The Turks view them as terrorists who seek to carve out a homeland that would claim a part of Turkey; the government of Syria views them in a similar way, an obstacle to Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s complete control of the country that he has vowed to reclaim \u201cevery inch\u201d of.\n\nCompetitors within the region include what remains of the Islamic State, lethal elements of Al Qaeda, large numbers of opposition fighters from other Islamist extremist groups, Iranian troublemakers, and pro-Iranian militias (including Hezbollah operatives). All of these players battle constantly for control of what little working infrastructure remains, with the Kurds caught in the middle.\n\nThe United States wants to relieve suffering and prevent the Kurds from being exterminated. But the United States is also practical and fully cognizant that the Kurds are good fighters and the most effective local means through which to attack terror groups that pose a threat to U.S. interests.\n\nAs for the Syrian Kurds, their survival is at stake and can only be secured by maintaining an effective claim on a homeland that, by its nature, sustains the \u201cthreat\u201d perceived by all of the other actors in this bloody play.\n\nThe lack of agreement on who will do what to create and maintain this safe zone also highlights the complexity of the U.S.-Turkey relationship. Both are members of NATO and the United States depends on the use of military facilities hosted by the Turks. Yet Turkey has pushed forward in acquiring the advanced S-400 air defense radar/missile system from Russia in spite of U.S. concerns about the threat it poses to America\u2019s newest fighter jet program, the F-35. Turkey has been a part of the program since its beginning and was slated to receive one hundred fighters. But now, Turkey has been barred from acquiring the fighter jets or participating in the production of components for the F-35 program.\n\nSo what to do? That Syria\u2019s refugees need a sanctuary as long as the civil war rages is a given. And the Kurds are valuable partners in America\u2019s efforts to fight ISIS and contain Iranian influence. Washington should not allow them to fall prey to Syria\u2019s brutal regime or its Iranian backers.\n\nThe United States cannot completely quit the region because of the larger security risks presented by an assortment of terrorist groups and Iran\u2019s designs to entrench itself in Syria and open up a new front on the borders of Israel. The United States should seek to mediate between Turkey and Syrian Kurds, just as it played a role in fostering better relations between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds.\n\nAs frustrating, drawn-out, and unsatisfactory as all of this is, a \u201cleast bad\u201d outcome is far preferable to slaughter, ethnic cleansing, broken alliances, and a region plunged deeper into chaos. That\u2019s the nature of intractable problems; it is often the nature of regional relations, and it highlights the importance of patient, focused, and artful diplomacy.", "description": "The State Department\u00a0announced\u00a0early this month that U.S. and Turkish military delegations had reached an agreement on establishing a\u00a0safe area in northern Syria\u00a0for refugees fleeing the fighting that has devastated that country since 2011.", "authors": ["James Phillips", "Commentary By", "Senior Research Fellow", "The Heritage Foundation", "Defense Programs"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-1161809334.jpg?itok=UskU7MZC"}
