She was at the local police station. She said she had filed a police complaint but, fearing her husband would murder her, she had asked the police to accompany her home to safely retrieve her possessions before leaving. But the police refused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the police station? You\u2019re in danger. Your husband is at home. The police can accompany you,\u201d the operator assured the caller.\n\nThe woman said that the police were refusing to do so. Macron looked visibly angered and shook his head, but remained silent.\n\n\u201cThey have to help a person in danger,\u201d the operator insisted and asked to speak to the police officer.\n\nIn a call that lasted 15 minutes, the operator attempted in vain to persuade the gendarme to help, but the officer insisted it wasn\u2019t his place to intervene. Unaware that the president was listening in, the officer said \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that he would need a judicial order to accompany the woman.\n\nMacron silently shook his head and wrote a note on a piece of paper, handing it to the operator.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the gendarme\u2019s job to protect her when there is a clear risk,\u201d with or without any extra judicial permission, the note said.\n\nThe hotline operator continued to press the officer, at one point saying: \u201cThis woman is under threat of death, are you waiting until she\u2019s actually killed?\u201d\n\nBut the officer refused to act.\n\nAfter the call, an exasperated Macron asked: \u201cDoes that happen often?\u201d\n\nThe operator, who had been working on the hotline for over 20 years, said: \u201cOh yes, more and more frequently.\u201d\n\nCaroline de Haas, a feminist campaigner, said the incident showed the dangerous lack of training among state professionals: \u201cI hope that Emmanuel Macron, now he has been confronted with the daily reality for women experiencing domestic violence, will take initiatives to improve things on the ground. He has said it himself \u2013 this is a problem with training, professionals are not properly trained in how to detect domestic violence or how to respond to women who are victims of it.\u201d\n\nShe said Macron did not need to change laws or make decrees, but he must increase funding.", "description": "French president\u2019s visit to hotline was supposed to showcase crackdown on domestic violence", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350f35d563a68a944a32c2693507b7734a8af09e/2400_43_2727_1636/master/2727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=253664a3af6559263d2e8b48155ff539"}
