(In 2018, many large supermarket chains in the U.K. voluntarily banned the sale of energy drinks to anyone under 16, reported the BBC.)\n\n\u201cThe laws on them should be the same as the laws on alcohol,\u201d he told SWNS. \u201cI won\u2019t touch one again, and my daughter is now banned from having them.\u201d\n\nPENNY-SIZED BATTERY FOUND LODGED IN 2-YEAR-OLD'S THROAT: 'I NEARLY LOST MY LITTLE GIRL'\n\nEnergy drinks typically contain large amounts of caffeine, added sugars, other additives and legal stimulants such as guarana, taurine, and L-carnitine, which can increase alertness, attention and energy. However, they may also raise blood pressure, heart rate and breathing. The ingredients can also have a harmful effect on the nervous system, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLewis\u2019 heart rate returned to normal the following day, but he said he faces further testing to see if there is any lasting damage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit worn out, but it could have been very nasty indeed,\u201d he told SWNS.", "description": "He said within minutes of finishing his drink he felt sweaty and his heart was skipping beats.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/energy_drink.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
