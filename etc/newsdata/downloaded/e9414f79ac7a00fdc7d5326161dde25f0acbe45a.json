It seeks to recoup the $130,000 that the city says the police department spent to investigate Smollett\u2019s claim that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in January.\n\nKendall rejected the argument made by the former Empire actor\u2019s attorneys that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Smollett could not have known how much time and money the police would spend investigating his allegations.\n\nPolice maintain that Smollett staged the attack, but the actor says it was real.\n\nProsecutors charged Smollett with lying to the police but abruptly dropped the charges weeks later, angering the police department and mayor\u2019s office.", "description": "A federal judge has refused to dismiss Chicago\u2019s lawsuit against former \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/GettyImages-692063812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
