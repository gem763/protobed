It was his 350th wicket in 66 tests and he equaled Sri Lankan great Muttiah Muralitharan as joint quickest to reach the milestone.\n\nShami then got into the act and bowled Temba Bavuma second ball for no score.\n\nAiden Markram (39) and Faf du Plessis (13) provided some resistance and pushed the score past 50, after which the Proteas completely collapsed.\n\nFirst, du Plessis was bowled off Shami in the 22nd over, shouldering arms to an incoming delivery. Two overs later, Shami bowled first inning's centurion Quinton de Kock (0).\n\nSouth Africa's Temba Bavumal is bowled by India's Mohammed Shami during the fifth day of the first cricket test match against India in Visakhapatnam, India, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.

In the final ball of the over he had Keshav Maharaj (0) also out lbw.\n\nPlay was extended by 15 minutes considering the possibility for an early result. But Senuran Muthusamy (19 not out) and Dane Piedt (32 not out) managed to defy the Indian bowling with a 47-run partnership.\n\nPiedt hit five fours and a six, with the latter breaking the record for the most sixes in a test match, passing the previous best of 35 set during a test between Pakistan and New Zealand in Sharjah in 2014 .\n\n___\n\nMore AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSouth Africa's captain Faf du Plessis reacts after being dismissed by India's Mohammed Shami during the fifth day of the first cricket test match against India in Visakhapatnam, India, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.
