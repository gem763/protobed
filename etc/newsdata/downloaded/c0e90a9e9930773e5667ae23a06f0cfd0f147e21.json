The allegations overshadowed the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference which opened on Sunday.\n\nCharlotte Edwardes, a columnist, wrote in The Sunday Times that Johnson had groped her at a lunch in 1999 when he was editor of The Spectator magazine.\n\n\u201cUnder the table, I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze,\u201d Edwardes wrote. \u201cHis hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\u201d\n\nEdwardes said that after the meal, she confided in another woman who had sat on the other side of Johnson. The other woman said Johnson had also groped her, Edwardes said.\n\nAsked in a television interview if he had inappropriately touched her thigh as she reported, Johnson said: \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nWhen subsequently asked if she had made up the account, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m just saying what I said, and I think what the public want to hear is what we are doing for them and the country and for investment in ways of uniting the country.\u201d\n\nAsked if the allegations were overshadowing the conference, he said \u201cNot at all. I think what the public want to hear is what we\u2019re doing to bring the country together and get on with improving their lives.\u201d\n\nAfter a denial by a Downing Street spokesman, Edwardes said on Twitter: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nLondon\u2019s Labour-run local government said on Friday it had referred Johnson to Britain\u2019s police watchdog for potential investigation over allegations of misconduct involving a U.S. businesswoman while he was mayor of London.\n\nThe referral follows allegations, first reported by The Sunday Times, that when Johnson was mayor, he failed to declare close personal links to tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, who received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips.\n\nAsked about the London referral, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister as mayor of London did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied on Monday that he had inappropriately touched a female journalist 20 years ago, and said the public were more interested in hearing about his plans for public services.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435498862&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0BP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
