In addition to the investment banks tasked with selling Aramco stock, the pot will also be shared with other professional parties including accountants and advertising agencies, two of the people said.\n\nThe payment would represent a fee of about 1% on the roughly $40 billion Aramco is seeking to raise -- relatively low compared to other markets. Among the underwriters on the deal, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are expected to be paid the most, the people said.\n\nThe final amount paid to banks will depend on how much Aramco raises, they said. A representative for Aramco declined to comment.\n\nInvestment bankers from around the world have been pitching for years to win a coveted role on Aramco\u2019s IPO. Many firms have been investing heavily into the kingdom on expectations of a fee bonanza as the country diversifies away from oil. Many have been left disappointed though as deals have been delayed or failed to materialize.\n\nFalling Short\n\nEven though Aramco\u2019s would be one of the biggest fee pools for investment banks, it would still fall short of the $535 million SoftBank Group Corp. paid when it raised $21 billion by selling shares in its Japanese telecommunications business last year.\n\nStill, perhaps bankers shouldn\u2019t complain too much. When Saudi Arabia\u2019s National Commercial Bank raised $6 billion in its 2014 IPO, advisers including HSBC and Gulf International Bank were paid just 0.1% of the offering value.\n\nAramco\u2019s board is planning to meet with its advisers on the IPO around Oct. 17 to give final approval for the share sale, according to other people familiar with the matter. Aramco is speeding up preparations for the IPO with an aim of listing on the Saudi bourse as soon as November, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nThe draw of working on what\u2019s set to be the world\u2019s biggest IPO -- even for relatively low compensation -- has attracted some of the top Wall Street names. Aramco appointed nine global co-coordinators, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG. There are also 15 book runners and three financial advisers.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. paid $300 million to banks when it raised $25 billion in the biggest IPO to date.", "description": "Payment would represent fee of about one percent on amount Aramco is seeking - relatively low compared to other markets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/26/e20c5a00946e40a186bc1efcdfd7736c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
