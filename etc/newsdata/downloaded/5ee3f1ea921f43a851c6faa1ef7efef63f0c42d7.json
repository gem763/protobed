ABC News\u2019 Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross\u2019 false Russia reporting was so bad it actually tanked the stock market.\n\nThis week, ABC News outdid itself. It used video of shooting at a gun range in Kentucky and said it showed an attack by Turkish forces on Kurds in Syria. This made Trump look bad and potentially escalated the conflict.\n\nTRUMP SAYS ABC NEWS \u2018OWES AN APOLOGY\u2019 FOR MISTAKING KENTUCKY GUN RANGE VIDEO FOR TURKISH BOMBING OF SYRIA\n\nIt appears someone at ABC may have tried to get the U.S. into a war. But the press downplayed the incident as an accident. The incident resembled the plot from the movie \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d except the movie had better writing than ABC.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened. Sunday\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d featured a report called \u201cSlaughter in Syria,\u201d with weekend anchor Tom Llamas reporting. He talked while a video appeared on screen apparently showing a massive gun battle peppered with explosions.\n\nDescribing the scene, words on the screen said: \u2018CRISIS IN SYRIA, ISIS prisoners escape as death toll rises in attack.\u201d\n\nLlamas described the U.S. troop pullout from the Syria-Turkey border as \u201ceffectively abandoning America\u2019s allies in the fight against ISIS.\u201d Then he explained what looked like a terrifying scene.\n\n\u201cThis video right here appearing to be showing Turkey\u2019s military bombing Kurdish civilians in a Syrian border town,\u201d Llamas said. \u201cThe Kurds, who fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS \u2013 now horrific reports of atrocities committed by Turkish-backed fighters on those very allies.\u201d\n\nThe video was so powerful that ABC used it again on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d the next day. This time, correspondent Ian Pannell told viewers: \u201cThis video obtained by ABC News appears to show the fury of the Turkish attack on the border town.\u201d\n\nAppears. But as the old saying goes, appearances can be deceiving \u2013 and they certainly were in this case. Extraordinarily deceiving, in fact.\n\nSure, it was amazing video. Lots of guns going off. Lots of things exploding. But it wasn\u2019t a battle scene. The video was from a nighttime machine-gun shoot at the Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Ky. \u2013 not Syria.\n\nSocial media posters recognized the video wasn\u2019t from Syria and other news outlets reported the shocking incident. ABC issued Twitter corrections, because that\u2019s what outlets do when they are too embarrassed to tell viewers. The correction stated the network removed the video \u201cafter questions were raised about its accuracy.\u201d Naturally, \u201cABC News regrets the error.\u201d\n\nMore like ABC appears to regret the error.\n\nThis was briefly a big controversy. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter called it \u201ca big black eye for ABC News.\u201d Even The New York Times noted that \u201cABC News did not specify how the error had occurred.\u201d\n\nJournalism\u2019s Poynter Institute added: \u201cInto that vacuum of non-information rushed a familiar barrage of cynical accusations.\u201d Then it proceeded to rationalize how showing the wrong video was simply an accident, because there was no proof it wasn\u2019t.\n\nPoynter insisted that \u201cknowingly misrepresenting anything is not in the interest of a standards-based news organization.\u201d Of course, the standards-based news organization also tanked the stock market in its desperate attempt to get Trump.\n\nThe president called the ABC blunder \u201ca big scandal\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d He\u2019s right. And, perhaps, those who simply say that \u201caccidents happen\u201d might be right as well. ABC hasn\u2019t elaborated and has already proved itself untrustworthy.\n\nYou notice how the news media don\u2019t make big errors that help Trump? Instead, they assume the worst and ignore one of journalism\u2019s cardinal rules \u2013 when a story seems too good to be true, it usually is.\n\nABC leaves viewers with only two disturbing choices. It is either trying to destabilize the Mideast and cause a war with NATO ally Turkey or it employs idiots who are easily duped and bosses who don\u2019t even bother to verify the video they run.\n\nBoth choices say a lot about journalism in 2019.\n\nFinger-pointing at Trump and Obama gets different reactions\n\nWe turn from \u201cWag the Dog\u201d to wag the finger. Only no two digits are alike when it comes to the press.\n\nThis week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stood across from Trump at a crowded conference table and pointed her finger. The media couldn\u2019t wait to celebrate Pelosi\u2019s victory over Trump and evil men. CNN ran a video from correspondent Dana Bash headlined: \u201cLook at Pelosi standing up to Trump at table of all men.\u201d\n\nThat was a common theme. Give credit to the Washington Free Beacon\u2019s Andrew Kugle, who captured all sorts of examples of finger-pointing fandom. Only he paired it with media outlets up in arms when then-Gov. Jan Brewer, R-Ariz., treated then-President Barack Obama in the same manner back in 2012.\n\nJournalists were furious at Brewer for allegedly disrespecting the president who they voted for and adored. Some even turned it into a racial incident. Jack Cafferty, then of CNN, summed up that view with the comment: \u201cAll that many saw in that famous photograph was a white woman wagging her finger at the first black president.\u201d\n\nBrewer took to Twitter to underscore the double-digit, double-standard. \u201cThe news media hails @SpeakerPelosi as a hero for pointing her finger at @POTUS @realDonaldTrump but when I stood up to @BarackObama I was vilified as rude and racist. Such Hypocrites!\u201d Brewer wrote.\n\nAnd she\u2019s right. Both times the media were giving the finger to honest journalism.\n\nFree press hates free speech\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to Georgetown University this week and gave a pivotal address on free expression. He paired it with a Washington Post op-ed, both times calling for \u201cthe freedom for people to express themselves.\u201d And the news media were furious about it.\n\nThink about that.\n\nFacebook wasn\u2019t subtle. It headlined his speech on its own site as \u201cMark Zuckerberg Stands for Voice and Free Expression.\u201d It\u2019s long past time that Big Tech did just that.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTo be fair, Zuckerberg also called for governments to deliver \u201cnew regulation in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.\u201d\n\nGiven the tendency of governments to restrict freedom (China!) that could become a global nightmare, just as it\u2019s becoming one in Europe. Letting government just decide so-called \u201chate speech\u201d would torch online free speech.\n\nJournalists were critical of Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201ccontroversial\u201d speech. \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Anthony Mason was typical: \u201cComing up, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s controversial comments about censoring politicians.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere are reasons why the press is upset about \u201ccontroversial\u201d speech. A Politico article by reporter Ryan Lizza this week noted how the big social media companies are viewed as dangerous to the left. \u201cA consensus is emerging in Democratic politics that these platforms are the greatest threat to the party\u2019s eventual nominee,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s because the left doesn\u2019t dominate social media the way it does traditional news. That\u2019s a big reason why journalists want Zuckerberg and others to restrict political speech. They want to beat Trump in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "ABC News used video of shooting at a gun range in Kentucky and said it showed an attack by Turkish forces on Kurds in Syria.
