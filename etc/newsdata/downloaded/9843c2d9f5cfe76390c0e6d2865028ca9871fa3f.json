Those with a higher DTI have a lower proportion of disposable income.\n\nThat means a high DTI borrower could be more vulnerable to adverse changes in their personal circumstances or loan conditions.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank, the level of household debt to income has exceeded 190 per cent for the first time. The level of housing debt to income is at an all-time high of more than 140 per cent.\n\nUnder the planned ANZ policy, applicants with a DTI ratio of more than nine will be rejected.\n\nFor example, an applicant with total debt of $650,000 and total income of $100,000 has debt of 6.5 times their income.\n\nAn applicant who fails to meet the criteria will be required to either lower their debt or increase income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypes of liabilities included in the calculation range from personal loans to credit cards, car loans and all other personal debt. National Australia Bank introduced a similar DTI test in April.\n\nFrom Monday, the bank will also be changing its mining town policy to improve the accuracy of managing risks in vulnerable economic regions.\n\nIn the past, major lenders have effectively black-banned entire regions by flagging postcodes as being too risky. The new strategy will enable the bank to identify individual towns and according to the bank, the number of postcodes affected will be reduced from 47 to 44.\n\nLoan applicants in riskier towns will have their loan-to-value ratio capped at 70 per cent for new lending on owner occupier, investment loans and lines of credit. Rental yield is capped at 8 per cent for determining the capacity to service debt.", "description": "ANZ is set to follow Westpac's lead and tighten scrutiny of new borrowers to weed out candidates who understate their expenses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4bea58e8636ccb276357110df9fb0169bd63de99", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
