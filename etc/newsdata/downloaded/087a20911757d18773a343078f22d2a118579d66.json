He is expected to miss the rest of this month, but the team said Monday he will continue his rehab in hopes of playing in October.\n\nThe slumping Cubs headed into their series opener at San Diego in the NL\u2019s second wild-card slot.\n\nB\u00e1ez got hurt on a headfirst slide into second base during a 4-0 loss to Milwaukee on Sept. 1. He is batting .281 with 29 homers and 85 RBIs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to wait on Javy,\u201d manager Joe Maddon said.\n\nWith B\u00e1ez and Addison Russell sidelined, touted prospect Nico Hoerner was promoted from Double-A Tennessee and got the start against the Padres.\n\nThe Cubs also recalled right-hander James Norwood from Triple-A Iowa. To make room for Hoerner on the 40-man roster, lefty Randy Rosario was designated for assignment.\n\nRight-hander Adbert Alzolay was optioned to Class A South Bend after Sunday\u2019s loss at Milwaukee.\n\nRussell was hit in the head by a pitch from Adrian Houser during the series finale against the Brewers. Maddon said the Cubs would know more about Russell\u2019s condition after he is seen by a local doctor.\n\nThe 22-year-old Hoerner was selected in the first round of last year\u2019s draft out of Stanford. He is the first member of the 2018 draft class to join a big league roster.\n\nHoerner hit .284 with three homers and 22 RBIs with Tennessee. He was limited to 70 games due to a broken left wrist.\n\nHe is the first Cubs prospect to make the jump from Double-A to the majors since Kyle Schwarber in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that stands out about him is a lot of self-confidence,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cNot in a braggart way, just a self-confident young man. From the moment I met him, he gave me the impression that he thought he belongs here, which I love.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in his own skin. I anticipate a good result. I know one thing, he\u2019s going to play hard and he thinks things through very well. He\u2019s one of those guys who has great makeup.\u201d\n\nMaddon also said third baseman Kris Bryant, who had a cortisone shot in his sore right knee on Sunday, might be able to play Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All-Star shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez could return to the Chicago Cubs if they reach the playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/brewers_cubs_baseball_79416_c0-229-5478-3422_s1770x1032.jpg?a5b8932ee33985171ffc73b5f2fad0b33d00b414", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
