This generation that some experts warned could be destined to rent forever is actually America's biggest group of homebuyers. But the situation is a lot more stable in some places than in others. In some metro areas, high costs keep millennials from buying, or there aren't enough good jobs for prospective buyers to get approved for mortgages. Other areas offer the right mix of affordability and, usually, higher-than-normal salaries \u2014 and those places are generally where 20- and 30-somethings are becoming owners. Based on our analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Zillow on salary, home prices, and the share of homes owned by people aged 21 to 38, here's our list of the top 10 metro areas where millennials can actually afford to buy homes. On average, millennials in these top 10 metros are 25% more likely to own a home than their peers across the country.\n\nMetro areas where millennials can afford to buy homes\n\nDes Moines, Iowa Grand Rapids, Michigan Wichita, Kansas Omaha, Nebraska Toledo, Ohio Dayton, Ohio Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Little Rock, Arkansas St. Louis, Missouri Syracuse, New York The places that topped our ranking on average have 3% lower earnings for folks age 25 to 44, a range that includes most millennials. They make up for it, however, with home prices that are 38% lower than the national median list price of $291,900, according to Zillow. That's much better bang for the buck.

Wichita, at No. 3, is home to the corporate headquarters of Koch Industries, the country's second-largest private firm. And paychecks stretch a lot further in Wichita, where the median list price, $184,900, is 44% lower the nationwide median. In Des Moines, which ranks No. 1, as it does on our list of the top 10 cities where millennials are doing the best financially, the unemployment rate is just 2.1%. Millennial median household income in Des Moines is $78,200, or 17% higher than the nationwide figure, while housing prices are 20% lower.\n\nAny buyer that comes in and starts looking at what it cost to rent vs. buy and weighing the options, they'll see it's better to own.

The 25-year-old's digital marketing employer in Chicago allowed him to work remotely, so he started researching where his dollars would go the furthest. He didn't have to go far: In November he bought a home in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which ranks No. 2 on our list. \"For the same price as a little 600-square-foot box in Chicago, you get a full two-story home in Grand Rapids,\" Kranker said. He snagged a home for just $180,000. \"I have definitely felt the cost savings. My grocery bill went from $115 per week to $45 per week. And that's more money you can put towards mortgage payments.\" That helps explain why eight of the top 10 metros we ranked are located in more affordable Midwestern states.\n\nHere, a mortgage payment can be less than rent", "description": "We ranked the 10 best metro areas for millennials hoping to buy a home.
