Unsurprisingly, it shows that Trump\u2019s reckless spending policy is accelerating America\u2019s descent to Greek-style fiscal profligacy.\n\nMost people are focusing on the estimates of additional red ink, but I point out in this interview that the real problem is spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome folks also are highlighting the fact that CBO isn\u2019t projecting a recession, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s important for the simple fact that all economists are bad at making short-run economic predictions.\n\nThat being said, I think CBO\u2019s long-run fiscal forecasts are worthy of close attention (unfortunately, I didn\u2019t state this very clearly in the interview).\n\nAnd what worries me is that the numbers show that government spending will be consuming an ever-larger share of the nation\u2019s economic output.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not time to give up.\n\nModest spending restraint (i.e., obeying the Golden Rule of fiscal policy) generates very good results in a remarkably short period of time.\n\nWhat matters most is reducing the burden of spending. But when you address the problem of government spending (as the chart shows), you also solve the symptom of red ink.\n\nThe challenge, of course, is convincing politicians that spending should be frozen. Or, at the very least, that it should only grow at a modest pace.\n\nWe have enjoyed periods of spending restraint, including a five-year spending freeze under Obama, as well as some fiscal discipline under both Reagan and Clinton.\n\nBut if we want long-run spending discipline, we need a comprehensive spending cap, sort of like the very successful systems in Hong Kong and Switzerland.", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) just released its\u00a0new 10-year forecast. .09/02/2019 3:22:30AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
