So did Michigan . Same with Pennsylvania .\n\nSo Castro\u2019s statement is off.\n\nHowever, these states still have economic struggles. Pennsylvania has lost factory jobs since the end of 2018. So has Michigan . And Ohio has shed 100 factory jobs so far this year.\n\n__\n\nELIZABETH WARREN, senator from Massachusetts: \u201cMueller had shown to a fare-thee-well that this president obstructed justice.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not exactly what special counsel Robert Mueller showed.\n\nIt\u2019s true that prosecutors examined more than 10 episodes for evidence of obstruction of justice, and that they did illustrate efforts by President Donald Trump to stymie the Russia investigation or take control of it.\n\nBut ultimately, Mueller did not reach a conclusion as to whether the president obstructed justice or broke any other law. He cited Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president, and said that since he could not bring charges against Trump, it was unfair to accuse him of a crime. There was no definitive finding that he obstructed justice.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Cal Woodward, Josh Boak, Eric Tucker and Amanda Seitz contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactChecketu\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Twelve Democrats seeking the presidency tussled Tuesday night in a wide-ranging debate featuring the largest number of qualifying candidates on the same stage.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/election_2020_debate_62703_c0-157-3773-2357_s1200x700.jpg?1785c905d38005196c0e12e989eb83e74f3318b3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
