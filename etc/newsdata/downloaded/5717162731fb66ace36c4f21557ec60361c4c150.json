It appeared in a school yearbook, while Trudeau, then 29, was working as a teacher at West Point Grey Academy.\n\n\u201cI apologise profoundly,\u201d said the Canadian prime minister on Wednesday night after the photograph was published. \u201cI regret it deeply. I\u2019m deeply sorry I did that, I should have known better.\u201d\n\nTIME (@TIME) Exclusive: Justin Trudeau wore brownface at 2001 \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party while he taught at a private school, Canada's Liberal Party admits https://t.co/j3UobfYNIF\n\n\u201cIt was something I should not have done. I didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.\u201d\n\nTrudeau did not answer a question about whether he had considered resigning.\n\n\u201cIn 2001, when I was a teacher in Vancouver, I attended an end-of-year gala, the theme was Arabian nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I should have known better, but I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nPolitical rivals seized on the opportunity to attack the prime minister, issuing scathing condemnations following revelations of the damning image.\n\nAndrew Scheer, the Conservative leader and Trudeau\u2019s main opponent, said he was \u201cextremely shocked and disappointed\u201d at the actions of the prime minister, calling his rival \u201cunfit\u201d to lead Canada. \u201cIt was racist in 2001, it\u2019s racist now,\u201d he said.\n\nJustin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand Read more\n\nScheer has consistently used the prime minister\u2019s ethical lapses to paint the government as unable to govern effectively. But the Conservative leader has also faced calls to eject his own party members for racist or homophobic statements in recent weeks. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions.\n\nAfter issuing an initial condemnation of the image, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, released a second video, in which he emotionally described the racism he and many others faced growing up in Canada.\n\n\u201cSeeing this image today \u2013 the kids that see this image the people who see this image \u2013 are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt\u2026that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less, because of who they are,\u201d said Singh, the first non-white leader of a major federal party.\n\n\u201cPlease reach out to loved ones. Please reach out to people who are suffering in silence right now. Please let them know they are loved. And they are celebrated for who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was \u201cdeeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe must apologize for the harm done and commit to learning and appreciating the requirement to model social justice leadership at all levels of government,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn this matter he has failed.\u201d\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims said his appearance in brownface was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d, but later thanked the prime minister for apologizing.\n\nIn his apology, the prime minister also confirmed that this was not the first time he had done something like this, saying that when he was in high school he dressed up at a talent show and sang Day O, a traditional Jamaican folk song, \u201cwith makeup on\u201d.\n\n\u201cObviously I regret that I did it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself, obviously.\u201d\n\nHe told reporters he had made numerous calls to friends and colleagues \u2013 and expected to make more on Thursday.\n\nThe incident comes as Trudeau is locked in a fight to maintain his parliamentary majority. Canadians vote on 21 October, in what many expect to be a tight race.\n\nPolling suggests Trudeau and Scheer are deadlocked in the popular vote, but that the Liberals hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.\n\nThe election will be fought against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister, with accusations \u2013 including from the country\u2019s ethics commissioner \u2013 that Trudeau acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.\n\nAfter his election in 2015, Trudeau was hailed for naming a young and ethnically-diverse cabinet, with a ministerial team that for the first time in the country\u2019s history was equally balanced between men and women.\n\nHis cabinet included Maryam Monsef, who fled Afghanistan as a refugee 20 years ago and will oversee the democratic reform portfolio, as well as two Indigenous members of parliament and three Sikh politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be here before you today to present to Canada a cabinet that looks like Canada,\u201d Trudeau said after he was sworn in.\n\nHowever, the Canadian leader has also been criticised for his treatment of Indigenous peoples, particularly in relation to the Trans Mountain pipeline project that the Liberal government has supported despite environmental and Indigenous groups fiercely opposing the project.\n\nIt is unclear how the image will impact the prime minister, who has cultivated a tightly-controlled social media image. When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn\u2019t entertain \u201chypotheticals\u201d and that each incident would be viewed on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d.\n\nWhen asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: \u201cI\u2019m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.\u201d", "description": "Canadian prime minister says he deeply regrets image from 2001 party, which emerges weeks out from election", "authors": ["Kate Lyons", "Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b1f074eec2e757690232a21619aebf48b002da/0_250_3498_2099/master/3498.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3191374ef81ed81416680b4ad1565d64", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
