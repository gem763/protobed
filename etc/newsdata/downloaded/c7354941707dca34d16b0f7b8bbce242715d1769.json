GITEX experts answer", "language": "en", "text": "As the number of people on social media increases, using online platforms to reach consumers is a growing trend for brands around the world.\n\nMore than 3 billion people used social media every month last year, according to a report by networking and management platforms, We Are Social and Hootsuite.\n\nMeaning that 42% of the world\u2019s population is posting, following forums, and scrolling through feeds on a regular basis.\n\nDuring the latest GITEX event, a yearly gathering of global tech experts in the UAE, industry insiders gave their take on effective social media marketing strategies.\n\nDigital anthropologist Dr. Crystal Abidin at GITEX\n\nGETTING THE MESSAGE ACROSS\n\nDigital anthropologist Dr. Crystal Abidin shared her latest research on influencer marketing.\n\nShe explained how marketeers, and political parties, are weaponizing social media by using shock value to deliver their message.\n\n\u201cYou entertain them by feeding their desire for confession, for gossip,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter the time has passed, you work out a plan to de-escalate, to drown out the scandal, but still retain people\u2019s interest in your life. Before giving them the gold nugget, which is the policy you want to publish or the product you want to put out sponsored.\u201d\n\nAbidin also discussed the concept of \u201castroturfing\u201d, where advertisers hide sponsored messages or products in picture posts, in a bid to secretly influence viewers.\n\nEmbedding products in Instagram posts is one of the influencer techniques.

Which is exactly the other way around to Europe.\u201d\n\nSzucs flags up the online fashion retailer BrandAlley, which in 2015 saw orders more than double after it created targeted adverts for consumers on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nEmarsys regional director Adam Szucs speaks to Euronews at GITEX\n\nTAPPING A BILLION DOLLAR MARKET\n\nSzucs explains that brands have to pay on average one dollar for every Facebook advert that leads users to its page.\n\nWhich is the equivalent to the price of 40 text messages or 1,600 emails.\n\nThe global digital marketing software market was estimated to be worth about $37.5 billion in 2017, according to U.S based business research group Analytical Research Cognizance.\n\nThe body forecasts that by 2026, the market will more than double in size and value to be worth approximately $90 billion.\n\nSEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA: TECH TRENDS AT GITEX\n\nNauphal from India \u201ctravelled through time\u201d at this tech exhibit at GITEX.\n\nMohamed from Egypt plunged head first into a VR flying experience at the event.\n\nInfluencer Naomi from India had a lightbulb moment at this business incubator stand.\n\nAnd Paul from Britain, had high hopes of this robotic dog doing a breakdance.", "description": "As the number of people on social media increases, using online platforms to reach consumers is a growing trend for brands around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/97/98/1000x563_cmsv2_7432c4d1-8d8c-5397-8f95-75b944a0f0f1-4209798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
