She might have thought it was blown out of proportion, but she certainly didn\u2019t help neutralize its main concern. Clinton used a home-based server for all official business while serving as secretary of state under Obama. It wasn't secure. It was unauthorized. And she might have mishandled classified information. In 2016, as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, this is a story. It was one that killed her numbers with voters. Her endless stream of lies about it also poured fuel on the fire. She said that she had gone to State Department officials for approval and that they signed off on it.\n\nNot true, as stated in the State Department inspector general\u2019s report at the time. Either way, the whole controversy rehashed many of the criticisms that plagued the power couple during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, that being the two are secretive and they think the rules don\u2019t apply to them. Hillary eventually decided to do the one thing that ensures non-stop talk about the server: she nixed doing press conferences.\n\nNow, the State Department has finally concluded their review, where they cite 588 violations by 38 people (via AP):\n\nThe investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were \u201cculpable\u201d in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton\u2019s personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released on Friday. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified. The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases. For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be. Although the report identified violations, it said investigators had found \u201cno persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\u201d However, it also made clear the Clinton\u2019s use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information.\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not forget that Hillary ordered her aide to strip the classified markings on sensitive documents. No one will be going to jail, but Hillary Clinton is not and never will be president of the United States. That\u2019s good enough for me.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/19/2019 6:49:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/6b7d14ff-ab3e-4d3e-8402-120fdd1b18e7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
