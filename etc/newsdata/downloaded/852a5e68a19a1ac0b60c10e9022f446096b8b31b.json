Cory A. Booker on Monday said he doesn\u2019t want to hang around in the presidential race if he\u2019s not in it to win it, after his campaign issued a dire plea over the weekend saying they don\u2019t see a viable path forward if he doesn\u2019t raise an additional $1.7 million by Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cWe have built a campaign to win, but we wanted to be very honest with people,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cThe fourth quarter is when you grow, and if we don\u2019t have the money to grow, we are not going to be able to stay competitive in this race.\u201d\n\nShortly after his appearance, the campaign announced that it had raised more than $500,000 since the warning on Saturday, in its biggest online fundraising weekend of the campaign.\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s campaign had issued a memo saying without a fundraising surge to close out the quarters, \u201cwe do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, I don\u2019t want to stick around if I\u2019m not in this to win it, and so we put out this challenge, nearly $2 million, really for us to stay in this race,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cWe got still a little bit of a hill to climb.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker has qualified for next month\u2019s Democratic debate, but has been polling in the single digits and is well back of leading contenders such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.\n\nBooker campaign manager Addisu Demissie had said in the memo that there are probably only four campaigns with the money necessary to win the nomination, and that as of Saturday, the Booker campaign wasn\u2019t among them.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: This isn\u2019t an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press,\u201d Mr. Demissie said. \u201cThis is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
