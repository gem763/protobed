Helena Christensen shared photos of her lookalike son Mingus on his 20th birthday, and he clearly inherited a few of his mom\u2019s famous traits. Sure, the series of snapshots shared by Christensen suggests that Mingus also slightly favors his dad, The Walking Dead\u2018s Norman Reedus. But no ifs, ands or buts about it \u2014 with each passing year, he looks more and more like his mom.\n\nChristensen posted the birthday tribute to her boy on Instagram Sunday evening, sharing 10 photos ranging from Mingus\u2019 childhood to present-day. \u201cToday is a beautiful day because you were born, 20 years ago! Love you so much,\u201d Christensen captioned the slideshow. Reedus also shared a few images, with his mostly featuring Mingus during the young man\u2019s earlier years. \u201cHappy birthday to the coolest of all time,\u201d the proud dad captioned his photos.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nAnd, heartwarmingly, it\u2019s obvious that Christensen, Reedus and Reedus\u2019 current partner (and the mother of Mingus\u2019 little half-sister) Diane Kruger are all one big happy family. In response to Christensen\u2019s post, Reedus and Kruger both dropped a string of heart emoji. On Reedus\u2019 tribute, Christensen wrote, \u201cOur baby boy is a young man and I love him more than anything.\u201d Sounds like Mingus is one lucky kid, huh?\n\nNot surprisingly, friends and fans pointed out in Christensen\u2019s comment feed just how much the former couple\u2019s son resembles his mother. \u201cHe is your portrait,\u201d one commenter gushed on Christensen\u2019s post, with another writing, \u201cOMG TWINS.\u201d And some marveled over the strength of Christensen\u2019s family genes. \u201cHe is his mother\u2019s son, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s as if you were reborn as a boy,\u201d said one. Another weighed in, \u201cHe looks exactly like you, great DNA.\u201d One even pointed out that Mingus looks like Christensen\u2019s father, who is pictured in the photo tribute. Others speculated that Mingus would go on to become a world-renowned model like his mom.\n\nLet\u2019s be real, though \u2014 there was no losing for this guy. With Christensen as a mother and Reedus as a father, he was destined to be an impossibly beautiful and cool human being.
