Allan Gray, Old Mutual\u2019s second-biggest investor, is against the idea. Sanlam Investment Management wants to wait and see how the court process unfolds, while Prudential Investment Managers reckons a payout of that magnitude would be \u201cegregious.\u201d\n\nMoyo fired the salvo when he issued Old Mutual with a summons seeking damages if he can\u2019t get his job back. The 174-year-old firm shot back, saying it will vigorously defend any claim, and that it was correct to dismiss the CEO. The battle spilled into the open when Moyo was suspended toward the end of May and then fired three weeks later, which he successfully challenged in court as being unfair.\n\n\u201cWe are not opposed to a R250m settlement if it achieves an expedited closure to this unfortunate and costly dispute,\u201d All Weather Capital Chief Investment Officer Shane Watkins said in response to emailed questions. The board should then independently re-evaluate whether Trevor Manuel should continue as chairman, he said.\n\n\u201cThe board has handled this matter appallingly and changes are necessary and desirable,\u201d Watkins said. All Weather Capital holds about R300m of shares in Old Mutual.\n\nWhile Prudential Investment Managers, which owns 4% of Old Mutual, would prefer an out-of-court settlement to a long legal process with \u201cuncertain outcomes,\u201d the price is too high, said the Cape Town-based company\u2019s head of equity Johny Lambridis.\n\n'Particularly excessive'\n\n\u201cIt appears particularly excessive in a society like ours that is plagued with inequality,\u201d he said. It \u201cunfortunately speaks to the fact that executive pay in South Africa and globally has grown to levels dangerously out of kilter with what society seems willing to tolerate and what shareholders are willing to pay.\u201d\n\nThe amount Moyo is seeking is in addition to the 36 million rand he earned in salary and incentives in 2018, and 4 million rand for his six months notice period, the insurer said. Moyo, 56, has denied wrongdoing and said he should\u2019ve been through a disciplinary process before being dismissed. His contract was due to expire when he turns 61. At present Moyo and Old Mutual are not negotiating a settlement or payout, the fired CEO said.\n\nAllan Gray, which holds 10% of Old Mutual and has consulted with the company, is fully behind the board.\n\n\u201cWe believe company boards, as shareholder representatives, should be able to dismiss executive officers and there should be no need for cash settlements,\u201d said portfolio manager Jacques Plaut. \u201cThe board is following the correct course of action.\u201d\n\nPatrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management, said Old Mutual\u2019s reasons for dismissing Moyo have not yet been tested in court, making for a difficult call on whether the parties should settle.\n\nWhile the matter has been handled very poorly, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a full picture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Massive headache\u2019\n\nOld Mutual\u2019s board fired Moyo for an alleged conflict of interest over NMT Capital, in which he and Old Mutual both own 20%. Old Mutual said it should\u2019ve been paid preference-share dividends before NMT declared ordinary dividends to its shareholders. Those payouts also caused a fallout with the Industrial Development Corp., which wrote off a portion of a loan to a unit owned by NMT without knowing of a windfall NMT had made from another investment.\n\nThe spat - which has seen Moyo been turned away from reporting for work three times - has pitted the fired CEO against his chairman amid allegations and counter-accusations of conflicts of interests, claims they both deny.\n\n\n\nManuel, a former South African finance minister who oversaw the country\u2019s longest stretch of economic growth, has said court rulings against the company has created a \u201cmassive headache for corporate governance.\u201d Moyo, who has accused Manuel of spearheading his dismissal, wants to defend his reputation.\n\nThe Public Investment Corp. continues \u201cto engage both parties to register its concerns and urging them to find a solution to this dispute,\u201d the insurer\u2019s biggest investor and the continent\u2019s largest money manager said in an email.\n\n\u201cA delay in resolving this dispute will escalate the destruction of shareholder value,\u201d the PIC said. \u201cMost importantly, the PIC urges the Old Mutual Board to act in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders; and to preserve the remaining shareholder value.\u201d", "description": "Old Mutual shareholders are split on whether the South African insurer should pony up and settle with Chief Executive Officer Peter Moyo or run the risk of a R250m damages claim.", "authors": ["Roxanne Henderson"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9172/89a112b20d2e46d59e253c1ceea3ef3d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
