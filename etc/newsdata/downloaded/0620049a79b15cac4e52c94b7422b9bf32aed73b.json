Trump said Beijing agreed to buy more American farm goods in exchange, though China has yet to confirm details of its commitment.\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the agreement as a possible step to breaking a deadlock in the 15-month-old conflict, though the two sides have yet to report progress on their core disputes over Beijing\u2019s trade surplus and technology policies.\n\nThose include complaints from Washington, Europe and other trading partners that Chinese development plans are based in part on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nAuthorities will be banned from \u201cexplicitly or implicitly\u201d pressuring companies to give up technology, said a ministry official, Ye Wei.\n\nThat pledge, if carried out, builds on a law enacted in March that prohibits use of \u201cadministrative tools\u201d to force companies to give up industrial secrets. Business groups said that might leave officials free to use other leverage.\n\n\u201cAdministrative organs may not implicitly or explicitly force the transfer of technology by foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises,\u201d Ye said.\n\nThat still leaves open the question of foreign companies that are required to work through joint ventures with Chinese partners. For such ventures to function, the foreign partner often must hand over technology or teach a potential competitor how to develop its own.\n\nChina is trying to appeal to foreign companies, some of which have postponed or shifted investments to other countries out of concern about the impact of U.S. and Chinese tariff hikes.\n\nA ministry statement also promised to \u201celiminate all restrictions on the scope of business\u201d of foreign banks, securities companies and fund managers. It pledged to \u201cremove the requirement on total assets\u201d for establishing a foreign-owned bank.\u201dWe will move faster to open finance industries,\u201d said a deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen.\n\nWang gave no details, but business groups say high requirements for capital might keep foreign investors out of Chinese financial industries. They say restrictions on licensing and operations also might discourage potential competitors.\n\nBeijing has issued a series of market-opening promises over the past two years including abolishing limits on foreign ownership of companies in auto manufacturing, securities, banking, insurance and futures trading.\n\nFull foreign ownership of futures traders will be allowed as of Jan. 1, followed by mutual fund companies on April 1 and securities firms on Dec. 1. Until now, foreign investors have been limited to owning 51% of such businesses.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China on Tuesday promised more improvements in conditions for foreign companies including an end to officials pressing them to hand over", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
