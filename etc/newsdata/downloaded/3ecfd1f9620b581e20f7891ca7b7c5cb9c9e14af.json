While our production at this factory is extremely limited, we will ensure workers are protected from any form of abuse and are treated fairly.\u201d\n\nThe workers alleged they expected to be hit or verbally abused if they broke rules, and that pay for some workers was as low as $140 a month. One worker claimed they were slapped for leaving work when sick, while another witnessed a colleague hit in the chest. Some reported being called \u201cwhores,\u201d \u201csluts\u201d and \u201cprostitutes\u201d by management.\n\nYoungone Corp. is based in Chittagong, Bangladesh, where The Guardian has at least two reporters working on stories about the treatment of women in Bangladeshi factories.\n\nAnna Bryher, advocacy director for Labour Behind the Label, told The Guardian that \u201cas outrageous as this story is, this isn\u2019t a one-off. Women making clothes in Bangladesh are routinely and systematically abused and harassed.\u201d\n\nYoungone told The Guardian that an internal review had been launched.\n\nLululemon also sources items and clothes from Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\ndcarrigg@postmedia.com\n\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\n\nIs there more to this story?
