Three other suspects are linked to his security team.\n\nRiyadh admits murder\n\nOn October 20, Riyadh finally admits Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate, claiming this was after a \"brawl\".\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir tells Fox News on October 21 there had been a \"tremendous mistake\" and those responsible acted \"outside the scope of their authority\".\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 23 says Khashoggi's \"savage\" murder was carried out by a 15-person team from Riyadh.\n\n'Painful'\n\nOn October 24, the crown prince says the affair is \"very painful for all Saudis, it's a repulsive incident\".\n\nOn October 31, Turkey's chief prosecutor says Khashoggi was strangled as soon as he entered the consulate, his body dismembered and destroyed.\n\nOn November 2, Erdogan says the order for the murder came from \"the highest levels\" of the Saudi government.\n\nOn November 15, Washington announces sanctions against 17 Saudis allegedly involved. Germany, France and Canada follow suit.\n\nPrince accused\n\nThe Washington Post on November 16 quotes anonymous sources as saying the CIA had concluded the crown prince was involved in the murder plot.\n\nBut Trump says the CIA has \"nothing definitive\".\n\nOn December 4, Republican senators say after a CIA briefing that they firmly believe the crown prince was complicit.\n\nOn December 13, the Senate adopts a resolution holding him responsible.\n\nTrial begins\n\nOn January 3, the trial of 11 accused opens with Saudi Arabia's attorney general seeking the death penalty for five of them.\n\nOn February 8, the Saudi foreign minister insists Prince Mohammed was not involved and says blaming him would be crossing a \"red line\".\n\n'Credible evidence'\n\nOn June 19, independent UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard says there is \"credible evidence\" linking the crown prince to the killing.\n\nShe calls for an international criminal investigation.\n\nCallamard's inquiry also finds that the closed-door trial of the 11 suspects did not meet global standards and should be stopped.\n\nOn September 26, US television PBS quotes the prince as insisting, in comments to a reporter two months after the murder, that it was executed without his knowledge but, \"I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch\".\n\nIn an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes aired September 29, he again denies having advanced warning of Khashoggi's killing but says he \"took full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia\".", "description": "Here is a summary of events in the year since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate, an affair that shocked the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9302/6d331412c6b4468eaeac0b5a67d80680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
