The attack killed 12 people, including an American soldier. While it is not clear why Trump waited until Saturday evening to cancel the talks (the attack occurred on Thursday and the Taliban\u2019s responsibility was clear) it is likely a result of last-minute pushing from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nRegardless, Trump made the right call. The Taliban proved they are currently unwilling to negotiate seriously. In turn, the group must know that the president won\u2019t sacrifice America\u2019s security and its allies for a campaign narrative. Trump\u2019s decision, in the context of a tough reelection fight, thus stands in stark contrast with President Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.\n\nThis does not, however, change the crucial importance of diplomacy in Afghanistan.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tom Rogan", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Trump-Was-Right-To-Invite-The-Taliban-To-Camp-David-And-Then-Right-To-Cancel-On-Them"], "top_image": ""}
