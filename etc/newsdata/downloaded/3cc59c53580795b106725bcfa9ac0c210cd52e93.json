Ministers have good reason for attempting to keep them there because it takes the heat off them and their decision not to step in to save the company when they had the option to do so.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe odds of the investigation digging anything up would seem to be long, however.\n\nBen Klinger, a partner at City law firm Brown Rudnick, cautions that while the bonus packages Cook executives were on look high, investigators will have to prove that they either pushed the firm into insolvency (which I think we can safely rule out) or were made when the firm was insolvent. And again, that looks doubtful.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

But the bar they will have to clear to take action against the company\u2019s directors and bosses is a high one.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the collapse came from out of the blue. This is not an RBS or a Carillion where we were told everything was more or less fine until, suddenly, it wasn\u2019t. The travel company started issuing profit warnings in September of last year. They\u2019ve been arriving like London buses since then, just in a more timely fashion.\n\nI\u2019m told Cook\u2019s bosses also kept in regular contact with both the government and the Civil Aviation Authority to keep them appraised of the situation throughout its troubles.\n\nAs for the vexed issue of those bonuses and the packages Cook executives were on, the \u00a38.5m CEO Peter Fankhauser made during his nearly five years isn\u2019t quite as juicy as it looks given that about half of it was paid in now worthless shares. It\u2019s still silly money, but it bears repeating that there was a poll conducted on the Thomas Cook remuneration report at the last AGM in February. It was opposed by only 1 per cent of the company\u2019s shareholders, despite voting advisor Pirc calling for a vote against.\n\nPirc has since done an analysis of shareholder turn out at the company\u2019s recent meetings. It stood at 83.6 per cent for the AGM of February 2017, falling to 82 per cent in 2018 and then to 70.6 per cent in February. At the EGM held in April it was down to 63 per cent.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s possible that investors popped some sleeping tablets as the company was hurtling towards a cliff. But there\u2019s another possible explanation for the marked decline in turnout. It is that, for a fee, some of them decided to let hedge funds and other traders borrow their shares for the purposes of short selling Cook and failed to recall them for voting purposes.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of shorting going on and some hedge fund managers are sitting very pretty as a result.\n\nSo where am I going with this? The events at Thomas Cook once again demonstrate that some big shareholders simply can\u2019t be trusted to effectively steward the companies they own.\n\nIt is the system that stinks to high heaven as much as anything else.\n\nA responsible business secretary, working as part of a responsible government, might care to meditate on that because we\u2019ll surely be here again.
