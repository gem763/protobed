Yields rose further as soft demand at a $16 billion 30-year government auction touched off a fresh wave of selling in the U.S. bond market.\n\nWith the ECB decision in the rear view, attention now turns to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut rates next Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)", "description": "A gauge of global stock markets reached a six-week high in choppy trading on Thursday after new hints of progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute, sending bond yields off lows hit earlier in the wake of the European Central Bank's new stimulus measures.
