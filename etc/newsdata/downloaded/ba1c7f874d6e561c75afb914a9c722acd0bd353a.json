The phones are available for preorder starting on Friday before they launch in stores on September 20.\n\nIf the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s headlining feature sounds familiar \u2013 a triple-lens camera that includes an ultra-wide-angle lens \u2013 that\u2019s because other smartphone makers have done it first. Samsung, the biggest smartphone maker in the world by market share, introduced a similar feature on its Galaxy S10 phone back in February.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at how Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11 Pro compares to the Galaxy S10.\n\nCamera\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nBoth the iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10 have three rear-facing camera lenses, one of which allows the phones to capture ultra-wide images with a noticeably larger field of view than was previously possible.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between Apple and Samsung\u2019s ultra-wide-angle cameras. Samsung\u2019s offers a 123-degree field of view, while Apple\u2019s is slightly narrower at 120 degrees. The Galaxy S10\u2019s ultra-wide-angle camera also has a 16-megapixel sensor, while the iPhone\u2019s is 12 megapixels. Samsung\u2019s ultra-wide-angle camera has a lower aperture than Apple\u2019s too, which means the lens should be able to open wider to absorb more light and therefore provide more exposure.\n\nSamsung\u2019s telephoto and wide-angle cameras are also 12 megapixels just like Apple\u2019s, but as is the case with the ultra-wide-angle lens, there are some differences to take into account when it comes to aperture. The iPhone\u2019s wide-angle lens has a f/1.8 aperture, while Samsung\u2019s is capable of switching between an aperture of f/1.5, which would be lower than the iPhone\u2019s, and f/2.4. Apple\u2019s telephoto lens, however, has a lower aperture of f/2.0 compared to the Galaxy S10\u2019s, which has an aperture of f/2.4.\n\nRead more: Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro launch is proof that the smartphone industry is going through a massive change\n\nWhen it comes to recording video, both the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S10 share many similarities. Both phones can shoot 4K video up to 60 frames per second and slow-motion video in 1080p at up to 240 frames per second.\n\nBased on their specifications, it sounds like the iPhone 11 Pro could give the Galaxy S10 some serious competition, but there\u2019s no way to know without comparing their performance side-by-side.\n\nDisplay\n\nsource Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider\n\nThe Galaxy S10 has a 6.1-inch screen that\u2019s slightly larger than the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s 5.8-inch display. It\u2019s also sharper than Apple\u2019s iPhone, or at least it should be on paper. The Galaxy S10\u2019s display has a resolution of 3040 x 1440, packing 550 pixels per inch, while the iPhone 11 Pro has a resolution of 2436 x 1125 with 458 pixels per inch.\n\nBut having a higher resolution doesn\u2019t always mean one screen is better than the other. While the displays on Samsung\u2019s phones are usually vibrant and full of bold color, I sometimes find in that colors generally look more realistic on the iPhone. It\u2019s impossible to tell which phone offers a better viewing experience without spending a significant amount of time with each of them, however.\n\nDesign\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S10 may share some similarities when it comes to their cameras, but Apple and Samsung have taken noticeably different approaches when it comes to design.\n\nThe most evident of these discrepancies involves the devices\u2019 screens. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a notch cutout near the top of the display for the selfie camera and facial-recognition sensors, much like the one that debuted on the iPhone X two years ago. It hasn\u2019t changed much, if at all, since 2017.\n\nRead more: I\u2019ve been switching between Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Note 10 and Apple\u2019s iPhone XS Max \u2013 here are the biggest differences I\u2019ve noticed\n\nSamsung has done more to push the design of its flagship smartphones forward with the \u201cInfinity O\u201d displays on the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 lineup. This new display makes it look like Samsung simply punched a hole in the device\u2019s screen where its front-facing camera sensors are situated, creating the illusion that the display truly stretches from edge to edge. It\u2019s an aesthetic that\u2019s much sleeker and minimalist than Apple\u2019s, making the iPhone\u2019s notch feel all the more intrusive.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the way the phones look from the front that differentiates them from one another. The backside of these devices also look and feel distinctively different. The iPhone 11 has a new matte textured back that I imagine could give it two important advantages: it\u2019s easier to grip, and it\u2019s less prone to fingerprint smudges. The Galaxy S10, comparatively, has a glossier, shiny back that feels more fragile.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro, however, is also a bit heavier than the Galaxy S10. It weighs 188 grams, while the S10 weighs 157 grams.\n\nStorage Options\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro comes in three storage options (64GB, 256GB, and 512GB), while the Galaxy S10 only comes in two (128 GB, 512GB). The catch, however, is that if you\u2019re opting for the cheapest model, you get twice as much storage with the Galaxy S10 (128GB with the S10 versus 64GB with the iPhone). Samsung\u2019s phone also has a microSD card slot that allows you to add an extra 512GB of removeable storage to the phone.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S10 is also a bit cheaper than the iPhone 11 Pro, since the 128GB entry-level configuration starts at $900 while the 64GB iPhone 11 Pro costs $1,000.\n\nDurability\n\nsource Apple\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro is better equipped to withstand water damage than the Samsung Galaxy S10. Apple\u2019s new iPhone can weather being submerged in up to four meters of water for up to 30 minutes, while the Galaxy S10 can survive after being dunked in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes.\n\nExtra Features\n\nsource Samsung\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 also offers a few extra features that the iPhone doesn\u2019t, such as an in-screen fingerprint reader, an always-on display that can show information like the time and battery life while the display is off, and reverse-wireless charging. That last feature allows you to charge accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch simply by resting them on the back of the phone, which could come in handy when you\u2019re not near an outlet.\n\nOne of the big benefits that come with Apple\u2019s products, by contrast, is how seamlessly they all work together. One of the best examples of this is the way your AirPods automatically pair with your iPhone as soon as you flip open the lid, and the way they automatically pause music when you take one AirPod out of your ear. Some competitors have copied this approach in recent years, but Apple pioneered it.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung's Galaxy S10 have a lot in common.
