Parliament TV/via REUTERS//File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s governing Conservative Party plans to stand a candidate against parliamentary speaker John Bercow at the next national election, business minister Andrea Leadsom said, accusing him of \u201cflagrant abuse\u201d of his power.\n\nBreaking with convention, Leadsom said it was right for the Conservatives to stand a candidate against Bercow. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy having plunged parliament into chaos, the next national election could take place soon.\n\nWriting in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Leadsom said Bercow had \u201cfailed us\u201d when he allowed lawmakers to seize control of parliament on Tuesday, putting in place a plan to force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay if parliament has not approved either a deal or consented to leaving without one by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson has said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek that extension - which businesses say is needed to prevent economic damage from a no-deal Brexit - and has promised to lead Britain out of the bloc by Oct. 31 with or without a deal.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker is the senior officer of the House of Commons, and its highest authority. A politically impartial, independent umpire of proceedings, the Speaker is in place to protect the constitution and oversee the behaviour of the House,\u201d Leadsom wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw on Tuesday was a flagrant abuse of this process.\u201d", "description": "Britain's governing Conservative Party plans to stand a candidate against parliamentary speaker John Bercow at the next national election, business minister Andrea Leadsom said, accusing him of \"flagrant abuse\" of his power.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427521645&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF87075", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
