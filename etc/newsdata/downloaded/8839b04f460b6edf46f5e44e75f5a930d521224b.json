We asked readers what they want to know about the storm. Answering those questions is Prof. Adam Sobel, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate at Columbia University.\n\nWhat makes a hurricane change course?\n\nThe motion of hurricanes is determined mainly by what meteorologists call the \u201csteering flow,\u201d or \u201cenvironmental flow,\u201d meaning the winds on a larger scale, excluding the swirling circulation of the hurricane itself. Think of the storm as a swirl you make in a river with a canoe paddle: It has its own little circulation, but the whole thing drifts with the river current on the larger scale. The environmental flow can vary in both speed and direction at different altitudes; the storm follows the low-level winds most, but the winds higher up also have an influence.\n\nIf left to itself, a hurricane would drift slowly toward the North or South Pole, depending on which hemisphere it is in. But the steering flows rarely leave a hurricane to itself. A hurricane turns when it encounters a steering flow that blows in a different direction than the storm was being driven before.\n\n[Read more questions and answers about Hurricane Dorian.]", "description": "The National Hurricane Center warned of \u201clife-threatening\u201d storm surge along hundreds of miles of the Southeast coast, even before the storm\u2019s high winds arrive.", "authors": ["Patricia Mazzei", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/us/04dorian-updates01sub/04dorian-updates01sub-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
