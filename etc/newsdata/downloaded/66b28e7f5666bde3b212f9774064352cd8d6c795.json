They face charges of conspiracy, forced labor, document servitude and benefits fraud.\n\nThe El Centro-based ministry has about 30 affiliate church throughout the United States and Mexico and runs five group homes in Southern California, authorities said.\n\nDozens of victims, many of them homeless and some as young as 17, were lured to the group homes by the promise of food and shelter until they were able to return home.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Punishments for violations of home rules, including talking about the outside world, allegedly included the withholding of food,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn addition to panhandling up to 54 hours per week to provide money to the church, some victims were refused medical treatment, the indictment alleged.\n\nA diabetic woman was refused medicine, supplies and food for her low blood sugar but managed to escape and seek help, authorities said.\n\nAnother woman was refused treatment for a prolapsed uterus, the indictment alleged.\n\nA man who answered the phone at the ministry\u2019s headquarters Tuesday night declined to comment or be named but said the church would be posting comments on its website in a couple of days. An email message seeking comment was not immediately returned.\n\nAll the alleged victims that have been identified are now free and support services were available for them and for any additional victims that are found, authorities said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A dozen leaders of a California-based ministry were arrested on charges they used homeless people as forced labor, U.S. prosecutors said", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/arrested-handcuffs.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C64px%2C2121px%2C1110px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
