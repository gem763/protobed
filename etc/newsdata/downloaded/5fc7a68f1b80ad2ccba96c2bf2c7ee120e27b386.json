And facing constituents at home, many lawmakers said they have gotten more encouragement \u2014 or at least less of a backlash \u2014 that they might have anticipated as public opinion polls show more Americans supporting impeachment.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has been living in a house of cards, and it\u2019s beginning to fall apart,\u201d said Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.). \u201cThere was some anxiety \u2014 should we have stayed [in Washington]? \u2026 There was a little uncertainty about that. But I think we come back in a much stronger position.\u201d\n\nSaid Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.): \u201cI think we\u2019re much further along after two weeks away from Washington than people could have imagined.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are still key unresolved questions: Should Democrats bow to Republican demands and take a formal vote authorizing an impeachment probe? Should the investigation of Trump extend into other alleged misdealings with foreign leaders? How quickly should the impeachment process come to a head?\n\nBut on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.\n\nRep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.), who narrowly won a rural, GOP-held seat last year, wrote an op-ed in the Las Cruces Sun News endorsing an impeachment probe last week after staying mum on the subject for months. Failing to investigate, she wrote, would \u201crisk our safety and the integrity of the very Constitution I swore to support and defend.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a freshman who wrested a suburban Denver district from GOP hands, said in an interview that some lawmakers who might have feared a backlash from launching an impeachment probe have instead seen the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cI think there is increased confidence, and that is a result of the response we\u2019re getting in many of our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cOut in our district, people really do want the rule of law upheld. That\u2019s certainly what I\u2019ve been hearing.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have struggled to mount a coherent defense of the president. Trump\u2019s leading House defenders have focused mainly on the process, accusing Democrats of violating precedent by proceeding without a formal House vote.\n\nAD\n\nWhile previous presidential impeachment investigations have included such a vote, it is not required under the Constitution, federal law or House rules. Several federal judges, for instance, have been impeached following investigations that were not previously authorized with a House vote.\n\nAD\n\nThat makes the calculation of whether to further formalize the impeachment process a political one, and Democratic lawmakers and aides said they have seen little in the Republican response to dissuade them from plowing forward with the investigation, viewing the GOP attempts to raise process concerns as reflecting an inability to defend Trump\u2019s conduct itself.\n\n\u201cThe inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office,\u201d Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a private conference call Friday, according to notes taken by an aide on the call. \u201cWe will honor ours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSenate Republicans have struggled to answer the basic question of whether the crux of the impeachment allegation against Trump \u2014 asking a foreign leader for help to win an election \u2014 is acceptable conduct.\n\nFacing local media last week, GOP Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2014 both up for reelection next year \u2014 dodged questions about whether Trump\u2019s conduct was appropriate. Another Republican, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James E. Risch of Idaho, cut short an interview with a public-radio reporter in Boise rather than answer the question.\n\nAD\n\nAsked about the apparent momentum Democrats have built following a Trump rally in Louisiana Friday, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) pivoted instead to process \u2014 attacking the probe led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a prime target of Trump and GOP attacks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe ought to know that if you run a kangaroo court, the people are going to look at it for what it is and know that he\u2019s not taking it seriously,\u201d he said of Schiff.\n\nOver the recess, the three committees charged with probing the Ukraine controversies had repeated success compelling witnesses to testify despite White House objections. Kurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, gave the committees text messages depicting State officials coordinating with Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani to leverage a public promise of an investigation into the Bidens for a meeting between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s new president.\n\nAD\n\nFormer Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch \u2014 who unlike Volker is still a State Department employee \u2014 followed suit Friday, ignoring a State Department demand that she not testify, and Gordon Sondland, the sitting ambassador to the European Union, is expected to appear Thursday under subpoena.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, those who have served in the administration are unwilling to hide behind salacious claims of privilege, unwilling to stand silent in the face of sequentially serious misconduct,\u201d Schiff said in a recent interview. \u201cIn order for the president\u2019s [stonewalling] strategy to work, he needs willing partners among those \u2026 in the administration, and not all of them are willing to go along with it.\u201d\n\nAs the committees heard testimony last week, federal prosecutors in New York indicted two close Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who played a role in driving Trump\u2019s interest in Ukraine by pushing theories about the country\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election and the service of Biden\u2019s son Hunter on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The campaign-finance indictment from Trump\u2019s own Justice Department has undercut Giuliani\u2019s credibility and complicated White House attempts to promote a counternarrative focused on Biden\u2019s alleged wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nAn unpredictable factor is the fallout from Trump\u2019s decision last week to withdraw a small number of U.S. troops from northern Syria, paving the way for a Turkish invasion of territory held by the Kurds, U.S. partners in the fight against the Islamic State. That move has prompted bipartisan outrage.\n\nAD\n\nOne Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), directly criticized Trump for his Syria pullout Monday in a tweet: \u201cI thought you were going to defeat ISIS, that is why people voted for you. What changed? This is weakness. America is far more honorable than this.\u201d\n\nBut neither Kinzinger nor any other Republican has moved to tie the Syrian pullout to the impeachment push, and one top GOP official went beyond that: Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the House Republican Conference chairwoman, said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about Trump\u2019s withdrawal decision in a Fox News Channel appearance Monday before suggesting that it was the Democratic impeachment push that set the stage for the Turkish invasion \u2014 not Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border, and I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage that they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings,\u201d she said, without citing evidence that the Turkish offensive was prompted by anything other than Turkey\u2019s long-declared goal of clearing the Kurds from its border.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Republicans who are averse to conflating the Syrian pullout with impeachment. Top Democrats are wary of muddying their case by expanding the impeachment probe beyond the bounds of the Ukraine allegations, a point Pelosi and others made on the caucus conference call Friday.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of rabbit holes to go down here, but we need to resist that temptation,\u201d said one Democrat on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private call, paraphrasing Pelosi\u2019s message. \u201cKeep it clear in a way that is easy to communicate to folks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the courts have given Democrats new reason to hope that they will ultimately be able to break the White House\u2019s resistance to their oversight activities. Multiple federal judges ruled last week against the Trump administration on cases dealing with attempts to circumvent congressional oversight or otherwise short-circuit the legislative process. None was more crucial than a 2-to-1 D.C. Circuit decision upholding Congress\u2019s right to inspect Trump\u2019s business records, one that dismantled a White House argument that Congress had no \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d to its oversight.\n\nOn Friday\u2019s conference call, according to three people on the call, House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) tempered the victory, saying the ruling was likely headed to the Supreme Court, where there is a solid conservative majority that could overturn it. But rank-and-file Democrats said they were gratified to see even lower-court judges objecting to the White House\u2019s noncooperation.\n\n\u201cThat is the genius of our system, that no one house or branch holds all the power,\u201d Crow said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way that it is supposed to work.\u201d", "description": "Lawmakers return to Washington Tuesday after a two-week recess in which they made progress in explaining Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine for election help, the crux of their inquiry.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1Ip5qxPRuIHbMC-FazJApppt5tc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I5XIFDHFFYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
