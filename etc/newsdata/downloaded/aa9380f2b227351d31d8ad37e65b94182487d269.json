Consumer prices last month fell 0.4 percent on year - far lower than the official inflation target of 2 percent, although the central bank and the government denied that Korea is suffering from deflation.Fears are rising that deflation could start a vicious cycle of weak consumer spending, tepid investment and low growth.Hong Joon-pyo, a researcher at the think tank, underlined negative indicators for manufacturing sector worldwide as a factor pulling down investment and exports.The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a gauge of U.S. manufacturing provided by the Institute for Supply Management, dropped to 47.8 in September, its worst level in more than 10 years.Other global economic institutions have revised downward their outlooks for Korea as well.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in an interim outlook report earlier this year that the Korean economy would grow 2.3 percent in 2020, slower than its previous forecast of 2.5 percent.Fitch Ratings, a global credit rating agency, also reduced the country\u2019s 2020 GDP growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 2.3 percent, citing growing trade risks.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
