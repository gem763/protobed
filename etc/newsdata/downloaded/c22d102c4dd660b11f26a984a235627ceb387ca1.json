Elijah Cummings Dies At 68\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nUpdated at 5:55 a.m. ET\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings, a Baltimore attorney and civil rights advocate who served in Maryland's legislature before representing the state in the U.S. House, where he took on a lead role in investigating President Trump, has died. He was 68.\n\nCummings, the head of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe 12-term congressman had failed to return from an unspecified medical procedure and missed two legislative roll call votes on Tuesday, the first day after a two-week recess, according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\nIn a statement on Sept. 30, Cummings said his doctors expected him to be able to return to Washington \"when the House comes back into session in two weeks.\" It said he'd be in \"constant communication\" with his staff and congressional colleagues while he was away.\n\nCummings was among the three Democratic committee chairmen who signed a letter last month that accompanied a congressional subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nAccording to an official biography of Cummings, the Baltimore native attended Howard University, where he obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and served as student government president. He later obtained a law degree from the University of Maryland.\n\nHe served for 13 years in Maryland's House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in 1996.\n\n\"Congressman Cummings has dedicated his life of service to uplifting and empowering the people he is sworn to represent,\" his official biography says.\n\n\"He began his career of public service in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he served for 14 years and became the first African American in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tem,\" it says. \"Since 1996, Congressman Cummings has proudly represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.\"\n\nCummings was born and raised in Baltimore, and lived there his entire life in what he described as the \"inner inner city.\" He was one of seven children of parents who worked as sharecroppers before moving to the city in the 1940s, according to the Sun.\n\nAs a prominent Democratic lawmaker, Cummings frequently found himself on the receiving end of Trump's Twitter account. In an infamous series of tweets in July, the president referred to Cumming's Baltimore district as \"rat and rodent infested\" and suggested that the congressman seldom goes there.\n\nElijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through \u201cOversight.\u201d He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019\n\n\"Mr. President, I go home to my district daily,\" Cummings fired back in a letter to Trump. \"Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.\"\n\nReferring to investigations of the president, which he perceived as the true impetus for the derogatory remarks, Cummings said in the letter that it is \"my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.\"\n\nDespite the president's remarks, Cummings continued to reach out to the White House and called on government officials to stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments.\" that divide and distract.\n\nMr. President, we can address this together. Two years ago, I went to the White House to ask you to endorse my bill to let the government negotiate directly for lower drug prices. \u2014 Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) July 27, 2019\n\nWhen Democrats took the house in the 2018 election, political pundits had predicted that Cummings' chairmanship of the Oversight Committee would be a \"nightmare\" for Trump.\n\n\"Are we going to be the nightmare? he mused in an interview with the Sun. \"It's in the eye of the beholder.\"", "description": "The Baltimore congressman, who was chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, had taken a lead role in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/17/ap_19219669676686_wide-9c8d10ec81358496d5598216e9000154c5b262a2.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
