He came out on fire. He was sober, direct, returning volleys from the two lefties on either side of him. \u201cFor a socialist you have a lot more faith in corporate America than I do,\u201d he said to Sanders.\n\nBut a half-hour into this third Democratic debate, many Democrats had to be wondering: Can he go three hours? It\u2019s our own collective ageism.\n\nHe did, closing with his most appealing side: his humanity and vulnerability. After the El Paso shootings, Trump showed he couldn\u2019t even pass the base test of a human being, demonstrating a smidgen of empathy. He couldn\u2019t even fake it. Not for a minute. Biden bleeds empathy. What\u2019s appealing about him is what my colleague Jennifer Senior called \u201cthe bartender aspect\u201d of his character, in her review of his book on the loss of his son Beau.\n\nProgressives looking for someone who will bring big structural changes should remember that we are electing not just a president, but an executive branch. I have no doubt that Biden would sign any kind of advanced legislation that can get by the Neanderthals holding the Senate back in the last century.\n\nWaiting for Uncle Joe to collapse is not a winning strategy. Most of the other candidates in Thursday\u2019s debate seemed to get that. O\u2019Rourke had his best night. This is the rare politician who\u2019s not afraid to let it rip, the b.s. valve turned off. Kamala Harris is brilliant, and would crush Trump in a debate. \u201cYou can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d was her line that should be on bumper stickers soon. And on the shootings, she said of Trump: \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull the trigger but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\u201d\n\nFor the two of them, though, it may too late: both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump led at this stage in the polls four years ago.\n\nPete Buttigieg, born in 1982, nearly a decade after Biden entered the Senate, makes a pitch for generational change, citing John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. He\u2019s got the right song in the wrong presidential year. Remember the guy who specifically called for passing the generational torch in an earlier debate? Me neither.
