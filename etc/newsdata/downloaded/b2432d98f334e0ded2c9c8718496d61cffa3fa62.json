This is where you go to hear Ann Coulter do her impression of liberals (\u201cHe\u2019s Hitler, he\u2019s Hitler, he\u2019s Hitler!\u201d), watch Sean Hannity argue with James Carville (\u201cThere was no quid pro quo!\u201d) and then follow it up with \u201cAn Evening With Al Franken\u201d (after which there was no photo line).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd because it\u2019s not the White House briefing room, Sarah Sanders is more than happy to show up.\n\n\u201cI think the president is a role model in being a fighter and being willing to stand up and sometimes stand alone even when it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nNow in its fifth year, Politicon, a two-day convention for self-described \u201cnews junkies\u201d held last weekend at the Music City Center, could easily be mistaken for something essential and ideas-driven. It is not. Like so much social media, it\u2019s populated by people who specialize in being the center of attention and their followers.\n\nSo what, exactly, is the mission behind all this?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we have one, to be honest,\u201d said Simon Sidi, who before creating Politicon five years ago produced concerts for the likes of Kanye West and \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolitics as entertainment is nothing new, yet this particular event feels like it was destined to exist now: A reality TV star is president; former members of his team are dancing with the stars; seemingly every best-selling book is a tell-all about this administration. A Comic-Con, but for politics? Why not?\n\nPlus, there is something to be said about smashing a bunch of political bubbles together and seeing if they pop. Attendees of all stripes tended to get along. Members of the Yang Gang in Make America Think Harder (MATH) hats chatted with their MAGA counterparts. Folks in Bernie Sanders shirts got their picture taken with Sarah Sanders (\u201cMy parents are a huge fans,\u201d said Joshua Knepshield, 24, of Richmond). And everyone seemed to agree that nobody needs to hear from James Comey anymore.\n\n\u201cHere at Politicon, there is a human element,\u201d said Terry Lewis, 23, a Yang supporter who was chatting with a new Trump-supporting friend, Tyler Randall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Randall, 32, who was dressed in an American flag suit. \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell people they\u2019re stupid, because they\u2019d be looking right at you, and you\u2019d realize you were a troll.\u201d\n\nIn the real world, the stakes for these conversations are astronomical: What will become of our health care, our planet, our border, our national character? In theory, politics is about building coalitions behind policies \u2014 changing minds and changing reality. At Politicon, politics is mostly about cheering and jeering.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about convincing anyone of anything here,\u201d said Josh LeCash, 33, a conservative from Los Angeles. \u201cThat\u2019s why it can be so civil. It\u2019s like going to a sporting event; you don\u2019t try to convince anyone to root for the other team. That\u2019s what this is \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a carnival.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe carnival drew a smaller crowd than usual this year. Organizers expected 10,000 (a following less robust than a mid-level #ResistanceMom or TrumpUncle on Twitter), but at times it could feel downright empty. The organizers estimate 6,000 people showed up.\n\nFor Politicon, this meant fewer people to hear Hannity try his hand at civility: \u201cWe\u2019re all Americans; we love our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t question any Democrats\u2019 motives, I don\u2019t. I think they\u2019re corrupt. I think what they\u2019re doing is corrupt.\u201d\n\nJoe Walsh, a nominal candidate for president, wheeled two suitcases through the Politicon exposition booths (\u201cI\u2019m my own body man!\u201d), after speaking onstage alongside fellow Trump primary opponents Bill Weld and Mark Sanford (the crowd had been thin, but Sanford only attracted one person to his campaign kickoff, so it must have felt like the Super Bowl). Walsh said he came to Politicon to \u201cget this face in front of people,\u201d any people, really, but he was excited to be here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy campaign manager told me it would be like Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I love Twitter.\u201d\n\nThe smaller crowd also meant an auditorium less than half full to hear Franken, the former senator, do impressions of his colleagues, and no lines at the booths selling MAGA watches (\u201cFor supporters too afraid to wear the hat\u201d), AOC dolls or shirts from Wehateliberals.com.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have a shirt that says, \u2018No, Beto, you can\u2019t have my AR-15, but you can have every round in the clip,\u2019\u201d said Eric Grinnell, a Kentucky attorney who practices family law when not running that \u201chate liberals\u201d website. \u201cYou can read into it whatever you want.\u201d (Disclaimer: Retweets do not equal endorsements.)\n\nAD\n\nWhat should we read into the half-empty auditoriums and dull provocations of Politicon 2019?\n\nSome visitors chalked up the poor attendance to the event being held in Nashville for the first time after four years in Los Angeles. Local vendors said there was hardly any advertising for the event. Then there\u2019s the question of fatigue: What\u2019s the point of coming to Politicon when so much of the national conversation is about politics? Why see people argue onstage when you can scroll through the same arguments on Twitter?\n\nAD\n\nThe overwhelming number of political tweets come from a tiny slice of Twitter users, a population that makes up a small minority of Americans. If Politicon is like Twitter come to life, then maybe it was just another place for a small group of power users to gather and quarrel.\n\nAD\n\nOn the final day of Politicon, a few hundred Trump supporters, Yang Gangers, Bernie Bros, YouTubers and Extremely Online teens took their seats for a discussion called \u201cBeing Black in the Age of Trump.\u201d\n\nThe panel itself, featuring a group of black media personalities talking about doing their jobs and living their lives in a time of heightened racism, was civil. It was the comments section \u2014 which is to say, the audience \u2014 that got out of hand.\n\n\u201cI sit here and watch you say, \u2018Trump is this, Trump is that,\u2019 \u201d Jimmy James, a black man wearing a Make America Great Again hat over his long dreadlocks, said from the audience. \u201cYou want to call people like me with a red hat on a coon!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI never said that. I never said that,\u201d White House correspondent April Ryan replied from the stage, jabbing a finger in James\u2019s direction. (She hadn\u2019t said that word and said later she was appalled at being accused of hurling a racial slur.)\n\n\u201cCome back here and answer my question,\u201d someone in the crowd shouted at Ryan as she prepared to leave a stage that was beginning to seem potentially a bit unsafe.\n\n\u201cI am not a dog!\u201d Ryan yelled back. \u201cI am not a dog. You need to learn some respect!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe liberal media is lying to you, April Ryan is lying to you!\u201d Brandon Straka, a white man wearing a shirt proclaiming he was \u201cNot a Racist,\u201d shouted into a microphone. \u201cWalk away from the Democratic Party! Hashtag Walk Away!\u201d Straka also runs an online campaign trying to convince Democrats to change teams, and would later get more than 17,000 retweets sharing a Fox News story about this encounter.\n\nAD\n\nPoliticon staff rushed in to grab the microphone. Audience members hurled insults at one another. The crowd began chanting, \u201cWalk away,\u201d and though bellowed in unison, it seemed to be directed at various targets.\n\n\u201cThis is good content,\u201d a man in the back said to his friend.\n\nAs Ryan walked through the airport, less than an hour after her hired security escorted her offstage, she said she\u2019s not sure whether she\u2019ll do another Politicon.\n\n\u201cWho knows,\u201d she said. \u201cI was fearful during the panel. The heat, the venom that was directed at us was crazy.\u201d\n\nShe took a deep breath.", "description": "Politics as entertainment is nothing new, yet this particular event feels like it was destined to exist now.", "authors": ["Ben Terris", "Feature Reporter Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oYC3JPsHGz_2oZ5HIC6bZnFnPUU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/64MIN3XZ3MI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
