Their abrupt withdrawal, following a phone conversation between Trump and Turkish President Erdogan, gave Ankara an unambiguous green light to initiate military operations against the Kurdish forces which could not be walked back by subsequent conflicting statements from the White House.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Turkish jets began pounding Kurdish positions, followed by a Turkish artillery and ground attacks which have killed as many as one hundred.\n\nLater, the United States joined Russia in vetoing a statement supported by the rest of the Security Council condemning Turkish operations against the Syrian Kurds.\n\nThe thirty to forty million Kurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East. Their century of political misfortunes arise from a cruelly simple reality: their people are dispersed across Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, without a state to call their own.\n\nAs America has periodically warred openly or covertly with Iraq, Iran and Syria, it has supported Kurdish revolts in their territory.\n\nBut while the Kurd\u2019s nation-building zeal and relatively progressive attitudes of certain Kurdish factions has attracted supporters amongst Western journalists and activists, Washington has never truly supported an independent Kurdish state.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Trump is not the first.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8wCTqZHewypfIyY2M162Og--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/a60c027ac8cf6b36c4581c7cd8246080", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
