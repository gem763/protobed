An airlift was organised in which British passengers were flown home on aircraft with sealed holds, with their luggage flown separately.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Airlines including Monarch, Thomas Cook and British Airways initially said they would reinstate flights as soon as possible, and several holiday companies sold trips \u2013 which later had to be cancelled.\n\nBy the summer of 2016, the Egyptian government had spent tens of millions of pounds upgrading security at Sharm el Sheikh, but repeated requests to the UK to allow flights to resume were rebuffed. Airlines and holiday companies cancelled all their planned operations and moved capacity to other destinations \u2013 including Hurghada, across the Gulf of Suez.\n\nWhy has it taken four years to lift the ban?\n\nThe official reason is that until now the UK government was unsatisfied that security standards at Sharm el Sheikh airport were adequate.\n\nMany in the travel industry believe the delay has been partly a result of the political turmoil in the UK. Senior sources have told The Independent that David Cameron was planning to lift the ban in the summer of 2016. But the Leave vote and his immediate resignation meant that the announcement \u2013 expected within days \u2013 was never made.\n\nSince then, despite increasingly vocal demands for the reinstatement by Egyptian officials, the issue has been put on the back burner.\n\nWhen will flights resume?\n\nThe winter season for the travel industry begins next Sunday, 27 October. By my estimation there is only a small chance of flights starting in time for Christmas/New Year. February half-term is more possible, but because of the collapse of Thomas Cook and the Boeing 737 Max grounding there is a chronic shortage of planes \u2013 and fleets are fully committed.\n\nIt is possible that foreign airlines might come in, though. A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesperson says: \u201cUK carriers may now recommence services, and the CAA will consider Foreign Carrier Permit applications from non-UK airlines wishing to operate routes between the UK and Sharm El-Sheikh.\u201d\n\nWill it be just like before?\n\nNo. The ban had a devastating effect on the Egyptian economy, and the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depended on the Red Sea resort.\n\nWith no indication of when the British market might return, the country and its tourism industry has built up a thriving business with Italian, Polish and Ukrainian holidaymakers. So there are not necessarily thousands of empty hotel rooms waiting for travellers from the UK, which is another reason the reinstatement of holidays will not be imminent.\n\nWhat is the current Foreign Office assessment of the threat in the region?\n\nHigh. The current travel advice warns against \u201call but essential travel\u201d in the whole of the South Sinai, except the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier \u2013 which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq, but not St Catherine\u2019s Monastery and Mount Sinai.", "description": "The ban on UK airlines flying to Egypt\u2019s premier resort, Sharm el Sheikh, has finally been lifted \u2013 four years after flights were banned.
