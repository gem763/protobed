You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a while, the President has tried to normalize lawlessness. Now, he is trying to make lawlessness a virtue,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s statement read. \u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections. Despite the White House\u2019s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,\u2019\u201d it added. \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to Pelosi stating it refuses to cooperate with the probe and blasted it as \u201cillegitimate and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe letter, written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, accused the speaker of attempting to \u201coverturn the results\u201d of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d the letter read. \u201cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have the President no choice.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d it added.\n\nPelosi launched the impeachment probe against President Trump on September 24th after a partisan CIA officer accused the president in a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint of asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both presidents have denied any pressure was applied to probe into the Bidens, and in a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the world leaders\u2019 call to illustrate no wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cWe had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I \u2014 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky, flanked by President Trump, told reporters at the United Nations last month.", "description": "\"Mr. President, you are not above the law.\u00a0You will be held accountable,\u201d House Speaker Pelosi wrote to President Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Nancy-Pelosi-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
