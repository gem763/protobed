Gough appears an unlikely candidate for the role, given his media commitments, but England could use a series of short-term appointments to fill the void left by Silverwood.\n\n\u201cIt is a tremendous honour to be asked by Chris Silverwood and Ashley Giles to be involved in this elite environment,\u201d Gough said. \u201cI will gain a lot from the experience and to work at this level will benefit me as a coach for the long term. I can\u2019t wait to get cracking.\n\n\u201cI very much look forward to working with all the bowlers and helping them improve.\u201d\n\nGough has previously been involved a little with England squads, working as an adviser for the Under-19 squad this summer and working with the Test side before a Test against the West Indies in 2017.", "description": "Darren Gough has been appointed as a fast bowling consultant for England\u2019s two-Test series in New Zealand later this month.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214618385-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKU-op6n8Xxa2ymKjnWOvoQBL4iPaysraAy7B085YJhk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
