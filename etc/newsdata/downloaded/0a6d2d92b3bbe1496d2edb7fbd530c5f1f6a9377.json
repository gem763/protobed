REUTERS/Loren Elliott/File Photo\n\nCARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank arbitration panel lowered an initial $8.7 billion award to U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) as compensation for Venezuela\u2019s 2007 expropriation of its assets to $8.5 billion, according to a decision dated Aug. 29 posted online.\n\nThe new award will represent savings of $200 million from the first award in April, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s overseas legal representative said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said the rectification lowered the award by $227 million and that the company \u201cdoes not challenge\u201d the action.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to pursuing all available legal avenues to obtain a full and fair recovery of the award,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nGuaido has prioritized protecting Venezuela\u2019s overseas assets since being recognized as the country\u2019s rightful leader by the United States and dozens of other countries this year. He has also requested that the World Bank\u2019s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) annul the award.\n\nGuaido argues that socialist President Nicolas Maduro is usurping power after winning a May 2018 election dismissed by the opposition and most Western democracies as a sham. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.\n\nJose Ignacio Hernandez, Guaido\u2019s legal representative who now represents Venezuela in the case, did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the annulment request.", "description": "A World Bank arbitration panel lowered an initial $8.7 billion award to U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips as compensation for Venezuela's 2007 expropriation of its assets to $8.5 billion, according to a decision dated Aug. 29 posted online.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425505855&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811KA"}
