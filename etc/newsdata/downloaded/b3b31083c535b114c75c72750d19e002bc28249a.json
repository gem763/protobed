Wray noted that the FBI has more than 1,000 investigations in regards to attempted theft of U.S. tech that are linked to China involving nearly all of the FBI\u2019s field offices.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a big city problem, it hits the heartland,\u201d Wray said of Chinese technology theft.\n\nMcAleenan warned that China, along with Russia and Iran, are using \u201cadvanced cyber capabilities\u201d in order to attack U.S. critical infrastructure and steal trade secrets.\n\nThe hearing also focused on concerns around DHS\u2019s leadership, particularly in light of McAleenan\u2019s pending departure as acting secretary. McAleenan took over as acting secretary following former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Michele NielsenHouse Homeland Security Committee subpoenas security officials for testimony on terrorism Trump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Nielsen on leaving Trump administration: 'Saying no and refusing to do it myself was not going to be enough' MORE\u2019s departure in April, and McAleenan\u2019s replacement will mark the fifth person to fill the position since President Trump took office.\n\nRep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.) questioned McAleenan closely on whether his departure would harm the agency\u2019s ability to address cyber threats to the nation and election security threats specifically.\n\nMcAleenan denied that this would have any negative effect on these efforts, citing the ongoing election security efforts by DHS, the National Security Agency and the Intelligence Community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a different secretary or acting secretary is going to affect that progress,\u201d McAleenan said. \u201cI think we have a team effort and very clear lanes that we are all working in concert.\u201d", "description": "FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday testified that he expects Russian actors to attempt to interfere in the 2020 elections,\u00a0adding that he also expects countries like\u00a0China to explore disinformation efforts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/wrayhearing_072319as6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
