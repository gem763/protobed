Whether it\u2019s this morning or by reaching out to me by phone or email, anytime day or night there is not a question that I\u2019m afraid to answer. I only ask to opportunity to do so.'\n\nA few hours later, the woman whose allegations about Lauer led to his firing was spotted running errands in New York City.\n\nBrooke Nevils had a big smile and a fresh blowout, suggesting that the young woman who got her start as Meredith Vieiera's assistant might have spent the day in front of the camera for a change.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSweater weather: Brooke Nevils (above) had a big smile and a fresh blowout when she was spotted in New York City on Wednesday\n\nBrave: On Wednesday, she went public for the first time with al;legations that she was raped by Matt Lauer in 2014 at the Sochi Winter Olympics\n\nHer call: 'The whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however she chooses to and she is doing so now, I think that is appropriate,' explained NBC president Oppenheim\n\nLater in the meeting, Oppenheim also explained the reason he and other executives kept quiet as more and more women came forward to accuse Lauer.\n\nLauer has yet to be spotted since the details of his alleged affair were revealed, but did deny the claims made by Nevils.\n\nIn a lengthy letter, Lauer painted Nevils as a bitter lover who had consensual relations with him and grew bitter and upset after he stopped speaking to her at work.\n\nNevils certainly did not look bitter or upset on Thursday when she was spotted on Thursday, just one day after her allegations were detailed by Ronan Farrow in his book Catch & Kill.\n\nIt was Nevils decision to go public with her story in Farrow's upcoming book, and as Oppenheim told staffers on Monday, she decided when she would break her silence,\n\nOppenheim also explained that there was an obligation on their end as well to protect the victim, which is why they were so quiet\n\n'Our first obligation when someone brings forward a complaint is to protect that person\u2019s confidentiality. All of our communication to you guys and externally, frankly to anyone, the words were carefully chosen to characterize it exactly the same way that her attorney was characterizing it,' he explained to those in attendance and others who had dialed in tot eh meeting remotely.\n\n'That confidentially is not something that I am ever going to breach, not only for her sake.'\n\nHe then stated: 'The whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however she chooses to and she is doing so now, I think that is appropriate.'\n\nIt was just hours after she spoke out that Lauer took aim at Nevils and her allegations in an open letter.\n\nEmployee relations: Noah Oppenheim (center) met with top members of the NBC News team on Thursday to discuss the events of the previous 24 hours (Lauer on left, Farrow on right)\n\n'I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual,' wrote Lauer\n\n'The story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object.'\n\nHe continued: 'She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner.'\n\nLater in the letter, Lauer suggested that Nevils accused him because she was upset about their split.\n\n'I admit, I ended the affair poorly. I simply stopped communicating with her. Brooke continued to reach out,' wrote Lauer.\n\n'She admitted to NBC at the time she filed her complaint that she called me late at night while I was home with my family in an effort to rekindle the affair.'\n\nNevils responded to this letter in a comment to NBC news later in the day of Wednesday.\n\n'There's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,' explained Nevils.\n\n'His open letter was a case study in victim blaming and concluded by threatening any other woman who might dare to speak out against him.'\n\nNevils chose to share her story with Farrow, who makes it clear in his book that he still had an axe to grin with NBC about how they responded to his reporting on Harvey Weinstein and their belief that it was not ready to air.\n\nFarrow eventually found a home for his piece at the New Yorker.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Farrow said that among those Weinstein turned to while trying to get the story pulled were Hillary Clinton, the editors of American Media and even his estranged father Woody Allen.\n\nThe first two went to considerable lengths to try and quash Farrow's reporting, and dossiers detailing allegations of Lauer's sexual misconduct during his time on Today did play a role in NBC killing the story while he was at the network, claims Farrow.\n\nClinton did her best too says Farrow, who recounts being told his 'big story' was a 'concern for us' by the then-presidential hopeful's publicist Nick Merrill.\n\nHe also claims that the campaign withheld access to Clinton at a time when Farrow was trying to interview her for the foreign policy book he was working on at the time.\n\nAttempts to rope in Farrow's family were much less successful, including a call to Farrow's estranged father Woody Allen.\n\n'Jeez, I'm so sorry. Good luck,' Allen told Weinstein, explaining that there was nothing he could do to stop the story.", "description": "Brooke Nevils had a big smile and a fresh blowout, suggesting that the young woman who got her start as Meredith Vieiera's assistant might have spent the day in front of the camera for a change.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19559426-0-image-a-33_1570742813992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
