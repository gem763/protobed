The company has been profitable for years since its bootstrapped beginnings and counts fintech giants like Chime Banking, Robinhood, Monzo, and Transferwise among its customers. In fact, the debit and credit card service provider will process nearly $26 billion in financing by the end of the year, according to the company.\n\nFor financial services companies that are launching these days there are a few ways to get to market quickly. One is to partner with a financial institution that will handle the money for them in accounts that are FDIC assured and the other is to become a financial provider that\u2019s fully regulated themselves.\n\nMost companies have opted for the second route, and when they do, they need to find a way to hook into a bank\u2019s financial system and the payment technologies that form the backbone of transaction processing through the debit and credit cards that a huge portion fo the world relies on to buy things.\n\nAccel partner John Locke, who is joining the Galileo board of directors, calls the company almost the flip side of the Braintree and Stripe investments that power transactions for most online merchants.\n\nRather than focus on the companies that are taking online orders and processing payments, Galileo deals with the consumers who are spending the money and powers the ways in which companies are trying to offer new services to get those consumers to switch from traditional banks to their upstart challengers (ironically still mostly powered by traditional banks).\n\n\u201cThrough the API what they\u2019re doing is creating and managing accounts, authorizing merchant transactions, monitoring fraud, initiating disputes and chargebacks, being able to configure products and a wide variety of product,\u201d said Wilkes. \u201cWe support [direct deposit accounts] and we do credit products\u2026 all of these capabilities are capabilities that fit on our platform.\u201d\n\nWilkes wouldn\u2019t talk about the company\u2019s valuation except to say that it\u2019s worth \u201ca substantial amount\u201d.\n\nWhat he will talk about is how Galileo will use the money it\u2019s raised. The Salt Lake City-based startup is planning to greatly expand its geographical reach beyond North America. It\u2019s \u201cactively pursuing opportunities in Brazil and Colombia and Argentina,\u201d according to Wilkes. In fact, the company plans to open an office in Mexico City in the coming months to service new Latin American business.\n\nMeanwhile it already has something of a stranglehold on the market in the United Kingdom. \u201cThe top five largest fintechs in the UK are all clients today,\u201d Wilkes said.\n\nUnlike other companies in the market that take a fixed percentage of transactions, Galileo charges a variable amount of a few cents for every transaction that it processes to connect a startup with its banking back end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a golden era of fintech innovation and Galileo has quietly built the API infrastructure layer powering the industry\u2019s most innovative products,\u201d said Locke in a statement. \u201cClay and his team have built a very impressive business with many parallels to companies like Qualtrics and Atlassian: bootstrapping first to build a quiet, profitable powerhouse and now, ready to go big globally. We\u2019re excited to help Clay and team take Galileo to the next level.\u201d", "description": "Clay Wilkes had already been retired for six years when he launched Galileo Financial Services in 2000.
