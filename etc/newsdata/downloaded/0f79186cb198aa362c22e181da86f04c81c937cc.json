They like the Hawaiian congresswoman\u2019s isolationist foreign policy views. They like her support for drug decriminalization. They like what she sees as censorship by big technology platforms.\n\nThen there is 4chan, the notoriously toxic online message board, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Ms. Gabbard, calling her \u201cMommy\u201d and praising her willingness to criticize Israel. In April, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard\u2019s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.\n\nBrian Levin, the head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino, said Ms. Gabbard had \u201cthe seal of approval\u201d within white nationalist circles. \u201cIf people have that isolationist worldview, there is one candidate that could best express them on each side: Gabbard on the Democratic side and Trump on the Republican side,\u201d Mr. Levin said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Tulsi-Gabbard.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
