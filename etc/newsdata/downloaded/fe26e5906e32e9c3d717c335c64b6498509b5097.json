Scheduled for launch in 2020, YellowHeart will reportedly allow artists to set maximum resale prices, ensure tickets are distributed to real customers instead of scalpers, as well as earn a share of tickets resold on YellowHeart\u2019s secondary marketplace.\n\nAlpert, who is also CEO at American record label Disruptor Records, stressed that the problem of scalpers has been well-known in the industry for years.\n\nIn September, South Korean conglomerate CJ Corp\u2019s IT arm, CJ OliveNetworks, announced the launch of a new blockchain-based digital copyright system for recording and tracking music in broadcast content. Previously, global media giant Warner Music Group invested in blockchain startup Dapper Labs to collaborate on its blockchain network Flow, on which Warner is reportedly planning to create a new digital asset.", "description": "Popular American EDM-pop duo The Chainsmokers are supporting a new blockchain-based ticketing platform", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMWZiNjE1NmZlZTZlMTkyNTA3YTE4NGZjNWY2NjQyNzYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
