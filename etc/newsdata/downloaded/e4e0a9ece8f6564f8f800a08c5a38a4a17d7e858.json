Bush.\n\nIn the areas home to Kosovo\u2019s ethnic Serb minority, the \u201ctowel\u201d is rarely seen and instead, the Serbian flag dominates.\n\n\u2013 Judo icon \u2013\n\nKosovo beat its big brother Albania to an Olympic medal during the country\u2019s first appearance at the Games in Rio in 2016, when Majlinda Kelmendi took gold, making her a national hero.\n\nSporting events are often an arena for diplomatic tensions with Serbia, which was not pleased to see Kosovo admitted to the International Olympic Committee in 2014.\n\nKosovo\u2019s footballers have also gained fame, both in the national team and in European clubs.\n\n\u2013 Pop stars and youth \u2013\n\nKosovo is home to around 1.8 million people but another 700,000 are estimated to live abroad, mostly in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nThe diaspora, which has its own ministry, is also a hefty economic force, sending home more than 800 million euros ($900 million) in 2018.\n\nSome of its most famous ambassadors are pop stars: Dua Lipa and Rita Ora both have Kosovo roots.\n\nAt home, Kosovo has one of the youngest populations in Europe, with roughly half of its citizens under the age of 25.\n\n\u2013 Cathedral of gratitude \u2013\n\nMore than 90 percent of Kosovars are Muslim, but one of the Balkan region\u2019s largest Roman Catholic cathedrals sits in the centre of Pristina.\n\nDedicated to Saint Mother Teresa, of ethnic Albanian heritage, the church was built as a symbol of gratitude to the West for supporting Kosovo\u2019s independence.", "description": "Pristina (AFP) \u2013 Kosovo, which holds early legislative elections on Sunday, is one of the world\u2019s youngest democracies.
