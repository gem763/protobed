Nancy Pelosi set the first formal vote on impeachment and investigators will hear for the first time from a white house official on the phone call with Ukraine's leader. Army colonel warned that he twice warned about inappropriate pressure. Mary Bruce starts us off. Reporter: His name is lieutenant colonel Alexander vindman, a decorated combat veteran, served in the army for more than two decades, describes himself as a patriot and says it was out of a sense of duty and obligation that he felt the need to go to his superiors with his concerns about what he was hearing not once but twice. This morning on capitol hill a key witness who listened in on the call at the center of this impeachment inquiry will tell investigators he was so concerned about what he heard, he feared it would undermine U.S. National security. Lieutenant colonel Alexander vindman, a decorated combat veteran and top Ukraine expert on the national security council, he's the first white house official to testify who heard the phone call between president trump and Ukrainian president zelensky. When trump demanded Ukraine investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. According to his opening statement obtained by ABC news, vindman will tell investigators I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. Citizen and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. Government's support of Ukraine. Vindman was also troubled by comments made by Gordon son land, the U.S. Ambassador to the European union and a key figure in this investigation. Vindman will testify that during a meeting in the weeks before that call sondland started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the president. I stated to ambassador sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security. Vindman reported both his concerns about sondland and what he heard on the call to his superior, saying he was acting out of a sense of duty. Colonel vindman insisting it is my sacred duty and hon to advance and defend vindman said it was a priority to keep the relationship with Ukraine on track and according to \"The New York Times\" he was directed by his superiors, including then national security adviser John Bolton to draft a memo that thought to restart the millions of dollars in security aid being withheld from Ukraine but vindman says the president refused to sign it. House speaker Nancy Pelosi after weeks of pressure has now said there will be a formal house vote to lay out the procedure for impeachment. Reporter: This vote set for Thursday will outline what comes next including the procedures for public hearings. Now, unlike in the past, it is likely that staff lawyers, not just members, will have to do some of the questioning. This vote will also outline what rights the white house has in this process. Republicans of course for weeks have been insisting that this investigation go public, that there are public hearings. This move now is in part an attempt by Democrats to try and put Republicans in a box given their intent on going after the process here. The goal is now a final vote by Christmas? Reporter: George, it seems that we are on track to see those public hearings starting some time next month.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Lt.
