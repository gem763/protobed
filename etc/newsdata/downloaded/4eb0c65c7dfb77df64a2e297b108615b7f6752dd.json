I hate it',\" he says. \"I hated the culture of it. I mean, I liked the speed of it, the flexibility, and the entrepreneurialism. But I knew one day I was going to get out of it.\"\n\nSo he decided to build a hotel at Bondi Beach. (He'd never been.)\n\nThe hotel plan fell through. Instead, Marks got involved with distributing fashion labels Sass & Bide, Zimmermann and Fleur Wood to North America (this went really well), a wine bar in Paddington (this went pretty well), and a record label (this went badly).\n\nI found every Mexican living in Australia \u2013 that's probably why I got divorced, she probably thought I was having an affair. \u2014 Steven Marks\n\nThen he fell into fast food.\n\n\"I literally went to every Mexican restaurant in Australia,\" he says. \"And each one was more shit after the other. And everything was packed and I was like, the Aussies love this, but it's so wrong.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told Hazan they were going to \"re-introduce Mexican food\" to Australia.\n\n\"I found every Mexican living in Australia \u2013 that's probably why I got divorced, she probably thought I was having an affair \u2013 I'd hear somebody speak Spanish and I'd be like, you've got to come work for me,\" he says.\n\nMarks admittedly snuck a few Colombians into the employee mix, having formed the view that Australians were not a people known for their great powers of cultural-heritage discernment.\n\n\"I was like, they don't know. As long as you speak Spanish. They don't know where Bogota is ... they're still spelling Colombia with a \u2018U\u2019!\" he says.\n\n\"It\u2019s not the university,\" he adds.\n\n'I'd never seen more white people in my life'\n\nHe settled on Newtown in Sydney's Inner West as the location for the first store.\n\n\"When I got to Newtown, I felt at home. That\u2019s what I grew up in. I grew up on streets that were ethnically diverse, I grew up with blacks and Latins and Indians and Iranians, and I mean, everybody. And I miss that aspect of New York. When I came to Australia, I'd never seen more white people in my life. Everybody looked like they'd jumped out of a Ralph Lauren catalogue,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first he and Hazan funded the business with their own money. When they hit six restaurants in 2009 they sold a minority stake to Peter Ritchie, Guy Russo and Steve Jermyn \u2013 all of whom helped build McDonald's in Australia. In August last year, TDM Growth Partners bought a $44 million stake in GYG.\n\nSales weren't great at first. Hazan worried that the genius plan to make all Australians fall in love with 'real' tacos wasn't working. But things eventually picked up.\n\nGYG's Newtown store used to do about $11,000 in sales a week \u2013 last week it took in $64,000. The Bondi Junction store used to take in a loss-making $9000 a week, but that's now up to $55,000.\n\nGoing 'clean'\n\nAfter going free-range with all of GYG's chicken in 2017, Marks' next move was to only serve \"clean\" fast food.\n\nHis marketing team loved it. From personal trainer James Duigan\u2019s \"Clean and Lean\" brand to journalist Sarah Wilson\u2019s \"I Quit Sugar\" revolution, consumers were already wanting to know what exactly was in their food.\n\nHis board wanted more clarification on what this whole \"clean\" thing meant because of minor details like not wanting to get sued for misleading consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Clean\" to GYG means no added preservatives, artificial flavours, added colours or unacceptable additives in any food ingredients. The company hired a nutritionist to audit everything from the tacos to the salsas.\n\nIn 2016, GYG removed a carcinogenic artificial colouring known as \"sunset yellow\" from its Dulce de Leche dipping sauce for churros. In 2017, they took the antioxidant BHA out of the Chipotle Mayo. Ingredients like cheese were trickier, but after reviewing more than 30 options they landed on an Australian supplier of preservative-free cheese in May.\n\nMarks argues that cleaning up their food has been good for revenue and said the initial research was the most expensive component. He dismissed concerns about a greater risk of food poisoning, which tripped up US chain Chipotle.\n\nGYG is projected to earn $300 million in revenue for the 2020 financial year, up from over $250 million in 2019 and over $200 million in 2018.\n\nBringing Guzman y Gomez home\n\nIn January, GYG will open its first American store in Chicago.\n\n\"I was going to pick [Washington] DC, then Trump got into office, f---ed the whole city up \u2013 everyone voted against Trump in the city and is like on Xanax \u2013 the whole f---ing place is depressed. So, then I picked Chicago,\" says Marks.\n\nNaysayers will point out that America has a lot more Mexican restaurants than Australia \u2013 from Chipotle to Baja Fresh to Taco Bell. But Marks insists that building GYG in a market as tough as Australia is an advantage for this return to the motherland.\n\nGuacamole may well be extra, but it's still not a patch on Marks' ultimate vision, which is to list GYG on the ASX. No, he doesn't own shares in any other companies \u2013 all his equity is tied up in his own company.\n\n\"I can only love one thing at once,\" he laughs.", "description": "New Yorker Steven Marks was raised by a single mother and worked for Wall St legend Steven Cohen before starting Guzman y Gomez in Sydney 13 years ago.
