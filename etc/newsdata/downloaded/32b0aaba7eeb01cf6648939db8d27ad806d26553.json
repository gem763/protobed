Faury said this would \"increase prices,\" and \"have an impact on the cost of travel,\" as Airbus manufactures some of its planes in Alabama, but import parts from Europe.\n\nFaury added that 40% of the parts that are used in its US factories come from Europe, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, Faury did say \"we think it's still possible,'' with regards to a resolution between the two parties being solved and would be pushing for a settlement to the conflict.", "description": "Airbus' CEO told reporters on Thursday the trade war between the US and EU over aircraft subsidies is a 'lose-lose game,' for both sides.
