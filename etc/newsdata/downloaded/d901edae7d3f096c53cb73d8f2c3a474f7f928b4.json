Amit X. Garg, a professor of medicine at Western University in London, Ontario, knew about turmeric\u2019s medicinal use because of his Indian heritage. He knew firsthand of its rich cultural significance too: On his wedding day, his relatives rubbed the spice all over him because it is believed to be cleansing.\n\nAfter seeing the effectiveness of curcumin, in smaller studies, Dr. Garg and his colleagues decided to test it on a larger scale in hopes it would make elective aortic surgery safer by reducing the risk of complications, which include heart attacks, kidney injury and death. In the randomized clinical trial that followed, about half of the 606 patients were administered 2,000 milligrams of curcumin eight times over for four days, while the others were given a placebo. \u201cIt was a bit disappointing, but we couldn\u2019t demonstrate any benefit used in this setting,\u201d Dr. Garg said of the study, published last year in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n\nIn fact, there is not enough reliable evidence in humans to recommend turmeric or curcumin for any condition, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Turmeric became a nutritional golden child partly because of its promise in laboratory studies \u2014 cellular and animal. Some research indicates that both turmeric and curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric supplements, have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral and antiparasitic activity. But this has mostly been demonstrated in laboratory studies, and, in many cases, the benefits of preclinical research isn\u2019t observed in clinical trials.\n\nAccording to Natural Medicines, a database that provides monographs for dietary supplements, herbal medicines, and complementary and integrative therapies, while some clinical evidence shows that curcumin might be beneficial for depression, hay fever, hyperlipidemia, ulcerative colitis, osteoarthritis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it\u2019s still too early to recommend the compound for any of these conditions.\n\nAnd Natural Medicines has found there isn\u2019t enough good scientific evidence to rate turmeric or curcumin\u2019s use for memory, diabetes, fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, gingivitis, joint pain, PMS, eczema or hangovers.\n\nPhysicians say more research is needed. D r. Gary W. Small, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies curcumin\u2019s effect on memory, sees a lot of therapeutic potential. He also states that existing research demonstrates curcumin\u2019s biological effects.", "description": "Famed for purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, the botanical is hailed for helping a host of conditions.
