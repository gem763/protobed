Richemont (ticker: CFR.Switzerland), along with other big players, has shrugged off concerns of a consumer slowdown and trade tensions, with rivals LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC.France) gaining 147%, and Tiffany (TIF), 29%, over the same period.\n\nBut due to its product mix and exposure to Asia, Richemont is likely to suffer more than most from disruption in Hong Kong, depreciation of the Chinese yuan, and macro issues engulfing the region.\n\nAnalysts at UBS have warned the situation in Hong Kong will have a 2% negative impact on Richemont\u2019s organic sales growth next year. UBS has a Sell rating and a target price of 68 Swiss francs ($68.49), 10% lower than its current CHF 75.04. Over the past three months Richemont has seen 8% wiped off its stock, compared with a 1.3% and 1.8% fall at LVMH and Tiffany, respectively.\n\n\u201cWe believe the slowing Cartier brand performance and near-term industry headwinds, which are set to put group margins under pressure, are not priced in,\u201d UBS analysts wrote in a Sept. 17 note.\n\nHong Kong is a vital market for Richemont, contributing about 11% to group sales. The crucial Chinese consumer accounts for about 40% of all sales. When asked for comment, the firm pointed to its July trading update. \u201cSales in Hong Kong retreated, additionally impacted by the relative strength of the Hong Kong dollar and the recent street protests,\u201d the company said.\n\nRichemont is the third-largest luxury-goods firm by sales, behind LVMH and Estee Lauder, according to an annual report by Deloitte. Richemont, which is based in Geneva, also owns online retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter and gun maker Purdey. It has a market value of $40 billion and employs about 30,000 people in 36 countries. The stock is priced at 21 times forward earnings, a 10% premium to its peers, and the company posted operating profit of \u20ac1.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2019, on sales of \u20ac13.9 billion.It traces its heritage to the 1940s, when the late South Africa billionaire Anton Rupert created conglomerate Rembrandt. It had interests in tobacco, financial services, wines and spirits, and gold- and diamond-mining industries, as well as luxury goods. In 1988, Rembrandt Group spun off some of its international assets to form Richemont.\n\nUBS has sourced data that looks at the appeal of Richemont\u2019s largest brand, Cartier, which UBS says accounts for 80% of group earnings before interest and taxes. UBS has monitored the brand on social media and online search sites to gauge interest. Cartier has nine million followers on Instagram, but in August \u201clikes\u201d per post were down 7% compared with a 55% increase in July, UBS noted. Cartier also has had a 30% year-on-year decline in reads per post on the Chinese social-media platform WeChat, according to UBS.\n\nThe company has launched a new jewelry line called Clash, and Cyrille Vigneron, Cartier\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a March statement that \u201cClash is super positive, the fastest launch we ever had on such a launch category.\u201d\n\nCartier needs to innovate more in order to remain a star brand, otherwise Richemont will lose its sparkle.", "description": "Due to its product mix and exposure to Asia, Richemont is likely to suffer more than most from disruption in Hong Kong and depreciation of the Chinese yuan.", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110941/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
