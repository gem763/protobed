You know, when someone has the determination that he has, the mindset, it\u2019s 100 per cent positive for the squad and especially for young forwards like myself.\u201d\n\nWhile there is uncertainty about who takes penalties for Rashford\u2019s club Manchester United, there is no doubt over who takes them for England, given Kane\u2019s deadliness from 12 yards.\n\nRashford said: \u201cObviously here it\u2019s a bit more simple because, like you say, Harry\u2019s record is unbelievable and that\u2019s a way for him to get his goals, and the players, the squad and the staff all support that.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a bit more of a simple topic here.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "England\u00a0striker Marcus Rashford has revealed Harry Kane\u2019s prowess in front of goal is driving him on to better things.
