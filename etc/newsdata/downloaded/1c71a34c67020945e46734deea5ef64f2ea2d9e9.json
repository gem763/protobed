Vacancy rates are very low, interest rates are low. A number of things are working for pushing the button.\"\n\nAfter years of tight vacancy, developers have confidence to push the button on new office projects, says Luke Briscoe, seen in front of AMP Capital's under-construction Quay Quarter Tower in Sydney. James Brickwood\n\nIn central Sydney, AMP Capital's 50-storey Quay Quarter Tower is 80 per cent pre-committed to anchor tenants AMP and Deloitte two-and-a-half years before practical completion \u2013 well ahead of the 75 per cent figure it was counting on upon completion.\n\n\"That is an extremely high level,\" Mr Briscoe said.\n\nThe growth of cranes to record numbers in other sectors such as civil (37) and education (22) showed the effect of public infrastructure spending on the wider economy.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing changes in government\u2019s infrastructure spending and planning schemes is evident as the location of cranes gravitate along key city transportation corridors and activity centres,\u201d said Domenic Schiafone, consultancy RLB's Oceania director of research and development.\n\nA net loss of cranes in residential (down 3 to 145), mixed-use, commercial and educational work pulled Melbourne's count down for the first time in the past six reports. The city's total fell to 213 from 222 six months earlier.\n\nMelbourne's cranes are more concentrated in the city centre. RLB\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the latest count, which finished in mid-September, the city now has 13 cranes involved on the Melbourne Metro Tunnel and Western Distributor projects.\n\nCentral Sydney cranes are clustered around commercial developments. RLB\n\nSydney's crane total rose 9 to 319, making up most of the decline it suffered in the last count six months earlier.\n\nThe gain includes a net increase of just one residential crane to 233, while commercial cranes made a net gain of six to 44.\n\nTower cranes are more spread out across the NSW capital than in Melbourne, and they were closely following infrastructure projects, Mr Schiafone said.\n\n\"These are north along the Pacific Highway, west along Parramatta Road, north-east along the M2 and south along the Kingsway.\u201d\n\nCranes spread out across greater Sydney, following transport and infrastructure developments. RLB\n\nBrisbane continued the decline it has seen since the city's burst of apartment construction that peaked at 104 cranes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in the second quarter of 2016. In total, the city lost a further two cranes \u2013 and a net 15 in the residential sector \u2013 in the latest report to slip to 57.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gold Coast total slipped to 29 from 32, with a net decline in residential cranes partly offset by new cranes on retail projects.\n\nIn Perth, where overall activity picked up after troughing in early 2017 \u2013 and has fallen back again over the past 12 months \u2013 the crane count made a net gain of one, rising to 34 cranes.\n\nAdelaide rose to a record-high 19 cranes, with a boost of three coming from hotels and student accommodation projects.\n\nWollongong was counted for the first time in the latest report and added 18 cranes to the total. Including the NSW industrial city lifted the national total to 757. Its two commercial cranes took the office crane total to 85 and the city's two educational cranes took that total to 24.", "description": "Years of low office vacancy rates have given developers confidence to push the button on new projects, the latest RLB Crane Index shows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2859%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_789/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9972e6ac8dc9a10f1619956265694dc379782789", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
