Doubters (myself included) are standing at the ready to blast some holes in that vision. This is easily the best iPad ever made, but can it really do all the computer things it takes to actually replace your computer?\n\nAll those bests could convince you that this PC could replace a laptop. Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller certainly thinks so. When he introduced the iPad Pro, he said \"There are over 600 million PCs in use today that are over five years old. This is really sad! These people could really benefit from an iPad Pro.\"\n\nEverything I just said about that phrase also applies to the new iPad Pro itself. It looks so much like the iPad Air 2 that you\u2019ll mistake it for one when you see it, yet the insides are so much more powerful it\u2019ll blow your hair back. It\u2019s packed with a weapons depot of \"bests\" for a tablet: the best screen, the best speakers, the best camera, the best processor.\n\nSo said Tim Cook at the introduction of the new iPad Pro 9.7 last week. It\u2019s exactly the kind of phrase you expect from Cook\u2019s Apple: spoken humbly, but revealing a huge ambition. It mixes a thing that\u2019s familiar (the good ol\u2019 iPad) with an idealistic goal. And Apple likes to workshop these phrases until they have a fine, chamfered edge \u2014 it\u2019s not \"the iPad,\" it\u2019s just \"iPad.\" It\u2019s a little confusing, but it\u2019s definitely compelling, and when you first hear it you really want to buy in.\n\nThe most important thing to know about the new iPad Pro isn\u2019t the specs or the speed \u2014 it\u2019s the price. It starts at $599 for the 32GB model. It\u2019s difficult to even compare that price to the just-reduced iPad Air 2, since Apple has set up the storage options for these models differently \u2014 but in general you\u2019re looking at a $150 or more price differential. And if you\u2019re really going to use the \"Pro\" in the iPad Pro version, you\u2019ll probably want to pony up for the 128GB model, which is $749. Oh, and you will also probably want the Smart Keyboard for $149, and maybe the Apple Pencil for $99. You can easily spend $1000 or more on an iPad Pro kit Add it all up and you can easily spend $1,000 or more on an iPad Pro kit. That\u2019s not just computer pricing \u2014 that\u2019s computer pricing that\u2019s significantly more expensive than many Windows PCs or Chromebooks. If you\u2019re going to lay down that kind of money, you had better really know what you\u2019re going to get out of it. That\u2019s where the \"Pro\" part comes in. The difference between the iPad Pro and the iPad Air is roughly equivalent the difference between the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air: they can both essentially do the same things, but the Pro is just way, way faster. Figuring out what makes the Pro a Pro means you have to consider a constellation of features, and they don\u2019t map exactly to what\u2019s available on the bigger, 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Apple\u2019s product naming strategy is confusing, but it\u2019s got nothing on the feature matrix. So: the iPad Pro 9.7 has the same screen size and the same basic body as the iPad Air 2, but the Pro\u2019s screen is much better, with lower reflectivity and a wider color gamut. The Pro 9.7 also has a great new feature called \"True Tone\" that adjusts the color of the screen, which isn\u2019t available on the larger iPad Pro. The 9.7-inch Pro has the same A9X processor as its bigger brother, but with 2GB of RAM instead of 4GB. It has four speakers and a smart keyboard connector, like the big one. It also has a very good 12-megapixel camera (and the concomitant camera bump), which is better than what either the Air 2 or the larger Pro have. Oh, and the iPad Mini 2 and iPad Mini 4 still exist, for some reason. Got all that? Good \u2014 you can forget almost all of it. Because if you\u2019re interested in an iPad, your decision comes down to two things. What size screen do you want and \u2014 again \u2014 how much are you willing to spend to try out Apple\u2019s vision for \"the future of personal computing?\"\n\nMy favorite thing about the new iPad Pro is the screen. Apple says it\u2019s less reflective than the iPad Air 2 \u2014 40 percent less, to be precise. But while I couldn\u2019t really see that, I could see the True Tone color technology. There are hidden sensors on the face of the iPad that detect the color temperature of the room and automatically adjust the color temperature of the screen. The idea is that it\u2019s supposed to make your screen act more like a physical piece of paper. When you look at a white sheet of paper in yellow light, you\u2019re actually seeing a more yellow color tone, which is easier on your eyes. The iPad Pro\u2019s screen still looks like, well, a screen, but it is actually much nicer to look at. When I flicked True Tone off, suddenly the screen got very blue and looked really unnatural by comparison. It\u2019s the same color I\u2019ve been looking at for years, but suddenly it looks jarring. The True Tone display really works, and it's really nice Of course, if you\u2019re the kind of graphic designer I imagine Apple wants to cater to with the iPad Pro, you\u2019re going to be turning True Tone off \u2014 you need accurate color representation. But for normal use, giving up a little bit of color fidelity for a nicer-looking screen is great. I have no complaints about the performance of the iPad Pro, either. The battery is more than good enough to last a full day of work \u2014 and then some. In my tests it actually exceeded Apple\u2019s claimed life of 10 hours. The A9X processor inside is the same as what you\u2019ll find on the larger iPad Pro, and it flies. I don\u2019t feel like my iPad Air 2 is slow, but the Pro is generally able to render a web page almost twice as quickly. It also has fewer of those little pauses you tend to see when you\u2019re running split screen apps. The hope is that this iPad should be fast enough and powerful enough to act as a stand-in for the stuff you do on your computer. But I don\u2019t think it quite gets there. Part of it could be the 2GB of RAM, which isn\u2019t quite enough to have a ton of Safari tabs open and be responsive while running another app alongside it. The bigger issue, though, is that iOS isn\u2019t quite ready for my computing tasks. Safari still feels more like a mobile browser than a desktop browser, for one thing. For another, two apps at once is great but somehow I always feel like I need one more on the screen. That\u2019s to say nothing of the limitations that iOS still places on users and developers: you can\u2019t pick default apps for key things like email or web browsers, you don\u2019t have an easily accessible file system, and too many apps feel like stripped-down versions of their desktop equivalents. And sometimes, really, you just want to plug some USB thing into your computer without having to worry about adapters.\n\nIf you think of this iPad Pro as \"just\" an iPad, you\u2019re going to be impressed. I\u2019ve already enthused about the screen and the speed, but there\u2019s more to it. The four speakers are very loud and very good \u2014 there\u2019s not enough bass in them to replace your Bluetooth speaker, but there\u2019s more than enough volume to make you love watching movies in bed. The Apple Pencil is great too \u2014 it works exactly like it does on the bigger iPad Pro. I still wish that it was a little more pragmatically designed: it rolls around, you have to charge it by sticking it into the side of the iPad, and there\u2019s no \"eraser\" on the top. But it\u2019s incredibly responsive and accurate, works for shading at an angle, and is just all-around fun to use. The Smart Keyboard is easy to type on, but not as functional as it could be And then there\u2019s the camera, a 12-megapixel sensor that\u2019s the same as you\u2019ll find on the iPhone 6s or the new iPhone SE. I confess I haven\u2019t tried it in every single lighting condition, but in general it\u2019s been as fast and as good as it is on those phones \u2014 which is to say it is very good. It supports Live Photos (viewable with a long press, not 3D Touch) and I\u2019m long past griping about people using this massive screen to take photos. It does have a camera bump, which I find aesthetically aggravating but at least it doesn\u2019t make the iPad wobble when you set it on a table. I can\u2019t deny that it is the best camera ever put on a tablet, but nevertheless the only thing I can say about deciding to put this much camera in a tablet is as follows: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I\u2019m also of two minds about the Smart Keyboard, the $149 accessory that attaches directly to the Smart Connector on the bottom of the iPad Pro. On the one hand, I\u2019ve never acclimated as quickly to typing on a small-sized keyboard as I did on this. Apple has done some clever things with the design to make it thin, light, and durable \u2014 there are effectively no moving parts inside it, for example, it just uses the custom fabric weave to provide feedback to your fingers. On a desk, it\u2019s as good as typing on a 9.7-inch iPad as you\u2019re going to get. But while the core typing experience is great, the rest isn\u2019t. I still find the integrated Smart Cover setup kind of fiddly, and it only works at the one, single angle \u2014 so lap typing can get a little frustrating. And other Bluetooth keyboards (and, presumably, other Smart Connector keyboards soon to come) have both backlights and specialized function keys for things like music playback and volume. So as much as I like typing on it, I think the best move is to wait and see if a better keyboard from a third-party becomes available. Looking at you, Logitech.\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge", "description": "\"We believe that iPad is the perfect expression of the future of personal computing.\"\nSo said Tim Cook at the introduction of the new iPad Pro 9.7 last week.
