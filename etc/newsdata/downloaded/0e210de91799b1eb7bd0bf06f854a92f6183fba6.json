We haven\u2019t changed our position, because it\u2019s the position shared by all Europeans, and this obviously means guaranteeing the security conditions of those prisons and camps. That\u2019s why the Turkish intrusion and offensive of the past two days is extremely serious. It\u2019s extremely serious and we totally condemn it; the French President spoke about this earlier. It\u2019s extremely serious because it undermines five years of fighting against Daesh [so-called ISIL]. Because the enemy is Daesh. Contrary to what some people think, Daesh isn\u2019t dead. Daesh fighters are currently in the camps or prisons or have gone underground and are waiting for only one thing: for people to turn their eyes to other issues so that they can reorganize and restart the caliphate. So we have to be extremely vigilant on this. That\u2019s why the Turkish offensive is extremely serious. It\u2019s also serious because, as you\u2019ve said, a lot of displaced people and refugees are going to add to the displaced people and refugees who are currently living in extremely difficult conditions.\n\nQ. \u2013 But to get back to the Daesh soldiers, who are therefore in danger of escaping\u2026\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 We haven\u2019t reached that point.\n\nQ. \u2013 We haven\u2019t reached that point. But some worries are being expressed \u2013 and the President expressed them too \u2013 about the restoration of the caliphate\u2026\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 We haven\u2019t reached that point. It\u2019s a concern we must take into consideration. But we haven\u2019t reached that point.\n\nQ. \u2013 But shouldn\u2019t those Daesh soldiers have been repatriated, at least the French ones, to be tried in France so we can at least be sure they\u2019re imprisoned?\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 Our point of view is that terrorists must be tried where they committed their crimes. The people who have been victims of the jihadist fighters\u2019 attacks, bombings, threats and torture should be able to see them tried locally. That\u2019s what we want, as do many Europeans.\n\nQ. \u2013 Even if we risk them being released one day\u2026\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 At the same time, we must totally ensure the security of those places; but we\u2019ll come back to this, I imagine. It\u2019s also a prerequisite we\u2019re especially mindful of.\n\nQ. \u2013 Are there currently any French forces in Syria?\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 I won\u2019t answer that question. I was defence minister for a long time, I\u2019m [now] Foreign Minister and I\u2019ve never commented on the operation of special forces.\n\nQ. \u2013 So there are special forces. What can we do today to stop the Turks?\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 We must reclaim history. We created a coalition against Daesh five years ago. In that coalition against Daesh, which is an international coalition, France has played its full role. The coalition has not only been able to remove Daesh from certain territories in Iraq, it\u2019s also managed to ensure that north-east Syria, thanks to the alliance with the Syrian Democratic Forces, is stabilized \u2013 in a fragile way, but stabilized \u2013 pending the peace process that will clearly have to come one day, somehow or other. So that coalition bears responsibility for what happens afterwards. I must tell you today that France would like that international coalition, which has been mutually supportive until now, to meet very urgently to ensure everyone faces up to their responsibilities \u2013 not only the Turks but also every member of the coalition. There are about 30\u2026\n\nQ. \u2013 Because the Turks are part of the coalition.\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 There are about 30 countries in the coalition \u2013 [which includes] the Australians, the Canadians, the Gulf countries, the Turks and a lot of Europeans \u2013 which share our feeling and expressed it at the Security Council earlier in New York. The international coalition must meet, because we\u2019re in a new situation and because the fight against Daesh is in danger of resuming, because Daesh is waiting only for this opportunity to get out. So France is asking for this international coalition, which has met several times, to meet today\u2026\n\nQ. \u2013 When was the last time?\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 Oh, back at the start of 2019! [France is asking] for it to say today, right: what\u2019s the situation? What do we do? What do you, the Turks, want to do? What do you, the Americans, want to do? How do we ensure the security of places where there are currently jihadists and fighters in prison? In short, put everything on the table, clearly, so that everyone shoulders their responsibilities and also put everyone on the spot: \u201cWhat are you doing? What are you doing? How are we going to manage our security tomorrow?\u201d Because what\u2019s at stake is our security, your security, which is today being undermined by the Turkish offensive as it\u2019s unfolding at the moment.\n\nQ. \u2013 There\u2019s our security. There\u2019s also the threat brandished by Turkish President [Recep Tayyip] Erdo\u011fan that he\u2019ll let these Syrian refugees go \u2013 there are currently 3.6 million of them in Turkey\u2026\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 Yes, yes, it isn\u2019t the first time\u2026\n\nQ. \u2013 Yes, it isn\u2019t the first time, but before an agreement was concluded with Turkey in 2016 to close the Balkan route, a million refugees entered Europe. If he opens the floodgates again, it isn\u2019t easy to see how those refugees would be prevented from coming again!\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 Today, first of all, the European Union has never operated in response to blackmail, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good approach. But, rather, let\u2019s bring the international coalition together to raise these questions as well. President Erdo\u011fan must also know that in the zone where we said 450,000 people were living, today you\u2019ve got 60,000 who have already been displaced. So his intervention is going to increase the number of refugees going to Turkey. Moreover\u2026\n\nQ. \u2013 But he wants to get rid of a million refugees and put them in that zone.\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 \u2026Turkey also knows perfectly well that resurrecting Daesh or helping resurrect Daesh, as they\u2019re doing today, may also have repercussions on Turkish territory, because there have been attacks by Daesh on Turkish soil, especially in Istanbul, but elsewhere too. That fear must be shared to some extent by the Turkish public.\n\nQ. \u2013 Can we say that the Americans have betrayed the Kurds?\n\nTHE MINISTER \u2013 President Trump doesn\u2019t seem to have opposed the operation the Turks are carrying out today, even though much firmer positions are being asserted today. All the more reason for talking about this around a table and for the international coalition \u2013 of which we\u2019re members, of which the United States is a member and which is responsible for taking military action in the area \u2013 to meet and clarify things. So we want this to happen as soon as possible. (\u2026)./.", "description": "Syria/Turkish offensive in north-east Syria/European Union \u2013 Interview given by M.
