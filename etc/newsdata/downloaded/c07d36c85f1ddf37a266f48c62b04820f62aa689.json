Yet the gains only partly mitigated a 1% drop on Sunday, with the index down 0.4% since the start of the year.\n\nBlue chip Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (2010.SE) gained 0.6% after tumbling nearly 3% on Sunday when the company said it had curtailed feedback supplies by about 49% following the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe critical issues for Saudi Arabia and the global oil market are the extent of the damage and the time required to restore Aramco\u2019s oil and gas supply,\u201d said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, adding the short-term impact could be partly mitigated by the kingdom drawing down strategic oil reserves.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal deficit could widen by some 0.9-1.0% of GDP under the scenario mentioned above, though oil revenue would see some support from the higher oil price as production and exports gradually normalize.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi Arabia could hit a fiscal deficit of 6.5% of GDP compared with 5.9% in 2018, as higher government expenditure is likely to curb the upside of stronger non-oil economic growth.", "description": "Dollar-denominated bonds issued by Saudi Arabia's government and state-oil firm Saudi Aramco tumbled to multi-week lows on Monday following a weekend attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities that shut about 5% of global supply.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
