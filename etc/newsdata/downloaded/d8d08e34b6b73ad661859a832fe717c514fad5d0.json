Iran distanced itself from the attacks, but said it was ready for \"full-fledged\" war.\n\n\"I don't think it would be the right thing to blame Iran,\" Erdogan said in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Wednesday, adding that the attacks came from several parts of Yemen.\n\n\"If we just place the entire burden on Iran, it won't be the right way to go. Because the evidence available does not necessarily point to that fact,\" Erdogan said, according to a translation of his comments broadcast by Fox.\n\nSaudi Arabia is in consultation \"with friends and allies about the next steps to take,\" its Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on the heartland of Saudi Arabia's oil industry damaged the world's biggest petroleum-processing facility and knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Daren Butler; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan urged caution over blaming Iran for a Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, adding that it would not be right to place the entire burden on the Islamic Republic.
