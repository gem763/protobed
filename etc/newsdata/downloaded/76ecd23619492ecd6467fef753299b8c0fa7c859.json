It is estimated drivers in Brussels spend about 85 hours a year stuck in traffic.\n\nProfile What is the history of hitchhiking? Show Hide The practice of hitchhiking is often given the thumbs up in periods of crisis. It is thought to have first been taken up by US army recruits during the first world war, when they would need to travel vast distances to get home during breaks. The recruits would hike for a while before seeking to hitch a ride from the growing number of vehicles on the roads. There was a need to move around for work during the Great Depression, and it became a staple of the literature of that period, including in John Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of Wrath. The rationing of petrol in the second world war turned hitchhiking into a patriotic act. But the development of motorways, from which it is illegal to hitchhike in the UK, for example, curtailed the practice \u2013 as did concerns about safety.\n\nContributing factors to the problem include a corporate tradition of providing company cars to employees, Belgians\u2019 propensity to commute into their main cities and the poor layout of orbital roads around Brussels.\n\nThe Brussels minister for mobility, Elke Van den Brandt, said the situation could not be allowed to continue and she would be launching a free app in the hope of reducing the number of single-occupant cars.\n\n\u201cA startup is working on this application project aimed at reinvigorating hitchhiking,\u201d Van den Brandt said.\n\nJulien Uyttendaele, an MP in the Brussels parliament whose Socialist party is part of the governing coalition, said the intention was not to compete with private companies offering taxi and carpooling services, but to engender a more receptive attitude towards the old practice of hitchhiking.\n\nFive reasons Belgium has the worst traffic in Europe Read more\n\n\u201cThe goal here is not to have a business logic like BlaBlaCar or UberPOP but to offer an app that would allow drivers to get in touch with passengers who want to share part of their journey for free,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCurrently, hitchhiking has become obsolete and the logic of bringing a stranger into the vehicle is considered insecure. But via new technologies, this measure would help in the fight against the damage we are inflicting upon ourselves.\u201d\n\nVan den Brandt said that beyond clearing the roads, it was vital to act now as part of efforts to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nThe Belgian capital\u2019s efforts to tackle congestion have been hindered by its complicated structure of government, with the Brussels parliament needing to coordinate efforts with the federal, Francophone Walloon, and Flemish authorities.\n\nVan den Brandt said: \u201cWe have to look for what we have in common and find solutions together. Maybe it will not be easy, but we will talk. I am optimistic.\u201d\n\nThe city is also looking at introducing a congestion charge similar to the one deployed in London. It is estimated drivers in Brussels can expect a journey to take an average of 37% longer than it should.", "description": "Local government backs new app connecting drivers who have spare seats with workers", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa4908d63703159df1bc4cd731fd6a99d690315d/0_205_4782_2869/master/4782.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f0beb230a83201714baeedad55f36d3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
