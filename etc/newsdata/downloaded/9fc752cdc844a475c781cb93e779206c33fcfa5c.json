Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2015 all of whom are firmly in the double digits and are leading the pack of 19 hopefuls jockeying for the Democratic bid.\n\nO\u2019Rourke dismissed the numbers while speaking to The New York Times last month, stating that he has instead \u201cjust been focused on saying what\u2019s on my mind, being myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd not really in the slightest being interested in polls, or how things poll, or what you\u2019re supposed to say,\u201d he added.\n\nO\u2019Rourke drove that point home in the third Democratic debate in September when, in the wake of the August mass shooting that left 22 people dead at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart, he told the audience, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nThe vociferous call for gun control sparked outrage from the right and even troubled members of his own party who raised concerns that the comment was practically a gift to the GOP.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another Democratic candidate, told CNN days later that he felt O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement played into Republicans\u2019 hands.\n\nHowever, in his latest interview with Politico, O\u2019Rourke, who is pushing for a mandatory assault weapons buyback program, showed no signs of backing down.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue to keep this issue front and center if we\u2019re going to make any progress on it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have an opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke will face off on Tuesday night with 11 other candidates at the fourth Democratic debate, which will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.", "description": "For the Democratic presidential candidate, it may be all or nothing.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da62dd3200000ba0c503b84.jpeg?cache=sgsu1acpcn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
