Secularism is about welcoming all parents without exception.\u201d\n\nBlanquer told BFMTV that even though French law did not ban mothers in headscarves from going on school trips as volunteers, he wanted to avoid this \u201cas much as possible\u201d. He said he encouraged \u201cdialogue\u201d in which headteachers would ask mothers to remove their scarves. He said the parents association had made a \u201cregrettable\u201d mistake by using the picture.\n\nThe parents association that produced the pamphlet, the FCPE, said the minister was wrong. Its co-president Rodrigo Arenas said: \u201cWe\u2019re on the side of the law and we\u2019re simply here to inform parents of their rights.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s state council has ruled that parents are free to wear what they like. This means mothers on school trips can wear headscarves. And yet there are still school trips in France which are cancelled by teachers who won\u2019t allow mothers in headscarves to accompany children.\n\n\u201cWe protect parents\u2019 rights. Secularism in France is about including people, not excluding them.\u201d\n\nTeachers in France regularly ask for parents to volunteer to accompany school outings to museums or galleries. But there has been political debate and counter-protests over whether volunteer mothers in headscarves should be excluded in the name of French secularism.\n\nThere is no law preventing a Muslim mother in a headscarf from accompanying a school trip. The state council ruled in 2013 that mothers outside school were not affected by the strict neutrality rules for state workers such as teachers or hospital staff who cannot wear any religious symbols in the workplace, including headscarves and turbans.\n\nThe French republic is built on a strict separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. In theory, the state is neutral on religion and allows everyone the freedom to practise their faith as long as there is no threat to public order.\n\nBut the row is the latest political standoff over Muslim women\u2019s dress in France, where the headscarf has long been a political issue. Girls have been banned from wearing head coverings in state schools since 2004, along with other religious symbols.\n\nUnder the rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy, the education ministry issued a memo in 2012 recommending schools uphold the \u201cneutrality of public service\u201d on school trips, meaning mothers in hijabs should take off their head coverings if they wanted to help. The memo left schools free to decide. As a result some barred mothers in headscarves and others did not.\n\nAt the time, mothers\u2019 groups protested against women in headscarves being prevented from boarding coaches on school trips. Parents\u2019 representatives in some parts of France said mothers in headscarves were so active in volunteering to help with school projects that excluding them meant outings could not happen.\n\nThis year, rightwing senators voted to add a clause to a new education law to ban mothers in headscarves going on school trips, but a cross-party parliamentary commission altered the amendment.\n\nThe FCPE also announced it would take legal action for incitement to hatred against Laurent Bouvet, a university professor who founded an association called Printemps R\u00e9publicain to defend secularism and who sits on an advisory body on secularism in education.\n\nBouvet had shared on social media a parody of the flyer replacing the woman in a headscarf with jihadis carrying guns.\n\nAur\u00e9lien Tach\u00e9 (@Aurelientache) Une plainte justifi\u00e9e.
