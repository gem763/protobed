Somewhere in the process that promise has been hijacked. the Corbyn revolution has been hijacked by a handful of bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nEmily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also made clear her unhappiness with the position, saying Labour risked getting stuck in a \u201ccrusher\u201d between leave and remain with the \u201cwalls coming in\u201d unless it picks a side before an election.\n\nAnother shadow cabinet minister involved in election campaign planning told the Guardian that his position has changed and he now believes Labour needs to campaign to remain, because of the risk of voters moving to a revitalised Lib Dem party.\n\nHe said the mood in shadow cabinet had shifted towards becoming a pro-remain party because of polling, focus groups and the mood in the party and on the doorsteps, but it had not met for some weeks.\n\nThe issue has been causing serious tensions within Corbyn\u2019s own team. It is understood Fisher, who resigned citing a lack of \u201cprofessionalism, competence and human decency\u201d in the Labour leader\u2019s team, has been arguing that the party\u2019s policy of trying to appeal to both sides over Brexit was no longer working and was electorally problematic.\n\nHe tweeted several supportive policy statements on Sunday, indicating he was still backing Corbyn\u2019s project overall and sources confirmed he would stay on to write the manifesto at the next election.\n\nWith Brexit due to be debated by members on Monday, pro-remain activists said they would not back down on efforts to let members get a clear vote on whether Labour should campaign now and at an election to stay in the EU.\n\nA group of delegates were due meet on Sunday night to decide the text of one or two motions on Brexit through a process known as \u201ccompositing\u201d, with about 80 local parties having proposed a clear remain position.\n\nMichael Chessum, of Another Europe is Possible, said: \u201cWe are utterly determined to take a remain position to conference floor tomorrow \u2026 there will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn.\u201d\n\nThe second day of conference was dominated by the row over Brexit, but many anti-Corbyn MPs were also exercised by the move earlier in the week to abolish Watson\u2019s post as deputy leader. This was abandoned on Saturday after an intervention from Corbyn, but MPs on the centrist wing of the party were up in arms about the move against him.\n\nSeveral suggested on their Whatsapp group that Watson should challenge Corbyn for the leadership or lead a public split of Labour MPs, regardless of the country potentially being very close to a general election.\n\nWatson is understood to have dismissed the idea that this was time for a breakaway but the deputy leader arrived at the party\u2019s conference earlier than expected in order to fight any further attempts on his position.\n\nTwo shadow cabinet ministers told the Guardian they believed the bid to oust Watson was related to concerns within the Labour leadership about Corbyn\u2019s position if he were to lose an election and stand down, with the deputy leader potentially becoming the most powerful elected person in the party.\n\nWatson was among those on the NEC who declined to support the statement on Brexit, which is also expected to be put to a vote on the conference floor.\n\nWatson said: \u201cI have no doubt that Jeremy\u2019s supporters on the NEC will endorse any statement he proposes. However, without the NEC having met to debate over it, we risk giving an imperfect document to conference, and the document not being given the weight it deserves by delegates.\u201d\n\nAnd Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator and a prospective parliamentary candidate, said Corbyn must decide on Labour\u2019s Brexit this week, not after a general election.\n\n\u201cWe have to decide at this conference. The one we have come to, the one we have travelled across the country to come to, not at some putative further conference which is presumably in the mythical land with that fucking table with all our options on it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Leader in conference bid to stop party campaigning for remain at general election", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Heather Stewart", "Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/771d7844919799afa876bf0bc29f1924a7d7d88d/0_30_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f8ef18cbb4f3a86974f848c885f0349", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
