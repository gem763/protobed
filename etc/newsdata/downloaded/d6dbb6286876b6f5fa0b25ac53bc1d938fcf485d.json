Photo: Paramount Pictures\n\nThis post is updated regularly to reflect the latest movies to leave and enter Hulu. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nWhen a lot of people think of Hulu, they might think of it as the best streaming service for current television, with a few of their original shows thrown in for good measure. That\u2019s a shame: Film lovers still don\u2019t really utilize the service\u2019s surprisingly deep library of movies, all free to subscribers. As we have with Netflix and Amazon, we\u2019re hear to provide a service \u2014 a regularly updated list of the best movies you can watch on Hulu right this minute. Get started.\n\n12 Monkeys\n\nTerry Gilliam\u2019s sci-fi allegory is one of the visually ambitious director\u2019s best films, a perfect blend of style and daring storytelling. Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt star in a story of time travel, betrayal, and even romance. Based loosely on the legendary short La Jet\u00e9e, this is a reminder of how studio films used to take genuine risks. It\u2019s hard to imagine a major company getting behind a movie this strange in 2019.\n\n13 Assassins\n\nThe prolific and brilliant Takashi Miike had one of the biggest hits of his career in 2010 with his remake of Eiichi Kudo\u2019s 1963 samurai film. Set in 1844, 13 Assassins is an old-fashioned samurai pic with a modern Miike edge. In other words, you get everything you want from a movie like this and it\u2019s all filtered through Miike\u2019s unforgettable style.\n\nAin\u2019t Them Bodies Saints\n\nBefore he made A Ghost Story and Pete\u2019s Dragon, the great David Lowery made his film debut at Sundance with this meditative, elegiac film about an escaped criminal (Casey Affleck) trying to get back to his girlfriend (Rooney Mara). With echoes of Bonnie and Clyde, this film announced Lowery as a talent right away.\n\n*Airplane!\n\nComedies don\u2019t get much funnier than this 1980 smash hit from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker, a spoof of the disaster genre franchises of the \u201870s. A film that always ranks highly on any list of the best comedies ever made, Airplane! holds up wonderfully as a perfect blend of physical humor and slapstick comedy. Quotable to the extreme, Airplane! is one of those movies people like to say can\u2019t be made today. Check it out to see why.\n\n*An American Werewolf in London\n\nJohn Landis\u2019s 1981 horror-comedy stars David Naughton and Griffin Dunne as two students who have a very strange trip to the United Kingdom, where they are attacked by a werewolf. A critical and commercial success, one of the main reasons to check out Werewolf almost four decades after its release is to see the remarkable make-up effects, highlighted in a transformation scene that has lost none of its terrifying power.\n\nAnnihilation\n\nParamount notoriously didn\u2019t know what to do with Alex Garland\u2019s latest sci-fi masterpiece and so they dumped it in U.S. theaters and sold it to Netflix in the rest of the world. In the States, it\u2019s not on Netflix but is sitting there on Hulu, waiting for you to catch up with the fascinating story of \u201cThe Shimmer\u201d and what it does to characters played by Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac. It\u2019s only just over a year old but has already developed a loyal following.\n\nArrival\n\nSpeaking of brainy sci-fi, Denis Villeneuve seems to be one of the modern masters of the subgenre with Blade Runner 2049 and this Oscar nominee. Amy Adams stars as the woman who figures out how to communicate with an alien species that lands on Earth. However, this emotional film becomes more about humanity than anything extraterrestrial.\n\nBabe\n\nOne of the few children\u2019s films incredible enough to be nominated for Best Picture, George Miller\u2019s brilliant 1995 fables feels timeless almost a quarter-century later. Miller and his team of CGI masters are playing with universal themes of family entertainment \u2013 don\u2019t give up, don\u2019t let anyone else define you, the underdog arc, etc. \u2013 but they do so in a fresh, clever, moving way.\n\n*Bad Lieutenant\n\nAbel Ferrara\u2019s 1992 drama features one of the most fearless performances of its era from Harvey Keitel. Long before monsters were regularly the protagonists of independent films, audiences were shocked by Keitel\u2019s portrayal of an NYPD lieutenant who has gone completely off the rails. Sure, we had edgy cops, but we didn\u2019t have ones who smoked crack while on the job or masturbates in front of teenage girls. This is the kind of insanity that should make for a B-movie, but Ferrara and Keitel elevate it into fine art.\n\nBad Santa\n\nBilly Bob Thornton gives one of his most playful performances in this 2003 dark comedy about, well, a bad Santa. Every year, Thornton\u2019s career criminal gets a job as a department store Santa in order to rob the place, but this year is a bit different. Incredibly raunchy and deeply cynical, this is a brand of comedy for adults that is too rarely done well nowadays.\n\nBeautiful Girls\n\nTed Demme\u2019s relationship comedy made almost nothing when it was released in the winter of 1996, but it developed a cult following over the years in large part because of its terrific ensemble, including a nearly movie-stealing performance from a young Natalie Portman. Remember when they made movies like Diner and The Big Chill \u2013 flicks with big ensembles of interesting characters bouncing off one another? This is one of those, and it\u2019s a great one.\n\nBill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\n\nWyld Stallyns Forever! With the recent announcement that Bill S. Preston Esquire and Theodore \u201cTed\u201d Logan would be returning in 2020\u2019s Bill & Ted Face the Music, the time is right to catch up on this 1989 comedy classic, a movie that impacted pop culture in a way that barely seems possible today. But don\u2019t just appreciate this flick as a piece of nostalgia \u2013 it would be sweet, clever, and funny if it were released today too.\n\nThe Birdcage\n\nMike Nichols\u2019s remake of the beloved La Cage aux Folles is a joyous comedy about acceptance and love that still works well today (which is not something you can say about a lot of mid-\u201990s comedies). Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are phenomenal as a gay couple forced to jump through hoops for their son\u2019s new in-laws, played wonderfully by Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest. It\u2019s funny and smart front to back.\n\nBorat\n\nSacha Baron Cohen\u2019s 2006 mockumentary remains the king of the hill when it comes to cringeworthy cultural clashes in comedy. Cohen is like no other modern comedian \u2014he\u2019s more in tune with people like Andy Kaufman in how he\u2019s willing to do anything for a joke and go places other comedians wouldn\u2019t even consider. This film find him at his creative peak, mixing commentary about xenophobia with slapstick humor in a way that felt transcendent at the time and holds up on repeat viewing.\n\nBreakdown\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good underrated thriller, look no further than this 1997 film about a road trip gone horribly awry. Jonathan Mostow directs the always great Kurt Russell as a man who has some words with a truck driver and learns that road rage is never the answer. A mix of modern fears with a noir sensibility, this is a tight, effective little movie of the kind that doesn\u2019t really make it to theaters all that often anymore.\n\n*Bull Durham\n\nAny list of the greatest baseball movies of all time that doesn\u2019t include Ron Shelton\u2019s Bull Durham is simply incomplete. This is another great example of a movie that found its three stars at exactly the peak of their powers. Tim Robbins is at his gawky best and it\u2019s arguable that no one has had the chemistry that Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon had here. Watch this scene and try to argue otherwise.\n\nCertified Copy\n\nAbbas Kiarostami passed away too young in 2016 but he left a notable library of great works, including Close-Up, A Taste of Cherry, and his final film, 24 Frames. However, the best work of his career is sitting right there on Hulu to introduce you to his filmography. This 2010 drama is a riveting movie about a woman (Juliette Binoche) and man (William Shimell) who seem to be meeting and flirting for the first time\u2026but then maybe not. Kiarostami plays with the very nature of how relationships are captured on film in one of the best films of the \u201810s.\n\nChasing Amy\n\nKevin Smith\u2019s best film is also one of his most personal, the story of a man who falls in love with a lesbian and destroys his friendship in the process. Smith has never been better than he is here at capturing believable, funny human relationships, and he gets his best acting work of his career as well from Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, and Jason Lee. It won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay for a reason.\n\nChicken Run\n\nThere are precious few quality family films on Hulu, so you should try and embrace the few options you do have, such as this 2000 hit from Peter Lord and Nick Park, two of the geniuses behind Aardman Animations. A clever riff on prison break movies like Escape from Alcatraz (but with chickens!) this is actually the highest-grossing stop-motion animated film of all time, a title it\u2019s held for almost 20 years now.\n\n*Child\u2019s Play\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love Chucky? The homicidal doll recently popped up again in pop culture with a reboot, but the original franchise is still going strong. Go back to where it all began with this classic horror-comedy, a movie that scared a generation into throwing away their toys.\n\nChinatown\n\nForget it, Jake. One of the essential films of the \u201870s was directed by Roman Polanski and released to rapturous reviews in 1974. (It would have won Best Picture if not for a little movie called The Godfather, Part II.) Jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, a private eye who gets involved in the California Water Wars in the \u201830s. Polanski uses a noir structure to get at something deeper about corruption and poison in the entire system. It\u2019s a masterpiece.\n\nThe Cider House Rules\n\nAn imperfect but sweet movie, Lasse Hallstrom\u2019s 1999 adaptation of the John Irving novel is mostly worth watching today for the excellent performance of Michael Caine, which one the beloved actor his second Oscar. His work supports Tobey Maguire as the lead Homer Wells, who lives at an orphanage at which Caine\u2019s doctor performs illegal abortions. An unusual coming-of-age film that\u2019s strengthened by a great cast, especially Caine.\n\nClerks\n\nFor those too young to remember when a little black-and-white movie about convenience-store clerks took the world by storm, it can be kind of hard to explain why Clerks was so huge. Sure, it\u2019s a very funny movie \u2013 arguably Kevin Smith\u2019s funniest in terms of pure laughs, even to this day \u2013 but what was so amazing about Clerks was the sense it gave a generation of filmmakers that they could do it, too. DIY filmmaking was never the same.\n\n*The Color Purple\n\nSteven Spielberg is often cited as one of film\u2019s best purveyors of movie magic, but he doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves as a director of historical dramas like Lincoln, Bridge of Spies, and Schindler\u2019s List. That part of his career really started here with this 1985 film that took the childlike wonder of Spielberg\u2019s early films and turned them to a darker chapter of American history. It\u2019s a huge turning point in the career of one of history\u2019s best directors.\n\nColumbus\n\nThere are Oscar winners and blockbusters on Hulu when you want something familiar, but sometimes it pays to dig in a little deeper and find a movie that\u2019s been overlooked. You shouldn\u2019t miss this gem from kogonada, starring John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson. It\u2019s a beautiful, elegiac piece of work about unexpected connections and, believe it or not, architecture.\n\nThe Crying Game\n\nSometimes a movie\u2019s quality can become overshadowed by the headline-grabbing twist in its final act. Such was the case with Neil Jordan\u2019s 1992 hit, a movie that became a cultural phenomenon because of its twist, but the movie itself kind of faded into history. Even without the shocker, this is a solid film with great performances by Stephen Rea, Forest Whitaker, and Jaye Davidson.\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard of it? Probably the most popular film on Hulu, Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2008 blockbuster redefined not just the superhero movie but the blockbuster altogether. Winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, The Dark Knight redefined critical acceptance of an oft-maligned genre, and movies haven\u2019t really been the same since it premiered. It\u2019s arguably the most influential film of its era.\n\nDazed and Confused\n\nRichard Linklater\u2019s semi-biographical and hilarious coming-of-age film is one of the best of the notable writer-director\u2019s career. Maybe you wrote this off in the past as just another stoner comedy, but this movie deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as films like American Graffiti and Diner for the way it captures the way young people really communicate with affectionate and genuine filmmaking. It also launched a dozen or so careers, including Parker Posey\u2019s and Ben Affleck\u2019s.\n\nThe Dead Zone\n\nDavid Cronenberg directed one of the best adaptations of Stephen King\u2019s work in this 1983 hit starring Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, and Martin Sheen. Walken plays a man who comes out of a coma with psychic powers. He can grab your hand and know your secrets, possibly even your future. When he shakes hands with a candidate for the Senate and sees a horrifying vision of nuclear holocaust, he knows he has to act. It\u2019s a little dated, but Cronenberg\u2019s craftsmanship keeps it humming.\n\nDheepan\n\nThe continued debate over immigration and refugee crises around the world has kept Jacques Audiard\u2019s Dheepan incredibly relevant. This Palme d\u2019Or winner (the biggest prize at Cannes) tells the story of a man who escapes war-torn Sri Lanka and moves to France with a family he doesn\u2019t know. The first half is more of a character drama than the stark, action-driven second half. See for yourself if they work together as a complete piece for you.\n\nFences\n\nViola Davis finally won her first Oscar for Denzel Washington\u2019s 2016 adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Davis plays the wife of Washington\u2019s Pittsburgh-based trashman in the 1950s in this study of a patriarch who rules with an iron fist. Washington and Davis find the truth in characters who would have been stereotypes in the hands of lesser actors.\n\nA Fish Called Wanda\n\nOne of the funniest movies ever made is just sitting there on Hulu waiting for you to laugh again. This brilliant 1988 comedy stars John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin, and Kevin Kline, whose timing is so good here that it should be studied by anyone seeking to do comedic acting. How good? So good that he won an Oscar for it.\n\n*The Fifth Element\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of great sci-fi on Hulu, but you should fire this one up if you\u2019re jonesing for something set in a different time and place in space. And make sure you fire it up on the biggest TV in your house and with the volume at a level to wake the neighbors. Luc Besson\u2019s vision isn\u2019t exactly a great piece of storytelling, but this Bruce Willis vehicle is a perfect example of the director\u2019s skill with world-building and technical elements.\n\nForce Majeure\n\nThis 2014 Swedish film became an international hit on the back of rave reviews. It\u2019s a searing examination of how an incident can forever change a relationship. In this case, the incident happens to be an avalanche, and the patriarch of a traveling family\u2019s decision to run instead of protecting his wife and kids. All four survive the natural disaster, but they\u2019re not quite the same again. It\u2019s being remade with Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. See the original first.\n\nFree Solo\n\nThe surprising winner for the 2019 Oscar for Best Documentary is already right there on Hulu for you to catch up with it. Be careful to have someone nearby to hold your hand if you\u2019re scared of heights. Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin are the directors, but the star is Alex Honnold, a \u201cfree climber,\u201d someone who tackles mountain faces without any gear. His latest quest? To take down El Capitan, one of the most famous rock formations in the world, and one that had never been free-climbed.\n\nGoldfinger\n\nBond, James Bond. One of the most iconic characters in the history of films may have officially started in 1962\u2019s Dr. No and 1963\u2019s From Russia with Love certainly ain\u2019t bad, but this is the real essential film from the early days of 007. One of the best movies of its kind ever made, this is the Sean Connery iteration of Bond, of course, and his adventures with the villainous Auric Goldfinger and the Bond girl with most unforgettable name, Pussy Galore.\n\n*Gone Baby Gone\n\nBen Affleck\u2019s adaptation of a great Dennis Lehane thriller stars the actor/director\u2019s brother as a Boston detective investigating the disappearance of a little girl. Affleck\u2019s greatest gift as a filmmaker is with ensemble and this is arguably his best with Casey, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Michelle Monaghan and the Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan filling out an amazing cast in a riveting thriller. It\u2019s great.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, The Weird\n\nWhat if we told you there was a crazy, stylish, unforgettable Korean Western just sitting there on Hulu waiting for you to discover it? Kim Jee-woon\u2019s 2008 epic is a study in style, a movie that blends Spaghetti Western influences with modern sensibilities and action choreography. It\u2019s not unlike The Matrix meets Sergio Leone. Who doesn\u2019t want to see that?\n\nThe Green Mile\n\nFrank Darabont\u2019s The Green Mile isn\u2019t the director\u2019s most famous Stephen King adaptation, but it\u2019s arguably even more earnest and heartfelt than The Shawshank Redemption. Tom Hanks stars as a death-row officer who meets a prisoner (Michael Clarke Duncan) who may have supernatural powers. It\u2019s a solid adaptation of a great King book, and history has kind of forgotten it in favor or more popular King adaptations and Hanks performances. Check it out.\n\nGrizzly Man\n\nIn 2003, Timothy Treadwell, a nature enthusiast, was killed by a grizzly bear in New York state. Two years later, Werner Herzog made one of the best documentaries of his career about not just Treadwell\u2019s passing but the tenuous connection he had with mother nature, one that eventually broke and resulted in his death. It\u2019s a fascinating examination of man\u2019s place in a dangerous world.\n\nThe Guilty\n\nGustav M\u00f6ller\u2019s 2018 film is a riveting thriller that takes place entirely in an emergency call center in Copenhagen. An officer, demoted to working there because of a pending court case, answers a call from a frightened woman. His life will never be the same as he works to try to save her and makes some false assumptions along the way. The kind of tight little thriller that you should watch before they inevitably remake it.\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky\n\nAmerican audiences don\u2019t have enough love for Mike Leigh, one of the best filmmakers still working today. His 2008 dramedy stars Sally Hawkins as a teacher who is almost strangely optimistic, and the ways in which the harsh truth of reality sometimes challenges her rosy outlook. Hawkins should have won the Oscar for her nuanced, layered work in one of Leigh\u2019s best films.\n\nHeathers\n\nIgnore the think pieces about how Heathers plays today and watch this 1989 dark comedy, a satire that caught Christian Slater and Winona Ryder at just the right time in their careers. She plays the outcast in high school and he plays the mysterious new kid who teaches her the art of vengeance. Is some of it dated? Sure, but it\u2019s still sharp in the way it weaponizes the clique culture that has arguably become even more prominent in the three decades since.\n\nHellraiser\n\nClive Barker\u2019s terrifying literary sensibility has too rarely been adapted well for the big screen, but this 1987 horror classic is the exception. Writing and directing an adaptation of his own work, Barker created an unforgettable vision of an alternate dimension of creatures born of nightmare fuel. In the \u201880s, there was Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead. And the last one was arguably the scariest.\n\n*Hero\n\nNear the end of a run in which Jet Li was one of the biggest stars in the world, this wuxia period piece made over $175 million worldwide on its way to an Oscar nomination. Released at a time when American audiences actually saw foreign films, Hero is a wonderful distillation of why so many people worldwide loved Jet Li, blending his balletic skills with the fact that he could kick anybody\u2019s ass.\n\nThe Host\n\nThey don\u2019t make great monster movies like they used to. Which is one of the reasons everyone should watch the best modern flick in the subgenre, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s 2006 gem about a creature in the water. The story goes that Bong was inspired by a story he read about a deformed fish found in the Han River. The rest was movie history.\n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople\n\nBefore he made Hemsworth your favorite Chris in Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi wrote and directed this adaptation of Barry Crump\u2019s Wild Pork and Watercress. Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) has a new foster family, including a sweet foster mother. Sadly, he\u2019s stuck with the surly husband when his new mom passes away, leading Ricky and Hec (Sam Neill) on an unforgettable adventure. Funny and truly heartwarming, this is a comedy that\u2019s almost impossible to dislike.\n\nI, Tonya\n\nNot many people would have bet that a black comedy telling of the story of Tonya Harding would end up being an Oscar winner but the \u201810s have been nothing if not surprising at the Academy Awards. Allison Janney took home the gold for her role as Harding\u2019s cruel mother in this version of one of the most famous sports scandals of all time.\n\nThe Ice Storm\n\nAng Lee\u2019s 1997 adaptation of the 1994 Rick Moody novel is a masterpiece of tone and impending dread. Set in 1973, it\u2019s about a suburb of adults (including Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, and Sigourney Weaver) who are acting more childish than their offspring. And it\u2019s about the tragedy that\u2019s inevitable when no one is acting their age. It also features great young performances from Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, and Katie Holmes.\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nOne of 2018\u2019s best films is already on Hulu in Barry Jenkins\u2019 lyrical adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s beloved novel. His follow-up to Moonlight is the story of Tish and Fonny, young lovers in the early \u201870s torn apart after Fonny is accused of a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Poetic and realistic at the same time, If Beale Street Could Talk is a gorgeous, essential piece of filmmaking.\n\nJane\n\nThe masterful documentarian Brett Morgen was basically handed hours and hours of National Geographic footage of Jane Goodall that had never before been seen. With Goodall\u2019s assistance and a brilliant score by Philip Glass, he assembled the footage into a study of a fearless pioneer in the understanding of what it means to be human. This is one of the best documentaries of the \u201810s.\n\nJFK\n\nOne of Oliver Stone\u2019s best films, the quality of JFK is sometimes overshadowed by its controversial talking points. Put aside whether or not you believe Stone\u2019s take on what happened to John F. Kennedy, and just appreciate this film for its masterful acting, editing, and dialogue.\n\nKick-Ass\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughn proved to be the perfect fit for Mark Millar\u2019s dark comic sensibilities for this 2010 superhero movie for adults. Aaron Johnson stars as an average kid who tries to be a superhero, but Chloe Grace Moretz steals the flick as the unforgettable Hit Girl. If you like the Kingsman and Deadpool movies, you owe it to yourself to check out the movie that helped usher them into existence.\n\nKnocked Up\n\nIts gender politics seem shakier now than when it came out, but Judd Apatow\u2019s biggest hit still works because of the intelligence of its screenplay and the commitment of its cast, especially Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl. The story of a man forced to grow up when his one-night stand gets pregnant errs a bit too much on the side of the male view, but one can\u2019t deny the pure laughs-per-minute ratio. It\u2019s fun to contrast this with the recent Long Shot to see how much Rogen has changed (and how much he really hasn\u2019t).\n\nLet the Right One In\n\nTomas Alfredson\u2019s Swedish vampire movie is one of the best horror flicks of the new millennium and a film that feels like it\u2019s really influenced the current wave of personal, \u201celevated\u201d horror films that are currently so popular. A 12-year-old boy becomes friends with a young girl in a Stockholm suburb in the \u201880s and finds out she may not be exactly what she seems. Haunting and unforgettable, you need to see this one, even if you\u2019re not a big horror fan.\n\nLife Itself\n\nEverything comes full circle in Life Itself as Steve James tells the life story of Roger Ebert in a way that only he could. Ebert helped bring James\u2019 Hoop Dreams to the world with his praise for it and so it makes perfect sense that James would now tell his story, one that is even more poignant since his passing.\n\nThe Limey\n\nSteven Soderbergh is one of film\u2019s best genre jumpers, able to make any kind of film that suits his fancy. This is one of the darker entries in his filmography, the story of a Brit (Terence Stamp) who comes to the United States to find out what happened to his daughter. Stamp is unforgettable in this taut, clever thriller by one of America\u2019s best filmmakers.\n\nMajor League\n\nThis 1989 sports comedy was a major hit mostly for the way it tapped into something that all baseball fans love \u2014 the story of the underdog. No sports team is more underdog than the Cleveland Indians, who are the focus of this story of an owner who basically wants to tank the team. This is back when Tom Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, and Charlie Sheen could carry a movie. And it\u2019s still a solid diversion, a reminder that even those who are told they will fail can surprise even themselves.\n\nMan on Wire\n\nJames Marsh\u2019s Oscar-winning documentary chronicles the 1974 feat of courage/idiocy of Philippe Petit, who strung a wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and then walked from one to the other. Marsh\u2019s success comes from eschewing the traditional talking-head format of history docs, making his movie more like a heist film, complete with re-creations of the insane event high above New York City.\n\nMeek\u2019s Cutoff\n\nKelly Reichardt directs Michelle Williams and Paul Dano in this deliberate, purposeful tale of life on the Oregon Trail. Loosely based on a true story, it\u2019s the story of an 1845 excursion across the infamous trail in which a frontier guide led a wagon train through a bleak, unforgiving desert, which would later be called Meek\u2019s Cutoff.\n\nMelancholia\n\nOne of Lars von Trier\u2019s best films is this 2011 sci-fi masterpiece about the end of the world. Reportedly inspired by the director\u2019s own battles with depression, the film stars Kirsten Dunst as a woman on the day of her wedding. Melancholia is divided into two acts, the first about a miserable wedding day and the second about a rogue planet crashing into Earth. It\u2019s a must-see.\n\nMinding the Gap\n\nBing Liu\u2019s deeply personal documentary was one of the breakthrough indie films of 2018, going all the way from a Sundance premiere to an Oscar nomination. People fell in love with Liu\u2019s deep humanism in the telling of his own friendship with three young fellow skaters in Rockford, IL, and how he illuminates how difficult it can be to go from a boy to a man.\n\n*Mission: Impossible Fallout\n\nTom Cruise\u2019s latest adventure as Ethan Hunt may actually be his best. It\u2019s certainly one of the best action movies of the last couple years, and it\u2019s already available on streaming services! Sure, you\u2019ve read a lot about how Cruise does his own stunts (which is impressive) but watch this for a master class in action film editing. The film hums and moves in ways that other action movies don\u2019t. It\u2019s as wildly entertaining as anything you\u2019ll find on Hulu.\n\nMoonstruck\n\nIt\u2019s fun to see a movie that catches a star at just the right moment in his or her career. A great example of that is 1987\u2019s Moonstruck, which contains Cher\u2019s best performance, an acting turn that won the famous singer an Oscar. She stars as an Italian-American who faces a small problem when she falls for the brother of her fianc\u00e9, played by an also-perfectly-cast Nicolas Cage.\n\nMother!\n\nMajor studios really don\u2019t make movies like Mother! that often, if ever, which is why it\u2019s so crazy that this is a Paramount release. No matter what you think of it, you have to admire the risks Paramount took in financing and releasing something this truly insane \u2013 the story of a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) and her husband (Javier Bardem) and how their lives change after the arrival of a strange couple. That only hints at the insanity to follow in this riveting, deeply symbolic film about religion, filmmaking, art, gender roles, and broken sinks.\n\nMud\n\nRemember the McConaissance? Now that it appears to be over, we can appreciate the tentpoles of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s comeback to be taken seriously as an actor, including True Detective, Dallas Buyers Club, and this indie gem, in which McConaughey plays a drifter stumbled upon by a couple of Arkansas kid. Jeff Nichols coming-of-age drama is a great example of a filmmaker who uses setting as a character.\n\nThe Neverending Story\n\nWolfgang Petersen adapted Michael Ende\u2019s book in 1984 with results that impacted an entire generation unwittingly scarred by intense emotion and complex storytelling. Adapting the first half of the book, Petersen\u2019s film tells two stories \u2013 that of the bullied Bastian in the real world and his counterpart Atreyu in the story that he reads. It\u2019s a great fable that doesn\u2019t talk down to kids.\n\n*The Pianist\n\nRoman Polanski\u2019s Holocaust drama won the director and star Adrien Brody Oscars. Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, an unforgettable Polish-Jewish survivor of World War II. Polanski\u2019s film plays out like a piece of music itself, lyrically moving through the major events in Szpilman\u2019s life as he hid to survive the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.\n\nThe Piano\n\nJane Campion directs Holly Hunter to her best performance in this 1993 film about a mute piano player and her daughter, played by Anna Paquin in a breakthrough performance. Set in 19th century New Zealand, Campion\u2019s film was a massive hit when it was released, winning three Oscars \u2013 including trophies for both Hunter and Paquin.\n\n*Punch Drunk Love\n\nP.T. Anderson is one of the best living American filmmakers, acclaimed for films like Phantom Thread and There Will Be Blood. If he has a film in his oeuvre that remains underrated it would be this 2002 gem, which also happens to contain the best performance of Adam Sandler\u2019s career. A delightful little movie about two eccentric loners who find each other, this is a movie that people watch over and over again. In nearly any other director\u2019s career, it would be their best movie.\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nUntil Disney+ comes along, there aren\u2019t really that many major blockbusters from recent years on streaming services. The assumption is probably that people will pay to rent or own movies that were hits. And so it\u2019s kinda neat that Paramount has dropped John Krasinski\u2019s mega-hit from 2018 on streaming services already. It\u2019s an incredibly rewatchable movie. You\u2019ll admire something new about its design and execution every time.\n\nRain Man\n\nBarry Levinson directs Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in the story of a man who learns he has a brother who is an autistic savant after the death of his father. Both gentlemen are fantastic in a movie that\u2019s arguably a little manipulative but should be watched or rewatched purely for the strength of its performances. The movie won four Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Hoffman.\n\nRomy and Michele\u2019s High School Reunion\n\nTalk about your comedies that have aged well. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow star as the title characters, two twenty-somethings without much focus or direction who decide to go to their high school reunion. Both of the leads are delightfully charismatic and the film contains some wonderful supporting turns from Janeane Garofalo and Alan Cumming too.\n\n*Rosemary\u2019s Baby\n\nEveryone talking about the arrival of elevated horror on the scene as if Get Out and Hereditary were the first of the genre to be taken seriously must not remember the \u201870s when movies as dark and vicious as Rosemary\u2019s Baby won Oscars and made millions. Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s novel has lost none of its terrifying power, thanks in large part to the phenomenal work by Mia Farrow, who makes Rosemary\u2019s predicament palpable.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums\n\nThere\u2019s surprisingly little Wes Anderson on streaming services, but one of his most beloved comedies is sitting right there on Hulu waiting for you to rewatch it. It\u2019s the story of three siblings \u2013 Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson \u2013 and their abrasive father, played unforgettably by Gene Hackman. This is Anderson\u2019s second highest-grossing film for a reason (after Grand Budapest Hotel) \u2013 it really does feature a little bit of everything that fans of his like about his work.\n\n*Rushmore\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been two decades since Wes Anderson\u2019s sophomore feature, a wonderfully dry comedy about an overly mature teenager and an overly immature adult. The former is played by Jason Schwartzman, who does amazing work as Max Fischer, a kid who falls into a love triangle with his teacher (Olivia Williams) and a millionaire named Herman Blume (Bill Murray). It\u2019s one of the funniest movies of the late \u201890s and one of the few comedies of its era that could easily be released unchanged and still be a critical darling today.\n\n*Seven\n\nSome of the films on this list are movies you may not have seen in years, if ever. Some are in the top 20 of all time on IMDb. This is the latter, arguably David Fincher\u2019s most beloved film. It\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s held in such high esteem, even a quarter-century after its release. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give two of their best performances in a film that takes a classic mystery structure and makes it unforgettably vicious.\n\nShaolin Soccer\n\nStephen Chow rules. This Cantonese-language international hit was one of his first breakthroughs (followed by his masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle, which you really need to see if you have yet to do so). Shaolin Soccer is pretty much exactly what that title implies \u2014 a kung fu sports movie. It\u2019s almost impossible to describe a Chow movie in a way that captures his inspired, bizarre filmmaking. Just watch this one. Trust us.\n\nThe Shining\n\nForget what Stephen King himself has said about this Stanley Kubrick, it will likely always be the best adaptation of the literary legend\u2019s work. Kubrick made the story his own and then allowed Jack Nicholson to give one of the most unforgettable performances in horror history. The Shining isn\u2019t just an essential film for horror fans, it\u2019s essential for everybody, the kind of movie that transcended genre to become a cultural phenomenon.\n\nShoplifters\n\n2018\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or winner (the biggest prize at Cannes) is already on Hulu for you to see what the big deal is about. And it\u2019s a real big deal. The masterful Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda has long been fascinated with the concept of what exactly we mean when we say \u201cFamily.\u201d In this case, it\u2019s the story of a discarded girl taken in by strangers and the drama that ensues. It will break your heart.\n\nShrek\n\nNow that it\u2019s been a full generation since its release, some people may not remember the days when a gassy green ogre ruled the world. Shrek wasn\u2019t just a hit movie that spawned multiple sequels and TV specials, it won the first ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature (and was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay!) It has held up well as an engaging riff on the fairy tale with phenomenal voice work.\n\nShutter Island\n\nIn 2010, Martin Scorsese released his adaptation of Dennis Lehane\u2019s best novel, the story of a U.S. Marshal who investigates a missing patient at a legendary mental hospital. Scorsese is in full command of his skill as a craftsman in this riveting thriller that also co-stars Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams. It\u2019s one of the most underrated films of the last decade.\n\nA Simple Plan\n\nSam Raimi directs a dramatic thriller that\u2019s not exactly like the horror and superhero films for which he is primarily known. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton star as Minnesotan brothers who find a plane crash with $4.4 million in cash. They take the money and, well, things go wrong from there. It\u2019s a fantastic thriller with a \u201cwhat if\u201d premise about what you would do in the same situation.\n\n*Sleepy Hollow\n\nIs this the last great Tim Burton movie? This 1999 Johnny Depp flick was the perfect distillation of both Burton and his favorite star\u2019s interests, allowing both to display their love for the dark side in a big-budget adaptation of Washington Irving\u2019s classic short story. Depp plays Ichabod Crane, who investigates a series of murders allegedly committed by a headless horseman. Stylish and creepy, it\u2019s a film of its era that\u2019s held up remarkably well.\n\nSorry to Bother You\n\nBoots Riley writes and directs one of the most daring debuts of 2018 in this satire of modern race relations and corporate dynamics. Lakeith Stanfield stars as a man who climbs the ladder of a telemarketing company only to find true horrors on the top floors. It\u2019s smart, strange, and unforgettable.\n\nSupport the Girls\n\nAndrew Bujalski\u2019s charming comedy about a Hooters-esque restaurant stars the delightful Regina Hall on a particularly bad day on the job. This ensemble piece doesn\u2019t seek to make any great statement or offer deep insights, but somehow ends up doing both just by presenting truthful, genuine characters. It\u2019s a funny movie with a poignant streak about how hard people have to swim just to keep their heads above water.\n\n*Swingers\n\nEvery few years, a comedy comes completely out of nowhere and taps something in the zeitgeist that makes everyone involved a star. No one knew who Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn the day before Swingers came out, but it launched them into the celebrity sphere, where they still reside. This movie is still money, baby, as it captures the posturing of young men trying to get work and get laid in Hollywood in the mid-\u201890s.\n\nTangerine\n\n\u201cShot entirely on an iPhone\u201d sounds like a gimmick but Sean Baker transcends that to deliver a film that is about more than just the way it was filmed. Baker\u2019s comedy-drama is the story of an eventful day in the life of a transgender sex worker. Tangerine pulses with life and energy in a way that most modern L.A. films fail to do, capturing a side of the city and its people in a heartfelt, pure, often hysterical manner.\n\nThree Identical Strangers\n\nTim Wardle\u2019s 2018 documentary tells the story of Edward Galland, David Kellman, and Robert Shafran \u2014 three identical triplets who were separated at birth and reunited in their teens. The WTF story of Three Identical Strangers is the kind of thing that would be deemed ridiculous if it were in a fictional screenplay but the film gets even more interesting when it turns to an investigation of nature vs. nature and reveals some dark secrets behind this fascinating tale. Don\u2019t miss it.\n\nThree Kings\n\nLong before he was an Oscar darling, David O. Russell made one of his best films in this 1999 war comedy about four soldiers \u2014 George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze \u2014 who try to steal gold while in Iraq. A wonderfully balanced film tonally, Russell\u2019s comedy is both a great character piece on a commentary on the ridiculousness of the Gulf War. In conversations about the best war movies, this one should come up more often.\n\nTotal Recall\n\nAh-nuld! Near the peak of his fame, the future Governor went to Mars in this landmark 1990 sci-fi film the great Paul Verhoeven. Loosely based on a Philip K. Dick short called \u201cWe Can Remember It for You Wholesale,\u201d Total Recall is about an average man caught in an uprising on Mars \u2026 or is he? Most 1990 action movies have aged poorly, but Total Recall still has something to entertain even the many Hulu subscribers born after it was released.\n\nTouching the Void\n\nDid you like Free Solo? What if we told you there\u2019s an even better high-altitude documentary sitting on Hulu waiting for you to compare and contrast? Based on a 1988 book of the same name, Kevin Macdonald\u2019s film tells the story of a climb in the Andes with incredible shots of the mountain on which these intrepid men nearly died. It\u2019s an unforgettable story of danger, courage, and survival.\n\nTwo Days, One Night\n\nJean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne wrote and directed the biggest hit of their career in this 2014 drama starring Marion Cotillard as a woman who has to essentially beg her co-workers to keep her job. The Dardennes make deeply compassionate and humanist films that turn average people into unforgettable film characters, and Cotillard does the best work of her career here. She was nominated for the Oscar (and should have won).\n\nUp in the Air\n\nJason Reitman\u2019s best film stars George Clooney as a man who spends more time on the road than he does at home. The writer/director won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and the film feels just as timely a decade later as people continue to be increasingly divided by work and technology. Clooney has arguably never been better, and Oscar nominees Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are pretty fantastic too.\n\nUnder Siege\n\nSteven Seagal is a strange dude these days, but he was once the biggest action hero in the world, heir to the throne of Ahhnold and Sly. He was arguably never more popular than when Warner Bros. released this bit of action escapism in 1992 (and made over $150 million). Andrew Davis, of The Fugitive fame, directs Seagal in the story of a Navy SEAL who has to stop a group of bad guys led by Tommy Lee Jones. This is the era of \u201cDie Hard on a ____\u201d movies. This one was on a ship.\n\nThe Virgin Suicides\n\nSofia Coppola made here directorial debut with this adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides beloved novel about a group of sisters who captivated the entire neighborhood in which they lived. Kirsten Dunst anchors a dreamy, captivating movie about the myth of perfection that exists in the world of picket fences in middle America. It\u2019s got a great Air soundtrack too.\n\nWar Games\n\nWhile viewers were still relatively deep in the Cold War, John Badham\u2019s film about a hacker who accesses the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) and thinks it\u2019s a game as he starts World War III had an urgency. The scary thing is that the world of 2019, one of hackers and increasing nuclear concerns, isn\u2019t that different than when this movie became a massive hit. Watch it to see what people flocked to in 1983 and then ask yourself how different things are now.\n\nWedding Crashers\n\nHit comedies are often just about finding the right comedians at the right time in their career. That\u2019s certainly the case with Wedding Crashers, which made a fortune (almost $300 million worldwide) just by creating the perfect vehicle for Owen Wilson\u2019s shaggy dog charm and Vince Vaughn\u2019s alpha-bro hilarity. The two star as guys who crash weddings and meet girls. The movie helped revive the R-rated comedy and became an instant hit that\u2019s still quoted today.\n\nWendy and Lucy\n\nMichelle Williams gives one of the best performances of her career as a vagrant whose only real friend is her dog Lucy. On their way to Alaska, the two become separated, and Wendy strives to reunite with the pet she so desperately needs. Kelly Reichardt makes beautiful, character-driven films, and this is one of her best.\n\nThe Wings of the Dove\n\nIain Softley directs this adaptation of the hit Henry James novel that earned Helena Bonham Carter a much-deserved Oscar nomination. Carter does the best work of her career in this period piece about class and privilege with a deeply cynical, dark edge to it. Lest you think all period pieces are dry and stuffy, check this one out and have your mind changed.\n\nHarrison Ford does the best dramatic acting of his career in this 1985 Peter Weir film about a detective who realizes he may be the only one who can protect an Amish boy who has witnessed a crime. If you only really know Ford as Han Solo or Indiana Jones, you really need to see how much more he could do with the only performance he\u2019s ever given that was nominated for an Academy Award.", "description": "Hulu has a deep reservoir of great free streaming movies, from The Royal Tenenbaums to A Quiet Place.
