I have a very small sample size: 2-0 to start my NFL career. Talking a lot of smack. And then I walk into Kansas City and put up the worst football game of my existence. And I\u2019ve always been this brash, arrogant kind of guy.\"\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat\u2019s the way I came back at everybody instead of just walking up in front of the camera and going, \u2018Oh my God. This was my fault. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019 And hearing Baker [Sunday] \u2014 even though small \u2014 blame the officials for some calls is problematic for me because as a quarterback, you want to be able to stand up in front of everybody and take personal accountability.\u201d\n\nRAMS GET CB JALEN RAMSEY FROM JAGUARS FOR 3 DRAFT PICKS\n\nMayfield shot himself into the national spotlight last season, setting the touchdown pass record with 27 and helping Cleveland to a 7-8-1 record \u2013 the closest the team has been to .500 since the 2014 season.\n\nBut so far this season, Mayfield has only thrown five touchdown passes and has thrown 11 interceptions. Cleveland is 2-4 this season with wins over the New York Jets and Baltimore Ravens.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t appear he is going to go the way of Leaf, Mayfield will be relied on to do more to right the ship before the Browns sink out of the race for the AFC North title and an AFC wild card spot.", "description": "Ryan Leaf, one of the NFL\u2019s most notorious draft busts, compared his career to Baker Mayfield\u2019s as the Cleveland Browns second-year quarterback has struggled during the 2019 season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
