Three Houses isn\u2019t a stealth game; Byleth doesn\u2019t use her impressive sneaking skills in combat. Instead, she uses them to listen in on dozens of private conversations that unfold between her students. It\u2019s never actually specified in-game whether Byleth can hear all of these conversations, but the game makes a lot more sense if you assume that she can. It\u2019s also a lot creepier.\n\nThe talks in question are called Support conversations, and they\u2019re common to the Fire Emblem series at this point. In Three Houses, if you place certain characters next to one another in battles, or have them do activities together at school, they\u2019ll grow closer, which will make them stronger together in subsequent battles.\n\nThe game illustrates their increasing emotional closeness through cutscenes that progressively unlock between each pair of characters. You get a notification in the game\u2019s menu whenever you unlock a new Support conversation between a pair of characters.\n\nYou play as Three Houses as Byleth, and the rest of the game is viewed through her perspective. She uses the information from the Support conversations to make her decisions about battle placement, teaching instructions, and more, so she must know what happened in the conversations somehow. I like to imagine she\u2019s sneaking around, spying on her students in their most intimate moments.\n\nSpying would also fit her personality. Byleth is very involved in her students\u2019 lives, way past the point of an ordinary professor. She is their teacher, their battle captain, their friend, and in some cases, their potential paramour (once they get old enough for that, but still\u2026 creepy). It\u2019s her job to decide which students should stand next to one another in battle, which students should work together on chores, and which students should learn which subjects in school.\n\nByleth wanders the school grounds finding lost items and returning them to their rightful owners, from love letters to silver brooches; she can only do this because she\u2019s gotten to know everyone so well that she can figure out what belongs to whom. She\u2019s so absurdly involved in their lives that it seems believable that she would resort to following students around and listening in on everything they say.\n\nLast night, I watched a Support conversation between Byleth and Sylvain that confirmed my silly theory. The scene begins with slick-talking womanizer Sylvain having a fight with one of his many flings, who leaves the scene in tears. Sylvain turns around to face a clump of bushes behind him and says, \u201cSo, Professor, do you enjoy spying on people?\u201d In the next frame, Byleth pops up and starts advising Sylvain about his love life. She doesn\u2019t even acknowledge how weird it was that she watched that whole conversation!\n\nJust like Byleth, I love getting to listen in on all of the students\u2019 conversations. They range from entertaining, to awkward, to poignant. But I do it all with just the tiniest twinge of guilt, because I\u2019m pretty sure Professor Byleth is hiding behind a nearby curtain, taking notes on which of her students play nice together. Professor Byleth should probably get a life of her own. But if she did, she wouldn\u2019t be a very good video game protagonist.", "description": "Fire Emblem: Three Houses protagonist Professor Byleth is very good at spying.
