Let\u2019s not get people overly nervous about it.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s how Sanders responded when CNBC\u2019s John Harwood asked if he\u2019d appoint democratic socialists to big positions in his administration.\n\n\u201cI will appoint people who believe in the working class and the working families of this country, who are prepared to stand up to the incredibly powerful corporate interests,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cI will appoint an attorney general, who for the first time in modern history, will go after the white-collar crime, which I believe is rampant. Instead of arresting kids whether they are selling marijuana, maybe we go after some of the crooks on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s following the lead of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, by campaigning on the platform that economic rights must be considered human rights.\n\n\u201cSo you could vote, but you also have the privilege of sleeping out on the street,\u201d Sanders explained in the interview. \u201cYou can protest, but you also have the freedom to work 60 or 70 hours a week at starvation wages. You have the freedom not to have health insurance, not to be able to send your kids to college.\u201d\n\nHe also said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d embraces FDR\u2019s suggestion that, as president, he welcomed the hate of his adversaries.\n\n\u201cYou can judge a person by the friends they have,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou can judge a candidate for president by the enemies they have.\u201d\n\nBut does he have a realistic chance of actually winning the election? As you can see from this breakdown, he\u2019s still a long shot:\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to bother Sanders, however.\n\n\u201cThe ideas that I talked about four years ago seemed so radical and extreme. Today they\u2019re kind of mainstream ideas, right?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview:", "description": "There\u2019s more than a little skepticism among the other generations toward socialism, and that\u2019s something self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders,...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM281_arends_ZG_20190626183935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
