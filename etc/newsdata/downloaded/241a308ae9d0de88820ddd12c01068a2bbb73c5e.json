The sales were voluntarily disclosed by ARK, which publishes all of its intraday trades in email updates and on a regularly updated website.\n\nWhile ARK is a small holder of Tesla stock \u2014 its 0.65% stake at the end of the second quarter made it the 21st-largest shareholder \u2014 the volume of its outspoken support for the company and its sky-high price target make the sales notable.\n\nRen Leggi, a client-portfolio manager at the $9.6 billion firm, said in an interview with Business Insider that Tesla remained one of its top picks and conviction was still high.\n\n\"We're long-term investors, but we are short-term contrarian,\" he said by phone on Monday. \"We trade quite often \u2014 in some cases almost every day \u2014 and we trade around positions. We're not market timers, but we will take advantage of volatility.\"\n\nTesla's stock price was near record lows in June, amid a spat with the Securities and Exchange Commission, at about $170 per share. ARK was buying then, Leggi said, and eventually had to sell in order to stay below internal rules that limit individual holdings to 10%.\n\n\"Our conviction is still very high,\" he said. \"In fact, it's probably only increased since we first held it. So it's not a matter of conviction, the selling, it's more opportunistic trading.\"\n\nWhat's more, the company is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday after the close of trading. Historically, shares have moved up to 10% in either direction following Tesla's earnings reports. This quarter is likely no exception, as some analysts have warned the company could cut its estimates for full-year vehicle production.\n\nAnalysts are likely to ask for an update on plans for Tesla's planned network of autonomous robo-taxis. Musk said in April that a 1 million-strong network would hit the roads by next year, and the plans are key to ARK's investment theory.\n\n\"We think that Tesla, right now, has a large competitive advantage compared to others like Waymo and Cruise,\" he said. \"From an autonomous perspective, if they are able to deliver, then we think the stock could be worth $5,000 to $6,000 per share within five years.\"\n\nTo be sure, both Waymo and General Motors' Cruise are currently operating semi-autonomous cars in select areas, with a safety driver still present. Beyond Smart Summon, which was the subject of many viral videos showing errors and close calls, Tesla has not launched any similar product.\n\nEven if that doesn't happen, ARK's bear case for only electric vehicles still has Tesla's share price more than doubling to $600.\n\nWall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg expect Tesla on Wednesday to remain in the red for the third quarter, despite a record amount of vehicle production and deliveries as the company struggles to return to profitability.\n\nRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a note to clients on Friday: \"We are maintaining our recently lowered estimates, which reflect the fact that while overall 3Q deliveries tracked higher, the beat was driven by higher than anticipated sales of the lower ASP (average selling price) and lower margin Model 3, which more than offset relative weakness in sales of the higher ASP and higher margin Model S/X.\"\n\nShares of Tesla are down 23% since the beginning of the year.", "description": "Ren Leggi, a portfolio manager at ARK, said the firm's conviction in Tesla has never been higher, but its trading strategies aren't passive.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dadfe994af909589a39e4b5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
