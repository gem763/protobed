An invitation went out to various conservative and free-market groups to attend an announcement at the Environmental Protection Agency's headquarters in Washington on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press. However, The Washington Post reports that the announcement could be delayed by at least a day.\n\nThe 2013 waiver issued by the EPA to the California Air Resources Board allowed the state to set stricter air-quality standards than those imposed on the federal level.\n\nThe move comes after the Department of Justice earlier this month launched an antitrust investigation into a July deal between California and four automakers \u2013 Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW \u2013 and is seen as a broader effort by the White House to rollback efforts to combat climate change.\n\nIn the agreement between the state and manufacturers on fuel economy standards \u2014 which the administration says may be illegal \u2014 the automakers pledged to produce passenger vehicles averaging 50 miles per gallon by model year 2026, which is in line with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards set by the Obama administration.\n\nBut the White House wants to roll back the Obama-era requirements with a single, federal guideline that freezes mileage standards at 37 mpg from 2020 to 2026.\n\nAutomakers have expressed concern about having two different standards \u2013 one at the federal level and another at the state level. They have also welcomed moves to relax the fuel efficiency standards.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump will be attending fundraisers in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley and the announcement might be aimed at coinciding with his visit.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday to the National Automobile Dealers Association, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler telegraphed the planned announcement, saying the administration embraced federalism, \"but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation.\"\n\nThe waiver for California was meant to add impetus to the push for higher standards nationwide. With the state's huge car market, it could force the automakers to comply with a higher standard than on the federal level, or risk losing a huge market. In addition, 13 other states have signed on to California's standards.\n\nCalifornia's Attorney General Xavier Becerra has vowed to take the Trump administration to court. Speaking on Tuesday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said that while the White House \"has abdicated its responsibility,\" his state \"has stepped up.\"\n\nHe said the White House move \"could have devastating consequences for our kids' health and the air we breathe, if California were to roll over. But we will not.\"\n\nIn a statement from July, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobby group, said \"Automakers have said repeatedly that they support year-over-year increases in fuel economy standards that align with the marketplace, while also advocating for one national program.\"\n\nCalifornia was accorded special status in the 1970 Clean Air Act, allowing the state to set its own emissions standards if it could convince federal authorities of the need to do so. Many of California's anti-pollution measures have been adopted nationally.", "description": "The end of the state's Obama-era waiver is seen by many as the latest move to undo a years-long push to produce more fuel efficient cars.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/18/ap_19261014643206_wide-fc2fd508b3d6b63bbaee31477e8109fb23e98232.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
