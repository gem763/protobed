They planned to get married in 2013 but they put the ceremony on hold when Yang felt pain in her right breast. She was later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nYang, who was 28 at the time of her diagnosis, was told she only had five years to live.\n\nOver the next few years, she continued to undergo targeted treatment, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and she documented her experiences on the Chinese social network Weibo as support for other cancer sufferers.\n\nThe Chinese broadcaster CCTV wanted to interview the \u201cstar patient\u201d, as doctors referred to her, but she declined the offer because she didn\u2019t want to appear on TV in that state.\n\nAt one point, it appeared as though Yang was beating the illness and the couple began planning their wedding again.\n\nBut the bride-to-be\u2019s cancer returned and quickly spread to other parts of her body.\n\nAccording to reports, Xu remained by his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s side 24 hours a day for one week after her death.\n\n\u201cAll I can do is to fulfil your wish, and letting you wear this wedding dress fulfils my wish,\u201d Xu said.\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "The 34-year-old reportedly died from breast cancer on 14 October after battling the disease for five years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/80ff3349385a4782a83be54704ff3bcd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
