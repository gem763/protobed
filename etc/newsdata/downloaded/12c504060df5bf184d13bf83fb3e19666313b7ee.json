There are also a bunch of new smartphones with 5G-enabled variants: There's the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus 5G, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G, and the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. The LG V50 Thinq, Moto Z3 and Z4, and several Huawei phones also have 5G versions.\n\n5G is exciting. But it's not ready yet.\n\nMarques Brownlee is one of the most popular tech reviewers on the planet \u2014 for good reason. His videos are well-made and straightforward, and he'll often demonstrate real-world applications to argue for why a new technology is worth buying into or skipping altogether.

He purchased a brand-new, $1,600 Galaxy S10 Plus that supports 5G for this trip. What he found when he got there was really interesting: While peak download speeds were off the charts, connectivity wasn't perfect, and there are a lot of actual, physical barriers that 5G must overcome before it can become ubiquitous.", "description": "Tech companies want you to buy their 5G-enabled phones.
