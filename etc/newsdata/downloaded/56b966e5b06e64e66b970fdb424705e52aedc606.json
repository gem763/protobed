Debuting Sept. 27, it features lush production design, stylized performances and teens talking like they\u2019re in an Oscar Wilde play. Anderson alums Gwyneth Paltrow and Bob Balaban play the parents of title character Payton Hobart (Dear Evan Hansen and Pitch Perfect star Ben Platt). Though the series unfolds amid the Spanish Colonial mansions of Santa Barbara, the credits are set to twee icon Sufjan Stevens\u2019 orchestral anthem \u201cChicago.\u201d\n\nIn fact, The Politician is the creation of Ryan Murphy (with collaborators Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan) and the first product of his record $300 million Netflix development deal. His voice becomes so conspicuous as its first season progresses that the show winds up being the purest expression of his sensibility to date. Like American Horror Story, it tackles contemporary anxieties in overwrought yet imaginative ways. Like Glee, it\u2019s about young people figuring out who they are; queerness abounds, though in a post-Pose world, casual fluidity is the rule. Authentic emotion coexists with camp. There\u2019s singing, dancing, violence, stunt casting, side plots ripped from the headlines. The show is a lot. And it seems destined to be both popular and polarizing.\n\nWe meet Payton, the superrich son of a doting mom (Paltrow) and hated little brother of twin preppy nightmares Martin (Trevor Eason) and Luther (Trey Eason), in his senior year at posh Saint Sebastian High. He\u2019s applying to Harvard\u2014or, more accurately, lobbying for admission\u2014and running for student body president. Both campaigns are part of his lifelong plan to become President of the United States, an all-consuming goal he shares with the small team of equally precocious kids he\u2019s recruited to help propel him all the way to the White House.\n\nThe hitch comes when River (David Corenswet), a handsome jock with whom Payton had an affair, joins the race at the urging of his spiteful girlfriend, Astrid (Lucy Boynton). Gentle and kind, with a moving openness about his mental health, River connects with voters on a human level. Payton, by contrast, works hard and has good ideas but can\u2019t conceal his calculations. River is a shoo-in\u2014until he kills himself.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

A side plot about Payton\u2019s running mate, the chronically ill Infinity Jackson (Zoey Deutch), quickly goes off the rails; though it\u2019s fun to see Jessica Lange play her deranged grandma, the resemblance to Hulu\u2019s The Act (and the true story it\u2019s based on) falls somewhere between parody and appropriation. Not all of the young actors can keep up with a witty ensemble that also includes Judith Light, Bette Midler and January Jones.\n\nDespite these nonminor problems, I couldn\u2019t stop watching. Murphy productions are never boring, and this one bursts with frothy twists and amusing set pieces. An episode that detours into the mind of a swing voter\u2014a burnout who just wants to ogle boobs\u2014makes its point about the gulf between politicians and their alienated constituents.\n\nYet it\u2019s Payton who makes the show more than just fun. Though he\u2019s drowned his emotions in ambition, that numbness haunts him. His plight raises the question of whether you can make a positive impact on the world without being a good person\u2014or if inner purity can even hinder that work. Platt makes this internal conflict riveting. \u201cI wanna know you,\u201d Payton\u2019s Harvard interviewer says in the show\u2019s first scene. \u201cThe real you.\u201d The request stumps him. But by the end of the season, he\u2019s discovered more of a self than he ever knew he had.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "It looks like a Wes Anderson movie but turns out to be the purest expression of Murphy's sensibility to date.", "authors": ["Judy Berman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/the_politician_s01e06_4m49s6929f_r.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
