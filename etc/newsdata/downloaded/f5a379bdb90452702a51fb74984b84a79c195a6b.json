CSG stated the proposed price offer per share is AU$0.31.\n\nCSG added the scheme has valued CSG's issued equity at AU$140.8 million and enterprise value at AU$181.6 million.\n\nThe scheme is expected to be completed by mid-February 2020.\n\nThe last time CSG was approached for a takeover bid was in 2011 by an unnamed company. At that time, the proposed offer price per share was AU$1.20.\n\nThe company later entered into a deal with NEC Australia that bought CSG's Technology Solutions business for AU$227 million. The deal led CSG to restructure its print services division.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nAEC gives Fuji Xerox AU$27m for another ballot scanning system\n\nFuji Xerox Businessforce will be providing the Australian Electoral Commission with a new Senate scanning solution, touting the success of the one the company provided for the 2016 federal election.\n\nFujifilm takes control of Xerox to create joint venture\n\nUp to 10,000 jobs are expected to be lost due to the takeover.\n\nFuji Xerox launches IT services and enterprise software division\n\nFuji Xerox Australia has established a new business division that will provide managed IT services, cloud and hosting services, and enterprise content management software.\n\nAustralia's CSG buys NZ's CodeBlue\n\nDeal worth up to NZ$15 million sees CSG pick up nationwide IT service supplier.", "description": "The move is part of Fuji Xerox's plans to expand its business in Australia and New Zealand.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/10/17/0ab814f7-e335-4d37-9a1d-2a4c2804dec0/thumbnail/770x578/7840f06a747f05864caaa5a0ad493443/handshake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
