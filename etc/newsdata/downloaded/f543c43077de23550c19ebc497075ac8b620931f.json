He is now set to retain the presidency until 2025.\n\nHis very candidacy was a scandal, though, as Bolivia\u2019s constitution limits a president to two successive mandates. Morales has just won a fourth.\n\nMorales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, lost a 2016 referendum in which he tried to remove term limits but the Constitutional Court let him run again anyway.\n\nThe court, like the election tribunal, is made up of members appointed by Morales\u2019s Movement for Socialism.", "description": "La Paz (AFP) \u2013 The United Nations on Tuesday called for an urgent de-escalation of tensions in Bolivia, where rival supporters of President Evo", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/91f5e6_motorbike-burns-in-cochabamba-stronghold-bolivia-president-evo-morales-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
