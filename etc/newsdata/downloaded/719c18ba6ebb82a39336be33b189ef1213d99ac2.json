It currently has sites in Sydney and Perth.\n\nThe partnership also offers La Trobe access to Cisco's programs such as its Networking Academy modules with IoT, cybersecurity, and entrepreneurship, in addition to access to the company's Digital Schools Network that allow educators and students at participating schools around the world to share resources.\n\n\"This exciting partnership supports the upskilling of students in technology areas that are needed now, and critical for Australia's long-term competitiveness,\" Cisco Australia and New Zealand vice president Ken Boal said.\n\nCisco recently bolstered its IoT business with the acquisition of industrial IoT company Sentryo.\n\nAt the time, the company said Sentryo's platform addresses the challenges businesses face when deploying IoT projects, in terms of scaling to production and managing and securing infrastructure. The aim is to merge Sentryo with Cisco's intent-based networking technology, which Cisco has been integrating across its enterprise access portfolio to help customers manage more users and devices.\n\nEarlier this year, Cisco invested AU$20 million in a Sydney-based Webex data centre that will serve some 2.5 million users that are running Cisco Cloud Calling platforms.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "From skills to research and technology development.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/05/5c16a61b-9801-472b-89c6-353260d6922e/thumbnail/770x578/57a6de71e9fb89d5da293b67381b1a3d/iotent.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
