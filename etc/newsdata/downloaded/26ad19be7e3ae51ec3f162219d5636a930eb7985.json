An investigation is ongoing but law enforcement said they have no reason to believe the act was intentional.\n\nMr. Mystal, an executive editor at Above the Law and a contributor to The Nation, fired off a series of tweets reacting to the news, admitting that he thinks about crashing his car into the same complex \u201cEVERY TIME\u201d he sees it.\n\n\u201cReal talk: When you come out of the parking lot of this mall/movie theater, you have to sit a red light staring right into this lobby,\u201d he wrote Wednesday morning, Mediaite first reported. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about driving my car through it EVERY TIME. Basic humanity keeps me from doing it, but JUST.\n\n\u201cThe view in this picture is exactly the view you have from the stop light. It\u2019s a long light. You have a lot of time to\u2026 think,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnyway, innocent until proven guilty but\u2026 \u2018accident\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem likely to me. Maybe that\u2019s my own bias. Defense counsel should NOT put me on this guy\u2019s jury, I know too much :).\u201d\n\nThe tweets received significant backlash but Mr. Mystal has refused to delete them or apologize. In a heated back-and-forth with music video producer and conservative commentator Robby Starbuck, Mr. Mystal revealed that he is \u201cin crisis\u201d every single day watching Mr. Trump \u201cdestroy this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do often fantasize about vandalism to Trump properties,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have had that vandalism fantasy many times, about that particular building, which is what I shared. However, because real people could actually be hurt, I don\u2019t do it. Again, I\u2019m not a Republican.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
