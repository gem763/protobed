During the ride Mr Mehmood's passenger, a married woman that had arrived in the UK four days previously, broke down and revealed she had been lured to the UK on the false promise of a masseuse job and subsequently forced into illegal sex work.\n\nMr Mehmood, a married father of two, immediately called the police.\n\nEnescu was later arrested and jailed for nine years in his absence having jumped bail. West Midlands Police is working with forces across the UK and Europol to bring him to justice.\n\nMr Mehmood said the woman started crying when left alone in his taxi. \u201cI said \u2018what's up love? Why are you crying?\u2019 I stopped the taxi and said \u2018just tell me what's happened,\u2019\u201d he told Mail Online.\n\n\u201cShe said \u2018I don't know here, I just came here four days before, come to here to do massage, but they tell me go to prostitution, to do sex, but I don't want to do it. Can you help me go back to my country? The man said I got to do prostitution sex but I don't want to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nDetective Inspector Wes Martin of West Midlands Police's Public Protection Unit, praised Mr Mehmood, a taxi driver since 2004, for noticing some of the potential signs of human trafficking, such as a panicked or stressful passenger with a lack of belongings.\n\nDet Insp Martin said: \u201cThe taxi driver is going to be referred for a commendation because what a fantastic member of the public he was to do what he did.\n\n\u201cHe's a family man, a local Asian taxi driver, and it was a very honourable thing he did.\u201d\n\nCoventry councillor Naeem Akhtar said: \u201cThe council provides training and information to licensed taxi drivers that if they see something suspicious and believe something is wrong then they must contact the relevant agency.\n\n\u201cThis driver could have just ignored what he saw and the victim would have ended up in a brothel. Mr Mehmood's actions saved her.\u201d\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) says that 136 potential victims of human trafficking were rescued as a result of the agency\u2019s activity in 2017 to 2018.\n\nIt says most victims of modern slavery and human trafficking are \u2018recruited\u2019 in person, although some who find themselves trapped in the sex industry have been ensnared through online job adverts and social media websites.\n\nA series of adverts titled \u2018Can you see me?\u2019 highlight how many people working in the construction, agriculture or sex industries and in places like nail bars and car washes have been trafficked and suggests ways the public could help identify victims.", "description": "A cab driver has been hailed by police after he saved a woman trafficked into the UK to be prostituted.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dczh6Dcz0Pe73.e_IMClfQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/212afbcca5b4863842ab9905dfe9e6d8", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
