So to Sikhs, the festival represents freedom.\u201d\n\nEleanor Nesbitt, professor emeritus at the Warwick Religions and Education Research Unit at the University of Warwick, adds that Buddhists and Jains \u201chave other historical reasons\u201d for celebrating Diwali.\n\nWhen is the festival?\n\nThis year, Diwali begins on Sunday 27 October on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe festival typically lasts for four to five days and coincides with the new moon on the Hindu lunisolar calendar, called amavasya.\n\nThe new moon is the first lunar phase, which is when the moon and the sun have the same ecliptic longitude.\n\nAmavasya is known as the \u201cdarkest night\u201d among Hindus, and is regarded as a powerful force for both good and evil.\n\nDiwali is preceded by Navaratri, another Hindu festival that is observed every autumn over the course of nine nights.\n\nNavaratri also symbolises the triumph of good over evil and commemorates the Hindu deity Durga, the goddess of war.\n\nHow is it celebrated?\n\nAs Diwali is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, those who observe the festival typically decorate their homes with a plethora of lights.\n\nPeople will also routinely clean their homes in preparation for Diwali, Mr Kashyap explains.\n\n\u201cIn India every year, houses are cleaned, often renovated, and always illuminated with sparkling fairy lights and oil lamps,\u201d the general secretary and director of Hindu Council UK states.\n\nMr Kashyap outlines how many doorways and foyers are decorated with rangolis, beautiful, intricate patterns on the floor that are created using materials including rice, coloured sand and flower petals.\n\nGifts and sweets are also exchanged during Diwali, as are wishes for a \u201cHappy Diwali\u201d.\n\nMr Kashyap emphasises that while Diwali is \"probably best experienced in India\", it is a global celebration.\n\n\"In London in particular, Diwali has become a 'mega event' to celebrate the culture and traditions of India,\" he says.\n\n\"From live music to dance shows and much more, London really goes for it. Add in a huge array of Indian food to sample from all the food stalls and a massive firework display to end the festival.\"\n\nIn Leicester, multiple events are taking place in celebration of Diwali, including the lighting of a 110-foot Ferris wheel and an exhibition of rangoli designs.\n\nDuring Diwali, a variety of traditional sweet and savoury dishes are consumed.\n\nOne of the sweet dishes is called Lapsi Halwa, and is made from large-grain cracked wheat, cooked with ghee and sweetened with sugar and cardamom powder.\n\nTo read more about the symbolic foods eaten during Diwali, click here.", "description": "Diwali, the festival of lights, is a religious observance commemorated by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and some Buddhists\u00a0around the world.
