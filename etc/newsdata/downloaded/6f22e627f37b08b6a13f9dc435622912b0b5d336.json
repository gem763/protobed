The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 26.18 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7,956.29.\n\nWhat's driving the stock market?\n\nWall Street's focus on trade relationships between the U.S. and China have been heightened this week as discussions between lower-level officials, leading to higher-level delegates on Oct. 10-11, are kicking off.\n\nHowever, recent developments this week have made it difficult for investors to anticipate that a sweeping tariff agreement between the world's largest economies can be achieved soon, with a import duties set to be implemented on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% set to take effect Oct. 15.\n\nLate Monday, the U.S. blacklisted 28 Chinese companies (link) because of their alleged role in human-rights violations against Muslim minorities ahead of the high-level discussions which will be led by China Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday.\n\nBloomberg also reported (link) the Trump administration is moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a particular focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds.\n\n\"It seems that investors are reluctant to assume a clear direction ahead of the high-level trade negotiations between US and Chinese officials on Thursday and Friday,\" wrote Charalambos Pissouros, senior market analyst at brokerage JFD Group.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, the wholesale cost of U.S. goods and services posted the steepest decline in September (link) since the first month of the year, largely reflecting lower gasoline prices and signaling that inflation is likely to remain low. The producer price index sank 0.3% last month, and the increase in wholesale inflation over the past 12 months slid to 1.4% from 1.8%, marking the lowest level in almost three years. A more closely followed measure that strips out volatile food, energy and trade-margin costs dropped to 1.7% from 1.9% year-on-year. The low rate of inflation has given the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates to try to guard the U.S. economy from damage related to the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nStocks to watch\n\nDomino's Pizza Inc. (DPZ) slid 4% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the company posted weaker-than-expected earnings (link)for its fiscal third quarter. Revenue was below analysts' forecasts as well.\n\nBoeing (BA) was sued by the union representing pilots at Southwest Airlines (link). The pilots claim Boeing rushed the now-grounded 737 Max jet to market and misrepresented the aircraft as safe but Boeing said the suit is without merit.\n\nOracle (ORCL) is planning to hire 2,000 new workers (link)as part of a plan to expand cloud computing services to more companies in the competition with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) , JD.com(JD), Baidu (K3SD.SG) Chinese company stocks listed in the U.S. may come under pressure, following reports that the White House is considering limits on Chinese stock holdings in government pension funds.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nU.S. Treasury yields fell Tuesday after the Trump administration placed several Chinese technology companies on a blacklist ahead of trade negotiations at the end of the week. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped 2 basis points to 1.53% early Tuesday..\n\nGold for December delivery picked up $2.10 an ounce, or 0.1%, to trade at $1,506.50 an ounce on Comex after settling at $1,504.40 on Monday (link).\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery traded up 0.2% at $52.64 a barrel, early Tuesday.\n\nIn Asian trade overnight Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.3% to 25,893.40, the China CSI 300 gained 0.6%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1%.
