Still, despite the buoyant mood it wasn\u2019t just another festival tailor-made for glossy Instagram photos. Instead, Catharsis on the Mall, which was inspired by Burning Man and took place on the National Mall in May, had a different aim\u2014 healing. Not surprisingly part of the conversation included climate change and within 24 hours of a climate anxiety session being announced, all the seats were reserved. Amid laughter and ambient festival noise 30 people gathered in a hot tent and sat on rugs and lawn chairs to talk about their feelings of despair, depression, and anxiety.\n\nDebbie Chang, a volunteer with the D.C. chapter of Citizens' Climate Lobby, led the group and said the genesis of the event came from noticing the negativity of activists around her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really a space, I don\u2019t think, for people to talk about these feelings,\u201d Chang said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to dwell on negative emotions, but people want to be heard and validated.\u201d\n\nAttendees were asked to jot down emotions they felt when thinking about climate change and elaborate within small groups. After exploring the emotions, Chang led a discussion about coping mechanisms including breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, and stretching.\n\nAs part of staying grounded in the work the group also discussed what aspects of the movement made them hopeful. In naming those hopes, they were tasked with envisioning an ideal future and to imagine the first baby step they could take towards actualizing it.\n\n\u201cThe idea is: There\u2019s a lot of doom-and-gloom, and it\u2019s important to remember what it is you\u2019re working for. I think taking a moment to envision that is motivating,\u201d Chang said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of research to support that visualizing that first step means people will more likely take it.\u201d\n\nChang\u2019s meetup is part of a growing movement of support spaces that have sprung up around the country. As activists seek to stay engaged they are increasingly grappling with the challenges of what has become known as climate anxiety or climate depression.\n\n\u201c There\u2019s a feeling that your anxiety or your feelings are going nowhere\u2026 we\u2019re locked in the warming, greenhouse gas will have effects for decades,\u201d said Alex Trope, a resident physician at the University of California in San Francisco within the Department of Psychiatry. \u201cIt\u2019s the 11th hour. People are going to feel that now.\u201d\n\nTrope is also a member of Climate Psychiatry Alliance, a group comprised of psychiatrists who believe that mental health is significantly impacted by the changing climate and requires more clinicians to be well-versed in the concerns of the activist community. In addition to ideas on how to take tangible and meaningful action the alliance is, working to build a list of \u201cclimate-aware therapists.\u201d\n\nThough Trope said professional intervention for climate anxiety might be necessary for those with \u201cdeep dysfunction,\u201d he said finding someone who could relate could also be therapeutic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to find someone who can hold it with you, not crack jokes or not recognize the crisis,\u201d he said, adding that person-to-person interaction could help counteract the \u201cdoom-and-gloom online coverage.\u201d\n\nArizona-based activist Laura Schmidt said she felt like her years spent working in the environmental nonprofit space weren\u2019t \u201cfruitful,\u201d because she was unable to \u201cforce people to look at the problem.\u201d\n\nNeeding to rethink her approach to her activist work she utilized her grad school work in identifying tools that activists use to fight burnout and developed a 10-step program along with her wife, Aimee Lewis-Reau. Called the Good Grief Network, the program has a similar structure to Alcoholics Anonymous and therapy sessions.\n\nDesigned in the form of weekly meetings, the program guides participants through practicing self-care. Each week focuses on a different part of the curriculum ranging from confronting morality to practicing gratitude to clearing past trauma. Regardless of the week\u2019s lesson there is a focus on how to properly accept, process, and act upon the feelings that the severity of climate change can bring. The 10th step is \u201caction-oriented\u201d and acts as a means to help express climate anxiety in a positive way while taking \u201cthe pressure off the individual to save the world.\u201d\n\nLewis-Reau said creating a \u201cclear headspace\u201d was a priority of the program. \u201cIf someone\u2019s internal world is chaotic, it will make them act out in destructive ways. People should not be acting out in fear and panic, despite acting towards an uncertain future. The steps are tools that you have to be reminded of and practiced. It\u2019s a process-oriented program\u2026 Every step, you\u2019re at a new level of understanding.\u201d\n\nSince Good Grief\u2019s first meeting two years ago, the program has flourished with branches in California, New Jersey, Vermont, British Columbia and Australia.\n\n\u201cWe created the program we needed, and we\u2019re kind of shocked with the level of growth,\u201d Schmidt said, referencing the over 250 people who have participated. \u201cWe\u2019ve personally done 10 rounds of the program with participants, and more meetings are happening beyond us,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cWe know this is strong. It empowers people and takes away desperation.\u201d\n\nFor Lynn Wang, a trip to Australia last year was a tipping point as she felt the \u201cbigness of the world collapsed\u201d after seeing the coral reefs.\n\n\u201cThose coral reefs took thousands of years to become what they are. Hundreds of thousands of years of work were destroyed in the blink of an eye,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gave me a feeling that was unstoppable, that we could not stop the system destroying nature.\u201d\n\nDuring random conversations with other activists in the Sunrise Movement, where she is a hub coordinator, she noticed their climate anxiety would \u201ccome out in little spurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople would say, \u2018Isn\u2019t it great that the world is ending in 12 years?\u2019 It\u2019s in the back of people's minds, and it\u2019s constantly over our heads,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real fear for the next generation. Thinking about the future, I can\u2019t imagine planning for the future when we only have 12 years.\u201d\n\nThe decision to host a support group was aimed and combating dueling emotions.\n\n\u201cThe Sunrise Movement is optimistic, and that's not rhetoric that always jives with internal feelings\u2026 the climate movement is still figuring that out,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe\u2019re discouraged from saying things that might cause a panic, because panic is not a good emotion to act from\u2026 We need to make room for the anxiety before it takes over the movement. If it\u2019s driven by the panic, we won\u2019t be able to do much.\u201d\n\nThe movement\u2014which shot to fame after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined their sit-in at Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office\u2014believes that wealthy oil and gas executives along with complicit politicians are prohibiting climate change solutions from becoming reality. They focus on political engagement, like making the Green New Deal a top issue in the 2020 election or organizing demonstrations at City Halls across the nation.\n\nWang\u2019s hub plans to participate in the Global Climate Strike on September 20, kicking off a week of action demanding an end to fossil fuel use. Strikes are planned in 150 countries leading up to the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23.\n\nWang said organizing and participating in events like the strike was \u201ctherapeutic\u201d in fighting climate anxiety because it allowed her to find people who shared her values. Chang concurred, and said the camaraderie is critical.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking for fellowship in this work,\u201d Chang said. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s other people around you, there is always hope.\u201d", "description": "Support groups are growing around the country as activists seek to stay engaged while grappling with feelings of frustration and hopelessness.", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568677232/190915-Arciga-covering-climate-change-tease_ndjdgd", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
