Pictured is a member of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army during fighting in Ras al-Ayn\n\nTurkey's invasion of northern Syria has now entered its eighth day, with heavy clashes reported around the city of Ras al-Ayn (pictured, Turkish-backed rebels around the city)\n\nTurkey is fighting to regain complete control over Ra al-Ayn, on the Syrian border, after it initially seized the city then lost parts of it to a Kurdish counter-attack\n\nErdogan vowed to press ahead with his attack despite calls for a ceasefire and said he isn't worried about US sanctions against Turkey (pictured, rocket artillery attacks Ras al-Ayn)\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested over the past week that it is a good thing Turkey is taking over from the US in Syria, while also boasting about sanctioning the country over its role\n\nRussia has so far proved the most effective peacekeeper in Syria, after brokering a deal between the Kurds and Syrian government forces that has seen Assad's troops move to the front line (red arrows). Putin has also positioned his troops between Turkey and government forces around Manbij, stopping an anticipated attack\n\nHe has also welcomed the arrival of Russian and Syrian government forces to protect the Kurds, despite describing them as 'our enemy'.\n\nAnd, in an abrupt reversal of relations, he has amplified Turkish claims that Kurdish militias are terrorists who have been deliberately releasing ISIS members from prison - despite being allied with the Kurds as recently as a week ago.\n\nIn one typically contradictory tweet, Trump announced: 'Big sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!'\n\nTurkey's foreign minister said Wednesday that the country will retaliate against US sanctions with measures of its own, but did not specify what these would be.\n\nMevlut Cavusoglu told parliament that the current US position towards Turkey is at a 'critical juncture' and urged Congress to turn back from its 'damaging approach'.\n\nHe added that he will convey the message to an American delegation including Mike Pence, when he arrives on Thursday.\n\nIn his interview with the Turkish journalists, Erdogan also shared an anecdote from his telephone call with Trump this week.\n\n'I told Trump: \"You get very angry with the media from time to time. You are now under their influence. Don't listen to them, you are a strong leader. This does not befit a strong leader\",' he said.\n\nSo far Russia has proved the only effective peacekeeper, after negotiating a defence pact between the Kurds - America's former allies - and the Syrian government.\n\nVladimir Putin has also ordered Russian troops to stand between Turkish and Syrian forces around the city of Manbij, halting an anticipated attack on the city.\n\nTurkey's attack began after Donald Trump agreed to withdraw US troops from the region, but Washington has since called for a ceasefire (pictured, Turkish tanks near Manbij)\n\nIn one typically contradictory tweet, Trump amplified Turkish state claims that the Kurds are releasing ISIS prisoners, raised the prospect of war with Turkey, then vowed 'never ending wars will end'\n\nTrump has also repeatedly pushed the idea that the US should have nothing to do with Syria, while also saying 'we are watching the situation closely'\n\nThe President also claimed there is 'great consensus' on sanctions against Turkey for attacking the Kurds, despite effectively green-lighting the invasion himself\n\nTrump also tweeted about a Kurdish military operation which he claimed happened in Syria, when in fact it took place in Kirkuk, which is in neighbouring Iraq\n\nA member of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group backed by Turkey, fires his weapon during fighting around Ras al-Ayn\n\nEven as Erdogan vowed to keep Pence and Pompeo waiting for a meeting with him, the Kremlin announced a summit between the Turkish leader and Vladimir Putin, scheduled to take place in the coming days.\n\nMoscow said the meeting was to ensure the Turkish operation does not turn into all-out war between Erdogan and Assad's forces.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Erdogan vowed to defy calls from Washington to stop the violence, vowing: 'We will never declare a ceasefire.'\n\nHe added: 'They [America] are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about sanctions.'\n\nRussia's presence did not completely prevent the bloodshed, with Erdogan blaming Syrian government forces for a mortar attack which killed one of his soldiers.\n\nReuters journalists accompanied Syrian government forces who entered the centre of Manbij, a flashpoint where U.S. troops had previously conducted joint patrols with Turkey.\n\nRussian and Syrian flags were flying from a building on the city outskirts and from a convoy of military vehicles.\n\nRussia's Interfax news agency, citing Moscow's Defence Ministry, said later that Syrian forces had taken control of an area of more than 1,000 square km (386 miles) around Manbij, including Tabqa military airfield.\n\nFighting continues in earnest elsewhere including in the city of Ras al-Ayn, which saw heavy bombardment by Turkish forces Tuesday after Kurds recaptured part of the border crossing during a counter-attack.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected decision to withhold protection from Syria's Kurds after a phone call with Erdogan a week ago swiftly upended five years of U.S. policy on Syria.\n\nKurdish forces say hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of children, have been displaced by fighting along the border\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels load their weapons as they take a break between battles in villages surrounding Ras al-Ayn\n\nA transport carrying members of the Free Syrian Army close to the city of Ras al-Ayn\n\nFree Syrian Army units, allied to Turkey, drive armoured vehicles around the city of Ras al-Ayn\n\nAs well as clearing the way for the Turkish incursion, the U.S. withdrawal gives a free hand to Washington's adversaries in the world's deadliest ongoing war, namely Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies.\n\nThe Syrian army deployments into Kurdish-held territory amount to a victory for Assad and Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swathe of Syria that had been beyond their grasp through much of its eight-year-old war.\n\nThe United States announced on Sunday it was withdrawing its entire force of 1,000 troops from northern Syria. Its former Kurdish allies immediately forged a new alliance with Assad's government, inviting the army into towns across their territory.\n\nA Reuters cameraman on the Turkish frontier reported heavy bombardment on Tuesday morning of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, where an SDF spokesman reported a battle going on.\n\nU.S. military aircraft carried out a 'show of force' around the town of Kobani after Turkish-backed fighters came close to American forces, a U.S. official told Reuters. The Turkish-backed fighters dispersed after the show of force, the official said.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet Erdogan on Thursday in Ankara.\n\nMembers of Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, a militant group active in parts of northwest Syria, load up with supplies in the Turkish town of Akcakale\n\nThe Free Syrian Army, units of the government army that defected during the civil war and are now loyal to Turkey, load up with supplies\n\nThe Free Syrian Army is now facing off against their former comrades in Manbij, after government forces moved up to defend the city (pictured, a re-supply run in Turkey)\n\nThis picture taken on October 15, 2019 from the Turkish side of the border at Ceylanpinar district in Sanliurfa shows smoke rising from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn\n\nRas al-Ayn has seen the majority of the fighting so far, after Turkey seized control of the city but was partially pushed back by a Kurdish counter-attack\n\n'Vice President Pence will reiterate President Trump's commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached,' the White House said in a statement.\n\nAfter Trump announced a set of sanctions on Monday to punish Ankara, U.S. prosecutors hit Turkey with charges on the majority state-owned Halkbank for taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nA Turkish embassy official in Washington said the indictment did not contribute positively to the current state of U.S.-Turkey ties. Turkish and American officials had been in talks on the Halkbank case for at least a year.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said Washington would threaten more sanctions to persuade Turkey to reach a ceasefire and halt its offensive.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump supporter who has nevertheless been highly critical of the president's troop withdrawal, said he would introduce a bill on Thursday to impose tougher sanctions on Turkey.\n\nThe measures announced on Monday - mainly a hike in steel tariffs and a pause in trade talks - were less robust than financial markets had anticipated, and Trump's critics derided them as too feeble to have an impact.\n\nFree Syrian Army soldiers have a rest during fighting in villages around Ras al-Ayn\n\nTurkey's Operation Peace Spring has entered its eighth day, will heavy fighting still taking place around Ras al-Ayn (pictured)\n\nTurkey-backed rebels position a rocket launcher ready for attacks in Ras al-Ayn\n\nPro-Turkey rebels attempt to clear Ra al-Ayn of Kurdish fighters after a counter-attack saw them lose partial control of the city\n\nThe Turkish lira, which had fallen on the expectation of tougher U.S. measures, recovered after the sanctions were announced, as did its bond and stock markets, with traders noting that Trump had spared Turkish banks.\n\nBilateral trade between Turkey and the United States is relatively small - around a tenth the size of Turkey's trade with Europe. Washington's most effective form of economic leverage would be to hinder Turkey's access to U.S. financial markets, a step Trump has so far avoided.\n\nIn a potentially more damaging blow, German carmaker Volkswagen said it was postponing a final decision on whether to build a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) plant in Turkey, citing concern over 'current developments'.\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, the U.S. Treasury said on Monday it had sanctioned Turkey's energy, defence and interior ministers.\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of U.S. policy as part of a plan to extricate the United States from 'endless' wars in the Middle East.\n\nBut his critics cast it as a betrayal of the Kurds, loyal allies who lost thousands of fighters as the principal ground force in Washington's battle against Islamic State.\n\nA senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. military would continue to combat Islamic State militants, who experts say could take advantage of the chaos to stage a resurgence.\n\n'The intent is to reposition (U.S. forces leaving Syria) and use what assets and personnel we have available to continue the mission,' the official said.\n\nHowever, without a partnership on the ground in Syria like the with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, any such U.S. efforts would almost certainly be limited.\n\nSo far the only effective peacekeeper has been Russia, after Putin ordered his troops to stand between the warring factions, saying he 'would not allow' further fighting\n\nRussia has also brokered a defence pact between Syrian government forces (pictured) and the Kurds - America's former allies\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters are pictured in the town of Ayn al-Arus, south of the border town of Tal Abyad, after they seized control\n\nThe Kurdish YPG militia, the key component of the forces who fought Islamic State, is seen by Ankara as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish separatist insurgents in Turkey.\n\nTurkey says it aims to defeat the YPG and create a 'safe zone' where millions of Syrian war refugees now in Turkey could be resettled.\n\nThe United Nations says 160,000 people have fled their homes as Turkish forces advance. The regional Kurdish administration puts the number of displaced at 270,000.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will likely meet on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments in Syria, diplomats said, the second such session since Turkey began its offensive.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights office said on Tuesday that Turkey could be held responsible for war crimes by fighters under its direction, potentially including the assassination of Hevrin Khalaf, a leading Kurdish politician killed on the side of a highway on Saturday by gunmen who posted the attack on the internet.\n\nTurkish-backed fighters have denied blame for her murder.\n\nErdogan said Ankara was giving the world a chance to bring peace to the region.\n\n'The international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,' he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
