Saminathan, said she and two others, Sumathi (wife of S. Chandru, businessman) and Vimala Jakumaran (wife of Melaka local authority councillor V. Suresh Kumar) made this decision as they are frustrated with and disappointed at the arrests of husbands.\n\n\u201cIt has been 14 days since their arrest, and we have given all the cooperation the police have requested.\n\n\u201cWhat else are they investigating? How long more do they need to investigate?\n\n\u201cDeepavali is coming this weekend, but we will not be able to celebrate it as how we have before, knowing that our husbands are being detained for something they did not do,\u201d she said when met by Malay Mail outside the Bukit Aman police headquarters today.\n\nThe Kuala Lumpur High Court today set October 31 to hear a habeas corpus application by five of the suspects arrested over alleged links to LTTE.\n\nThe five are being held in detention under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma).\n\nUmah said by next Thursday (hearing day) will be the 21st day that her husband is held in detention, and it will take another week for the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThat makes 28 days, we won\u2019t be seeing my husband.\n\n\u201cUntil now I don\u2019t know what to tell my son. He has been asking me where is \u2018appa\u2019 (father). He has also asked me why are we not going Deepavali shopping. What am I to tell him?\u201d said Umah who was in tears.\n\nWife of Gadek assemblyman G. Saminathan, Umah Devi; wife of businessman S.

That you can celebrate in 30 minutes? There are prayers which need to be performed, and Deepavali is a very meaningful festival for us Hindus,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also asked if it was necessary that the five be investigated under Sosma as they were merely performing prayers for the public.\n\n\u201cThere is some form of confusion somewhere. And we hope that the police complete their investigations soon.\n\n\u201cThe Pakatan Harapan (PH) government had promised to abolish Sosma in their manifesto, but why are they are still using it.\n\n\u201cWhere are all the ministers who once fought to abolish Sosma? Why are they not saying anything about this?\u201d she questioned.\n\nUmah said they have stayed outside Bukit Aman since Monday and will continue to do so until their husbands are released.\n\nSeremban Jaya assemblyman P. Gunasekaren is also among the five who were arrested on suspicion of supporting the LTTE.\n\nThe LTTE was a separatist group that had been active in Sri Lanka until it was officially defeated in 2009. It has been classified as a terrorist group by 32 countries including Malaysia, which did so in 2014.\n\nRelated Articles Let LTTE detainees go early for Deepavali, lawyer urges IGP Tamils, LTTE and arrests Cops urge families of LTTE detainees to be patient amid ongoing investigation", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 \u2014 The wives of three suspects arrested over alleged links to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have gone on a hunger strike after hearing that their husbands will be...", "authors": ["Soo Wern Jun"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z1TGu6cGAiCCmw1ADB4gNQ--~B/aD0xMDMxO3c9MTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/587f61403d8032b2ee9b252fa02cd747", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
