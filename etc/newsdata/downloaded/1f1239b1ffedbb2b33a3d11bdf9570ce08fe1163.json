A package arrived a couple of weeks ago that I was not expecting and I was very surprised to see two Apple Watch bands from UAG.\n\nApparently I was not paying attention to the latest news as UAG recently launched both Leather and Active watch straps for the Apple Watch, covering all series with two watch sizes available.\n\nI was sent the Midnight (gray camo) Active and brown Leather models to test out with my 44mm Apple Watch Series 4. These are affordable bands with a price of $59.95 for the Active model and $69.95 for the Leather model.\n\nSee also: Apple Watch Series 4 back on my wrist: Unnecessary, but indispensable", "description": "Urban Armor Gear (UAG) is well-known for making high quality smartphone cases with drop-test certification so it is with interest we see it launch Apple Watch bands. The bands are very well constructed, look great, and are much more affordable than Apple's bands.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/11/84a722f4-530d-4703-b864-2b96746fecc4/thumbnail/770x578/9449e17ec223281d656a69d0d00be5f4/uag-apple-watch-bands-1.jpg"}
