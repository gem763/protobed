Simpkins says intervention by social workers might have spared her a brutal career being beaten by a pimp when she didn\u2019t earn a daily quota of $1,000.\n\nShe estimates that over the years she was arrested about 200 times for prostitution and other offenses; her pimp, never.\n\nEventually, Simpkins escaped that life and now works with an outstanding program in Tennessee called Thistle Farms that helps exploited women start new lives and find employment.\n\nAs world leaders prepare to gather at the United Nations, some 40 million people are effectively locked into modern forms of slavery, according to the Global Slavery Index. That includes sex trafficking but also child marriages and a great deal of forced labor.\n\nIn the United States, no one knows exactly how many children are sold for sex, but estimates have run between 10,000 and 100,000 in any given year. Whatever the number, it\u2019s too many.\n\nPresident Trump and Ivanka Trump have both denounced sex trafficking, with the president saying he will leverage \u201cevery resource\u201d to address this \u201curgent humanitarian issue.\u201d Ivanka Trump has said that fighting trafficking is a major priority of her father\u2019s administration.\n\nBut while the attention is welcome, it seems to be largely hot air \u2014 and Trump\u2019s lurid descriptions of trafficking seem mostly to be a misleading rationale for his border wall.
