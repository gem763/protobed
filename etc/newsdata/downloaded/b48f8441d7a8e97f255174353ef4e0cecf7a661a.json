It is unclear, at this time, if Walgreens will continue on as the lone remaining defendant at the trial.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % MCK MCKESSON CORPORATION 152.26 +1.75 +1.16% CAH CARDINAL HEALTH 51.54 +0.33 +0.64% ABC AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION 89.64 +0.14 +0.16% TEVA TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRIES LTD. 7.50 -0.27 -3.47%\n\nSettlement talks -- reportedly for nearly $50 billion dollars -- had fallen through over the weekend. In the last 20 years, an estimated 400,000 deaths are blamed on opioids, both legal and illegal.\n\nThe stakes of the case were expected to be significant and far-reaching, as a bellwether for how future cases are handled. There have been 2,600 lawsuits filed against various pharmaceutical-related companies -- that make, sell or distribute the drugs -- in an effort to recover some of the cost to opioid-ravaged communities.\n\nIn the case at hand, two Ohio counties -- Cuyahoga and Summit -- were suing companies that either make, sell, or distribute opioids. The counties were looking for money to help them fight and fix the epidemic, while families who lost loved ones to overdoses are seeking justice. The companies, meanwhile, say they followed the law and aren\u2019t to blame for the crisis.\n\n\u201cThis is not your typical tort product liability case. It\u2019s really about an epidemic,\u201d Carl Tobias, a professor in the law school at the University of Richmond, said. \u201cThere are so many different motivations among so many different players, it\u2019s virtually impossible to know what would be good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe distributors\u2019 role is to help ensure that medicines prescribed by licensed doctors are delivered to licensed pharmacies, so they are available for patients who need them, when they need them, where they need them,\u201d the three large distributors said in a joint statement issued after settlement negotiations hit an impasse on Friday. \u201cWe have to balance our mission to deliver medicines to pharmacies and hospitals when and where they need them against our important efforts to prevent and detect illegal diversion of those drugs.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "In the last 20 years, an estimated 400,000 deaths are blamed on opioids, both legal and illegal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
