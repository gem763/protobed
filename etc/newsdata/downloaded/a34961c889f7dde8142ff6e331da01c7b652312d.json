Moyes and his men are sinking without trace so don't let them take you down too... and prepare for 'aerial playmaker' Carroll's return\n\n\n\nWelcome to Sportsmail's weekly Fantasy Football column which will try to help you get the edge on your friends, family and Jamie Redknapp.\n\nHere, Rik Sharma considers the key issues in the game, from the men to bring in or avoid, through to which teams have a tasty looking run of fixtures.\n\n\n\nIn years gone by, Manchester United were reliable. Trustworthy.\n\nPlayers like Nemanja Vidic and Wayne Rooney pulled their weight.\n\nBefore them, it was Cristiano Ronaldo and Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\nYou could put three of them in your fantasy football side and be assured that you were getting what you paid for.\n\nBut that simply isn\u2019t the case any more.\n\nDavid Moyes hasn\u2019t put a strategy in place for his version of the Red Devils. If you were asked to describe how they go about playing football, you\u2019d find it hard to put in words.\n\nSome of the supporters might find a few abrasive four-letter ones.\n\nPerhaps the only consistent theme with this side is that they cross the ball a lot.\n\nBut Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie aren\u2019t incredible in the air. Juan Mata is better in the middle than on the flank.\n\nAnd it adds up, both in real-life and in fantasy football, to a lot of expensive players putting in not-very-good results.\n\nThe defence, meanwhile, is clearly not good enough either. Nemanja Vidic is leaving, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra are set to join him in the march towards the Old Trafford exit.\n\nIt just leaves a lot of rotation at the back and youngsters like Chris Smalling out of his depth.\n\nPulling in different directions: Robin van Persie (right) was outspoken about his team-mates after a humbling defeat in Greece\n\nNo case for the defence: Nemanja Vidic (left) is looking past his best, while Patrice Evra is on his way out too\n\n\n\nThe good old days: Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cristiano Ronaldo were must-haves for fantasy football owners\n\nThere\u2019s even disharmony in the camp. Van Persie said, after the Olympiacos defeat: \u2018Our fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces I want to play in.\n\n\u2018And unfortunately, they are often playing in my zones. I think that\u2019s a shame.\n\n\u2018And when I see that, it makes it difficult for me to come to those spaces as well.\n\n\u2018So that forces me to adjust my runs, based on the position of my fellow players.\u2019\n\nPerhaps that explains why the game\u2019s most expensive player is only the 14th top-scoring striker.\n\nRooney, his strike partner (allegedly; they barely pass to each other) is faring better, in seventh place, but that\u2019s still no great shakes.\n\nMidfielder Antonio Valencia is the top scoring United player in that department.\n\nThe leader of the pack: Antonio Valencia (left) is United's top-scoring midfielder... but only the 49th in the game\n\nLow scoring: At a princely \u00a39million, Michael Carrick has earned just 67 points\n\nBut he\u2019s a shocking 49th. That puts him in what would be the 12th best midfield in the Premier League if it was based on goals, assists and wins.\n\nHis team-mates, Ashley Young, Michael Carrick, Adnan Januzaj and Co, fare significantly worse.\n\nEvra is the highest scoring United defender and he\u2019s 14th, boosted by scoring a handful of goals.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been holding onto any United player, in the hope they might eventually come good, you\u2019re waiting for Godot.\n\nDitch them, and quickly.\n\nThe classic combo\n\nAndy Carroll is back from his three-match suspension and nobody will be happier than his partner in crime Kevin Nolan.\n\nWest Ham are in fine form and it was kick started by the big striker\u2019s return from injury.\n\nIt got Nolan, who feeds on his knock-downs and layoffs, back among the goals and he\u2019s been scoring since.\n\nOf course, Carroll was sent off for that elbow flung at Chico Flores, and has been absent, but it hasn\u2019t stopped the Hammers knocking down any nails that stick up in their path.\n\n\n\nBack in action: Andy Carroll (right) will be reunited with pal Kevin Nolan (left) after completing his three-match ban\n\nAre Everton going to be their next victims this weekend? Even if Carroll doesn\u2019t find the net himself, he boosts the potential of midfielder Nolan.\n\nHe\u2019d be a fine differential at this stage of the season.\n\nHave we got the Blackpool Adam back?\n\nMore known for his clumping tackles than his assists and goals these days, Charlie Adam is a far cry from his Blackpool days.\n\nBut in recent weeks, that\u2019s started to change.\n\n\n\nMixed bag: Is Charlie Adam (right) becoming a more attractive proposition at \u00a35m?\n\nThe Scot has started to take control of games for Stoke, bagging three goals in his last nine games, and playing several key passes.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s still got that lack of discipline - he\u2019s been booked four times in the last five matches.\n\nSwans survival push\n\nIn a recent column it was made clear that Swansea had a great chance to start pushing forward in their bid to avoid the drop.\n\nTheir 4-3 defeat by Liverpool won\u2019t have been good for the defence but anyone who put Wilfried Bony in on the back of that will have benefited.\n\nAnd that came after drawing 0-0 with Napoli in the Europa League.\n\n\n\nUpturn in fortunes? Wilfried Bony (second left) is crucial to Swansea's survival hopes\n\nIf they hadn\u2019t put so much effort in against the Italians, who knows what might have happened?\n\nHaving played - and lost 3-1 - in Italy again, the squad may be tired for their game against Crystal Palace on Sunday night.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, as that would be a great opportunity for their key players to score points.\n\nIf you have Swansea players in your side, perhaps you\u2019ll be hoping they\u2019re knocked out of Europe to concentrate on domestic affairs.\n\nSuper SuarezEase the pain for M Who's going to save Crystal Palace?\n\n\n\nMost selected XI\n\nGK: Simon Mignolet (28.01%)\n\nDF: Leighton Baines (34.54%)\n\nDF: Branislav Ivanovic (19.04%)\n\nDF: John Terry (17.71%)\n\nDF: Pablo Zabaleta (17.46%)\n\nMF: Eden Hazard (27.56%)\n\nMF: Yaya Toure (24.22%)\n\nMF: Oscar (20.74%)\n\n\n\nST: Luis Suarez (35.77%)\n\nST: Robin van Persie (34.20%)\n\nST: Olivier Giroud (19.80%)\n\n\n\nLynchpin: Luis Suarez (left) is a keystone to Liverpool's hopes this season - and more than one in three of you have the Uruguayan in your team\n\nPlay on the go!\n\n\n\nWe've launched our mobile Fantasy Football site which makes it even easier for you to make transfers and substitutions on the go.\n\n\n\nYou might not have the time to sit around at home and mull over transfer decisions but now you can do it while you're on the bus, or waiting in the supermarket queue, or wherever else you fancy.\n\n\n\nYou can now play MailOnline's Fantasy Football game on your mobile - making transfers and subs on the go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamie Redknapp's team for this weekend...
