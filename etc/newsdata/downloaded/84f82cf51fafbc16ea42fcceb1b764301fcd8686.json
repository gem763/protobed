The multi-millionaire managed to escape but the case reveals why you should never tell anyone your actual fortune worth.\n\nBitcoin Millionaire Almost Lost His Life\n\nA Norwegian multi-millionaire who reportedly made his fortunes by working with cryptocurrency for the past decade almost lost his life, according to local media TV2.\n\nEarlier in May this year, a multi-millionaire from Oslo heard his door ringing in the afternoon. As he opened to see who is it, the man saw someone pointing a gun to his head saying \u201cLie down, or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the millionaire managed to escape after jumping out of his own balcony on the second floor. The report doesn\u2019t say if the man is injured or not.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the man has spent the past decade working with cryptocurrencies and it\u2019s said that his account is worth more than $11 million. The report also reveals that the millionaire has previously been fairly public about how much money he made from cryptocurrency, which is perhaps what brought the attention of the robber towards him.\n\nThe case will be brought to court on October 17th and 18th by Oslo police lawyer Ellen Karine Aas. The perpetrator\u2019s attorney said that his client won\u2019t admit to criminal chargest and refused to give any further comment.\n\nThat\u2019s not the first time someone\u2019s been targetted for his cryptocurrency riches. Earlier in 2018 in Johannesburg, South Africa, a Bitcoin trader was kidnapped and tortured by a group of people over his Bitcoin holdings.\n\nIt\u2019s Important to Stay Safe\n\nThere are at least a few things that you can do that would prevent you from getting into situations of the kind.\n\nFirst things first, don\u2019t tell people about your riches. There\u2019s absolutely no value in anyone knowing how much Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency you own. Silence is golden. If you get into a situation of the kind, however, just lie. Deny as much as you can and try to cast as much doubt as you can even if you have bitcoin.\n\nAnother thing you can do is just keep a small amount of Bitcoin in a separate account that you can always use in order to appease the attackers. You can also use multi-sig technology by giving the other key to a person you trust or just keep it safe at a deposit box.\n\nIn addition to the above, Cryptopotato has prepared a list of 9 tips that you can use to keep your wallet safe.\n\nYet, it\u2019s important to know that there\u2019s no amount of money worth more than your life. If push comes to shove and there\u2019s no other way around it, simply forfeit your fortunes. It\u2019s definitely less valuable than your life.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "A cryptocurrency millionaire nearly lost his life after someone pointed a gun to his head, threatening to shoot him.
