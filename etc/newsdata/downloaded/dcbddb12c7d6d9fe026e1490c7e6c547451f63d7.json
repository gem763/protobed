SpaceX is now ready to move to a more powerful test vehicle that could be capable of flying into Earth's orbit.\n\nCEO Elon Musk teased a few images this week of the new prototype under construction at a SpaceX testing site in Boca Chica, Texas. The peek comes ahead of an event that Musk will host at that location on September 28. He's expected to give the most detailed presentation in two years about SpaceX's plans for interplanetary travel.\n\nThe first prototype SpaceX built was nicknamed \"Starhopper.\" It was used to conduct the hop flights over the past few months. Those tests in Boca Chica were designed to check the spacecraft's ability to make controlled landings, an important task if Starship will one day land on Mars, like Musk hopes.\n\nRead More", "description": "A year ago, there was little evidence beyond a few tweets, engine tests, and slideshows to indicate that SpaceX was building a massive spaceship capable of traveling to other planets.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918092641-01-spacex-elon-musk-starship-mars-rocket-prototype-trnd-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
