You rely on them being positive and coming on to make an impact,\u201d Lampard told reporters.\n\n\u201cYou have to give Christian huge credit because he looked so lively and the assist is just as important as the finish.\u201d\n\nPulisic had admitted to being frustrated by limited playing time, with the media speculating that he could leave Chelsea on loan during the January transfer window.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to shut my ears to a lot of the outside talk ... I understand his quality, his young age and the fact that it\u2019s a big move for him,\u201d Lampard said.\n\n\u201cHe wants to know what I want from him, what the Premier League is like and that\u2019s not always an easy ride but we\u2019ve stayed calm and kept looking at the big picture.\u201d\n\nLampard said the result in the Dutch capital, which left Chelsea with six points after three games in Group H, had set the benchmark for his youthful side.\n\n\u201cIt feels huge. That always scares me because there\u2019s a lot to do and it\u2019s just six points halfway through the group now, but we\u2019re entitled to be excited,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt can be a bit of a blueprint for us in terms of the work from the midfield players which was outstanding ... but there\u2019s no excuses for us now to dip from that.\n\n\u201cThe younger players are still babies in Champions League minutes so this was a huge test ... but the balance of our team between young players ... and experienced players who they rely on to set examples was good.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.8980 euros)", "description": "Chelsea's Christian Pulisic was left out of the squad entirely when they beat Lille in the Champions League earlier this month, but the 21-year-old's career sprang to life against Ajax Amsterdam on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444354363&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N07U", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
