Wade decision legalized the practice.\n\nA decision from the week-long hearing isn\u2019t expected until after February, and that ruling will be subject to judicial review.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s stubborn refusal to correct its gross deficiencies is the reason Missouri may soon be the first state since Roe v. Wade in 1973 to be free from abortion clinics,\u201d said March for Life President Jeanne Mancini. \u201cPlanned Parenthood should put the safety of women before its profits \u2014 the women of Missouri deserve as much.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn June 21, William Koebel, licenses administrator for the health department, wrote to Cathy Williams, interim president and chief executive of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, to deny renewal of the clinic\u2019s abortion license.\n\nFollowing state inspections, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region submitted many corrective measures that satisfied regulators, including improving medical records compliance and physician continuity.\n\nBut, Mr. Koebel noted that clinic officials provided no corrective measures for a host of other deficiencies and even refused to require patients to undergo pelvic examinations on the same day they received pre-surgical abortion counseling \u2014 a violation of state law.\n\n\u201cBecause RHS refuses to accept these grave instances as deficiencies, the Department has no assurances that such instances would not be repeated,\u201d wrote Mr. Koebel.\n\nPro-choice protesters gathered outside the courthouse in St. Louis.\n\nA federal judge has blocked Missouri\u2019s ban on abortions beginning after detection of a fetal heartbeat that was signed into law earlier this year by Gov. Mike Parson. A spokeswoman for Mr. Parson declined Monday to provide comment, citing pending litigation.\n\nThe number of abortion clinics in Missouri has fluctuated in the last decade, with as many as four facilities providing abortions as recently as 2017, according to the pro-choice research nonprofit Guttmacher Institute. Many pregnant people in Missouri seek abortion providers in other states.\n\nLast week, Planned Parenthood opened a 18,000-square-foot facility in Fairview Heights, Illinois, 12 miles east of St. Louis, to address increasing demand from Missourians.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
