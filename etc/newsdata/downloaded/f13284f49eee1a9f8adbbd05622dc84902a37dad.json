He refused to leave, and a white officer punched him in the face.\n\nThere was Craigory Adams, also black, who knocked on his neighbor\u2019s door late one night carrying a barbecue fork \u2014 to keep stray dogs away, he said \u2014 and the neighbor called the police. A white officer pointed a shotgun at Mr. Adams but said he wasn\u2019t meaning to fire it. He did, striking Mr. Adams in the arm.\n\nThese names and others have all been brought up again in the days since Ms. Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, was shot and killed in her bedroom this month by a white police officer who was standing outside her window. In the largely black and Hispanic neighborhood in southeast Fort Worth where Ms. Jefferson lived, and in others nearby, many residents recalled times when they had tried calling the police \u2014 and ended up sorry that they did.", "description": "Black residents of the city complained about mistreatment by the police long before Atatiana Jeffersons death. \u201cI never was supposed to be arrested,\u201d said one woman. \u201cI was the caller.\u201d", "authors": ["Manny Fernandez", "Sarah Mervosh", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/us/00FORTWORTH-indictment-promo/00FORTWORTH-indictment-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
