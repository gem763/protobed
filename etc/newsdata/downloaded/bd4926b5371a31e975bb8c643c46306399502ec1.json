That it wasn't going to happen. Because Oklahoma and us, we just couldn't get a deal done. At two, we thought it was back on. At five, [Clippers president Lawrence Frank] said 'Hey, it's over. We can all just go to dinner.' And so I was on my way to dinner, I was literally walking into Nobu in Malibu and I get a text, 'Grab your phone, it's back on.' Within an hour, the deal was done.\"\n\nLeonard was one of the most sought-after free agents this summer. While other stars had made their landing spots known early on in the process, the soft-spoken Leonard kept things close to the vest.\n\nUltimately, though, he told the Clippers he would sign if they could acquire George.\n\nThe Clippers eventually met the Thunder's asking price. L.A. sent OKC guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, forward Danilo Gallinari and three of their first-round picks (2022, 2024 and 2026) as well as two first-rounders via Miami (2021 and 2023), while the Thunder also received the right to swap first-round picks in 2023 and 2025.\n\nL.A. received only George\u2014a 2018-19 NBA MVP finalist\u2014in the deal, but the trade subsequently resulted in a commitment from Leonard, the reigning NBA Finals MVP.\n\nLeonard later told ESPN's Rachel Nichols that he was looking forward to teaming up with George, which will be his \"first time playing with ... an elite player on his level\":\n\nEven though the odds of a potential George trade appeared slim at times, Rivers and Co. never completely gave up hope. As a result, they will now enter the 2019-20 season among the favorites to win the championship.\n\nThe franchise has never advanced beyond the conference semifinals, let alone hoisted the Larry O'Brien Trophy.", "description": "The  Los Angeles Clippers  landed both Kawhi Leonard and  Paul George  on July 6, but in the hours leading up to the deal being completed, there was serious doubt the team was going to be able to pull it off...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/910/hi-res-8e5a20b1e12851e5c6285ae7881b7502_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
