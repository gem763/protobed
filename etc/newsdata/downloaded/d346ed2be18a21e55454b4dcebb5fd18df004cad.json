More than 130 applications have been made to the US Commerce Department by companies hoping to sell goods and services to Huawei, but none have yet been granted.\n\nThe ban on trading with the Chinese firm comes after concerns were raised by US government agencies that its devices could be used as spy tools by the Chinese state. Huawei has consistently denied these claims, and an escalating trade war between the US and China has not helped matters.\n\nHuawei has relied heavily in the past on US companies, particularly for software used in devices sold in US and European markets.\n\nMr Yu previously said it was Huawei\u2019s preference to continue working with US firms like Google in order to build its products.\n\nThe Mate 30 will be launched on 19 September in Munich, with rumours suggesting it will feature more camera lenses and support 5G connectivity.", "description": "The Huawei Mate 30 smartphone will be without Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube and other popular apps when it launches later this week but the Chinese firm\u2019s chief executive claims there will still be a way to get them.", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/10/huawei-mate-30-release-date.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
