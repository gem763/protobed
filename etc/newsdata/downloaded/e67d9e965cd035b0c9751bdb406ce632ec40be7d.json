But on Tuesday it was hard to actually find a bar showing the debate.\n\nThe management at Bullfeathers, a historic Capitol Hill watering hole, had originally intended to show both events, but ended up just showing the game. Down Pennsylvania Avenue, the manager at legendary local dive bar Tune Inn said there was \u201cno way in hell\u201d he would put the debate on any of his screens.\n\nThe only place where politics definitively triumphed may have been at Gypsy Sally\u2019s in Georgetown - but that was an event sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, where more than 50 people exclusively watched the debate in total silence.\n\nOne of the few places The Associated Press could find where people were watching both events was Capitol Hill\u2019s Hawk and Dove tavern. And even there baseball won the popular vote.\n\n\u201cWe thought everybody would want the game on mute until after the debate finished. But we asked everybody and only two people wanted the sound up for the debate,\u201d said bar manager Neptaly Escobar, who put the debate on one of the four screens above the bar. \u201cPeople are really excited for the Nats. This has never happened before.\u201d\n\nNot everybody was thrilled with that outcome. Across the room, a group of slightly disgruntled young men watched a separate TV showing the debate with closed captioning. They occasionally talked back to the candidates onscreen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unsatisfying to watch this way,\u201d said Ramzi, a Georgetown student who declined to give his full name. \u201cBut this is a historic night for the city. It trumps the importance of the debate tonight.\u201d\n\nOver at the bar, a few people were splitting their attention between both events. Megan, a congressional staffer, said she walked past multiple Capitol Hill bars before finding one that was showing the debate.\n\n\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t hear, I can still follow and enjoy a beer,\u201d said Megan, who also declined to give her last name. \u201cOn any other night, this place would be half-full of people all watching the debate.\u201d\n\nMegan chalked up the night\u2019s viewing habits to two main factors. On the sports side, there\u2019s the particularly compelling narrative of this year\u2019s Nationals team, which lost their best player to free agency and sneaked into the playoffs as a wild card team. On the political side, Megan said the fourth debate comes at a particularly non-compelling time in the process, with the stage still packed with 12 candidates fighting for airtime.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fewer people zoned in on it at this point. People are a bit burnt out but they\u2019ll get into it again when the field narrows a bit.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tuesday night presented a genuine televised quandary for many Washingtonians.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ashraf Khalil"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/aptopix_washington_split_screens_76660_c0-161-2824-1808_s1200x700.jpg?c139fe664570354209a42fe480d66a3bcfd12a2a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
