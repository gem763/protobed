He pointed to a high level of uncertainty over how much global temperatures might rise in coming decades.\n\nIf the temperature rise is near the midpoint of the projected range, the effects on human life might be bearable, he said. But if the temperature increase is closer to the high end of that range, \u201cthese are horrifying numbers, they would alter everything on Earth, every ecosystem, every person,\u201d he said in a video presentation posted online by Harvard.\n\nTo reduce the risk of a catastrophic outcome, he suggested a uniform global tax on carbon emissions.\n\nIn the 1980s, he argued for paying workers partly on the basis of their companies\u2019 profits. That way compensation would rise during booms and fall during downturns, allowing companies to lower costs when demand was weak without resorting to mass layoffs.\n\nProf. Weitzman died Aug. 27 in what the Massachusetts medical examiner determined was a suicide. He was 77 years old.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m drawn to things that are conceptually unclear, where it\u2019s not clear how you want to make your way through this maze,\u201d he said at a 2018 Harvard seminar honoring his career. Dr. Weitzman sometimes secluded himself to read and ponder on a marsh island he owned off Cape Ann in Massachusetts.\n\nHe and a co-author, Gernot Wagner, warned against climate-change complacency in lectures and in a 2015 book, \u201cClimate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet.\u201d The book argued that reducing dependence on fossil fuels would be \u201cone of the most difficult challenges modern civilization has ever faced.\u201d\n\nIn October 2015, he gave a lecture at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, on the difficulties of analyzing climate change. Political leaders needed to take prompt action, he said, because a wait-and-see approach might mean drifting into environmental disasters whose severity was realized only after it was too late to avert them.\n\n\u201cThe best policy for dealing with carbon dioxide is to put a price on it,\u201d he said. He estimated probabilities for various climate-change outcomes and said even those with relatively low probabilities of 10% or less couldn\u2019t be discounted.\n\nHe was born Meyer Levinger on April 1, 1942, in New York City. After his mother died of tuberculosis while he was an infant, he was taken in and eventually adopted by Fannie and Samuel Weitzman, who were schoolteachers living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. They renamed him Martin Lawrence Weitzman. When he was 7 years old, the family moved to Levittown, N.Y., on Long Island.\n\nAt Swarthmore College, he was on the wrestling and track teams. The student newspaper described him as talking about politics and mathematics \u201cwith the intonations of a Brooklyn garage mechanic.\u201d He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in math and physics in 1963. He then earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics and operations research at Stanford University in 1964 and a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967 before joining the economics faculty at Yale University. In 1970, he embarked on a year of study in the Soviet Union as a Guggenheim Fellow. MIT hired him for its economics faculty in 1972. He moved to Harvard as an economics professor in 1989 and spent the rest of his career there, most recently as a research professor.\n\nHis 1984 book, \u201cThe Share Economy,\u201d caught the attention of politicians searching for ways to prevent the economy from lurching from periods of rapid inflation to spells of high unemployment. He believed inflationary pressures would abate and companies would be less likely to lay off workers in bad times if wages could be adjusted down as well as up, depending on profits.\n\n\u201cThe major macroeconomic problems of our day can be traced back ultimately to the wage system,\u201d he said at a political forum in 1987. \u201cWe try to award every worker a predetermined piece of the income pie before it\u2019s out of the oven, before the size of the pie is even known.\u201d\n\nDr. Weitzman married Jennifer Brown Baverstam, a piano teacher, in 2013. They met in 2008 on what she described as her only online dating experience. She recalled his love of nature and statistical way of looking at the world. He once suggested to her that they should leave a party at the median point, or when half the guests had departed.\n\nHis survivors also include Rodica Weitzman, a daughter from an earlier marriage who is an anthropologist based in Brazil, and her two children.\n\nMs. Weitzman said her father was an outsider and could be obsessive in his hobbies, including gardening and listening to classical music. He carried around yellow pads to record ideas as they formed. \u201cHe always told me not to work too hard,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich was interesting because he was a workaholic.\u201d\n\nWrite to James R.
