The spacecraft completed its 16th close flyby of the giant planet this past October, revealing some of our best glimpses yet at its fascinating atmospheric processes\n\nThe image was taken just after 5:00 p.m. EDT on October 29th, during Juno\u2019s 16th flyby.\n\nAt the time, NASA says Juno was \u2018about as close to Jupiter as San Francisco is to Chicago.\u2019 This, the agency notes, \u2018is quite close when racing over a planet that's 11 times wider than Earth.\u2019\n\nThe image was processed by citizen scientist Bj\u00f6rn J\u00f3nsson, who used data from the craft\u2019s JunoCam to create the captivating color-enhanced view of the clouds.\n\nLast week, NASA shared a look at another stunning feature spotted during Juno's 16th flyby - a huge cloud that takes on the appearance of a dolphin.\n\nThe cloud was spotted amid bands of clouds spanning the planet\u2019s southern hemisphere back in October, when Juno came about 11,400 to 31,700 miles (18,400 to 51,000 kilometers) from the planet's cloud tops.\n\nAccording to NASA, the images were taken between 5:26 p.m. and 5:46 p.m. ET on October 29.\n\nThey were later processed by citizen scientists Brian Swift and Se\u00e1n Doran.\n\nThe image shows the 'changing cloud formations across Jupiter's southern hemisphere,' NASA explains.\n\nA breathtaking new image series captured by NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft has revealed a look at a dolphin-shaped cloud that appears to be jumping through Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere. It can be seen in the image above, just to the right of center\n\nWHAT IS NASA'S JUNO MISSION TO JUPITER? The Juno probe reached Jupiter in 2016 after a five-year, 1.8 billion-mile journey from Earth The Juno probe reached Jupiter on July 4, 2016, after a five-year, 1.8 billion-mile (2.8bn km) journey from Earth. Following a successful braking manoeuvre, it entered into a long polar orbit flying to within 3,100 miles (5,000 km) of the planet's swirling cloud tops. The probe skimmed to within just 2,600 miles (4,200 km) of the planet's clouds once a fortnight - too close to provide global coverage in a single image. No previous spacecraft has orbited so close to Jupiter, although two others have been sent plunging to their destruction through its atmosphere. To complete its risky mission Juno survived a circuit-frying radiation storm generated by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. The maelstrom of high energy particles travelling at nearly the speed of light is the harshest radiation environment in the Solar System. To cope with the conditions, the spacecraft was protected with special radiation-hardened wiring and sensor shielding. Its all-important 'brain' - the spacecraft's flight computer - was housed in an armoured vault made of titanium and weighing almost 400 pounds (172kg). The craft is expected to study the composition of the planet's atmosphere until 2021.\n\n'A cloud in the shape of a dolphin appears to be swimming through the cloud bands along the South Temperate Belt.'\n\nThe Juno mission has been churning out stunning photos of the gas giant planet ever since it arrived to its orbit in 2016.\n\nLast month, NASA shared another look at its swirling clouds, which take on dream-like appearance of an oil painting. The photo showed storms in Jupiter's dynamic North North Temperate Belt.\n\n'Appearing in the scene are several bright-white 'pop-up' clouds as well as an anticyclonic storm, known as a white oval,' NASA said.\n\n'A multitude of magnificent, swirling clouds in Jupiter's dynamic North North Temperate Belt are captured.'\n\nIt captures the intensity of the jets and vortices in Jupiter's North North Temperate Belt. The clouds are likely made of ammonia-ice crystals, or possibly a combination of ammonia ice and water, NASA says.", "description": "The spacecraft completed its 16th close flyby of the giant planet this past October, revealing some of our best glimpses yet at its fascinating atmospheric processes.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/10/22/7256876-0-image-a-43_1544479719940.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-10"}
