The whole thing was a huge concern for my parents though \u2013 there was a point they were told I might not walk again.\u201d\n\nBecause of her age \u2013 the majority of arthritis sufferers are over 40 \u2013 doctors struggled to diagnose Laura\u2019s condition and she was pumped with antibiotics to clear the infection.\n\n\u201cNothing they tried was working,\u201d says Laura.\n\n\u201cEven once I was back at school I would have to take nine or 10 pills a day.\n\n\"It was almost 18 months before they worked out I had septic arthritis, caused by a strain of bacteria that infects the joint. They hadn\u2019t thought of it because it was unusual to happen at such a young age.\n\n\u201cFinally, they were able to give me the correct medication but it had taken so long to get there I was left with permanent arthritis in my knee.\n\n\"All the \u00adantibiotics had wiped my immune system as well. It still isn't very strong now.\u201d\n\nLaura, who is now eight months pregnant with her first child, has always been determined the condition wouldn\u2019t hold her back.\n\nShe still has pain in her right knee, particularly if she \u201coverdoes it\u201d, but she ran the London Marathon in April shortly after she discovered she was \u00adpregnant.\n\n\u201cMy knee really suffered for that, but usually I only need occasional over-the-counter pain relief, nothing special,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cI was so poorly when I was young that I feel lucky to be able to move and enjoy sport.\n\n\"I know how \u00adimportant it is to my mental health, so I\u2019d rather move and get pain and endorphins from exercising than not.\n\n\u201cI love CrossFit, but while I\u2019ve been pregnant I\u2019ve been doing a lot more swimming.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, being able to support Harry through his own arthritis journey has been cathartic for both of them.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly there is a process that anyone having a setback goes through \u2013 psychologically it\u2019s challenging \u2013 so it was nice to be able to help him,\u201d she says.\n\n(Image: Can Nguyen/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons Laura is supporting Versus Arthritis\u2019 #PainNoFilter social media campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are all guilty of thinking we can\u2019t talk about our pain because there are others experiencing worse.\n\n\u201cArthritis is often dismissed as it\u2019s invisible, so having open conversations is important.\n\n\"We need to get people talking to help everyone find ways to deal with their pain without letting it define us.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Laura, 29, was just nine when she first started experiencing symptoms of arthritis and quickly needed a wheelchair", "authors": ["Amy Packer", "Molly Pike", "Image", "Pr Pic", "Can Nguyen Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666138.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_R_Laura-234813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
