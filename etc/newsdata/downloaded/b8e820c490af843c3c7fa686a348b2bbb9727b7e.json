Mandatory credit Kyodo/via\n\nSnead was 52 when he clinched his final tour victory in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1965, while Woods has matched the mark at age 43, and seems destined to break it and then some as long as his fragile body holds up.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a big number,\u201d Woods said after shooting a closing three-under-par 67 that was enough to hold off a challenge from Hideki Matsuyama at Narashino Country Club in the first PGA Tour event played in Japan.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately I went through some rough patches with my back and didn\u2019t play for a number of years, so that record (of Snead\u2019s) seemed like it was out of reach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about consistency and doing it for a long period of time. Sam did it into his 50s and I\u2019m in my early to mid 40s.\n\n\u201cAs far as playing until 52, I hope that\u2019s the case. If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would have given you a different answer, but certainly the future looks brighter than it has and hopefully I can be as consistent as he was well into my 40s and early 50s.\u201d\n\nWoods, who had to play seven holes on Monday in the weather-affected event, finished at 19-under 261 in his first tournament since undergoing arthroscopic left knee surgery two months ago.\n\nIt was the latest in a long list of surgeries for Woods, including a 2017 spinal fusion that fixed searing back and leg pain and resurrected a career that appeared destined to end prematurely.\n\nIt took 23 years for Woods to tie Snead\u2019s record. His first victory came in Las Vegas in 1996, in his fifth start as a professional, and his list of 82 wins includes 15 major championships, the most recent at the Masters at Augusta National in April.\n\nHis 2019 performances post-Masters had been mediocre, something he attributes to knee pain that also affected his back and his swing.\n\n\u201cThe knee wasn\u2019t allowing me to rotate and because of that it put more stress on my lower back and hip,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know I\u2019d come back and play at this level but the fact I could get down and read putts again is something I hadn\u2019t done in months. Something pretty subtle makes a difference. I felt more comfortable with my putter just because I was able to make a better stance.\n\n\u201cIronically my back has been less sore. I\u2019ve been able to rotate better. The way I started this week, who would have thought, bogeying the first three holes, I\u2019d shoot the number I shot. I made a few mistakes this week but they weren\u2019t bad.\u201d\n\nSLEEPY START\n\nWoods resumed at 7.30 a.m. on Monday with a three-shot advantage over Matsuyama, and took a while to find his stride, making a bogey right off the bat after dumping his approach shot into a bunker at the par-four 12th.\n\nBut he held on and a 10-foot birdie at the par-five 18th put the cherry on the cake for Woods, who reacted in understated fashion as though it was just another day in the office, perhaps more relieved than elated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week, five days at the top of the board is a long time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely stressful.\u201d", "description": "Tiger Woods won the Zozo Championship by three strokes on Monday, matching Sam Snead's record of 82 PGA Tour victories before saying he hoped to be playing at the highest level at the same ripe old age as the man whose mark he now shares.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445785287&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0JZ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
