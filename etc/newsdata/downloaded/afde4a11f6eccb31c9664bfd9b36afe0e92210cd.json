Subsequent reports have indicated the White House did take \u201cremarkable steps\u201d to prevent Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders from being made available to White House officials.\n\nAccording to the second Tuesday report, at least one National Security Council official and a number of White House aides and lawyers were alarmed after the call and were aware that it might have overstepped the bounds of normal foreign policy.\n\nTrump had ordered that almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine be withheld roughly a week before his phone call with Zelensky. During the conversation, Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate unsubstantiated allegations that Biden used his power as vice president during the Obama administration to kill an investigation into a gas company for which his son worked.\n\nA National Security Council official alerted White House lawyers about concerns over potential fallout from the call, CNN reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAs concern mounted at the White House, national security lawyers initially moved to block access to a transcript of the call by storing it in a code-word classified server, a move usually reserved for the most sensitive materials pertaining to national security.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing in his negotiations with Ukraine, calling all his conversations with the country\u2019s leaders \u201cperfect.\u201d The president also dismissed the first whistleblower\u2019s complaint because he said it contained only secondhand knowledge.\n\nA second whistleblower who is believed to have firsthand knowledge of the allegations has since come forward to speak with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.", "description": "The president's July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly sent shockwaves through the White House.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cf64d210000a807ac74c7.jpeg?cache=muadhor9rz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
