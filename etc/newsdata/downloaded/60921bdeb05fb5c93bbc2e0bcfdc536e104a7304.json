The Treasury Department published the plan Thursday and submitted it to President Donald Trump, who called for it in March.\n\nToday, @USTreasury released a housing finance reform plan which will protect American taxpayers and help more people achieve the American Dream of buying a home.

Together they guarantee roughly half of the $10 trillion U.S. home loan market. While the two companies have become profitable since their 2008 rescue and repaid their bailouts, the Treasury said in its report that \"the housing finance system is in serious need of reform.\"\n\n\"Although they remain critical to the functioning of that system, they are not yet subject to capital and other regulatory requirements tailored to the risks they pose to financial stability,\" the report said. \"This lack of reform has left taxpayers exposed to future bailouts.\"\n\nThe administration initially looked to Congress for legislation to overhaul the housing finance system and return the companies, which are operating under so-called government conservatorships, to private shareholders. But Congress hasn't acted, and now officials say they will take administrative action for the core change, ending the Fannie and Freddie conservatorships.\n\nThe new plan would make the companies privately owned yet government \"sponsored\" companies again. Their profits would no longer go to the Treasury but would be used to build up their capital bases as a cushion against possible future losses.\n\nWhat are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?\n\nBefore the Great Depression of the 1930s, financing for mortgages was mainly provided by life insurance companies, banks and thrifts, with little government support. Fannie was created in 1938 to buy loans issued by the Federal Housing Administration. Freddie was established in 1989.\n\nThey are called government-sponsored enterprises. Before they were taken over in 2008, they were private companies but still enjoyed an implicit guarantee that the government would step in and rescue them if they failed. That's what happened after the collapse of the housing market and the wave of mortgage defaults.\n\nThe companies don't make home loans. They buy them from banks and other lenders, and bundle them into securities, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors. Because the companies are under government control, investors are eager to snap up the \"safe\" securities.\n\nAnd because Fannie and Freddie stand behind nearly half of U.S. home loans, they're important to homeowners and potential buyers though people may not see their footprint.\n\nWhat's behind the push to privatize?\n\nAdministration officials say the government should have only a limited role in housing finance, and that the current system leaves taxpayers exposed to potential bailouts again. Some lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, agree with that view.\n\nYale economics professor Robert Shiller, the Nobel Memorial Prize-winner famous for calling the mid-2000s housing bubble, said he had not read the details of the government's reform plan, but noted on Friday that there has long been a debate around the government's involvement in housing. \"There's a question whether the government should be in it long-term,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is not American, to have the government investing in homes.\"\n\nOn Thursday, senior Treasury officials told reporters that the government's far-reaching power in this area means the Federal Housing Finance Agency can determine who gets a home mortgage, the price and terms of the loan, how it is made and then serviced and what happens if a borrower defaults.\n\nThe administration's proposed overhaul of housing finance \"will protect taxpayers and help Americans who want to buy a home,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \"An effective and efficient federal housing finance system will also meaningfully contribute to the continued economic growth under this administration.\"\n\nWhat is the administration proposing?\n\nThere are nitty-gritty details of housing finance in the plan, but the central change is ending the conservatorships. Officials haven't given a timeline for the administrative action.\n\nMark Calabria, the director of the FHFA, indicated recently that it wouldn't be any time soon, and likely after 2020. Some conditions will have to be met for the companies to be \"ready to exit,\" he said. They include ensuring the companies have sufficient capital to operate, and to continue on their own in the event of a severe economic downturn.\n\nOther changes outlined in the plan would have to be approved by Congress. They include replacing Fannie and Freddie's affordable housing goals with more \"tailored support\" for first-time homebuyers and low- and moderate-income borrowers.\n\nWhat do critics say?\n\nSome critics have expressed concern that the new capital requirements for the companies could cause them to increase their fees for guaranteeing mortgages, potentially raising borrowing costs for homebuyers.\n\nSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, called the new plan \"another industry giveaway that would destabilize the economy ... and limit access to mortgages for working people across the country.\"\n\n\"President Trump's housing plan will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get,\" Brown said in a statement.\n\nAdministration officials acknowledge it's hard to predict what the impact on borrowing costs would be. But they maintain that by removing government restrictions, the plan would likely expand the supply of mortgages and possibly lower costs.", "description": "Administration wants to return bailed-out mortgage finance giants to private ownership -- here's what that means to you", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/11/07/f43d4f23-4782-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/83875957b2cc0f4794a8520796490cdb/Fannie-Mae-HQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
