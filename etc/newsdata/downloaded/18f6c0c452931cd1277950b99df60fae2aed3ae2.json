It has urged the global community to intervene, and said Kashmiris were being treated like animals.\n\nKashmir, already one of the world\u2019s most heavily militarised regions, was flooded with extra troops and placed under curfew ahead of its loss of special status. Thousands of people have reportedly been arrested as part of a security crackdown.\n\nMost travel restrictions have since been removed, but mobile and internet services remain suspended.\n\nKhan said India\u2019s actions would radicalise Kashmiris and increase the likelihood of a terrorist attack. \u201cThere will be a reaction to this, Pakistan will be blamed, two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face like we came in February,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf a conventional war starts, anything could happen. But supposing a country seven times smaller than its neighbour is faced with a choice: either you surrender or you fight for your freedom till death. We will fight and when a nuclear-armed country fights to the end it will have consequences far beyond the borders, it will have consequences for the world.\u201d\n\nHis speech came shortly after an address in New York by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who did not mention Kashmir but said his country wanted peace and harmony. Modi\u2019s comments instead focused on the India\u2019s efforts to protect the environment and development issues such as healthcare.\n\nHe also called for unity in tackling terrorism, adding that India\u2019s \u201cvoice against terrorism to alert the world about its evil rings with seriousness and outrage\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday the senior US diplomat for south Asia called for a calming of rhetoric between India and Pakistan, saying Washington hoped to see rapid action by India to lift restrictions on Kashmir and the release of detainees there.\n\nThe two countries came to the brink of war in February after a suicide bomber blew up a convoy of more than 40 Indian soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region.\n\nResidents of Indian-controlled Kashmir expressed hope that the UN speeches would turn world attention to the unprecedented lockdown in the region.\n\n\u201cWe really hope these leaders will do something to rid us of conflict and suppression,\u201d said Nazir Ahmed, a schoolteacher on the outskirts of Srinagar. \u201cConflict is like a cancer hitting every aspect of life. And Kashmiris have been living inside this cancer for decades now.\u201d\n\nAs the two leaders spoke on Friday, large duelling protests supporting and opposing India\u2019s action in Kashmir were taking place across the street from the UN headquarters.\n\nDonald Trump has offered to mediate if both Pakistan and India agree to it, but Delhi has always refused outside mediation. Modi has presented his actions in Indian-controlled Kashmir as essential to counter separatism and terrorism, which he accuses Pakistan of fomenting.", "description": "Imran Khan tells UN assembly \u2018two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face\u2019", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd059b911bc8dd67bb50d8088ea4502a4068414/0_210_3396_2038/master/3396.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0e137e33afd182488bf5ed4a3fb89fa", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
