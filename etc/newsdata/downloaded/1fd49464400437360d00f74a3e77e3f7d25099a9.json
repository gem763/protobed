(AP) - Bikes with small rechargeable electric motors that are gaining in popularity would be regulated in a new way under a bill scheduled to pass the Wisconsin Legislature.\n\nThe measure up for a vote Tuesday in the state Senate changes how electric bikes, or e-bikes, are regulated under state law. Currently, they are treated as \u201cmotor bicycles,\u201d which subject them to regulations written for old fashioned gas-powered motor bikes.\n\nFor example, under current law e-bikes are banned from bike paths and operators must carry a valid driver\u2019s license.\n\nBut as sales of e-bikes have gone up, so has the effort to bring the regulation of them into line with their use.
