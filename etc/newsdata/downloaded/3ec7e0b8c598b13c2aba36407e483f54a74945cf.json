That is all fine and good but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It\u2019s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It\u2019s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.\u201d\n\nOscar-winner Francis Ford Coppola said, \u201cWhen Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration. I don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.\u201d\n\nKen Loach sums it up this way, \u201c\u201dThey\u2019re made as commodities like hamburgers, and it\u2019s not about communicating, and it\u2019s not about sharing our imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making a commodity which will make a profit for a big corporation \u2013 they\u2019re a cynical exercise. They\u2019re a market exercise, and it has nothing to do with the art of cinema.\u201d\n\nMy knee-jerk reaction to attacks on genre movies is to cry \u201csnob!,\u201d but there\u2019s some validity to this criticism, especially as it relates to Marvel, which basically reheats the same two plots over and over and over again: 1) We have to come together to save the world, uhm, again!, and 2) Please, for the love of all that is holy, not another origin movie.\n\nI myself have given some of these movies a favorable reviews while comparing them to a theme park ride. And I am getting tired of them\u2026 Would I have enjoyed Shazam! In a vacuum, in a world that is not pummeled with a dozen or so comic movies a year, half of which are origin movies? Probably. Even its off-beat sense of humor, that ironic distance thing, is growing tiresome. It felt fresh ten years and a hundred movies ago in Iron Man; enough already.\n\nObviously, you can\u2019t argue against success. These movies reliably make money and Marvel has done something never before seen: produced more than 20 box office smashes in a row. Eventually, though, audiences tire of the same old. We\u2019ve seen it a million times\u2026 Westerns, disaster movies, musicals, biblical epics, space operas, buddy movies, slasher pics, romantic comedies, raunchy comedies\u2026 Eventually, we are going to tire of the superhero genre, and maybe Scorsese, Coppola, and Loach are not being snobs.\n\nWhat I mean is, maybe as successful professionals who not only love movies, but watch and work in the industry, who make a living by eaching an audience, they sense a disturbance in the force, a change in the air, a shift in popular opinion\u2026.\n\nAren\u2019t you a little tired of these movies?\n\nAren\u2019t they starting to feel a little repetitive and empty?\n\nJoker is a comic book movie, so this might sound counter-intuitive, but maybe it\u2019s breaking all kinds of records (for an R-rated feature) because it feels so fresh, so different, like an anti-Marvel movie. There\u2019s no pretty colors, no saving the world, no obvious CGI, no aliens, no third-act, computer-generated epic battle, and no humor (unless you count the miniature golf joke , which I laughed at).\n\nCritics blasted Joke for aping other movies \u2026 that are more than 40-years-old! Meanwhile, every other comic book movie copies movies that are 40 days old.\n\nHonestly, how much are you looking forward to this next Marvel phase, which is going to feature all the same ole-same ole, but fill it with woketardery \u2014 Feminism! Gays! Transsexuals! Lady Thor! It all feels a tad oppressive to me.\n\nMaybe Scorsese and company really do dislike comic book movies, or maybe they\u2019re just sick and tired of them. Maybe we all are. I kind of hope so. I\u2019d like to move on to something else.\n\nGuess we will find out soon enough.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
