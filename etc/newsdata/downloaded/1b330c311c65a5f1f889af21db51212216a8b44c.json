He didn't look like he was in the mood for a 'quick word'... So, looking forward, what do Eddie Jones' men have to be scared of when it comes to facing the Springboks? Without wanting to fall into the classic English hubris trap, there was nothing that caught the eye, per se, but that's the point. South Africa won't be looking to dazzle and thrill next week, they'll be going for the slow, attritional approach. Victory is all that matters. The nature of the win is ultimately irrelevant. As such, Rassie Erasmus' men will relish the opportunity of an arm wrestle with England - but the Red Rose will have to tread carefully. If they get sucked into the sort of battle seen today, then the final next Saturday could go either of two ways. If they're to recreate the magic of the win over New Zealand, England need to keep play open, expansive, to make the most of their speed merchants and to get quick, rolling ball among the forwards. Although they're capable of winning a slow, sluggish game, it certainly won't play to their best attributes. Former Wales international Mike Phillips told ITV: \"I feel so sorry for them, it was such a close game, nothing in it. It was a poor game to watch, lots of poor kicking. \"The boys have been outstanding, they were in the mix right to the end and it's just a shame they couldn't get over the finishing line.\" Gareth Thomas, whose 100th and last Test match for Wales came in the 2007 World Cup, added: \"I think they've put everything on the line. \"It was a tough battle, South Africa won deservedly - you could argue Wales could have won as well. They couldn't have done any more.\"\n\nAdvertisement A stark contrast in emotions... Post-match stats and facts:\n\n- Next week's final is a repeat of the 2007 Rugby World Cup final when South Africa won 15-6. It is the third time that a final has been repeated after England v Australia (1991, 2003) and New Zealand v France (1987, 2011).\n\n- South Africa can still become the first team to win the Webb Ellis Cup despite losing a match earlier in the tournament.\n\n- This was the fourth successive Rugby World Cup in which one of the semi-finals has been won by five points or fewer. Two of the teams winning those matches lost the final but New Zealand won in 2015 after winning 20-18 against South Africa at this stage. - Alun Wyn Jones played his 142nd test match for Wales and the British & Irish Lions, equalling Sergio Parisse's record for a player from the Six Nations (ITA, 142). The only player who has played more test matches is Richie McCaw (NZL, 148). - Alun Wyn Jones became the sixth player to feature in 20 Rugby World Cup matches and the first to do so for Wales. He follows Jason Leonard (England, 22), Richie McCaw (New Zealand, 22), George Gregan (Australia, 20), Kevan Mealamu (New Zealand, 20) and Schalk Burger (South Africa, 20). - Josh Adams (WAL) scored his sixth try of Rugby World Cup 2019 and is now the competition's top scorer ahead of Mazakole Mapimpi (RSA) and Kotaro Matsushima (JPN) on five. - Handre Pollard (RSA) scored four penalty goals and a conversion, moving onto 140 RWC points and into a tie for seventh place all-time with Scotland's Chris Paterson. Wales' Jake Ball had this to say: \"We're just gutted as a team, a hell of a lot of hard work has gone in over the last five months but we've got to try and use that as motivation for the game next week.\n\n\"The boys put in a hell of an effort. If we have to look back at it, just disappointment to come so close. Sometimes we didn't have the swing of things there in that last 15 minutes but it's hard to put it all in words at the moment. A lot of the boys are down.\" Warren Gatland is currently speaking in his post-match press conference. \"We probably gave away too many penalties in our own half and that cost us dearly,\" he says. \"We never gave up and were in the arm wrestle. \"At 16-16 it was pretty close and you're dreaming of the three points going our way.\" Advertisement Looking at those stats, you've got to say there really wasn't much separating the two teams. If anything, Wales were the better on team on paper. But we know that's rarely how it works - as today proved in heart-breaking fashion.

It was a very tough encounter, and well done to South Africa\n\n\"I am proud of them, we punched massively above our weight in terms of playing numbers in Wales, we gave 100% in a close contest. But South Africa deserved to win tonight.\" Advertisement Some consolation for Josh Adams? Probably not... FULL-TIME: Wales 16-19 South Africa You have got to feel a degree of sympathy for the Welsh. They've been desperately unlucky with injuries this week. Josh Navidi and Liam Williams before the game, and then Tomas Francis and George North during the run of play. Regarding Williams, and I hate to say it, but I wonder if he could have brought something different to Wales' game plan? For all their spirit and grind, they did look a bit flat at times. You never really felt like they were going to get the better of South Africa among their backs. Instead, it was clear that this contest was going to be won up front. Had Williams been in the equation, you sense he could have provided that extra oomph in midfield. Nonetheless, I thought Leigh Halfpenny was defensively superb and his usual assertive self in the air. His kick for the try was equally impressive. It just wasn't to be. Advertisement FULL-TIME: Wales 16-19 South Africa Wales' players haven't stuck around for long. They've already headed down the tunnel after saying their thanks to the crowd. The South Africans, meanwhile, are over in one of the corners lapping it up with fans, friends and family members. They've earned this. It wasn't pretty but you can't say the Springboks don't know how to win. FULL-TIME: Wales 16-19 South Africa South Africa's bench also made a huge difference this evening. The late introduction of all those forwards seemingly swung momentum in their favour, with the Springboks subsequently coming to dominate at the scrum and line-out in the closing stages of the match. Wales, in contrast, were running on empty. The well had been sucked dry. Warren Gatland's forwards were simply unable to assert themselves or hoover up the scraps in the looser moments.
