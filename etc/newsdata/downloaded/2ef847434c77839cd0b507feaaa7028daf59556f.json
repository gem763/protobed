Once activated, critical alerts like road closures, crime reports and election results can be sent in real time\u2014though that also depends on individual notification settings.\n\nThis is helpful for citizens who live in areas that lack local news coverage, but it also puts responsibility on the user. According to Facebook, a little over 1.6 million people \u201chave opted in to receive regular local updates from Today In.\u201d That number is a far cry from the estimated 169.5 million users in 2018, as predicted by digital market research company eMarketer.\n\nDespite the limited engagement, Facebook affirmed that Today In features content from over 1,200 local news publishers every week.\n\nAPRIL 8, 2018: Phone sitting on laptop with Facebook desktop site reflecting on screen. The social media giant's stock has dipped sharply since the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA media study by the non-profit Poynter Institute in late 2018 found that more 1,300 U.S. communities have lost local news coverage. This is a dangerous precedent according to David Chavern, President and CEO of News Media Alliance.\n\n\u201cLocal news is important. It\u2019s one of the only controls for political activity. If you don\u2019t have local journalism looking over the shoulder of local politicians, that\u2019s just a recipe for corruption and criminality,\u201d Chavern told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cBut probably as or more important, local news ties communities together,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why press is mentioned in the first amendment. It\u2019s because it plays a really big role in pulling us together.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes down to why local organizations are struggling to stay in business, Chavern said it\u2019s because they no longer control the distribution of content. Instead, popular social media sites and search engines are information gatekeepers that also eat up ad revenue.\n\nKris Ruby, the CEO of New York-based public relations and social media agency, Ruby Media Group, concurred that the evolution of the digital has harmed traditional local news organizations with targeted advertisements.\n\n\u201cPeople quickly learned they could get a much better return on investment with digital advertising dollars deployed on Facebook for way less than they were spending on traditional print ads,\u201d Ruby told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cAds in local papers still play a role in brand building, but they are not the whole marketing communication pie that they once were,\u201d she explained.\n\nA Pew Research Center study found that the total estimated advertising revenue for the newspaper industry in 2018 was $14.3 billion, which is about 13 percent down from the year prior.\n\nAside from a decline in advertising dollars, Ruby added that smaller news organizations are pressured into boosting engagement on sites like Facebook and Google\u2014which sometimes impacts the quality of content readers receive. The rise of influencers may have also cut into news profits since there are people than ever vying for advertising dollars.\n\n\u201cA brand should still consider paying the quote in a local news outlet\u2019s media kit even if there are influencers who will work for less,\u201d Ruby said regarding news and media personalities who have built competing businesses.\n\nLosing out on local news is very risky Ruby added because whoever controls the news controls the narrative. A tech company like Facebook is dependent on algorithms that may unconsciously hold a bias.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, [users] had access to all information on both sides and could decide for themselves. That\u2019s no longer an option if big tech makes publishing decisions,\u201d Ruby explained.\n\nShe added: \u201cPlus, Facebook has gone back and forth on what their role really is. Are they a media company? Are they a publishing platform? They have yet to take a definitive stance.\u201d\n\nWhen Today In launched in late 2018, Facebook rolled it out to 400 cities in the U.S. and even implemented an international test in Australia. The recently announced expansion won\u2019t make its way to large metro areas, however.\n\nAccording to a report from the Associated Press, population density and abundant news coverage makes difficult to provide relevant current events. \u201cA big local story in Brooklyn, for instance, might be irrelevant in the same borough just a few miles away,\u201d the report explained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMoreover, Facebook\u2019s Today In won\u2019t be sharing ad revenue or paying licensing fees to participating news organizations. But, rather it aims to direct referral traffic. This isn\u2019t ideal, according to Chavern of News Media Alliance.\n\nHe pointed out that Facebook and similar outlets pay licensing fees to the music industry, but they \u201cuniquely won\u2019t pay for news content.\u201d\n\nChavern also added that Apple News implements a similar tactic.\n\n\u201cA lot of people consume news on Apple News. And interestingly enough Apple News drives a lot of traffic to publishers, but because of all the rules, it almost drives no money for these publisher,\u201d he said. \u201cInformation may want to be free but reporters like to get paid.\u201d", "description": "Facebook's news initiative Today In is being expanded to over 6,000 cities and towns.
