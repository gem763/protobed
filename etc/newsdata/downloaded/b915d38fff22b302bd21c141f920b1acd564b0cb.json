Companies connected with him owned a share of the economic rights of Tevez and Mascherano, breaking Premier League rules\n\nTevez and Javier Mascherano were signed from Corinthians, in Brazil, in August 2006, but a share of their economic rights remained with companies connected to his agent, Kia Joorabchian.\n\nThis only came to light, however, when Mascherano joined Liverpool five months later.\n\nThe Premier League to set up an independent commission. West Ham pleaded guilty and were hit with a record fine of \u00a35.5million. They did not appeal.\n\nCrucially, no points were deducted and Tevez was allowed to play on. It remains unclear when - or even if - the unlawful contract was terminated.\n\nThey seemed destined to go down anyway. A defeat against Tottenham two days after they were charged left them 10 points adrift of safety with the worst goal difference in the league and only nine games to play.\n\nTevez inspired West Ham to a great escape from relegation, scoring here against Bolton\n\nTevez celebrates after scoring for West Ham against Tottenham at Upton Park in 2007\n\nWest Ham chairman Eggert Magnusson presents Tevez with the club's player of the year award\n\nThen they started winning. And they won seven of the last nine games, and all of the last four, culminating in victory at Manchester United on the final day when Tevez scored the only goal.\n\nSheffield United needed only a draw to stay up but lost at home to Wigan in their last game and crashed back into the Championship after only one season.\n\nMcCabe set off in search of justice. He lost his initial appeal but was encouraged when the panel said they would 'in all probability' have 'deducted points from West Ham' but were powerless to change the penalty.\n\nThe next step was an independent arbitration tribunal set up by the FA and this did find in Sheffield United's favour in September 2008.\n\nChairman of the tribunal Lord Griffiths said there was 'no doubt West Ham would have secured three fewer points... if Carlos Tevez had not been playing.'\n\nWest Ham were still in the Premier League and banked \u00a336.8m in broadcasting rights alone as they finished 10th in 2007/08.\n\nBut their owners had been engulfed by the financial crash - Gudmundsson was declared bankrupt in 2009 owing nearly \u00a3600m - and the club was haemorrhaging millions through a reckless business plan with lucrative deals including ill-judged signings such as Kieron Dyer and Freddie Ljungberg.\n\nWest Ham chairman Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson suffered heavily in the Icelandic banking crash, and had the club not struck the right compensation deal it could have spelled doom\n\nMcCabe was well aware of the problems. Not only were his real estate company Scarborough Group tied up with another Icelandic bank but one of his senior directors was a big West Ham fan and the company hired a corporate box at Upton Park.\n\nDuxbury, now chief executive at Watford, and Igoe struck a deal with McCabe reported at the time to be worth around \u00a315m with an additional \u00a35m if the London club was sold within a year, which it was.\n\nThe key for West Ham was that this figure would be paid in instalments over four years. The deal was signed at the Connaught House Hotel in Mayfair and both sides toasted the end of an ordeal with beers in a nearby pub.\n\n'We had developed a good relationship with Scott and Nick and were able to achieve a sensible financial solution and protect the future of West Ham,' said McCabe.\n\nSheffield United spent a dozen years exiled from the Premier League - six of them in the third tier - and the resentment over Tevez festered among some players, staff members and fans.\n\nWhen the clubs met at Upton Park in the League Cup in 2014, and the Blades caused an upset by winning on penalties, the two sets of supporters spent much of the night baiting each other.\n\nThe theme can be expected to continue with Hammers fans planning to taunt the visitors by wearing Tevez masks on Saturday.\n\nWest Ham fans wear Tevez masks to mock Sheffield United during a League Cup game in 2014\n\nUnited had the last laugh that night by winning the second-round tie on penalties\n\nMcCabe did eventually lead his club back to the top flight this year although he returned in the midst of another legal fight; one that went against him last month when a High Court judge ordered him to sell his remaining 50 per cent stake to co-owner Prince Abdullah.\n\nHe is no longer at the helm as Sheffield United travel to face West Ham as equals for the first since November 2006, when they were the opposition for the first game of the Icelandic era at Upton Park.\n\nNew chairman Eggert Magnusson promised a bright and exciting future and performed a jig in the stands to celebrate the winner scored by Hayden Mullins, who was preferred to Mascherano in midfield.\n\nAs for Tevez, he was substituted after 66 minutes and replaced by 40-year-old Teddy Sheringham.\n\nHe reacted to this ignominy by storming down the tunnel, jumping into his car and driving straight home before the game ended.
