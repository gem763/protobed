Dr Vijay Limaye, climate change fellow at the National Resources Defense Council\n\n'The air contains a complex mixture of gases and tiny solid particles [produced] when wood burns,' Dr Limaye said.\n\n'Those small particles bypass our natural defense mechanisms whether it's coughing, sneezing or swallowing.'\n\nBecause of how small they are, PM2.5 particles stay in the air longer than heavy particles, increasing the risk of us inhaling them.\n\nTheir tiny diameter allows these bits of material to get deep into the lungs, becoming lodged in the tissue there, and potentially entering the circulatory system.\n\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 0 to 12 ug/m3 is viewed as little to no risk.\n\nWildfires often leave the air with levels of PM2.5 above 35 ug/m3 - nearly three times what the EPA considers acceptable for human health.\n\n'[The particles] enter the lungs and bloodstream and infect a whole damage of systems in the body,' said Dr Limaye.\n\n'There's a lot of strong epidemiology on links to heart attacks, lung disease, asthma and emphysema.'\n\nA study published earlier this year, led by Imperial College London, found that PM2.5 pollution caused 30,000 deaths in the continental US between 1999 and 2015, mostly from secondary conditions such as asthma and heart attacks.\n\nAnd an October 2018 study found that PM2.5 exposure could raise the risks of mouth cancer by up to 40 percent.\n\nClimate Readiness Institute program director Bruce Riordan says wildfire smoke also contains other pollutants such as hydrogen cyanide.\n\nHydrogen cyanide, also known as hydrocyanic acid, is a highly volatile liquid or gas that is colorless or pale blue.\n\nInhaling the toxic gas can deprive nearly every organ in the body - including the brain, heart and lungs - of oxygen according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nWithout sufficient oxygen, the tissues of these vital organs will begin to die.\n\nHydrogen cyanide is rapidly absorbed by the lungs and can result in death within minutes if supplemental oxygen is not administered.\n\nCALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD TIPS ON AVOIDING AIR POLLUTION 1. Stay inside and try to keep air inside home clean by closing doors and windows and turning off AC 2. Use high efficiency filters for HVAC systems 3. Don't run swamp coolers and house fans 4. Limit outdoors activity when the air quality is poor 5. If the air pollution is really bad, get a respirator mask, such as an N95\n\nThis is not just a concern for residents within the immediate vicinity of the fires.\n\nAccording to a 2013 report from the NRDC, the area affected by smoke exposure is 50 times larger than the area burned.\n\nFor example, the smoke of the Camp Fire in 2018 extended 150 to 200 miles beyond the area it burned in Northern California's Butte County.\n\nAnd currently in Imperial County, affected by the Kincade Fires, the Air Quality Index is 163 - marked a as 'Unhealthy for everyone.'\n\nOn a typical day, it's about twice as low at 60, which is marked 'Good'.\n\n'This draws attention to a problem that may seem isolated and acute, but affects millions of people in the country,' said Dr Limaye.\n\nRiordan and his wife are two of those people.\n\nThe couple lived southwest of the Camp Fire, and Riordan says they both developed chronic conditions in the aftermath.\n\n'We've never had any serious problems with cardiovascular health and we both have inhalers now because the smoke lasted several days and we didn't take care enough to protect ourselves,' he told DailyMail.com\n\nWithin a month of the Camp Fire's first flames, both Riordan and his wife developed coughs.\n\n'Mine didn't even go away for several months and hers still lingers,' he said.\n\n'I don't have to use [my inhaler] often but my wife is a landscaper so she has to use her regularly [because] physical exertion brings it on - and we got off easy.'\n\nIn the coming years, it's all but inevitable that more and more Californians will be exposed to pollutants left behind by increasingly common wildfires, causing not just acute but chronic health problems.\n\nClimate change is fueling more wildfires and longer seasons as temperatures rise, changes in seasonal rainfall patterns shift, snow melts earlier in the year and soil loses critical moisture.\n\nAccording to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the average wildfire season is 78 days longer.\n\nAnd a study from Columbia University published earlier this year found the annual burned area in California increased five\u2010fold during 1972 to 2018, mainly due to summer forest fires.\n\n'These fire events are so-called exceptional events, and they're becoming less and less exceptional,' said Dr Limaye.", "description": "DailyMail.com spoke to two climate activists who explained the devastating health effects of breathing in wildfire smoke, including tiny particles that increase the risk of heart disease, asthma and cancer.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/17/20289034-0-image-a-33_1572285559945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
