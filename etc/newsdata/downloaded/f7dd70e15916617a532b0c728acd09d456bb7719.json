We are committed to transition New Jersey to 100% clean energy by 2050,\" Murphy said.\n\nPennEast obtained approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to build the pipeline in January 2018 and promptly sued in federal court to use the federal government's eminent domain power to gain access to 131 properties along the route in New Jersey under the U.S. Natural Gas Act.\n\nNew Jersey did not consent to PennEast's condemnation suits on properties it controls. The state holds interests in most of the properties through easements requiring the land be preserved for recreational, conservation or agricultural use.\n\nPennEast needs the land to build its 120-mile (190-km) pipeline, which is designed to deliver gas from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nPatricia Kornick, a spokeswoman for PennEast, said the company \"is confident the legal actions will be resolved favorably and the long-standing legal precedent under which FERC has operated ... will be upheld.\"\n\nThe company has said it anticipates starting construction on the pipeline in 2020.\n\nThe companies seeking to build the PennEast pipeline include units of New Jersey Resources Corp (NJR), South Jersey Industries Inc (SJI), Southern Co, Enbridge Inc and UGI Corp.\n\nThe companies with contracts to use the project include units of NJR, SJI, Southern, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc and Consolidated Edison Inc.\n\nPennEast is not the only gas pipeline facing state opposition in the U.S. Northeast. Two of Williams Cos Inc's proposed pipelines are facing state opposition, including Constitution in New York and Northeast Supply Enhancement in New Jersey.\n\n(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Chris Reese and Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy tweeted on Friday that state environmental regulators denied a permit that PennEast Pipeline Co needed to build its proposed $1 billion natural gas pipe from Pennsylvania to New Jersey.
