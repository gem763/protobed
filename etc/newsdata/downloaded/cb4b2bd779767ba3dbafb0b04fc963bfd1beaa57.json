They also called for laws to seek to confront racism and white nationalism, given the alleged assailant in the El Paso shooting was \u201cdriven by racial hatred\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The 86th session, which started on January 8, ended on May 28, and legislators are not scheduled to sit again until January 12 2021.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It also has the second highest number of presidential electoral college votes. Political scientists say while the decision to only meet every other year may initially have been made because of the vast distances legislators were required to travel, it underscored an antipathy among many Texans towards politics and politicians.\n\nThe last Democratic president to win Texas was Jimmy Carter in 1976, and the party has not held a statewide seat since the 1990s. Yet, Democrats made gains in the 2018 midterms and believe they could flip more seats in the House of Representatives in 2020. The party also hopes to take control of the state legislature, which plays a crucial role in drawing up electoral districts, which in recent years have heavily favoured Republicans.\n\nMr Abbott\u2019s office said he had not ruled out recalling the legislature, though he wanted to avoid a session that resulted only in arguing.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

According to the Texas Tribune, following the shootings, he also established two groups to study gun violence and extremism.\n\n\u201cGovernor Abbott made clear in Odessa that all strategies are on the table that will lead to laws that make Texans safer,\u201d said spokesperson, John Wittman.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats who are part of today\u2019s partisan pitch, can be part of the bipartisan legislative process\u2026that is geared towards achieving real solutions, or they can be part of politics as usual that will accomplish nothing.\u201d\n\nCritics of Mr Abbott, who has a \u201ctriple A\u201d rating from the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA), a gun industry and users lobbying group, say he has been slow to address gun violence, and blocked efforts to regulate firearms. After the El Paso shooting, he described the incident as one of the of the \u201cdeadliest days in history of Texas\u201d.\n\nThe Giffords Law Centre to Prevent Gun Violence, a California group that works to regulate guns, says Texas has some of the nation\u2019s most relaxed gun regulations. The group says research shows states with tougher laws suffer fewer shooting deaths.\n\nIt ranks Texas as having the 34th strongest gun laws out of 50, and places it at 27 in terms of gun deaths. It ranks it with an \u201cF\u201d.\n\n\u201cTexas did not enact any firearm-related legislation in 2018. The state has very weak gun safety laws and is a major exporter of crime guns,\u201d says the group. \u201cTo raise its grade above an F and save lives from gun violence, Texas should pass universal background checks, prohibit hate crime offenders from accessing guns, and repeal its dangerous campus carry law.\u201d\n\nVeteran observers of Texas politics say there may be other reasons Mr Abbott does not want to recall the legislature. Last month, the Republican speaker, Dennis Bonnen, was caught on tape apparently asking a far right activist, Michael Quinn Sullivan, to help undermine some of his own colleagues. Mr Bonnen has issued an apology, but the Texas Rangers have launched a probe.\n\nHarvey Kronberg, publisher of the Quorum Report, a widely read website that focusses on Texas state politics, said: \u201cOne of the reasons Abbott doesn\u2019t want to do it, is that if the legislature is recalled, Bonnen may be forced from the chair.\u201d\n\nJanet and Michael Hoffman, who were visiting Austin from New Jersey, which has some of the nation\u2019s tougher gun laws, were recently walking in the grounds of the domed Capitol building. They said Texans had a reputation for their outsized love of guns.\n\n\u201cGuns need to be regulated,\u201d said Mr Hoffman. \u201cThere used to be common sense measures that were backed by Republicans.\u201d", "description": "Texas\u2019s Republican governor is refusing to recall the state legislature to consider measures to tackle gun violence - even though it only meets every other year.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/18/abbott-recall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
