He added a late single for good measure as the Astros pulled even.\n\nA day earlier, the regular season MVP candidate was hitless in five-bats, stranding six runners and plunging him to 1 for 13 in the Series. Bregman wasn't daunted - that's not his personality, he's definitely among the most self-assured players in baseball.\n\nBregman said he felt good swings coming. Asked about his teammate, Michael Brantley echoed that.\n\nHouston Astros' Alex Bregman watches his grand slam against the Washington Nationals during the seventh inning of Game 4 of the baseball World Series Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in Washington.

I can't wait to see him come out tomorrow, I'm ready,\" he said, adding for all to hear, \"You be ready, too.\"\n\nIt didn't take long - Bregman pounced on the first pitch he saw, and the Astros led the rest of the way.\n\nBregman delivered in a ballpark where he's had success, and in a city where his family has a legacy.\n\nLast year, Bregman's leadoff home run in the 10th inning at Nationals Park sent the American League to an 8-6 win and earned him the All-Star Game MVP award.\n\nA half-century ago, his grandfather was general counsel for the Washington Senators, the team that moved to become the Texas Rangers for the 1971 season, leaving the nation's capital without the national pastime until the Montreal Expos came in 2005.\n\nThe 25-year-old third baseman hit 41 homers with 112 RBIs this season. But with the Astros aiming to add to the championship they won in 2017, he'd been stuck in neutral this week, aside from a home run in a 12-3 loss in Game 2. Even his usually sure-handed defense at third base had been subpar.\n\nBregman quickly got in gear.\n\nAfter Jos\u00e9 Altuve and Brantley singled with one out in the first off Patrick Corbin, Bregman lined a single to left-center for a 1-0 lead.\n\nYuli Gurriel followed with an RBI single, and a pocket of orange-wearing Houston fans in the third deck past the right field foul pole began their chant of \"Let's go, Astros!\"\n\nBregman ended any doubt about Houston winning with his slam, a deep drive off Fernando Rodney that easily cleared the left field wall.\n\nBregman enjoyed the trip around the bases, and Astros teammates spilled from the dugout to greet him. Back on the bench, he held up four fingers.\n\nAt that point, many Nationals fans already were filing toward the exits. And way up above the right field foul pole, the cheer got louder and louder.\n\n\"MVP! MVP!\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nHouston Astros' Alex Bregman rounds the bases after a grand slam off Washington Nationals relief pitcher Fernando Rodney during the seventh inning of Game 4 of the baseball World Series Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in Washington.
