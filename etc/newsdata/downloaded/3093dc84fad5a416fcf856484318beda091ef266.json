And the mounting deficit is generating anxiety among budget experts who fear the government will have less room for emergency spending in a future economic slump.\n\n\"This is the first time in our history that we are seeing a boom in the economy at the same time deficits are rapidly rising. It's alarming,\" Marc Goldwein, a senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Budget, told the Washington Post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned to wipe out the nation's federal debt within eight years, but has instead piled onto it with the 2017 GOP tax cut as well as ramped-up defense spending. Its a stark shift for Republicans, who tend to be thrifters with a Democrat in the White House but become big spenders when they're in power.\n\n\"Republicans talk a good game about deficit reduction when they're out of power,\" a conservative economist and senior Manhattan Institute fellow Brian Riedl previously told Business Insider. \"But once they win the White House, they prioritize the more popular policies of cutting taxes and increasing defense spending.\"\n\nAs shown in the graph below, President Barack Obama also ran up large deficits, though to stave off the nation's economic collapse during the Great Recession. He cut deficits almost in half through his later years in office, but Trump has added onto it for three years since assuming the presidency.\n\nThe federal deficit from 2001 to 2019. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider\n\nTreasury Department data for 2019 shows the government spent $4.4 trillion on its programs while drawing in $3.5 trillion in tax dollars and other revenue \u2014 leaving the $984 billion hole in its finances.\n\nThe federal deficit in the last five years (Trump years in bold):\n\n2015: $442 billion\n\n2016: $584 billion\n\n2017: $665 billion\n\n2018: $779 billion\n\n2019: $984 billion\n\nExperts say 2017 GOP tax law has been a driver of the ballooning deficit. The Congressional Budget Office projected the law would increase the annual deficit by about $200 billion over a decade, or to nearly $2 trillion after interest payments are taken into account.\n\nThe Trump administration's tax cut has helped slide tax revenues instead of pay for itself in the form of robust economic growth.", "description": "The rising deficit under Trump is fueling fears the government may have less room to act in a future economic slump.", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b05654b65072ddc3567ef?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
