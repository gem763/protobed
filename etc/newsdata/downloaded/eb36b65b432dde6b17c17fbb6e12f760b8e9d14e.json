Rejection by LSE managers and shareholders signalled concerns over giving control of an exchange to a buyer with close links to China, analysts said.\n\n\"You can well imagine if Hong Kong stock exchange makes an offer for some other developing country exchange, why wouldn't you see similar (regulatory) pushback?\" said David Blennerhassett of Ballingal Investment Advisors, who publishes research on the Smartkarma website.\n\n\"This is going to curtail their global expansion. So, that means they will look inwards for their growth going forward.\"\n\nHKEX declined to provide comment on future plans for this article, but speaking at a conference in Singapore on Wednesday, HKEX Chair Laura Cha said that while she was disappointed the deal didn't go through, the approach for the LSE was just one facet of one part of HKEX's three-pronged strategy - building on the bourse's China links, focusing on technology and international ambitions.\n\nNOT ONLY 'CONNECT'\n\nHong Kong's track record for developing China-related trading links is well documented.\n\nIt has since 2014 operated the only direct stock trading link between the mainland and the rest of the world, the so-called 'Stock Connect'. In 2017, it added a 'Bond Connect' allowing international investors access to mainland debt markets.\n\nHigh on its wishlist for future growth is opening a 'southbound' Bond Connect, allowing Chinese investors to trade bonds in Hong Kong. Opening an 'IPO Connect' allowing mainland investors direct access to Hong Kong listings is another ambition.\n\nBeyond that, Li has talked also of the potential for an 'ETF Connect', offering Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to Chinese investors.\n\n\"The LSE acquisition was about growth, but there is still potential for growth in HKEX's earlier strategy - building its fixed-income currencies and commodities products. I expect them to return to this,\" said Michael Wu, an analyst at Morningstar.\n\nAs part of this, HKEX is keen to expand the operations of its successful British acquisition - the London Metal Exchange, bought for 1.4 billion pounds ($1.71 billion) in 2012 - into Asia and China in particular.\n\n\"The LME business also has significant cost-saving opportunities and further potential to expand its commodity breadth of products, which combined should drive significant earnings growth over time, if management execute on these organic growth options,\" said Ashley Pittard, head of global equities at fund manager Pendal, a top 15 shareholder in the HKEX.\n\nIn the near-term, attention is focused on already announced plans to launch a futures contract based on MSCI's mainland China index - which would be the first internationally traded contract based on the MSCI benchmark, a key gauge for global emerging markets investors.", "description": "Hong Kong stock exchange boss Charles Li ignited his unrequited overture to the London Stock Exchange with a riff on Romeo and Juliet as a corporate romance, and doused it in a wistful blog reference to the author of 'Alice in Wonderland'.
