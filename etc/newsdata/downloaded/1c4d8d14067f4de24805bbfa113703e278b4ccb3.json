Singapore-based Bright Ruby Resources Pte Ltd. had agreed last month to buy it and an adjoining property leased to Royal Dutch Shell Plc for about 850 million pounds. It\u2019s not clear what impact WeWork\u2019s roller-coaster IPO has had on Bright Ruby\u2019s appetite for the deal, the people said.\n\nWe Co., which owns WeWork, pushed back its IPO this week to buy time to overcome concerns about its governance, slashed valuation and business prospects. The decision sent the company\u2019s bonds plunging and added a sour note to a medley of high-profile, but frequently disappointing, IPOs this year. Shortly after the announcement, WeWork made a small round of job cuts in a New York City unit.\n\nRead more: WeWork\u2019s Breakneck Growth Hits Resistance as Banks Get Cold Feet\n\nThe delay also comes at a critical time for major backer SoftBank Group Corp., which is trying to raise money for a successor to its Vision Fund. SoftBank\u2019s biggest investors, including Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, are reconsidering how much to commit to the new vehicle as the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s bet on WeWork sours.\n\nWeWork has lease obligations of $47 billion and continues to burn cash to fund its rapid expansion, putting pressure on the company to raise new capital. But the company\u2019s model of signing long leases, then renting out short-term space to members, as well as its complex relationship with co-founder Adam Neumann, have polarized investors assessing the planned offering.\n\nSkate Ramp\n\nWeWork Waterloo, originally known as Two Southbank Place, is fully leased to WeWork and boasts a skate ramp, retro arcade games and a library in its cavernous lobby. Negotiations on a sale, which were first reported by React News in August, are ongoing and there\u2019s no certainty about their outcome, one of the people said.\n\nRepresentatives of Almacantar SA, the developer selling the buildings in London\u2019s Waterloo district, and WeWork declined to comment. A representative for Bright Ruby wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment.\n\nSidra Capital was in talks to buy 70 Wilson Street near London\u2019s financial district from a venture led by Columbia Threadneedle Investments, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives of Sidra Capital, Columbia Threadneedle and WeWork declined to comment.\n\n(Adds background in fourth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Lucca de Paoli and Alfred Cang.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jack Sidders in London at jsidders@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shelley Robinson at ssmith118@bloomberg.net, Patrick Henry\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Deals for two major London buildings leased mostly to WeWork are on the ropes.Saudi Arabia-based Sidra Capital has pulled out of a 90 million-pound ($112 million) deal as the flexible-office giant\u2019s planned initial public offering got an increasingly rocky reception from investors, according", "authors": ["Jack Sidders"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fxJcmxqCs1OlUE6raq0YBg--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/5a21e89d6b4fc546c37bbfe3082ce01e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
