Ong said he was hopeful of an even bigger rise in the second half of the year.\n\nThe new committee is headed by the ministers of finance and international trade and industry and they have the authority approve incentives immediately. Ong declined to give details of the specific deals it had approved.\n\nU.S. investment topped $5.62 billion in the first half of 2019 and Ong said he expected that to pick up further.\n\nIntel Corp (INTC.O), Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) and On Semiconductor Corp (ON.O) are the lead players in Malaysia\u2019s well-established electrical & electronics (E&E) industry.\n\n\u201cWe do see re-investments coming from existing U.S. companies and new E&E players coming to Malaysia. I know of at least one company that has expressed its very serious interest to come to Malaysia. This is a new factory that will be built,\u201d he said, without identifying the company.\n\nOng said the number of investment applications from China had risen in recent months and its FDI could rise in the last six months after dipping to 5.1 billion ringgit in the first half from 5.69 billion ringgit a year earlier.", "description": "Malaysia has set up a panel to fast-track investments as it seeks to woo businesses affected by the U.S.-China trade dispute and it approved more than $500 million in new proposals this month, a government minister said.", "authors": ["Krishna N.
