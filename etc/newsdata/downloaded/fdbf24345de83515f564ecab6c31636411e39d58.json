Above is a photo of a workshop in which she demonstrates on a living person how to care for a corpse\n\nIt argued in court that MaryMoon should not have the right to use the term \u2018midwife\u2019.\n\nBut BC Supreme Court Justice Neena Sharm said that while she agreed with the college that MaryMoon was in violation of health laws, she believed the legislation to be unconstitutional since it infringes on the right to freedom of expression, according to the Vancouver Sun.\n\nSharma cited Supreme Court of Canada rulings which are \u2018very clear\u2019 in allowing protected expression so long as it does not include physical threats or threats of violence.\n\n\u2018As soon as an action is capable of communicating anything to another person, it has meaning and is protected expression,\u2019 Sharma ruled.\n\n\u2018In my view, when the respondent refers to herself as a \u201cdeath midwife\u201d there can be no doubt she is conveying meaning.\u2019\n\nThe college and the province of British Columbia argued to the court that the law should not be struck down because doing so would create confusion amongst the public as to which health professionals were regulated.\n\nMaryMoon, however, argued in her defense that historically midwivery has included end-of-life care and that the term has been co-opted and re-defined only recently.\n\nMaryMoon says that there is growing demand for 'authentic' post-death care of corpses. She runs workshops in which she demonstrates how to preserve a corpse in the days leading up to burial or cremation\n\nThe judge, Sharma, agreed, saying: \u2018The point of that evidence is to demonstrate that the word midwife is not restricted to the care of pregnant women before and during childbirth.\n\n\u2018That point is relevant because the presumed association between midwife and pregnant woman and delivery is an underlying tenet of the College\u2019s submissions.\u2019\n\nThe college said that it was still reviewing Sharma\u2019s ruling and that it was considering an appeal.\n\nMaryMoon describes \u2018death midwivery\u2019 as \u2018end of life consultations\u2019 in addition to \u2018support for the death journeyer and their families throughout the pan-death process, funeral plans, memorial celebrant services, and initial grief counseling.\u2019\n\nAccording to her web site, MaryMoon offers \u2018death journeyers\u2019 the option of \u2018elective death\u2019 either through \u2018medical aid in dying\u2019 or \u2018voluntary stopping eating and drinking.\u2019\n\nIn 2016, she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that she knew from the age of 7 that her calling in life was to care for the dying and the dead.\n\nMaryMoon said she was inspired by an old Western movie in which a pioneer woman cares for her dead husband\u2019 body.\n\n\u2018She had to clean him up herself, dig the grave, put him in, say her goodbyes, fill in the grave and carry on, and I walked away from that movie saying that's the way it should be,\u2019 she told the CBC.\n\nMaryMoon says that caring for dead loved ones, which includes cleaning the body with essential oils, using ice packs to keep the corpse cold and odor-free, and using sandwich bags filled with rice to keep the eyelids shut - is a spiritual practice.\n\nAccording to her web site, MaryMoon offers \u2018death journeyers\u2019 the option of \u2018elective death\u2019 either through \u2018medical aid in dying\u2019 or \u2018voluntary stopping eating and drinking.\u2019 The image above shows MaryMoon teaching people how to wash the hair of a corpse. The body used in the above image is of a live human being\n\n\u2018A lot of people are recognizing that there is something missing with the way we are dealing with death \u2026 even when teaching people and practicing on a pretend dead body, they get the sense of how sacred this can be,\u2019 she said.\n\nMaryMoon says she is helping to fill the demand for \u2018a more authentic experience\u2019 while trying to change perceptions of death.\n\n\u2018We have this idea in our culture that somehow one minute after it died a body is different than one minute before it died, and that's not the reality,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018There is a slight change in the colour of the skin as the blood pulls towards the back of the body, but the body does not change that much in the first three to five days.\u2019\n\nMaryMoon is attracting clients who say they are searching for a cheaper and greener alternative to the conventional practice of the funeral industry.\n\nAfter-death costs, which include death certificates and registration, transferring the body, caskets, funerals, burial plots, and ceremonies, could run as high as $20,000 per person in Canada.", "description": "Pashta MaryMoon was sued by the College of Midwives of British Columbia, Canada, which claimed that she was violating the law by using the term 'midwife' to describe her work.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/16/19335706-0-image-a-16_1570287886847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
