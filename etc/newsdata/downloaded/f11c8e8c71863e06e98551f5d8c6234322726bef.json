Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) insisted on Monday that the fluctuations were \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nThe central bank said the uptick in U.S. dollar deposits was driven by a \u201ctransfer of funds resulting in a higher amount of foreign-currency deposits placed by the Exchange Fund,\u201d which backs Hong Kong\u2019s currency peg with the greenback at 7.75-7.85.\n\nAsked by Reuters about the reason behind this transfer, a HKMA spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, that \u201cin line with past practices, we do not comment on the details of our management of the Exchange Fund.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong Dollar was trading largely flat at 7.8414 per dollar at 0514 GMT.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Charts - HK deposits by currencies, August 2019 - here)\n\n(This story has been refilled to correct throughout to make clear Goldman Sachs\u2019 report did not mention the Hong Kong protests)", "description": "Hong Kong may have lost as much as $4 billion in deposits to rival financial hub Singapore between June and August, Goldman Sachs estimated this week.", "authors": ["Noah Sin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436564009&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9209E"}
