Why debate the environmental merits of fracking when you can step on the head of the coal industry to prove your value in a carbon-constrained world?\u201d\n\nReality check: On a per-unit basis, coal creates more carbon dioxide, which is by far the most prevalent greenhouse gas, compared to oil and gas.\n\nGo deeper: With natural gas on the rise, U.S. market is moving against coal", "description": "It's ironic because coal is considered far more damaging to the climate than gas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/rdomNtXLXTbl0UKJ-rt27Pug0zY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570712268318.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
