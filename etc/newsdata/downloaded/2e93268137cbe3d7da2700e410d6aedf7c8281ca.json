REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nSterling also pulled back from its highest in five months against the euro as investors booked profit and prepared for a make-or-break summit between Britain and the EU on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe focus is on last-ditch talks that dragged on late into Tuesday night to see whether the two sides can draft an agreement on Brexit before the summit.\n\nReports the pair were getting closer to an agreement boosted sterling overnight, though traders said sterling could swing wildly because it is still unclear if Britain can avoid postponing its departure beyond Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cEven if the two sides can agree something, it is unclear if they can stick with the exit deadline,\u201d said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWhether Britain\u2019s parliament will approve whatever has been agreed is another big uncertainty.
