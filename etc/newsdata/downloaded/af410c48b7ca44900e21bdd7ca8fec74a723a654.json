And from there, stories in publications from Bustle to the New York Post.\n\n\"You know how much ink these guys are going to get from these billboards? It's every goal of every ad campaign,\" said Eric Yaverbaum, who has more than 30 years of public relations experience and heads New York-based Ericho Communications. \"It's brilliant marketing.\"\n\nNot too shabby a payoff on a freshman production that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings didn\u2019t even mention when he updated investors on the Los Gatos, California-based company\u2019s financial performance in July, saving his breath for rainmaking productions like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe satirical show, created by Ryan Murphy of \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d focuses on the fictional Payton Hobart, who\u2019s dreamed of winning the U.S. presidency since age 7 and gets his political start taking private school elections to a new level.\n\nHis mom is played by Gwynneth Paltrow, who appears on the billboards outside the USC campus. The Los Angeles-based school made headlines earlier this year when federal investigators identified it, along with institutions from Yale to Stanford, as schools where parents had paid bribes to win admission for their children.\n\nAmong those charged were actresses Felicity Huffman, who appeared in \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d and \u201cTransamerica,\u201d and Lori Loughlin, the one-time soap opera star known for her roles on \u201cFull House\u201d and Hallmark Channel movies.\n\nIronically, \"The Politician\" was written and filmed months before those events. While the timeline is somewhat unique, Netflix isn\u2019t the first firm to gain publicity by capitalizing on controversy.\n\nAthletic-shoe maker Nike has done it repeatedly, most recently with \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaigns featuring Colin Kaepernick, the face of NFL protests against police brutality, and Tiger Woods, the golf pro who overcame debilitating injuries and legal troubles to win his fifth Masters tournament in April.\n\n\"Netflix can't go wrong with this,\" Yaverbaum added. \"They have a sense of humor. They're not uptight at all about their marketing, which I don't think you can be. If you want to play it safe, you get no attention whatsoever.\"\n\nUSC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The school said in a statement earlier this month that it had dismissed two employees after the allegations and was conducting its own review while cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department.\n\n\u201cWe will take all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity of our admissions process,\u201d the university said.", "description": "For Netflix, this year's college admissions scandal was a case of life imitating art: specifically, its new show, 'The Politician.'", "authors": ["James Langford"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/01/0/0/2017-04-18T180741Z_2_LYNXMPED3H13E_3_NETFLIX-RESULTS-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
