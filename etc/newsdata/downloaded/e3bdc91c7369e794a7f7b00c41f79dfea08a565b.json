Some are about extending existing policies, while others are completely new.\n\nThey include:\n\nPhasing out all marketing, advertising and sponsorship of unhealthy food and drink\n\nBanning food and drink on local transport with exceptions for water, breast-feeding and medical conditions\n\nFree water refill to be available at all food outlets, transport stations and public sector buildings\n\nRegular car-free weekends across the country to encourage physical activity\n\nChanging planning rules to make it harder to open fast-food takeaways\n\nExtending the sugar tax to include milk-based drinks\n\nAdding VAT to unhealthy food products that are currently zero-rated, such as cakes\n\nCapping calories in food served out-of-the home to combat rising portion sizes\n\nConsider plain packaging - as for tobacco - for junk food, if firms fail to reduce sugar, fat and salt in their products quickly enough\n\nAll nurseries, registered childminders and schools to adopt water and milk-only policies\n\nHow taxing can help\n\nDame Sally said tax was an important lever for ministers.\n\nShe highlighted the success of the sugar tax - a levy which has been applied on sugary drinks since last year.\n\nFigures released last month showed that it had reduced sugar consumption by more than a fifth through a combination of people choosing lower sugar drinks and industry changing the sugar content of products.\n\nThe fall came despite an increase in sales, and means the equivalent of 30,000 tonnes of sugar a year have been taken out of the nation's diet.\n\nBut Dame Sally wants the government to go further by extending the tax to cover milk-based drinks.\n\nShe also wants some anomalies in the VAT system to be tackled.\n\nFood is generally not taxed, but some unhealthy ones are, adding 20% to the price.\n\nIt means that a gingerbread man with chocolate-covered trousers is subject to VAT, but not if it only has chocolate eyes.\n\nCakes, flapjacks and corn chips are zero-rated, but chocolate biscuits, cereal bars and crisps are not.\n\nHow advertising distorts the market\n\nUnhealthy foods are big business for advertisers.\n\nAround \u00a3300m a year is spent on promoting soft drinks, confectionery and sweet and savoury snacks - that's nearly half of the total spend on food and drink advertising.\n\nBy comparison just \u00a316m goes on fruit and vegetables.\n\nThere are already restrictions on junk food advertising on TV and online.\n\nBut Dame Sally wants to go further, calling for a complete ban on unhealthy food and drink advertising.\n\nWhat are the chances of these steps being introduced?\n\nThe government published its last obesity strategy in 2018. The goal is to halve rates by 2030.\n\nNone of the headline measures recommended by Dame Sally are part of the current measures.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock praised the work of the outgoing CMO, saying she had \"done more than anyone to promote the health of the nation\" over the past decade.\n\nHe said ministers would study the recommendations \"closely\".\n\nBut there are doubts about how reforming a government led by Boris Johnson will be in this area.\n\nHe has already expressed scepticism about so-called sin taxes such as the sugar levy, although a policy paper published just before he became prime minister did suggest the sugar levy could be extended to milk-based drinks.\n\nSally Warren, of the King's Fund think tank, said: 'The government should make full use of all the levers at its disposal to tackle obesity.\n\n\"Some politicians may baulk at the idea of the 'nanny state', but research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume.\"\n\nProfessor Dame Parveen Kumar, of the British Medical Association, said the government would \"let down\" children if it did not act.", "description": "The outgoing chief medical officer warns ministers will fail on obesity unless they take bold action.", "authors": ["Nick Triggle", "Health Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17EF4/production/_102663089_mediaitem102663086.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
