Nelloptodes gretae belongs to a group of some of the smallest known free-living animals, London's Natural History Museum said Friday.\n\nThe species is fitting for the Swedish 16-year-old. \"Many people say that Sweden is just a small country and it doesn't matter what we do,\" Thunberg once said. \"But I've learned that you are never too small to make a difference.\"\n\nNot to mention the beetle's antennae, which resemble Thunberg's signature pigtail braids.\n\n'You are never too small to make a difference.' A new species of miniature beetle has been named after @GretaThunberg, in recognition of her advocacy for climate action and protecting the natural world \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc1e https://t.co/BWMgS2VbcM \u2014 Natural History Museum (@NHM_London) October 25, 2019\n\nMichael Darby, a scientific associate at the museum who found the insect during his studies of the museum's vast collection, chose the name to honor Thunberg's contribution to saving the planet.\n\n\"I'm really a great fan of Greta,\" Darby said. \"She is a great advocate for saving the planet and she is amazing at doing it, so I thought that this was a good opportunity to recognize that.\"\n\nThe species \u2014 part of a family of beetles called Ptiliidae \u2014 can be found all over the world. However, they are relatively unknown because of their tiny size.\n\nThe beetle is less than 1 millimeter long. They have no eyes or wings and are a pale yellow and gold color.\n\nNelloptodes gretae was first discovered in Kenya in the 1960s by entomologist William Block, who donated the samples to the museum, where they have stayed ever since.\n\nThunberg has become known worldwide for her weekly climate strikes, which she started on her own in 2018. Since the, the teenager has inspired millions of people to spend their Fridays urging their governments to take action against climate change.\n\nHer movement has resulted in the largest climate protests in history.\n\n\"It is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them, because of biodiversity loss,\" Dr. Max Barclay, the museum's senior curator of beetles, told the BBC. \"So it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species.\"\n\nThunberg is in good company: Darby also named a species of Ptiliidae after Sir David Attenborough.\n\n\"I'd also like to stress that I've not named this species after Greta because it is small \u2014 it's just that this is the group that I work on,\" he said.", "description": "The golden-colored beetle belongs to a group of some of the smallest known free-living animals", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/f850cf88-a2f8-4698-8e13-11b405bbfd5f/thumbnail/1200x630/2f5303856356917da434426dfd473636/my-post-11.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
