What CP3 wants is to get minutes and compete on a team with the potential to make a deep playoff run. He had that with the Clippers and Rockets, even if those teams didn\u2019t make the deep runs he had hoped.\n\nESPN\u2019s Ryen Russillo is well connected and dropped this tidbit today on The Woj Pod (hat tip Real GM).\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI had heard he wanted to go to Milwaukee. Of course, you\u2019d want to go play with Giannis.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Giannis Antetokounmpo can draw star free agents to Milwaukee is a legitimate question, one should get answered in the coming years, one that could determine if the Bucks get a ring (or multiple rings). That CP3 might have interest is a good sign.\n\nThere\u2019s also almost no chance this happens.\n\nThe Bucks already have Eric Bledsoe and George Hill at the point, plus Antetokounmpo is going to want to have the ball in his hands a lot of the time. Both of them are under contract for this season and next, and combined they make $12 million less than Paul does by himself. Remember, CP3 had four years, $124 million left on his contract coming into this season.\n\nOn top of all that are the fit issues. The Bucks want to play fast and attack in transition, Paul wants to slow it down and survey the floor \u2014 notice how much faster the Rockets are playing with Russell Westbrook in for CP3. The list goes on and on, but you get the idea.\n\nExpect a lot of Chris Paul rumors over the course of the season. Most of them will have little, if any, chance of happening.", "description": "There's also almost no chance this happens.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HOx9PJnfWYX2nEP4V1m2PA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuNjQ-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T7lipHC7hOf.oCCIefwvQA--~B/aD01NjM7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/f8eff5c6711091edca6f78963010fa9e", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
