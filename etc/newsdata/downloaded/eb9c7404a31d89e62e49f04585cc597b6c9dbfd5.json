Turkey suspects that the U.S. is backing Kurdish aspirations for self-rule in Syria and is prepared to use military force to prevent what it perceives as an attempt to redraw the region\u2019s map.\n\nTurkey wants to act quickly before winter conditions make it difficult for tanks to operate in muddy terrain, leaving little room for a last-minute settlement with the U.S.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly called on the U.S. to join forces in expanding a previously negotiated security zone in Syria -- designed to be off-limits to American-backed Kurdish YPG forces -- while threatening an incursion if he didn\u2019t get his way by the end of last month.\n\nThe YPG, which played a leading role in the defeat of Islamic State, has been at the heart of Turkey-U.S. tensions. Turkey sees the fighters as a critical threat given their link to the separatist PKK, an autonomy-seeking Kurdish group. It\u2019s considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nErdogan wants to resettle some of the more than 3.6 million Syrians who fled their country\u2019s civil war in the buffer area to alleviate the burden on Turkey\u2019s economy and defuse social tensions over hosting the world\u2019s largest refugee population.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Cagan Koc in Istanbul at ckoc2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Onur Ant at oant@bloomberg.net, ;Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net, Andre Janse van Vuuren, James Amott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Turkey is ready to start a military operation in northern Syria to claim areas from American-backed Kurdish forces and may act \u201cas soon as today or tomorrow,\u201d President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday.\u201cWe have made our preparations, completed our operation plans,\u201d Erdogan said at", "authors": ["Cagan Koc"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/brKq3JbMQLi7xHoe_2KnHw--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ce026804fafda4918816778e50aaf17d", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
