I know what responsibility is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will come a time when I speak out on strategic issues, policy issues \u2015 that I do not have a question about. But I need to give some period of time to those who have to carry out the responsibility to protect this county in a very, very difficult age.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the time\u2019s right to speak out about policy or strategy, I\u2019ll speak out,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his new book \u201cCall Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,\u201d released Tuesday, Mattis doesn\u2019t level any attacks on Trump or his leadership, maintaining the same stance he expressed in his talk with Haass.\n\nMattis was similarly reluctant to comment on the White House during an interview with \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d that aired Monday, refusing to state whether he feels Trump is fit for office.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t make political assessments one way or the other,\u201d he said.", "description": "The former secretary of defense has remained tight-lipped about his views of the Trump administration, saying he wouldn't speak out from \"the cheap seats.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ea98a2500008d00020a9b.jpeg?cache=e4j4qnogkm&ops=1778_1000"}
