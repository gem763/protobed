You\u2019re bloody brilliant and I cannot wait to see you tomorrow onboard the Stages Festival cruise!!!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA source told The Sun that the 38-year-old attended London Palladium\u2019s VIP bar with her fianc\u00e9 Jamie Horn before shouting and \u2018lashing out\u2019 at the kids.\n\nSheridan also played in Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps (Picture: Matt Crossick/PA Wire)\n\nThey said: \u2018Starring in a West End show can be very intense and while she never put a foot wrong on stage, away from it she could often be quite up and down.\n\n\u2018After the final show, bosses held a party in the theatre\u2019s VIP bar and Sheridan was there with her fianc\u00e9 Jamie Horn.\n\n\u2018They were chilling out, while a group of the younger cast were messing around nearby. Suddenly Sheridan turned around and very rudely told them to go away.\u2019\n\nDespite the rumours, the BAFTA-winning actress\u2019 stint was always meant to be once-off.\n\nBut it looks like Sheridan won\u2019t have anything to worry about as fans quickly came to her defence.\n\nOne user commented: \u2018Knew it didn\u2019t sound like you xx.\u2019\n\nAnother fan wrote: \u2018Support you always!!
