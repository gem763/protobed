My involvement is signing off the money.\n\n'The manager has a veto on a player - we would never sign a player the manager wouldn't want because he wouldn't play him. But we also feel the recruitment department, the football experts, should have a veto too.\n\n'I don't get involved in recruitment like people think I do. There's a myth that I look at YouTube and choose players. I don't. Having an eye for players is an art. I have no interest in doing that.\n\nThe United chief also clarified that managers always have the final say in signing players\n\n'I just want to have a disciplined process because if you are spending a lot of money on a player you have to make sure you get more right than wrong.\n\n'Where I get involved is that I have to sign off the money, yet when you have target one, two or three from your process I feel fine going after the No 1 target and, if it's not to be him, then number two or three.'\n\nWoodward also explained how changes had been made behind the scenes: 'The system wasn't set up in the right way. Twelve scouts reporting to one chief scout was more set up to say no - too many exceptions to the process were made historically while this was being fixed.\n\n'We also have to hold our hands up and say that recruitment wasn't at its best in recent years. We feel that we now know who our best scouts are.\n\nWoodward has been criticised for how he has run Manchester United over the last few years\n\n'The idea is to recruit in a closed environment, rather than listening to the press or getting distracted by conflicting agents' claims. We try and make cold decisions based on information.\n\n'Judge the recruitment department in the coming windows where hopefully we can get a team to be at the level we want to be.'\n\nDiscussing the January window, he continued: 'The manager sits down in September - so Ole has already done this for the next cycle - and told the experts the positions that he wants to recruit in and the characteristics relating to those players.'", "description": "The Manchester United chief has been criticised by supporters over the last few years as they believe he has too much power when it comes to bringing new players to Old Trafford.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20031536-0-image-a-3_1571742177380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
