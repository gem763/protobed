Charlotte and Sidney finally shared a kiss after eight weeks of slow-burning, but things ended in disaster after Sidney returned to London to marry his rich old flame in an effort to save Sanditon itself.\n\nFor some viewers, however, the sad finale only made them want a second series of the period drama even more.\n\nThat's all we're getting?! Nah if we don't get a season 2 I'm writing to ofcom #Sandition \u2014 Ane (@AnesJournal) October 13, 2019\n\nWell that ending was disappointing after last week \ud83d\ude23 there's got to be an another series or what was the point \ud83d\ude21 #sandition pic.twitter.com/k2guTHwosI \u2014 Maxine \ud83d\udc9c Winchesters \ud83d\udc51 J3 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc66\u200d\ud83d\udc66 (@spnmax) October 13, 2019\n\nThe series comes from writer Andrew Davies, who famously adapted Pride and Prejudice for TV in the 90s, with Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. That, of course, famously ended with Elizabeth Bennet defying the odds and marrying Darcy, which Sanditon viewers definitely did not get\u2026\n\nWell, let\u2019s all hope we get a second instalment with a happier ending, yes?\n\nSanditon is available to watch now on the ITV Hub.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
