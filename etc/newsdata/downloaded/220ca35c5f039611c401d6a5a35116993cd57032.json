Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?\n\nThe energy of the Democratic Party is clearly with its progressive flank. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing big policies that are energizing a progressive base fresh out of patience for warmed-over Republican talking points dressed up in appeals to the \u201cwhite working class.\u201d Warren has potentially overtaken former vice president Joe Biden, whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to be a reliable drum major, someone progressives can mark time with while they wait out the rolling horror that is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Ad Policy\n\nIf Joe Biden is having trouble convincing progressives to choose safety over ideology, you can imagine how it\u2019s working for the other moderates in the race. Pete Buttigieg raises money, but attracts fewer black and brown voters than Macklemore. Although they are not walking anachronisms like Biden, Kamala Harris\u2019s and Cory Booker\u2019s attempts to split the difference by offering a \u201csafer\u201d alternative to Warren/Sanders are having trouble getting traction. Amy Klobuchar, running in the \u201cwhat if Joe Biden didn\u2019t exist\u201d lane, is having trouble staying on the debate stage. What are these candidates supposed to do to tap into the progressive energy when they can\u2019t actually out-progressive the progressives?\n\nThis week\u2019s Democratic primary debate in Ohio saw the unveiling of their new, and for some of them last, strategy. I\u2019m calling it \u201cBut Now\u2013ism.\u201d Instead of making their plans bigger, the moderate wing is trying to sell their plans as more achievable, right now. Sure, Medicare for All sounds great, but people need health care \u201cright now.\u201d Addressing massive income inequality would be cool, \u201cbut now\u201d American workers need a raise. Breaking up Facebook makes perfect sense eventually, \u201cbut right now\u201d Trump is on Twitter functionally threatening lives. Moderates seem to agree that we need bold, aggressive action to fix what ails our country\u2014at some point. In the future. Maybe. But now, we should just be satisfied with whatever small-bore solution we can get, because we have a deranged narcissist in the White House right now. Debate 2020 Elizabeth Warren Learns That Being a Front-Runner Isn\u2019t All Fun and Games Joan Walsh\n\nWe saw Pete Buttigieg play the \u201cbut now\u201d game when he jousted with O\u2019Rourke over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (admirable, but constitutionally questionable) mandatory gun buyback idea: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can\u2019t wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don\u2019t wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can\u2019t wait for red-flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.\u201d\n\nWe saw it from Amy Klobuchar, who decided to set herself in opposition to nearly everything coming out of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s mouth: \u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.\u201d\n\nAnd we saw it from Joe Biden, telling us that his age and experience translate to right-now readiness: \u201cIt is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I\u2019ve been there, and I\u2019ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office.\u201d\n\nThe moderates would have us believe that their plans are the achievable ones, while the progressive plans are tilting at windmills. And if we lived in a functioning democracy, the moderates might be right. Passing bills that are broadly popular is easier than passing bills that are popular to some but trigger fierce opposition from others. \u201cWorking across the aisle\u201d to achieve compromise can be a political strength, not a moral weakness. When asked to list \u201csurprising\u201d friends, all of the candidates took the bait and three candidates mentioned their \u201cfriendship\u201d with the late Senator John McCain as if they were all auditioning to be on the Ellen show.\n\nBut you know whom none of them mentioned? The very-much-alive Mitch McConnell. I\u2019m starting to wonder if any of the Democrats running for president have met that dude yet.\n\nThe big, gaping problem in the centrist\u2019s argument for achievable policies is that as long as Mitch McConnell wields power, he will not allow things to be achieved. It doesn\u2019t matter if McConnell is the Senate majority leader or the Senate minority leader; if he survives his reelection campaign, he will not let things pass. All of these Democrats who are opposed to Medicare for All are talking about a public option, as if we are supposed to forget that they failed to get a public option when they controlled 60 votes in the Senate and a popular mandate to act on health care. \u201cBut now\u201d we\u2019re going to get a public option through the Senate? What on this good earth makes them think such a thing is more achievable than Medicare for All?\n\nModerates cannot run around acting like they\u2019re the serious, pragmatic candidates and then expect us to believe that McConnell is going to be visited by three ghosts between the election and the inauguration and wake up willing to let Tiny Tim go see a doctor about his leg.\n\nThe big-ticket progressive plans have a Mitch McConnell problem too. There\u2019s only one real way to deal with him, regardless of your policies. It\u2019s called nuking the filibuster. Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate consistently talking about that, as the key to unlocking all of her other policy proposals. When Klobuchar earnestly said that we are \u201cso close\u201d to strengthening background checks on gun purchases, Warren schooled her on exactly what \u201cclose\u201d looks like in McConnell\u2019s America: \u201cYou say we\u2019re so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013\u2026when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation and it didn\u2019t pass because of the filibuster. We have got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibuster, or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.\u201d Current Issue View our current issue\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a plan to get your plan past McConnell, then you really don\u2019t have a plan\u2014you have a wish.\n\nAnd McConnell is only the first part of the Republican gauntlet awaiting a new Democratic president. Even if you somehow get around McConnell, John Roberts and the Republican Supreme Court is right there waiting for you.\n\nIf you listened to the debate as a person familiar with the Supreme Court, you could almost hear Roberts guffawing as the Democrats advocated for their policy proposals. Kamala Harris wants to institute a \u201cpreclearance\u201d plan that would require states to ask the federal government for permission to change their abortion laws. Ha. Roberts already struck down preclearance as unconstitutional in 2013. O\u2019Rourke wants to push forward an assault weapons buyback program. Good luck, buddy. You\u2019re only dealing with the most pro-gun court we\u2019ve probably ever had in American history.\n\nThe way to get around Roberts is to pack the courts. But, except for Pete Buttigieg, Democrats have been lukewarm on court reform proposals. And Buttigieg\u2019s court plan is constitutionally questionable. Biden and Julian Castro came out as directly against court packing during the debate. Warren and Harris have suggested an \u201copenness\u201d to court reform, but neither have proposed specific plans.\n\nNone of the Democrats have a great answer to deal with John Roberts, which means that all of the Democrats selling you a \u201cbut now\u201d plan are really just saying: \u201cHere\u2019s what I would do until the Supreme Court overrules me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes But Now\u2013ism such weak tea. Nobody can grab the mantle of the \u201cpragmatic\u201d candidate, because nobody has truly wrestled with the practical reality that Mitch McConnell and John Roberts are antidemocratic forces likely to survive the Trump administration. It\u2019s fair to say that the progressive policies are hard to implement, but so are the moderate policies.\n\nSolutions are not magically made easier to pass because they are smaller or less comprehensive. They\u2019re not more practical because you got the idea from reading bathroom graffiti in a truck stop in Des Moines as opposed to reading it in a book you checked out of the library at Harvard. There are useful debates to be had, I suppose, about whether Medicare for All or Medicare for Some, Miniature American Flags for Others is the best policy, but which one McConnell and a Republican Senate minority (let\u2019s hope) will go for is not one of them.\n\nLet me end the suspense for you: The answer is no. Your plan, my plan, their plan, it doesn\u2019t matter. McConnell will block it, and what he doesn\u2019t block Roberts will overturn. That is the reality of the Republican Party these Democrats are fighting. Republicans have rigged the system so well that Republicans are the only ones allowed to win.
