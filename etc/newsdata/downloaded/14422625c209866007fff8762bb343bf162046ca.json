The meeting, coined \u201csuper Saturday,\u201d was the first time Parliament has met on a weekend since the Falkland War between Britain and Argentina in 1982.\n\nJohnson warned he may ignore the amendment because the best thing for Britain would be to leave the European Union with a deal Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther delay will be bad for this country.\n\n\u201cAlas, the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has effectively been passed up.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held amid a march in opposition to Johnson\u2019s deal in London.\n\nJohnson kicked off the meeting by presenting the Brexit deal he reached Thursday with the European Union.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party member Sammy Wilson suggested the party\u2019s MPs would back the Oliver Letwin Amendment, which would withhold approval of Johnson\u2019s deal until Parliament passes legislation required to implement Johnson\u2019s plan.\n\nMP Chris Grayling warned that passage of the Letwin amendment may delay the vote again.\n\nIf Johnson\u2019s deal had passed, the vote could have been the most significant step towards Brexit since British voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union three years ago.\n\nHis predecessor, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to pass a Brexit proposal.\n\nMay\u2019s deal featured a safety net clause to save Britain from a no-deal Brexit. Johnson\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t have that clause.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal also maintains some European Union rules in Northern Ireland, which critics fear could spark sectarian violence.\n\nSaturday\u2019s debate came as tens of thousands marched outside in opposition at a People\u2019s Vote March, demanding a \u201cfinal say\u201d in the vote.\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote campaign organizers are asking supporters to sign a letter to Boris Johnson and other leaders asking them to allow \u201cthe chance to check whether we want to proceed with Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 The British Parliament on Saturday passed an amendment delaying a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s European Union", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
