Apple\u2019s market capitalization regained its trillion-dollar status earlier this week for the first time since November 2018, after the company showed off new iPhones and detailed pricing for its subscription streaming offerings.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall checked in on Apple in response to those announcements Friday morning, and cut his stock price target to $165, 24% below current levels, from $187, while keeping his rating at neutral, citing potential negative effects from some of the pricing decisions Apple made.\n\nAlso read: Apple iPhone even reveals dramatic change in strategy.\n\nHall said he believes Apple plans to account for its one-year free trial for Apple TV+ as a $60 discount to a combined hardware and services bundle, which will likely result in lower average selling prices (ASPs) and margins but higher services revenue growth. He sees Apple\u2019s approach to accounting for TV+ as consistent with how embedded services such as Apple Maps and Siri are accounted for, even though TV+ clearly has a set price and can convert to an actual revenue stream after the free-trial period ends.\n\nThat might seem convenient for Apple, at a time that the company is trying to decrease its reliance on the iPhone, but Hall argues the point.\n\nOpinion: Apple\u2019s new iPhones are overpriced and behind the times.\n\n\u201cEffectively, Apple\u2019s method of accounting moves revenue from hardware to services even though customers do not perceive themselves to be paying for TV+,\u201d Hall wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThough this might appear convenient for Apple\u2019s services revenue line, it is equally inconvenient for both apparent hardware ASPs and margins in high sales quarter like the upcoming [fiscal first quarter of 2020] to December.\u201d\n\nIn the most recently completed quarter, hardware revenue represented about 79% of Apple\u2019s total sales, with iPhone revenue representing 48% and services revenue 21%. In the year-ago quarter, services revenue was 15% of total revenue.\n\nSee also: Apple\u2019s streaming service is cheap, but how does it stack up against Amazon, Netflix and Disney?\n\nHall said he believes fiscal first-quarter earnings per share could be \u201cmaterially lower than forecast,\u201d as Apple\u2019s accounting method could act as a 16% drag given lower product revenue and an increase in recognized cost of goods sold, or COGS. He said ASPs could take a 7% hit.\n\nApple stock is still up nearly 2% since the company\u2019s iPhone launch event on Tuesday. It has rallied 12% over the past three months, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.25% has gained 4.6% and the Dow has tacked on 4.3%.\n\nApple\u2019s stock needs to close at or above $221.28 for the company to regain its trillion-dollar status. The market cap was at $985.8 billion around midday Friday, below first-place Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.12% at $1.05 trillion, according to FactSet. Microsoft\u2019s market cap has been above $1 trillion for 69 straight days, since June 7.", "description": "Shares of Apple Inc. dropped Friday to send the technology behemoth\u2019s market cap lower than $1 trillion, after Goldman Sachs slashed its price target on...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ691_Apple_ZG_20190904142048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
