And those officials already are making key changes to the delegate process that could help enforce unity in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care at all about the lighting or TV camera angles at the convention in Charlotte,\u201d said a senior Trump campaign official. \u201cWe do care about who is seated in all of the chairs on the convention floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe care about that because we care about ensuring a predetermined outcome at the convention because history tells us \u2026 that a properly executed convention is the single most important thing a campaign can do to put their candidate on the pathway to reelection,\u201d added the official, who along with other top aides insisted on anonymity during a call this week with political reporters.\n\nThe move is an effort to strengthen the Republican president\u2019s general election prospects by preventing the kind of floor protests instigated by anti-Trump activists that rocked the 2016 convention in Cleveland, Ohio. At that convention, former primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz also caused an uproar by famously declining to endorse Trump at the time.\n\nA Trump campaign official said the goal now is to make sure the 2020 convention is a \u201cfour-day advertisement for the president and not an internal debate among activists.\u201d\n\nPolls indicate that the president remains extremely popular among Republicans and is the overwhelming favorite to win re-nomination in 2020, despite a handful of primary challenges. The surveys indicate that former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford, and former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois are the longest of long-shots as they primary-challenge Trump.\n\nSanford told Fox News on Tuesday that \u201ccoronations are nice but they\u2019re not particularly helpful to the working regular day folks that fall under them. I don\u2019t think this is good for the Republican Party at large.\u201d\n\nWalsh, a very vocal Trump critic, was less diplomatic.\n\nHe accused the Trump campaign and the RNC of \u201crigging the game in state after state.\u201d\n\nAnd he claimed, \u201cI think the Republican Party knows Trump\u2019s in trouble. I think they know he\u2019s weak. I think they basically know he\u2019s imploding every week so they\u2019re doing whatever they can to protect him. It\u2019s undemocratic.\u201d\n\nNevada and South Carolina \u2013 which vote third and fourth in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar \u2013 have canceled their nominating contents, as well as Kansas. The moves by those three states grabbed plenty of national attention.\n\nBut a Trump campaign official stressed that the moves encouraged by their team and the RNC in 37 states to make \u201cnuanced changes\u201d to convention delegate selection rules were arguably \u201cmore impactful\u201d than canceling the nominating contests.\n\nAmong the changes implemented \u2013 allowing the campaign to pick its own slate of delegates, binding delegates to the winner of the state\u2019s primary or caucus, and raising the thresholds to make sure candidates receiving a small percentage of the votes don\u2019t grab outsized numbers of delegates at the convention.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nA campaign official pointed to Massachusetts, where they raised the threshold to receive delegates from 6 percent to 20 percent.\n\nBut an optimistic Weld, campaigning in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire on Tuesday, said those changes were just fine with him.\n\n\u201cIn the six New England states, I plan to run a lot stronger than 15 or 20 percent. They changed the rule in Massachusetts from proportional to winner take all. I thought that was terrific. I aim to win New Hampshire and Massachusetts and I hope Vermont,\u201d Weld told Fox News. \u201cI kind of like this as far as New England is concerned.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee are tightening their grasp on the delegate selection process for next year\u2019s GOP\u00a0convention in a bid to prevent the kind of discord that flared in 2016.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/02/694940094001_6091289158001_6091290743001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
