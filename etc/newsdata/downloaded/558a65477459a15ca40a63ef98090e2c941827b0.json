The men dragged him out of the Cruz and Chiky bodega in Belmont and proceeded to stab him with machetes and knives. Video of the brutal slaying was caught on a surveillance camera, and prosecutors claimed that the four and a half-inch wound Martinez Estrella was seen delivering to the victim\u2019s neck was what ultimately caused his death.\n\nOn June 15, Breitbart News reported that following the murder, news of Guzman-Feliz\u2019s death went viral online with community members using the hashtag #JusticeforJunior to voice their sadness and frustration.\n\nIn June of 2018, the leader of the deadly street gang reportedly said he was \u201csorry\u201d the Trinitarios targeted Guzman-Feliz, adding that \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t mean a lot.

Why? To be a big shot in a gang,\u201d he commented.\n\nEstrella was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole and Muniz was sentenced to 25 years to life behind bars.\n\n\u201cThrowing it up was basically shoving it up the a\u2013 of the system that the Trinitarios will be who they are forever and you can put us in prison and we don\u2019t respect your system,\u201d said gang expert and retired NYPD sergeant Lou Savelli.\n\n\u201cThey were arrogant from the very beginning,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Two gangbangers convicted in the violent murder of Bronx teenager Lesandro 'Junior' Guzman-Feliz flashed gang signs during sentencing Friday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Lesandro-\u201cJunior\u201d-Guzman-Feliz-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
