For the best-tasting food, you should (mostly) ignore that first bit, and focus on the second.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because recipe writers are actively lying to you. The number of minutes they prescribe for saut\u00e9ing, searing, or simmering is probably based in reality, but you should use that timeframe as the loosest of guides.\n\nThere are simply too mainly variables from kitchen to kitchen to take numbers as gospel. Ovens heat unevenly, \u201cmedium-high\u201d on a gas stove is different than \u201cmedium-high\u201d on electric, and variation in ingredients \u2014 such as size or moisture content \u2014 can greatly affect cooking times.\n\nSo instead of worrying if you\u2019ve cooked your meal a couple minutes too long (or too short), focus on the parts of the recipe that describe physical cues such as temperature, colour, and volume.
