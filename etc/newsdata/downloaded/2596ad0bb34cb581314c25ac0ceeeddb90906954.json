The Redskins cornerback was still seething over what had transpired over the course of the afternoon.\n\nThere was a lot for Dunbar to digest, but it left him angry all the same. Not only did the Redskins lose 32-27 to the Eagles, but Washington blew a 17-point lead in the process. Dunbar was mad over two botched coverages \u2014 which, not surprisingly, led to Jackson breaking free for 50-yard-plus touchdowns each time. Dunbar said he felt the Redskins got complacent, particularly in the second half.\n\nAnd in speaking to reporters, he uttered then words that seem almost impossible to comprehend \u2014 especially when considering the fact this is only Week 1 of a brand new season.\n\n\u201cThey just wanted it more than us,\u201d Dunbar said.\n\nHow? How does that happen?\n\nThe proof, Dunbar said, was in the results. The difference between the two halves, he said, was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d At halftime, when the Redskins led 20-7, the Eagles had just 134 yards. They finished with 436. Philadelphia, too, controlled the ball for all but 8:52 of the second half.\n\nSimply put: Washington\u2019s defense couldn\u2019t get off the field.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense was supposed to be Washington\u2019s strength. They added All-Pro safety Landon Collins in free agency. They traded up for pass rusher Montez Sweat, giving them another first-rounder along the defensive line. The new pieces were supposed to gel with last year\u2019s young stars.\n\nBut in Sunday\u2019s opener, familiar problems \u2014 specifically coverage breakdowns \u2014 remained.\n\n\u201cDefensively, we have too good of personnel to play like that,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said.\n\nThe Redskins made the kind of devastating mistakes that shouldn\u2019t happen in the first game of a new season.\n\nOn Jackson\u2019s touchdowns, for instance, Redskins defenders, who harped on better communication going into this year, weren\u2019t on the same page.\n\nOn the speedy wideout\u2019s 51-yard score that gave Philadelphia its first points, the Redskins mixed up the zone coverage \u2014 leaving cornerback Josh Norman with no safety help over the top.\n\nOn the catch that gave the Eagles the lead in the third, the Redskins failed to communicate a check properly before the play was snapped, and Jackson blew past rookie Jimmy Moreland and safety Montae Nicholson for a 53-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cWe kind of just fell apart,\u201d Nicholson said of the second-half collapse. \u201cPlain and simple. This goes back to maintaining our composure and staying together. It\u2019s the game endurance that we still have to pick up.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins knew what they were facing. Jackson, after all, spent two seasons with Washington before leaving as a free agent in 2017. They also faced Jackson for years with the Eagles prior to the wideout reuniting with Philadelphia this offseason.\n\nEven at 32, Jackson has blazing speed \u2014 he finished with eight catches and 154 yards, and his playmaking ultimately made the difference as Washington couldn\u2019t hold on to a 17-point lead.\n\nBefore Jackson took over, the Redskins seemed well on their way to an upset.\n\nEntering the year with an unproven group of playmakers, the Redskins had players like Terry McLaurin (five catches,125 yards) and Trey Quinn (four catches, 38 yards) step up. Washington was missing both tight end Jordan Reed, who is in the concussion protocol, and running back Adrian Peterson, who was inactive.\n\nQuarterback Case Keenum got into a rhythm early and wasn\u2019t afraid to take shots down the field. Washington connected on a number of big plays \u2014 something desperately missing from the offense last year.\n\nThe Redskins first got on the board with a 48-yard touchdown from tight end Vernon Davis, who hurdled Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby in a remarkable feat of athleticism. Later, to go up 17-0, McLaurin hauled in a 70-yard bomb off a play-action pass from Keenum.\n\nBy the end of the game, Keenum had 380 yards \u2014 more than Alex Smith had in any game last season.\n\nStill, the offense stalled in the second half. Gruden called the unit\u2019s problems eerily similar to last season, when the Redskins also failed to put points up in the second half of games.\n\nThe defensive meltdown, though, was more troubling.\n\nThe Redskins have high hopes for the unit, and Washington now has a week to clean up its miscues as Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys, 35-17 winners over the New York Giants, come to town for the home opener at FedEx Field. Washington could also be without defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, who suffered a knee sprain against the Eagles.\n\n\u201cWe beat ourselves,\u201d Dunbar said. \u201cFor the most part, I felt like the guys went out there and competed well. We just got to get better at communicating, especially when it\u2019s DeSean Jackson, one of the best deep threat players in the game.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bust or have slip-ups like that because he\u2019s going to kill you, just like what he did.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
