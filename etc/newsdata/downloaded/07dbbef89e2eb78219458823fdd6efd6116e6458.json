Its release was initially stalled by the Pentagon for pre-publication review, and Snodgrass received threatening letters from DoD lawyers, but he ultimately was able to go ahead after he filed a lawsuit.\n\nFor his part, Mattis has said he hasn't read the book and doesn't intend to do so, according to his assistant Candace Currier.\n\nIn a statement to Task & Purpose, Currier said \"Mr. Snodgrass was a junior staffer who took notes in some meetings but played no role in decision making.\" (Snodgrass responded to being called a \"junior staffer\" by sharing the citation of an award he received from Mattis, which said he \"played a vital and influential role in the Department of Defense's strategic messaging\" and was \"integral in developing several foundational strategic guidance documents with far-reaching effects across the Department.\")\n\nCurrier added: \"His choice to write a book reveals an absence of character. He was appointed to a position of trust at the Department of Defense, and surreptitiously taking notes without authorization for a self-promoting personal project is a clear violation of that trust. He may receive a few brief moments of attention for this book. But those moments will be greatly outweighed by the fact that to get them, he surrendered his honor.\"\n\nHere's what we found were the best bits.
