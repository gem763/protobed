They charge the move is motivated by racial animus, upending federal law and violating constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cVoters will be denied their constitutionally guaranteed rights to equitable political representation based on actual population,\u201d read the complaint.\n\nMr. Trump issued the executive order after the Supreme Court struck down the administration\u2019s plan to ask residents about their citizenship status for the U.S. Census.\n\nThe directive forces federal agencies to share citizenship information with the Commerce Department, which will then transmit the population data to individual states.\n\n\u201cThis administration will stop at nothing to suppress the political voice of Latinos and other communities of color, while showing blatant disregard for the U.S. Constitution that they are supposed to uphold,\u201d said John C. Yang, president of Advancing Justice, which represents the plaintiffs.\n\nThe groups\u2019 lawsuit represents the first legal challenge against the executive order, according to NPR.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
