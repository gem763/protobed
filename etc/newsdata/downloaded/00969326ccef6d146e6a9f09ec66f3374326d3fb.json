We welcome Kaola to the Alibaba family and value NetEase's contributions in incubating an e-commerce platform with strong import capabilities,\" Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said.\n\nAlibaba said as part of the acquisition, Kaola will continue to operate independently under its current brand, and Tmall Import and Export general manager Alvin Liu will resume the role as Kaola's new CEO.\n\nIn addition, Alibaba have entered into an agreement with its private equity subsidiary Yunfeng Capital to invest approximately $700 million in NetEase Cloud Music as part of its latest round of financing.\n\nSee also: Alibaba releases its first RISC-V CPU as open source solution for 5G and AI (TechRepublic)\n\nSubject to certain closing conditions, the investment will still see NetEase remain as the controlling shareholder of NetEase Cloud Music.\n\nZhang said the investment would be an opportunity explore \"innovative collaboration in the digital entertainment space\".\n\nIn July, the company announced it was opening Alibaba.com, its B2B e-commerce platform, to US sellers for the first time.\n\nAlibaba has already signed up Office Depot and the global produce company Robinson Fresh as sellers on the marketplace, but it's primarily targeting small businesses.\n\nThe move echoes remarks made by Alibaba's Australia and New Zealand managing director Maggie Zhou, who told ZDNet last week that the US-China trade war might be heating up, but the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate is unfazed by it and is optimistic about future world trade.\n\n\"Alibaba remains committed to servicing the global economy. Alibaba continues to support those entrepreneurs and small business owners who can deliver high quality products to the growing consumer market in China,\" she said at the time.\n\n\"It is very crucial we break down the barriers that make global trade harder to allow SMEs to be exporters. There's a continued need to do that.\"\n\nIt's part of the company's wider plans to capitalise on Australia's appeal to Chinese consumers.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The deal will help further build the Chinese conglomerate's import service in China.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/27/baec4d1d-5db8-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/b75db1b3206c6bfaa38f464ebb59225f/australias-bigcommerce-inks-integration-deal-with-alibaba-com.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
