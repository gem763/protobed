Dan Crenshaw in a statement on Wednesday. He has sponsored the House measure along with Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama and Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico.\n\nFor its part, Shenzhen, China-based DJI Technology \u2014 the world\u2019s largest maker of commercial and consumer drones \u2014 has said it\u2019s \u201cmisguided\u201d for Congress to focus on country of origin.\n\nThe House bill \u201cbroadly and unfairly targets technology manufactured in China and would prevent the Department of Homeland Security from using the industry\u2019s most advanced drone and drone-detection technology \u2014 which it already relies on \u2014 to support vital operations,\u201d DJI said in a statement. \u201cIndependent cybersecurity investigations have proven our drones do not automatically send flight data to any third party including DJI, and we give all users full control over the data they collect as well as tools to manage where it is stored and how it is shared.\u201d\n\nPrivately held DJI said lawmakers should work with U.S. government agencies and the drone industry to develop clear standards for functionality, safety and security for the drones used by the Department of Homeland Security, rather than pursue a \u201cmisguided country of origin restriction.\u201d\n\nIn a disclosure filed Monday, DJI said it spent $200,000 on lobbying Washington during the third quarter on issues such as the Senate bill. That\u2019s the most the Chinese company has ever shelled out in a quarter, as shown in the above chart that\u2019s based on its disclosures since 2016.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s far below Huawei\u2019s third-quarter lobbying outlay, which was $1.76 million, up sharply from just $30,000 in the same period a year ago. But the latest figure has lifted DJI\u2019s year-to-date lobbying spending to $470,000, putting it on pace to top 2018\u2019s full-year total of $560,000.\n\nDJI has about 77% of the U.S. drone market, according to market research firm Drone Industry Insights. It\u2019s far ahead of American industry players such as Intel Corp. INTC, +0.99% , at 3.7%, and GoPro Inc. GPRO, -0.77% , at 1.8%. The company\u2019s annual revenue has been estimated at about $3 billion, and it has an estimated valuation of around $21 billion.\n\nThe Senate bill has six original co-sponsors, including Florida\u2019s two Republican senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, as well as Connecticut\u2019s two Democratic senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. Lawmakers also have taken separate steps this year to prevent the U.S. military from buying Chinese-made drones.", "description": "Bills introduced in the House and Senate over the past month seek to block federal agencies from buying drones manufactured in China, spurred by the view...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT979_drone__ZG_20191024155250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
