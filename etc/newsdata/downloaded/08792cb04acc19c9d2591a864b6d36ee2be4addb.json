You really were,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cDo you find yourself yelling at the screen because you have an idea for the right question and the person on the screen is not asking that question?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Franken replied after a brief pause. \u201cYes, that happens. Sometimes I have emailed my colleagues during hearings and said this might be good [to ask]. It is very frustrating.\u201d\n\nMr. Franken, 68, served in the Senate for nearly nine years before resigning in the wake of being the subject of sexual misconduct allegations that surfaced in late 2017. He announced earlier this week that he will host a weekly radio show on the SiriusXM satellite service, \u201cThe Al Franken Show,\u201d starting this Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen this first happened, if you had asked me, \u2018have you ever made a woman feel uncomfortable by the way you put your arm around her or touch her or something like that, I would\u2019ve said no,\u201d Mr. Franken said on \u201cConan\u201d about the circumstances that led to his resignation. \u201cAnd after all these allegations came in, I thought, well, I must be doing something wrong.\n\n\u201cEver since I\u2019ve been a lot more mindful in my interactions with pretty much everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nA comedian prior to entering politics, Mr. Franken and Mr. O\u2019Brien, 56, both worked as writers on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d at the same time in the late 1980s.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
