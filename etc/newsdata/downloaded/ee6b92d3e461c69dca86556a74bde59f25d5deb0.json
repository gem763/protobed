And they just might get them.", "language": "en", "text": "When the District closed off three miles of busy Georgia Avenue for four hours earlier this month, none could have been more joyful than the Washington Area Bicyclists Association, which has been pushing hard for the city to \u201crepurpose roads to enhance connectivity for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders, and improving non-motorized access to schools and parks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWoah! The District of Columbia\u2019s first-ever Open Streets was on October 5th and we had so much fun!\u201d Pedro Dana, the WABA programs director wrote on the group\u2019s website. \u201cHow about you? How did you enjoy our car-free streets? Did you do some dancing? Did you ride your bike with child-like joy?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd that\u2019s just for starters. To achieve its goal of permanent car-free zones across the city, the bicycle lobby is pushing for an array of even stiffer penalties against anyone who impedes the bikers\u2019 roll. Mainly motorists, but also developers who don\u2019t include bike lanes as part of their construction projects.\n\nConsider some of the bicycle-related proposals on the agenda for a hearing before the D.C. Council next week:\n\nAD\n\nNo public space permits for certain projects \u201cunless the plans include new sidewalks, bicycle lanes or cycle tracks.\u201d Levy a $10,000 daily fine on contractors who do not restore crosswalks and bicycle lanes within 24 hours of completing work.\n\nThe cyclists\u2019 push is in tandem with Mayor Muriel E. Bowser\u2019s attempt to ramp up a flailing traffic safety plan called Vision Zero. Launched in 2015, the plan aims for \u201czero traffic fatalities\u201d by 2024. However, the District had 36 traffic deaths in 2018, up from 31 in 2017, according to city and federal crash data. Half the victims were pedestrians or were riding two-wheelers \u2014 bicycles, mopeds, scooters or motorcycles.\n\nAD\n\nIt may be one reason that the bicyclists\u2019 proposals are likely to gain traction in ways that, say, having developers build low-income housing along with their high-end condos, did not.\n\nAD\n\nOn the bicyclists\u2019 agenda: requiring applicants for new or renewed driver\u2019s licenses to take a written test covering bicyclist rights. Let\u2019s try one question: Is it right for bicyclists to cut to the head of a line of cars at a stoplight, then poke along, impeding traffic?\n\nThe wrong answer could cost you a driver\u2019s license.\n\n(According to biker law, the correct answer is yes.)\n\n\u201cThis is our moment,\u201d Jeremiah Lowery, advocacy director for WABA, wrote on the website last month. \u201cOver the last year, together, we\u2019ve made a lot of noise about the urgent need for safer streets. Right now, we have an opportunity to use that energy to push the DC Council to pass truly transformative legislation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue against policies that could result in fewer traffic deaths. But according to WABA, part of the problem has to do with citations.\n\n\u201cCurrent penalties in the District for the most dangerous and egregious driving behaviors are generally far too low to serve as a deterrent, and in some cases are entirely nonexistent,\u201d according to the group.\n\nThey want harsher penalties, steeper fines.\n\nThe problem with that, as any motorist can tell you, is that the District already issues tickets like crazy. The city\u2019s red-light and speed cameras and parking tickets generated about $324 million in fines last year, according to city data.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly $1 billion every three years. And traffic fatalities are on the rise? Something is amiss.\n\nAD\n\nProblems with the enforcement system were raised by the D.C. Office of the Inspector General in 2014, and obviously they have not been resolved.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMotorists deserve reasonable assurances that District entities and contractors involved in issuing parking and moving violation tickets emphasize diligence and accuracy over volume and revenue,\u201d the OIG report said.\n\n\u201cOne of the most insightful and provocative comments made to the OIG team came from a senior District official: \u2018One of the beauties of parking, it\u2019s like the [Internal Revenue Service]. If you get a parking ticket, you are guilty until you have proven yourself innocent . . . . That has worked well for us.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn response to the report, D.C. police and transportation officials wrote a letter dismissing the concerns.\n\n\u201cComplaints about the District\u2019s [Automated Traffic Enforcement] program generally come from those relatively few people who feel entitled to speed on District streets or run red lights without being held accountable for their endangerment of pedestrians, bicyclists and other motorists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNot true. The concerns are real.\n\nWJLA teamed with AAA Mid-Atlantic on a report that showed that tens of thousands of drivers were overcharged for red-light camera violations between 2013 and 2017 \u2014 and they still have not received refunds.\n\n\u201cIf you care about safety on the roads, you\u2019d be looking at ways to expand telecommuting and the improvement of mass transit,\u201d said John Townsend, a AAA spokesman. \u201cYou can\u2019t just focus on motorists and think you\u2019re going to ticket your way out of a regional transportation problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the bike lobby rolls on. Among the proposals that have been offered: Increasing the fine for speeding in excess of 25 mph from $300 to $1,000.\n\nSome WABA members also would like to see the District charge motorists a toll just for entering the city. For a gentrifying city that has forced out thousands of low-income residents, the toll sounds like a way to keep those people from coming back, even for a visit.\n\nThat\u2019s not \u201cVision Zero,\u201d bicycle lobbyists. That\u2019s just blind.\n\nTo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/milloy.\n\nAD", "description": "There\u2019s a slew of bicycle-related proposals coming before the D.C. Council.
