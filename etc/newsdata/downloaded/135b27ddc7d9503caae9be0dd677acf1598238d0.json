I nearly died,' she said.\n\n'I was given antibiotics and they removed everything from my uterus, but I didn't quite get over the infection by the time I was pregnant with my second child.\n\n'That's why my second child (Hudson) was born prematurely.\n\n'We now live three minutes away from our local hospital because when I'm pregnant, I'm at the hospital three times in a good week, five times in a bad one.'\n\nAs he was one day shy of 20 weeks, Cooper's premature birth was classified as a miscarriage rather than a stillbirth.\n\nMs Rowe then fell pregnant with twin girls.\n\nThe pregnancy was high-risk because, while they had their own umbilical cords, the pair shared an amniotic sac and the same placenta.\n\nIn August 2015, Emma and Zoe became entangled in their cords and died at 15 weeks.\n\nAfter two more miscarriages, the pair opted for IVF last year and found out they were expecting baby Noah.\n\n'We were sure he was our miracle baby,' she said.\n\nThey were told that if Noah lived beyond 23 weeks, the doctors could keep him alive in the event of a premature birth.\n\nThe devastated couple also revealed they had two more miscarriages this year (pictured: Ms Rowe pregnant with Cooper in 2014)\n\nBut at almost 22 weeks, the hopeful mum felt shooting pains and went to the hospital, only to be sent home.\n\nShe went into labour at 6.30am the next day, but Noah didn't make it.\n\nThe devastated couple also revealed they had two more miscarriages this year.\n\n'We've got empty arms,' Ms Rowe cried, explaining she and her husband had to watch all their friends have healthy children over the years.\n\nAfter coping with the deaths of 11 babies, Mr Lyons and Ms Rowe decided to use their experiences to help others.\n\nThey founded Memories of an Angel providing mementos and keepsakes for deceased infants.\n\nThe couple said the loss of a child is a taboo topic - and revealed they want to help others understand they're not alone in their grief.\n\n'I can't take away your pain. I can't change the outcome and I can't bring your baby back, But I can give you a listening ear and support you ... There will be a day in the future when you will smile again and you will enjoy life again.'\n\nPregnancy & Infant Loss Remembrance Day is on Tuesday.", "description": "Bereaved mother Samantha Rowe and husband Paul Lyons have suffered through almost a dozen infant deaths over the past five years, as each one of their children tragically died prematurely.", "authors": ["Charlotte Karp For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/10/19650242-0-image-a-6_1570957698580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
