The September rally stalled around the 50% retracement level before rolling over, and prices are now interacting with the flash-crash low set early January. With the 20-day EMA capping the weekly high and Wednesday providing a bearish engulfing candle, the swing high could be in place at 0.6806. Yesterday\u2019s inside bar shows compression is underway, which can be the prelude to range expansion.\n\nThe bias remains bearish below 0.6806.\n\nBears could take a break of Wednesday\u2019s low as a sign the bearish trend is set to resume.\n\nInitial target would be around 0.6700 (round number), which is just above the YTD lows. A break beneath 0.6674 brings the lower channel into focus for bears.\n\nis also worth keeping tabs on as the setup is quite similar.\n\nAUD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nis consolidating above the June 2016 low and will likely track the direction of sentiment; so if indices and are to continue to rebound we could see USD/JPY rise in tandem, whereas if they turn lower, this FX barometer of risk could break through key support and bears take another crack at the year to date lows. Whilst a near-term bounce could be possible, and we\u2019d favor an eventual break lower due to the dominant bearish trend.\n\nThe daily trend remains bearish below 74.50, although a minor rebound from current levels seems plausible.\n\nIf prices rebound, a lower high beneath 74.50 could be a sign that momentum is trying to revert to the dominant trend.\n\nBears could take a break beneath 72.50 assign prices are set to head lower.\n\nMonitor price action on S&P500 and to help assess the likely direction of .\n\nAUD/NZD Daily Chart\n\nhas broken out of its latest channel, although the downside break is yet to compel. Wednesday\u2019s bullish hammer respected support around 1.0700 and spoiled the potential double top pattern previously highlighted. Still, yesterday\u2019s bearish candle spanned most of the hammer\u2019s range and closed near the lows, so bulls are not out of the woods yet. That said, we note a potential bullish wedge is forming on the four-hour chart with a small bullish divergence, so 1.0700 appears to be a key level going forward for bulls and bears.\n\nBears could wait for a break below 1.7000 before considering shorts, with the lows around 1.0631/38 as a target\n\nBulls could wait for a breakout from the wedge on the four-hour chart, using Thursday\u2019s high as an initial target (the base of the wedge), followed by 1.0800 and the 1.0840 high.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
