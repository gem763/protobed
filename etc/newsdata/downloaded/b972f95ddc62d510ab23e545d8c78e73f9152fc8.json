Phone makers are constantly trying to outdo each other with charging methods that can juice up your phones faster. While these techniques introduce faster charging, it might also mean you\u2019ll have to stick to that particular phone maker\u2019s proprietary charger and cable.\n\nHowever, that might change soon. According to a new document obtained by XDA Developers, Google is now urging phone makers to play nice with USB-PD (Power Delivery), an open USB-C fast-charging standard.\n\nThe report notes a new version of the Google Mobile Services \u2014 a list of requirements companies need to meet to get Android certification \u2014 states new devices with Android 10 should have \u201cfull interoperability\u201d with standard USB-C chargers.\n\nVery few phones (such as Google\u2019s Pixel series) use USB-C PD standard for fast charging by default. Companies like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Huawei rely on their homegrown fast charging techniques. A test from Android Authority shows charging speeds slow down considerably when you use a standard USB-C PD charger with some phones of these companies.\n\nWe are not sure when or how Google plans to enforce this standard. We\u2019ve asked the company for more details, and we\u2019ll update the story accordingly if we hear back.\n\nTheoretically, USB-C PD can support fast charging to 100W, but Samsung\u2019s 45W charger supplied with the Galaxy Note10 is the fastest alternative for now.\n\nIf this change is enforced, you won\u2019t have to carry your phone maker\u2019s proprietary charger everywhere. Instead, you\u2019ll be able to just use a standard charger that works with all devices for quick charging. Not bad at all.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F03%2FUSB-C.jpg&signature=64963218fe79942fb32ac409bdd430db", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
