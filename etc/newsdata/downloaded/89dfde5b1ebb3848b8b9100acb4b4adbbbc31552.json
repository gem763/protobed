Now the season rides on a single win-or-go-home game in D.C.\n\nThe Washington Nationals will either advance to the divisional series or see their season end prematurely when they play in the National League Wild Card Game, the first game of the Major League Baseball postseason. Here\u2019s how to watch and what to watch for.\n\nOpponent: Milwaukee Brewers (89-73, No. 2 wild card team)\n\nWhere: Nationals Park, Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen: Tuesday, Oct. 1, 8:08 p.m.\n\nTelevision: TBS\n\nRadio: ESPN Radio (Team 980)\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n\u2022 Max Scherzer will start for Washington opposite the Brewers\u2019 Brandon Woodruff. Scherzer finished the regular season 11-7 with a 2.92 ERA, a 1.03 WHIP and 243 strikeouts. He hasn\u2019t been quite the same after suffering a back injury in July \u2014 he hasn\u2019t pitched deeper than 6 2/3 innings in any start since being placed on the injured list. But in his final two starts of the season, he struck out 11 and 10 batters, respectively.\n\n\u2022 The Nationals started the season 19-31, the fourth-worst record in baseball at the time, but came all the way back to finish second in the NL East and secure the top wild-card spot. If they win Tuesday, they\u2019ll face the top team in the NL, the Los Angeles Dodgers, in the NLDS starting Thursday.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nA healthy Kurt Suzuki is the latest good sign for the #Nats, Dave Martinez says. @DaytonVaDriver with more: https://t.co/i9C7J4zstx \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 30, 2019\n\n\u201cGuys like Bobby Cox and Joe (Maddon), they always stayed the same and trusted what they believed in and led by what they believed in.
