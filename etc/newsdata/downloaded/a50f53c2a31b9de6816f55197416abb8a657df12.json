In no sense is this QE,\" he said in a question and answer session after the speech.\n\nOn monetary policy more broadly, Powell stuck to his recent script: He and his fellow policymakers view the economy as being strong but susceptible to shocks, particularly from a global slowdown, trade and geopolitics like a potentially messy Brexit. He said the Fed stands committed to supporting the recovery but is data dependent and not on a preset course of cutting rates.\n\nThe Fed has reduced its benchmark rate twice in 2019 and is expected to approve a third cut late this month.\n\nStocks pared some of their losses as Powell spoke while short-term Treasury yields hit their lows of the day.", "description": "On monetary policy more broadly, Powell stuck to his recent script, saying the Fed stands committed to supporting the recovery but is data dependent and not on a preset course of cutting rates.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106170719-1570560983682gettyimages-1174627918.jpeg?v=1570561010", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
