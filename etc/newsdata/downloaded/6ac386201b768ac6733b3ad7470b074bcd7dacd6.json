The EU negotiating team will meet with diplomats from the remaining 27 countries to discuss the proposal on Wednesday evening, European officials said.\n\nMr. Johnson sought to address a dilemma at the center of a Brexit riddle that has paralyzed Parliament and claimed the premiership of one prime minister: the land border between Northern Ireland, which is in the U.K., and Ireland, a separate EU member state.\n\nMr. Johnson indicated that under the proposal, Northern Ireland would withdraw along with the rest of the U.K. from the EU\u2019s customs union, while remaining inside the bloc\u2019s regulatory orbit for agriculture and manufactured goods. He said customs checks wouldn\u2019t be necessary \u201cat or near the border,\u201d implying that the necessary checks would be carried out using behind-the-border technology.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks\u2014when that technology is improving the whole time\u2014then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal,\u201d he said.\n\nEU officials have pointed out in the past that such technical solutions aren\u2019t in operation at any land border in the world, and doubt that any could be ready in the next couple of years.\n\nBritish lawmakers have already thrice rejected a Brexit deal that was negotiated last year, leading to two delays to the original departure date of March 29. Since his arrival at Downing Street this summer, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to get the U.K. out of the EU by the end of October.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s approach has fanned concerns among some British lawmakers and EU officials over whether he is serious about getting a divorce deal or whether he wants the U.K. to leave the bloc without an agreement to smooth its exit.\n\nBritain\u2019s Parliament has passed a law that states if a deal with the EU isn\u2019t agreed by Oct. 19, the government must request a further three-month extension to negotiations. It would be up to the EU\u2019s other 27 members whether to accept such an extension.\n\nUnless Mr. Johnson can get a deal with the EU, it looks increasingly likely that an extension will have to be requested, analysts say.\n\nSome in Britain are sounding alarms on the potential consequences of the U.K. crashing out of the EU without a deal. WSJ\u2019s Saabira Chaudhuri takes a look at what a no-deal Brexit could look like for businesses, the economy and consumers.\n\nMr. Johnson, whose party has a minority in Parliament, wants a general election to clear out pro-EU lawmakers who are currently blocking his plans. The opposition parties have blocked such a vote until a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 is off the table.\n\nIn the deal negotiated by Mr. Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, an arrangement, known as the Irish backstop, was agreed on to prevent the need for customs posts and related physical infrastructure along the 310-mile frontier separating Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBut the backstop was toxic to hard-line pro-Brexit lawmakers in the ruling Conservative Party and\u2014critically\u2014to Mrs. May\u2019s allies in Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, whose support she relied upon to govern.\n\nThe backstop called for the U.K. to remain within the EU\u2019s common customs area until a new free-trade accord could be agreed between London and Brussels. It also called for Northern Ireland to remain wedded to EU regulations in sectors such as agriculture and manufactured goods, to eliminate the need for regulatory checks on goods and animals crossing the border.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers said that agreeing to such provisions would leave the U.K. too closely tied to the EU after Brexit, and unable to escape the arrangement. Mrs. May\u2019s Northern Irish allies said the backstop risked weakening Northern Ireland\u2019s links to the rest of the U.K.\n\nExcising the backstop from the withdrawal package and replacing it with new arrangements has became Mr. Johnson\u2019s central negotiating goal. In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk not long after taking office, Mr. Johnson described the backstop as antidemocratic and inconsistent with the sovereignty of the U.K.\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a revised Brexit proposal, warning the European Union that he remains prepared to take the U.K. out of the bloc at the end of October without a deal.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Jason Douglas", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com", "Jason.Douglas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112892/social"}
