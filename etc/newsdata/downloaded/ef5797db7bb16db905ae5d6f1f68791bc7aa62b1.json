Rick Chiarelli's request for a leave of absence Wednesday.\n\nCouncillors were provided with an updated medical note explaining the reason for the College ward councillor's request, but still decided against granting the leave in a vote of 20-0 \u2014 councillors Diane Deans, Allan Hubley, Jenna Sudds and Chiarelli were away.\n\nCoun. Rick Chiarelli gave his permission to make this doctor's note, dated Oct. 22, 2019, public. In it, Chiarelli's doctor writes the councillor suffered a 'syncopal attack,' or fainting spell, on Oct. 12. Chiarelli's 'stress levels continue to be high with erratic blood sugars and blood pressure,' according to the note. CBC has withheld the name of the doctor because it's not clear whether he was aware the note would be shared publicly. (Joanne Chianello/CBC)\n\nThirteen women have now told CBC about inappropriate behaviour and comments by Chiarelli in his office and during job interviews. Chiarelli has denied all allegations.\n\n\"There's a lot of important issues we're dealing with and Coun. Chiarelli's ward does not have a voice. We're trying our best to do so through two members of council filling in, but as you saw today, there's precious little support for Coun. Chiarelli,\" Watson said Wednesday.\n\nMayor Watson said there is 'precious little support' for Chiarelli. (Giacomo Panico/CBC)\n\n\"I think as more allegations come forward, it becomes more disgusting and very upsetting as to what was going on in that office for what appears to be many, many months, if not years.\"\n\nBefore the vote, city solicitor David White warned councillors not to take the allegations against Chiarelli into account when making their decision about the councillor's leave.\n\nUnder the Municipal Act, if Chiarelli does not show up to council by the end of the November, his seat will be declared vacant.\n\nMore to come.", "description": "The College ward councillor, who's facing numerous allegations of inappropriate behaviour, must attend council by the end of November or his seat will be declared vacant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4261217.1503604465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rick-chiarelli-councillor-ottawa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
