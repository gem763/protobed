The attorney, Nicholas Lewin, requested the opportunity to be heard on the matter, citing his unnamed client\u2019s \u201creputational rights.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already made public more than 2,000 pages in the since-settled defamation lawsuit. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein\u2019s accusers, filed the case against Ghislaine Maxwell , a former Epstein girlfriend. Giuffre has accused Maxwell of recruiting young women for Epstein\u2019s sexual pleasure and taking part in the abuse\u2014 allegations Maxwell vehemently denies.\n\nThe first release of court records\u2014 unsealed the day before Epstein\u2019s jailhouse suicide in Manhattan\u2014 contained graphic claims against Epstein and several of his former associates. Giuffre alleges she was trafficked internationally to have sex with prominent American politicians, business executives and world leaders.\n\nGiuffre filed the lawsuit in 2015, alleging Maxwell subjected her to \u201cpublic ridicule, contempt and disgrace\u201d by calling her a liar in published statements \u201cwith the malicious intent of discrediting and further damaging Giuffre worldwide.\u201d The lawsuit sought unspecified damages.\n\nAbout one-fifth of all documents filed in the case were done so under seal\u2014 a level of secrecy the 2nd Circuit ruled was unjustified. However, the appellate court, in unsealing the records, issued an unusual warning to the public and the media \u201cto exercise restraint\u201d regarding potentially defamatory allegations contained in the depositions and other court filings.", "description": "A federal judge will discuss plans Wednesday for unsealing a new trove of court records involving sexual abuse allegations against Jeffrey Epstein, the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN349_epstei_ZG_20190715121129.jpg"}
