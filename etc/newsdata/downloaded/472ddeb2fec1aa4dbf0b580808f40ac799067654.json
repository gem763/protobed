Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran who flew missions throughout the Middle East -- including Afghanistan, said members of the group should \"NEVER\" be allowed in the U.S.\n\nNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country.
