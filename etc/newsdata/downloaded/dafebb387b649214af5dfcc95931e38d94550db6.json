We should be talking about Stephen Strasburg and Anthony Rendon and that Juan Soto homer to the moon and the Game 7 that\u2019s happening in less than 24 hours.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about whether this play is reviewable or that play is something you can protest. We shouldn\u2019t be screenshotting parts of the rulebook to post on Twitter and waiting for Joe Torre to show up at the postgame press conference.\n\nAnd the umpires, we should never be talking about the umpires during the World Series. Something is wrong if we\u2019re talking about the umpires.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nYet here we are, on the eve of a Game 7, in the aftermath of a thrilling Game 6, talking about the interpretation of interference calls at first base instead of this seven-game thrill ride the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals have given us the past week.\n\nThis should be an exciting moment for baseball. Instead, it\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nGame 7 should be an entry point for the casual fan, but if they saw this moment from Game 6, they were probably left scratching their head \u2014 or even worse, they turned to a different channel or opened a different app and thought, \u201cThis is why it\u2019s hard to watch baseball these days.\u201d You even had Kate Upton wondering what was taking so long and Bryce Harper wanting his old manager to step in the ring with the umpires. This was not baseball\u2019s finest moment.\n\nFrankly, MLB should be thrilled it only has one highlight to worry about and not the credibility of an entire World Series. Because that\u2019s how this was looking.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrea Turner, in the seventh inning, with the Nats clinging to a 3-2 lead, hit a chopper that didn\u2019t even go back to the pitcher\u2019s mound. Brad Peacock fielded it and threw to first. Turner is speedy, so it was a close play, and Peacock\u2019s throw wasn\u2019t exactly on target, which is why we\u2019re having this conversation. If you watched the play in realtime, nothing seemed particularly wrong \u2014 except the ball wasn\u2019t caught. It didn\u2019t look like interference to the naked eye.\n\nTurner ran fast and straight. The ball hit him as first baseman Yuli Gurriel stretched into the baseline. His glove was knocked off by Turner as the ball rolled into the outfield. The Nats appeared to have runners on second and third with nobody out, a prime opportunity to put the game away.\n\nBut then Turner was shockingly called out. Umpire Sam Holbrook had decided that Turner interfered with the throw. The umpires eventually huddled, put on their headsets and called the review booth, which took five minutes and when it was over, nothing had changed. Except there was even more confusion and contempt.\n\nRendon came up and hit a homer shortly after the debate. The Nats went ahead 5-2, eventually won 7-2 and the whole issue is moot save for the face-palming it caused.\n\nThat will save MLB from having a DEFCON-level-Saints problem on its hands. But there was clearly chaos on the field, including that five-minute delay and confusion about what was challenge-able and what wasn\u2019t. The ordeal left enough fans confused that baseball has to take this as a learning moment.\n\nBecause when the game eludes common sense and makes us question our own eyes, something is wrong.\n\nAs we learned more about the decision after the game \u2014 unlike football, they don\u2019t explain these things on the field afterward \u2014 at issue was that Turner was running inside the baseline, not in the three-foot runner\u2019s lane approaching first base. He wasn\u2019t out of the baseline, he just wasn\u2019t \u201cprotected.\u201d That\u2019s what made the play interference.\n\nThe umpire\u2019s union tweeted that the call was correct, not that you\u2019d expect anything else. Joe Torre, MLB\u2019s chief baseball officer, said it was the right call and pointed to the fact that Turner knocked off Gurriel\u2019s glove.\n\nTurner argued after the game, that he just hit the ball and ran in a straight line, so how could that be interference? That logic seems to hold up.\n\n\"I mean, what else do you do? I don't know,\u201d Turner told Mark Zuckerman of MASN after the game. \u201cThe batter's box is in fair territory. First base is in fair territory. I swung. I ran a straight line. I got hit with the ball. I'm out. I don't understand it. I could understand if I veered one way or the other. I didn't.\"\n\nTrea Turner #7 of the Washington Nationals is called out on runner interference for colliding with Yuli Gurriel #10 of the Houston Astros during the seventh inning in Game Six of the 2019 World Series.

Even in the age of replay, incorrect calls still slip by. What\u2019s troubling is when baseball looks confusing \u2014 and confused itself.\n\nAnd even worse when the clock is ticking and nobody knows what\u2019s happening.\n\nWas it a review? Turns out it wasn\u2019t, because the interference call is a judgment call and not reviewable. Were the Nationals protesting? They wanted to, but they told you can\u2019t protest a judgment call either. So what the heck took so long?\n\nTorre said the umpires went to their headsets just to double-check everything. But he also blamed it on Nationals manager Dave Martinez being \u201cout of control.\u201d (He would later be ejected). Torre said managers can ask umpires to call the review booth if they think a rule isn\u2019t being interpreted correctly, which is what happened here.\n\nMartinez had cooled down by the end of the game and didn\u2019t want to talk much about his clash with the umpires or his interpretation of the events. But Astros manager A.J. Hinch said something most fans could identify with.\n\n\u201cIt took a really long time for nothing to happen,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cI knew the rule, what he called, an interference. It's not a reviewable call. You can't protest it. You can't really do anything, and yet they go to the headset.\u201d\n\nAnd we didn\u2019t even get a good explanation of what so long.\n\n\u201cI don't know if it was the noise or whatever it was,\u201d Torre said. \u201cI know we had a hard line in our box and we had trouble reaching people because we tried to make some calls, we couldn't do it. It should never be that long. That's unfortunate. And certainly, we have to take ownership of that. But it shouldn't have been that long.\u201d\n\nBaseball has given us a number of modern rules that aren\u2019t easy for fans to parse. It feels like you need to pass a pre-requisite class before you can understand the catcher\u2019s interference rule or the rule about sliding into second base. At least those rules mean well. They\u2019re about protecting players and have a few layers of nuance.\n\nBut what about this? Can anybody really watch that play happen, hear the explanation of the rule and muster anything other than a shrug and \u201cUhh, OK, are you sure?\u201d\n\nWe sports fans don\u2019t ask for much relative to the time, money and eventual heartbreak we devote to this hobby of ours. We just want some semblance of order when these things happen. We want them figured out in a timely manner. We want the players \u2014 not the umpires \u2014 deciding the most important moments.\n\nAnd we want to believe our own eyes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
