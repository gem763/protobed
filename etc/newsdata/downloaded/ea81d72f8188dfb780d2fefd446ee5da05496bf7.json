She found out the hard way.\n\nWalker shot rounds of 85 and 74 at the Senior LPGA Championship.\n\nThat was before she had to add 42 penalty shots to her opening round in French Lick, Indiana, and 16 more to the second round, giving her scores of 127 and 90.\n\nWalker says she wasn\u2019t aware that caddies no longer can stand behind players as they putt unless a player starts the stance over. She didn\u2019t realize it until midway through her second round Tuesday, and then she had to add a two-shot penalty for every time it happened.\n\nLPGA rules official Marty Robinson said another caddie in the group informed Walker of the rules infraction and the golfer then brought the situation to an official\u2019s attention on the 14th hole (her fifth), Robinson told Golfweek.\n\n\u201cWe had her recreate the times that that happened,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nIt goes in the books as a 127 in the first round \u2013 with a birdie on her last hole.\n\nThe USGA and R&A implemented a change that went into effect on 1 January prohibiting caddies from lining up a player on the putting surface under Rule 10.2b.\n\nWalker made her LPGA debut in 1995 and played 13 years on the tour.", "description": "Walker says she wasn\u2019t aware that caddies no longer can stand behind players as they putt unless a player starts the stance over \u2013 and she paid a dear price", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c16ced0c6923f52ab141a37c0f2f8af18c6d6d/251_242_2711_1627/master/2711.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20b85ede233b66c38e86a162ae5dda4f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
