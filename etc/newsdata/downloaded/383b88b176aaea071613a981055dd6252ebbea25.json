(the world need two of you). [sic].\n\n'I HATE being made to feel I should be a mother': Ellie Goulding, 32, claimed on Instagram she has to field 'non-stop' questions about babies two months after marrying Caspar Jopling\n\nShe wrote back: Not particularly [grimace emoji]. As you can imagine it's been a non stop question.\n\n'I hate being made to feel like that's what I'm supposed to be doing on this earth. I guess technically I am. But I see things differently in today's world.'\n\nEllie's wedding to Caspar, 27, was a lavish one and no doubt people mean well when they ask if she is planning to expand her family.\n\nShe said: 'I hate being made to feel like that's what I'm supposed to be doing on this earth. I guess technically I am. But I see things differently in today's world'\n\nSomething to say: Ellie gave her point of view during an Ask Me Anything section on Instagram stories on Monday evening\n\nThe likes of Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry, Sienna Miller and James Blunt, as well as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, were all in attendance on her special day.\n\nThe wedding party then let their hair down at a reception hosted at stately home Castle Howard.\n\nThe congregation were also treated to an eccentric sermon by John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, which finished with him uncorking a bottle of prosecco as a symbol of the newlyweds\u2019 \u2018exhilarating love\u2019.\n\nEllie recently took to social media to shine a light on mental health.\n\nShe said: 'Sorry this is a little late, but I really wanted to say something about Mental Health Awareness, for what it's worth. We all have a right to feel what we do, whatever it is, whoever we are.\n\n'Exhilaration, madness, absolutely nothing at all, confusion, chronic sadness... (I can sometimes feel all these things in the space of a few days).\n\n'I am beyond relieved that more light is being shone on the complexity of going from being a touring artist/ performer to going straight back to normality on a regular basis. Thank you to those artists who have spoken so candidly about it lately.\n\n'I know I chose this job but nothing could have prepared me for the ups and downs that come with it.\n\n'I know for sure that a lot of my anxiety has come from what they call \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d not believing in myself enough and thinking that I don't deserve happiness which sometimes results in sabotaging your own success.'", "description": "She married the 'love of her life' art dealer, Caspar Jopling at York Minster on August 31.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20029796-0-image-a-81_1571739205230.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
