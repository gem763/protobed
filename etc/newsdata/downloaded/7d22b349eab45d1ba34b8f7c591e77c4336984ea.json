Furthermore, he shoots well with both feet.\n\nHe has slotted in seamlessly in a team which has other young talents in attack. Not least the 21-year-old Jonathan Ikon\u00e9, a quick and skillful player who scored on his France debut and set up another goal in the next match during the recent international break.\n\nIkon\u00e9 grew up in the same Paris suburb as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 - they are friends from their days living in Bondy.\n\nIkon\u00e9 netted only three times last season as P\u00e9p\u00e9 did most of the scoring, but now Ikon\u00e9 can take up a far greater role in attack.\n\nSo too can Luiz Araujo, a Brazilian forward with pace, skill and passing ability in abundance.\n\nHe showed this in Friday night\u2019s 2-1 home win against Angers, starting the move which led to Osimhen\u2019s goal with a brilliant turn and sprint from the halfway line after controlling a long pass with opponents on his back.\n\n\u201cLast season his path was barred by Nicolas (P\u00e9p\u00e9). He\u2019s gained in maturity,\u201d Lille coach Christophe Galtier said. \u201cI sensed it was the right moment for him to express himself. The team needs Luiz.\u201d\n\nWaiting in the wings at Lille is 19-year-old Timothy Weah - the son of Liberia President and former PSG and AC Milan striker George Weah.\n\nLEAKY LYON\n\nAfter scoring nine goals in two opening wins many observers were talking up Lyon\u2019s prolific attack.\n\nBut while forwards Memphis Depay and Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 shared the headlines, the Lyon defense had yet to be tested.\n\nIt has been now and the result is Lyon collecting only two points from the past three games - losing one and twice conceding leads to draw the match.\n\nFriday\u2019s 2-2 draw at Amiens, which equalized in injury time following a hurried Lyon clearance, exposed deficiencies in Lyon\u2019s defense.\n\nImposing Danish defender Joachim Andersen - signed from Italian side Sampdoria for 30 million euros - was too often caught out of position and passed the ball out poorly from the back. Yet he did not get nearly enough protection from midfield.\n\nLyon\u2019s lineup looked split in two, with the midfield and fullbacks pushing up constantly to support the forwards and leaving huge gaps for the center halves to cover.\n\nJeff Reine-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde set up one of the goals for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 but, just like fellow midfielder Houssem Aouar, he did not track back enough.\n\nLyon\u2019s new coach Sylvinho - a former left back with Arsenal and Spanish giant Barcelona - will hope for very quick improvement from his players.\n\nThey face Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by French champion Paris Saint-Germain at home on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "While Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 awaits his first goal since joining Arsenal for a club-record fee, his former team Lille has found another scoring talent in Victor Osimhen.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
