There's not really anywhere else to go.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\n\n\"At the time [I moved in] I was desperate for accommodation, but I was pretty appalled. I couldn't quite believe the prospect of spending a year there.\"\n\nHe added it was \"not an appropriate living standard for a human being\".\n\nAnd another student, Jack Fifield, who writes for the university's student magazine, said he had heard complaints the housing fees were too expensive.\n\nThe university has said it will be evaluating the value for money of the new units.\n\nMr Fifield told the BBC: \"They [the university] say it's a pilot scheme but they shouldn't be testing it on live students. They need to reduce the rent and retroactively refund them.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nAlso speaking to the BBC, a university spokesperson said the pods had been \"used successfully elsewhere, including student accommodation at other universities\".\n\nThe spokesperson said the flats provided students with the opportunity to live on campus during their first year.\n\n\"We are working closely with the students living in this accommodation to respond to their feedback,\" they said.\n\n\"This will be used to inform our future accommodation plans and to see whether the pilot may be extended beyond this academic year.\"\n\nThe university's vice chancellor, Steve West, has offered to meet with students living in the pods.\n\n\"We are trying to create communities for the increasing number of students who want to live on campus,\" he said.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\"The pilot picked up on the need for social space: [a new communal area] is being built and will be on site soon.\"\n\nUWE said it had plans to build a range of 2,000 additional student rooms on the campus, which would be ready by 2022.", "description": "The pods measuring just 8x10ft were installed in the grounds of University of West of England (UWE), in Bristol", "authors": ["Sarah Lumley", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708062.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_UWE_PODS_009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
