Bruce\u2019s visit to Anfield, where he scored two own goals on his Norwich debut, pits him against one player he did buy for Hull, Andy Robertson, and another, Mo Salah, who slipped through his extensive Egyptian scouting net.\n\n\u201cVirgil van Dijk: wow, what a player,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cWe all know how good Liverpool are up front but signing him and the keeper [Alisson] gave Liverpool the backbone they needed, just took them to the next level.\n\nAlisson will not be back for Liverpool before mid-October, says J\u00fcrgen Klopp Read more\n\n\u201cI could have taken him [Van Dijk] to Hull. I had dinner with Kenny Dalglish and the owner of Celtic, Dermot Desmond, in Barbados \u2013 I\u2019m name-dropping now \u2013and Desmond was waxing lyrical about the best players he\u2019s had. He was saying: \u2018[Henrik] Larsson is definitely, definitely the best I\u2019ve seen play for Celtic in my ownership but what I can\u2019t understand is nobody has gone for Van Dijk.\u2019\n\n\u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s interesting, he\u2019s seen a lot of football over the last 12 years,\u2019 so I tried to get him before he went to Southampton but I had no chance.\u201d\n\nBruce did, however, end up signing a young Harry Maguire from Sheffield United, the defender eventually leaving Hull for Leicester before this summer joining Manchester United. Even so, Robertson arguably proved his best buy by the Humber.\n\n\u201cStan Ternent, my chief scout at the time, said: \u2018I\u2019ve just seen this kid at Dundee \u2013 we\u2019ve got to take him,\u2019\u201d said Bruce, who has lost the midfielder Sean Longstaff to a freak ankle injury but hopes to have Andy Carroll back in full training next week. \u201cWe did our homework. I went to see him and we took him. It was a little bit of a gamble.\n\n\u201cI remember him arriving with his mum, holding her hand. To be fair to him, we had a couple of injuries, I threw Andy in and he had an unbelievable debut against QPR. He hasn\u2019t looked back, has he?\u201d\n\nDespite Bruce regularly visiting Cairo on scouting missions he never attempted to sign Salah. \u201cI took a few from Egypt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I missed him.\u201d", "description": "The Newcastle manager, Steve Bruce, said he tried to sign Virgil van Dijk when he was in charge of Hull City", "authors": ["Louise Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b479314c8fd958d1b4bb7843d013b4c5190bbb1b/0_218_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b01ef9df0007d4cfea2774a1b7c065a", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
