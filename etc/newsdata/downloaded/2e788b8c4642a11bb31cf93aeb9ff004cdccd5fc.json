She lives in London.\n\nAs a girl, I didn't dream of baking. You get that typical story, where it's all someone ever wanted to do, but that's not me.\n\nThe earliest memory I have is of making those boxed ready-mix cupcakes with younger siblings on a Sunday morning, at 14, while my mum napped.\n\nAfter school, I didn't know what to do. So I tried an art foundation course in Leeds. It was here that I became obsessed with baking. It started in Freshers' Week, as a way to make friends. Soon I was experimenting at every opportunity.\n\nGeorgia Green, 28, (pictured) founded the bespoke cake art brand, Georgia's Cakes, in 2015, and today, sells cakes in Harrods and online to a number of high-profile celebrities\n\nHowever, I had no idea you could get paid for it, so I went on to study animation at uni in London. Then I saw an advert for a Cordon Bleu open day. I went and loved it. I quit uni and signed up to their patisserie course in September 2012.\n\nMy first job was at a deli in North London. I was making salads and quiches, but desserts, too.\n\nAnd I became known as the 'cake girl' by customers, who started ordering bespoke designs directly from me.\n\nThis was my light bulb moment. I set up a website for Georgia's Cakes. Every cake was unique: I used my training to make extra meringues, macarons and chocolates to go on top, turning them into edible art.\n\nYet, it was still a hobby. Until, in October 2014, a friend who worked at designer label DKNY asked me to make a cake for a launch party with Cara Delevingne \u2014 at four days' notice.\n\nI didn't really know who she was! It was my sister Louisa who said: 'She's going to be the next top model. You have to set up an Instagram account, as she's going to 'tag' you.'\n\nAfter working at a deli store in London, she set up a website for Georgia's Cakes and ensured every cake was unique\n\nLuckily I did, and overnight I went from a handful of followers to 6,000! I got so many orders that I had to quit my job to go full-time in 2015.\n\nToday, I sell in Harrods and online. My art cakes (from \u00a3150) have been brought by celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and model Suki Waterhouse. I run private workshops, and do tutorials on YouTube and Instagram.\n\nI'm passionate about changing the face of baking, and bringing it to younger generations. It's amazing when someone messages me saying: 'Help! My buttercream is melting.' Trust me, I've been there. And I'll always try to help.", "description": "Georgia Green, 28, \nfounded the bespoke cake art brand, Georgia's Cakes, in 2015, and today, sells cakes in Harrods and online to a number of high-profile celebrities.", "authors": ["Florence Scordoulis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/20/19964338-0-image-a-10_1571600392262.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
