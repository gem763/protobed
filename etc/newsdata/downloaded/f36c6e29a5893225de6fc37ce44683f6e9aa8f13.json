REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday called U.S. Senator Mitt Romney a \u201cpompous ass\u201d after his sharp critique of the president\u2019s push for other nations to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic political rival.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning,\u201d Trump wrote of his fellow Republican on Twitter.\n\nTrump once again defended as \u201cappropriate\u201d a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which has triggered a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, and said his call for China to investigate Biden and his son Hunter was linked to corruption, not politics.\n\n\u201cIf Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cHe is so bad for R\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRomney was the Republican presidential nominee who lost to Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. On Friday, Romney said Trump\u2019s actions regarding Biden were \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney said on Twitter on Friday. \u201cBy all appearances, the president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump on Saturday called U.S. Senator Mitt Romney a \"pompous ass\" after his sharp critique of the president's push for other nations to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic political rival.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437424586&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940ET", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
