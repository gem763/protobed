That, analysts say, has long been a central goal of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nBut regional analysts say it\u2019s wrong to cast Ankara as a NATO partner in the traditional sense, even before the invasion of northern Syria. They point to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile system over strong U.S. objections as an example of why the country\u2019s NATO status should be reassessed.\n\n\u201cI think the talking points of many in the U.S. government are a little bit lagging behind reality,\u201d said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a leading Washington-based foreign policy think tank.\n\n\u201cThey really are a NATO partner in name but not reality. They\u2019re not acting like a NATO ally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we pretend they are a wonderful, reliable ally in good standing when they are not, the more we\u2019re going to see Erdogan taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Erdogan seems to have correctly calculated that the U.S. is unwilling to confront its NATO ally militarily. Mr. Trump, a frequent NATO critic, stressed Wednesday that while he opposes the Turkish invasion of Syria, it would be foolish to drive a wedge between the alliance for the sake of saving the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led group that fought with U.S. forces to defeat the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cSyria doesn\u2019t want Turkey to take its land. I can understand that,\u201d the president said during a press conference alongside Italian President Sergio Mattarella. \u201cBut what does that have to do with the United States of America if they\u2019re fighting over Syria\u2019s land? Are we supposed to fight a NATO member in order that Syria, who is not our friend, keeps their land? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nTurkey has its own gripes. Ankara said it has borne the brunt of Middle Eastern chaos \u2014 from the fallout of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 to the housing of millions of Syrian refugees from that country\u2019s civil war \u2014 with little help from its allies. Turkey\u2019s long-standing hopes of joining the European Union have also been rejected repeatedly.\n\nTurks complain that the U.S. and Western European powers do not appreciate the threat that Kurdish separatism has posed to the state and the dangers that Kurdish militants on the Syrian side of the border pose to national stability.\n\nMr. Erdogan has reacted furiously to talk of economic and military sanctions in the U.S. and Europe in response to his incursion into Syria.\n\nMr. Trump has urged Mr. Erdogan to pull back on his Syrian offensive and this week dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials to meet with their Turkish counterparts in the hopes of hammering out a deal. Thus far, however, Turkey has given little indication that it will stand down even as a new alliance among the Kurds, Russia and Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government forces mount fierce counterattacks.\n\nA key NATO cog\n\nDespite Turkey\u2019s provocations and sometimes choppy relationship with NATO \u2014 including its long-standing tensions with Greece \u2014 the country is inarguably a key cog in the 29-member alliance for a host of reasons.\n\nTurkey\u2019s geography alone makes it a vital partner because it serves as a bridge for Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The Muslim-majority nation also controls the path to the Black Sea, the headquarters of Russia\u2019s naval fleet, and is the only NATO power sharing a border with Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\nThe U.S. and its NATO partners use the Incirlik Air Base in southeast Turkey as a critical staging area and access point to the Middle East, including an estimated arsenal of some 50 U.S. nuclear weapons. The New York Times reported this week that U.S. officials are developing contingency plans for removing the nuclear weapons if instability in the region deepens.\n\nMore broadly, some regional analysts say kicking Turkey out of NATO would drive it closer to Russia and shift the power dynamic in the region.\n\nTurkey has the second-largest army of all NATO nations behind the U.S., making it an irreplaceable ally should the alliance find itself in a major war with Russia. It is one of a minority of NATO allies meeting Mr. Trump\u2019s cherished threshold of 2% of gross domestic product for defense spending.\n\n\u201cThey occupy some very critical real estate for NATO,\u201d said retired Army Gen. Thomas Spoehr, now director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cThey have a very large, very capable ground army.\u201d\n\nNATO leaders have condemned Turkey\u2019s offensive in Syria but have dismissed the notion of removing the country from the alliance.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s better to have Turkey inside NATO than outside NATO, to be honest. I think it\u2019s important to have them in our family and discussion,\u201d Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said this week.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has urged the Erdogan government to show restraint but has resisted any direct criticism of a key alliance member. NATO as an alliance, he noted, has no role in the Syria clash.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t quieted talk in Washington questioning Turkey\u2019s NATO membership. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, and House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat, have floated the idea of suspending or expelling Turkey from the alliance.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he had warned his Turkish counterparts just ahead of the invasion that an attack on the Kurdish positions \u201cwill damage U.S. relations with Turkey, their staying in NATO.\u201d\n\nEven as the White House and congressional leaders weigh powerful economic sanctions on Turkey in response to the Syria incursion, U.S. business groups are warning that a collapse of the relationship between the two countries could have far-reaching financial repercussions.\n\n\u201cThe recent deterioration in the relationship between the United States and its NATO ally, Turkey, an important strategic and commercial partner, is profoundly concerning,\u201d Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe U.S.-Turkey relationship has proven its value over the years, and every effort should be made to preserve its benefits for both countries.\u201d\n\nGrowing rifts\n\nAlthough the relationship is vital from a geopolitical point of view, critics say, Turkey can no longer be trusted. Mr. Erdogan has soundly rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for a cease-fire in Syria and announced Wednesday that he will travel to Moscow and talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the crisis \u2014 another sign of the growing partnership between the two nations.\n\nThat relationship took a major step forward this year when Turkey brushed off American warnings and purchased the Russian S-400 missile system. As a result, Turkey was ejected from the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 development program. American military officials said the two systems were not compatible and that the presence of the S-400 in Turkey could endanger U.S. national security.\n\nEven as the Syria crisis raged this week, Turkey continued other provocative actions in Europe, including a natural gas drilling effort off the coast of Cyprus. The European Union has called the energy exploration in Cypriot waters illegal.\n\nThe U.S. has accused Turkish banks of evading economic sanctions on Iran, and the Erdogan government has fiercely denounced U.S. sanctions programs targeting Iran and Venezuela.\n\nDespite all of that, Turkey\u2019s status in NATO seems all but guaranteed. Even with the will, analysts say, it\u2019s not clear there is a way to oust a recalcitrant ally.\n\n\u201cThere is no mechanism under the North Atlantic Treaty to evict a member,\u201d Mr. Bowman said.\n\nHe said NATO members could invoke Article 4 of the treaty, which allows for top-level consultations if \u201cin the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly a credible case could be made that their actions in Syria are threatening members of the alliance,\u201d Mr. Bowman said.\n\nOn the flip side, Mr. Erdogan has argued in recent days that all member states should be coming to his aide in the face of attacks from the Russia-Assad-SDF axis and long-standing terrorist threats from Kurdish foes.\n\n\u201cWe are a NATO ally. Please note that these countries are all NATO countries,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWhose side should they be on, according to Article 5?\u201d\n\nArticle 5 states that an attack on one member of NATO constitutes an attack on all members.\n\nAnalysts generally think NATO will survive in its current form \u2014 with Turkey in the fold.\n\n\u201cNATO is bigger and more enduring than this current spat we\u2019re having,\u201d Mr. Spoehr said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
