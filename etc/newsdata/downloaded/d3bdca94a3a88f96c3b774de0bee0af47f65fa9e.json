This was some of the best darts I\u2019ve seen from Dave and he never gave in.\n\n\u2018He had a great tournament and he played really well and pushed me, but every time in the important moments I did the right thing \u2013 and I think going 3-1 up was a big moment.\n\n\u2018I feel good and I want to keep this form going now into the big tournaments we have coming up.\n\n\u2018Everyone writes me off, but when I put in a performance like that it means a lot.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never won that [the Champions League] so it\u2019s going to be an important one, it\u2019s on my bucket list. So I need to make sure I keep my focus for a few days.\u2019\n\nSo happy to win this title for the fifth time. It is a special one for me. Dave Chisnall is a quality player and threw a lot at me in the final but tonight and all week I have been good in the big moments \u2013 and that's why I am holding the trophy again \ud83c\udfc6https://t.co/tDWwSJcVWF \u2014 Michael Van Gerwen (@MvG180) October 12, 2019\n\nThe five-time Grand Prix champ added on Twitter: \u2018So happy to win this title for the fifth time.

The atmosphere was electric tonight and I think we made fantastic final for everyone watching there and at home.\n\nThanks also to my family, friends, management, sponsors & my fans.
