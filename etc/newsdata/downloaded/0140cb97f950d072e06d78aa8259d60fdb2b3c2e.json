That electability and support go hand-in-hand means that as support for a candidate drops, so does the perception that the candidate can win the general election. The correlation between the two, in other words, means electability is often just a trailing indicator of primary support anyway.\n\nFor former vice president Joe Biden, this was always a looming iceberg. If voters stopped thinking he was the best candidate to beat Trump next year \u2014 which they consistently seemed to think \u2014 what would happen to his support? Or, conversely (and probably more accurately): If voters stopped supporting him, what would happen to perceptions of his electability?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019re starting to get an answer to the second question.\n\nOn Monday, Quinnipiac University released a poll showing that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had taken a within-the-margin-of-error lead over Biden in national polling. In August, she trailed by 11 points. Now she leads by three.\n\nComparing the new results to August is more broadly instructive. At that point, Biden had an 11-point lead in support (shown on the vertical axis below) but a 37-point lead on the electability question (left to right). (Quinnipiac asks which candidate \u201chas the best chance\u201d of beating Trump.)\n\nThe lines show movement over time: When Biden stumbled badly against Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) in the first Democratic primary debate, his support and sense of electability fell, too, with Harris seeing quick gains on both points. Those gains for Harris have since evaporated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotice the diagonal dashed line. Biden had more support on electability in August (49 percent) than overall (32 percent), so his dot is below the diagonal line. Harris at that point was the first pick of 7 percent of Democrats and seen as the most electable by 6 percent, so she was right on the diagonal.\n\nHere\u2019s the shift that happened in the new poll.\n\nWarren had big gains in electability and support. Harris saw both decline.\n\nThe other two lines, though, don\u2019t show a link between the two. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) continued to hold steady on the level of support he sees \u2014 but the extent to which he\u2019s seen as electable continues to erode. Biden, meanwhile, has seen his overall support sink \u2014 but he has also maintained about the same level of electability.\n\nOverall, Warren\u2019s line looks the way you\u2019d expect based on what we\u2019ve seen in the past: up and to the right, gaining support and a sense of electability at the same time. Biden is hanging in there, though, still viewed as having the best chance against Trump by twice as many respondents in Quinnipiac\u2019s poll.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is national polling, not state polling, so it\u2019s not particularly predictive. But the implication is that the dominant existing calculus \u2014 Biden is most electable and, therefore, has the best shot \u2014 isn\u2019t as solid as might have been expected.\n\nBut, then, we shouldn\u2019t have expected those two things to be as tightly linked as they\u2019ve been presented. We said this in July and will say it again: Biden\u2019s 2020 may look more like Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 than her 2016.\n\nAD", "description": "A new Quinnipiac poll shows a big Warren lead despite Biden's electability edge.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QTnsOB-OfKAyc7i2nlvGBuudGPs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2B5WOSXNMUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
