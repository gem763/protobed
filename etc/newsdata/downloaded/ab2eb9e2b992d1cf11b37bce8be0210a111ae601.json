That will move to 80% by 2024 and 100% by 2030, Bezos said.\n\nThe company will also purchase 100,000 electric delivery vans from Michigan-based start-up Rivian, he said. Currently, all of Amazon's vans burn fossil fuels. Amazon has invested $400 million in Rivian, which also has backing from Ford.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos during the JFK Space Summit at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Wednesday, June 19, 2019.

I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to do it.\"\n\nAsked how Amazon's move to one-day or same-day delivery affects the environment, he defended the company's business model, saying that short delivery times require local warehouses and often can't be done by carbon-heavy planes.\n\n\"It actually turns out that as you increase the speed of delivery, you have less carbon,\" he said. \"That is counterintuitive.\"\n\nThousands of Amazon's own workers have signed onto a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, which organized a campaign to urge the company's shareholders to adopt a resolution forcing the company to take action.\n\nThe measure won the support of two independent shareholder advisory services but was rejected by investors in May.\n\nRebecca Sheppard, a senior product manager at Amazon who is active in Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, told USA TODAY recently that \"Amazon's paying attention\" \u2013 based on the company's recent actions, including an announcement involving plans to cut emissions from 50% of its packages.\n\n\"Being an employee is actually a great gift to change the industry for which you work,\" Sheppard said at the time. \"If you want to invoke change, the best way to do so is to go into the industry where you want to see the change and fight for it.\"\n\nSheppard added: \"It seems increasingly that being on the right side of the climate crisis is not a fringe issue. It\u2019s becoming more and more what shareholders and investors expect.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Amazon's Jeff Bezos: Amazon commits to renewable energy, electric vans", "description": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Thursday that the company has committed to meet the terms of the Paris climate agreement 10 years ahead of schedule.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dIH9O82tH_E6y0NFMzJ_.A--~B/aD0yMjM2O3c9MzQ1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/b87539e2592f6d1b805db8e77171bcab", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
