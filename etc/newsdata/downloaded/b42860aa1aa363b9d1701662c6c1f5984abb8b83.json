After the \"incredibly long\" process, he is happy to say that \"just about all the roles cast were people that we were hoping for.\"\n\n(TOUGH-AS-NAILS: James Gracie is Lemmer.

With the team deciding on the latter, it means that there will still be plenty of surprises that even those who read the book won't see coming.\n\n\"There are certain things, politically especially, that had to be changed,\" he says.\n\n(THE BOSS: Sandi Schultz is Janina Mentz.

Cape Town is just such a scenic and photogenic place.\"\n\nOther places the team explored were the Karoo and areas near to the Kruger National Park. \"I think we managed to portray all the beauty of South Africa in the series,\" he says.\n\nA big part of the series that has been hyped-up by the media is the big money shots, incredible effects and the stunt work that has gone into the production.\n\nDeon expresses how impressed he was with the cast when talking about those TV magic moments.\n\n\"A lot of very hard work and long nights went into those scenes. We consulted explosive experts, firearm experts, and the cast was just brilliant.\"\n\n\"A lot of the cast did specialised training with the weapons, as some of them had never worked with firearms before. There was a lot of work that went into that. Also, the international director brought a lot of expertise. But mostly I can tell you that it was very, very hard work.\"\n\n(MOM TURNED SPY: Rolanda Marais is Milla Strachan.

Not that the others aren't great,\" he laughs.\n\nWhen it comes to the high expectations that have been set for Trackers, Deon admits that along with excitement, it brings pressure.\n\n\"We compete with the best in the world, and the DSTV audience is privy to the best being produced in the world. We need to meet their expectations,\" he says.\n\n\"We are feeling the pressure, but I am really confident, and I think that the show came out great.\"\n\n(THE BAD GUY: Sisanda Henna is iNkunzi.
