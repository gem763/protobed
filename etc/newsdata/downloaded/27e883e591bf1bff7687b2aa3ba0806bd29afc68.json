They're going to get a break.\"\n\nIn the south, winds will abate a little later in the afternoon, he said.\n\n\"But late Tuesday through Thursday, the winds are back and in some areas can be more extreme than before,\" he said. \"We have the potential for the strongest Santa Ana (southern) winds of the year.\"\n\nWind gusts can be between 50-to-60 mph, with some significantly higher, he said. \"It's going to be bad.\"\n\nThe northern California wine country has borne the brunt of the fires, with 84 square miles (21,756 hectares) burned and 190,000 people evacuated in the so-called Kincade fire.\n\nOnly about 5% of that fire was contained early on Monday after crews lost ground against the wind-driven wildfire a day earlier.\n\nAbout 3,000 people were battling the Kincade Fire, the worst of more than a dozen major blazes that have damaged or destroyed nearly 400 structures and prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a statewide emergency.\n\n\"All hands are focusing on the Kincade,\" Newsom told reporters after meeting residents at an evacuation center in the Sonoma County city of Petaluma, calling the blaze \"the most stubborn challenge we face\".\n\nInvestigators have not yet said what they believed caused the blaze, although it ignited near a broken wire on a Pacific Gas & Electric transmission tower.\n\nPOWER OUTAGES\n\nHigh wind forecasts prompted utility Pacific Gas & Electric Corp to shut off power to about 940,000 customers in 43 counties on Saturday night to guard against the risk of touching off wildfires.\n\nBut PG&E Expects to issue a weather \"All Clear\" for safety inspections and restoration work to begin early Monday morning for Northern Sierras and North Coast, the company announced early Monday.\n\nThe governor has been sharply critical of PG&E, saying corporate greed and mismanagement kept it from upgrading its infrastructure while wildfire hazards have steadily worsened over the past decade. PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in January citing billions of dollars in civil liabilities from deadly wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018, says it has since remedied problems experienced with its website and customer call center.\n\nNewsom said crews had largely \"gotten their arms around\" the Tick Fire near the city of Santa Clarita, some 35 miles (56 km) north of downtown Los Angeles, which has charred 4,615 acres (1,868 hectares) and destroyed 22 structures since Thursday.\n\nMost of the more than 40,000 residents ordered to evacuate were allowed to return home by Saturday afternoon, the county fire department said.
