And that\u2019s bad.", "language": "en", "text": "The economists are right, and the populists are wrong. Rent-control laws can be good for some privileged beneficiaries, who are often not the people who really need help. But they are bad for many others.\n\nThe California law would cap the rise in rents statewide to inflation plus 5 percent annually. Oregon would set the cap at inflation plus 7 percent. Mr. Sanders would restrict rent increases nationally to 3 percent or 1.5 times inflation, whichever is greater. To many struggling to afford housing in super-expensive parts of New York, San Francisco or the District, these plans no doubt sound great. Yet these cities already have rent-stabilization policies, and they have not worked.\n\nFor example, a March study from a group of Stanford University researchers shows that San Francisco\u2019s rent-stabilization efforts failed. It\u2019s true that the policy kept some residents\u2019 rents lower. But landlords responded by converting their buildings into condos they could sell or business properties they could lease without rent-control restrictions \u2014 or by demolishing their old buildings and replacing them with new ones that did not qualify for rent stabilization. Effects such as these drove down the supply of rental housing and, therefore, drove up rents across the city \u2014 by 5.1 percent.\n\nThese costs fell on those seeking to move into San Francisco or between apartments within the city. The city\u2019s housing tended to cater more to high-income condo-buyers or renters willing to pay top dollar for apartments in brand-new buildings. \u201cIt appears rent control has actually contributed to the gentrification of San Francisco, the exact opposite of the policy\u2019s intended goal,\u201d the researchers concluded.\n\nResearch also indicates that landlords have less incentive to maintain their properties in a rent-controlled environment. Governments can impose maintenance requirements on landlords \u2014 but they are tough to enforce. Depending on how the policy is designed, stiff rent-control policies with few exceptions could also discourage investors from building new homes, which would also constrain rental unit supply. And since rent-stabilization policies often tend to discourage people from moving, they harm worker mobility and the economic dynamism associated with it.\n\nIn the long run, the key to making housing more affordable is to build more homes. In desirable urban environments, that means more construction and more density than municipal policy \u2014 not to mention benighted NIMBY activism \u2014 often allows, which would also require better walking, biking and public transportation options in dense city centers. (To his credit, Mr. Sanders also embraces this policy.) This approach is not as bumper-sticker-ready as rent control. But it would be far more effective.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: A move to expand affordable housing weathers a storm\n\nMegan McArdle: The one issue every economist can agree is bad: Rent control\n\nCatherine Rampell: The far left is taking a page from its opponents\u2019 playbook\n\nDominic T.
