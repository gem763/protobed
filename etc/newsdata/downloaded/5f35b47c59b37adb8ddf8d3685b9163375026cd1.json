Trump has argued before that the strength of the dollar gives other countries an advantage over the US.\n\n\"We don't have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players), we have a Fed problem,\" Trump said. \"They don't have a clue!\"\n\nTrump has long lashed out against the Federal Reserve and its Chairman Jerome Powell, and has even repeatedly said that the Fed poses a bigger threat to the US than China.\n\nEven after the Fed handed down the first rate cut since the Great Recession in July, Trump was not pleased: the 25-basis-point cut, and Powell's calling it a \"mid-cycle adjustment,\" were not the right moves in his opinion, even though many economists disagree.\n\nTrump has said he wants the Fed to lower interest rates by a full percentage point as soon as possible. If the Fed cuts, Trump said on Friday, \"we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time.\"\n\nTrump also went after companies that are saying tariffs between the US and China are hurting business.\n\nHe said, \"Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management\u2026 and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!\"\n\nDozens of retailers, manufacturers, and technology companies in the US have spoken out against the tariffs, especially after Trump doubled down on plans to escalate the trade dispute with China further before the end of the year. The US is poised to increase the tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to 30% as of Sunday.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday ripped into the Federal Reserve on Twitter yet again, calling for further interest-rate cuts to weaken the dollar.\u00a0 ...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d67e1142e22af1206717a9b-2400/2019-08-29t142643z1lynxnpef7s1flrtroptp4poland-usa-5g.jpg"}
