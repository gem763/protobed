It runs the popular SteamVR platform, and it\u2019s partnered with HTC on the Vive system. But it hasn\u2019t actually produced a VR headset. That\u2019s changing with the Valve Index: a high-end, PC-tethered headset that starts shipping today.\n\nThe Valve Index is specialized and expensive even by VR\u2019s standards. It costs $999, which is more than twice as much as the $399 Oculus Rift or $499 HTC Vive. Like those systems, you\u2019ll need a gaming PC to use it. If you need convenience and portability, it\u2019s not the right choice. You can find headsets with higher resolutions or wider fields of view. But for people who spend a lot of time in VR, it offers solid visuals, thoughtful hardware design, and the coolest VR controllers on the market.\n\nOur review of Valve Index Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Good resolution and field of view\n\nComfortable, user-friendly headset\n\nAwesome controllers Bad Stuff Very expensive\n\nLighthouse setup is inconvenient\n\nStill tethered to a PC Buy for $999.00 from Steam\n\nThe Index uses the same \u201cLighthouse\u201d tracking system as the Vive, so it ships with two laser-emitting base stations that you\u2019ll need to mount in opposite corners of your play space. These are second-generation base stations, and Valve promises a few benefits over the Vive\u2019s 1.0 beacons \u2014 primarily, an expanded diagonal range of up to 10 by 10 meters if you use four of them. If you already have a Vive, you can save $250 by using its 1.0 base stations, but I haven\u2019t personally tried that mix.\n\nThe Lighthouse system makes sense for Valve, but it\u2019s still inconvenient\n\nI\u2019ve had fewer syncing problems with the 2.0 base stations than the 1.0 models, but they\u2019re still frustrating to set up, especially as Microsoft and Oculus have moved to more convenient front-mounted cameras, completely eliminating that setup. Valve has spent a long time fine-tuning its base station design, and the Index is aimed at people who have used these awkward systems for years, so it makes sense to stick with Lighthouse for them. But for anyone just getting into Valve\u2019s system, it\u2019s a frustrating hurdle.\n\nFurther, in standard home use, the new Lighthouses haven\u2019t offered a substantially better experience than Oculus inside-out tracking. I can reach completely behind my back without fear of losing tracking, but that\u2019s a fairly rare situation. And the tracking hasn\u2019t been flawless \u2014 the controllers have occasionally drifted for no obvious reason, although they usually recover quickly.\n\nA few Index features seem intended for developers. There are two front-facing cameras that can show you the outside world, but that\u2019s really not enough to justify the added weight. So when Valve says they can also be used for computer vision experiments, that makes a lot more sense. The front includes a little compartment (officially dubbed the \u201cfrunk\u201d) with a Type-A USB port, so tinkerers can plug in other devices.\n\nThe Index adopts great design elements from the Vive, Rift, and more\n\nBut the Index also adopts some great overall design elements from other headsets. It features a comfortably padded, helmet-like headband that tightens with a dial on the back, similar to HTC\u2019s alternative Vive head strap. You can adjust the distance between lenses to find the best focus, which is an excellent feature that Oculus controversially removed from the Rift. A dial lets you change the distance between your eyes and the lenses, giving you even more control over the image.\n\nSome people won\u2019t need these features \u2014 I\u2019m usually fine with less versatile headsets \u2014 but they help fulfill the Vive\u2019s promise of offering the best experience to the biggest number of users. The padded strap design simply feels great. The headset isn\u2019t the lightest I\u2019ve tried, but I felt all right after an hour or more in VR.\n\nLike several other companies, Valve is also experimenting with speaker-based audio systems. The Index features two speakers that look a lot like headphones, but they sit about an inch away from your ears, projecting sound without actually pressing against your head. That\u2019s very comfortable in long VR sessions, and it sounds richer and more realistically ambient than the Oculus Rift or Quest\u2019s strap-based speakers.\n\nThese headsets all share one basic problem, though: everybody can hear exactly what you\u2019re doing from several feet away. I\u2019m willing to accept that sacrifice on a cheaper product, and you can always plug your own headphones into the Index. But since the Index is a top-of-the-line system aimed at people who want loud, intense gaming experiences or who work in professional settings, I wish Valve had looked for a slightly more discreet solution.\n\nThe Index doesn\u2019t make any pretenses toward coziness, stylishness, or minimalism. It\u2019s a big, attention-grabbing black helmet covered in dials and sliders. The front features a slightly RoboCop-like strip of shiny plastic, which you can pull off to reveal the frunk. It\u2019s not my favorite aesthetic, and with its two cameras, it shares the \u201csad robot with giant forehead\u201d look of the Rift S. But Valve more than justifies its bulkiness. And while the design might be clunky, it certainly doesn\u2019t look or feel cheap \u2014 although that should really be taken for granted on a nearly $1,000 headset.\n\nI\u2019ve written previously about Valve\u2019s unique yet eminently practical new controllers. The Index controllers (previously called \u201cKnuckles\u201d) are strapped around your hands instead of held, and they look more like a sci-fi weapon than a remote or gamepad. A central stock detects individual finger motion and squeeze pressure, and its sensors can even tell when your hands are close to \u2014 but not quite touching \u2014 the controller. A more traditional top section includes an analog stick, two face buttons, and a little trackpad groove.\n\nWhen the Index controllers are used well, they can feel incredibly natural since you can open and close your hand naturally instead of relying on abstractions like a grip or trigger. The Index controllers enable some great interactions. There\u2019s an official Valve demo where you play rock-paper-scissors or test your handshake grip strength with a robot.\n\nDon\u2019t expect a lot of exclusive Index controller options\n\nAs I mentioned before, most game developers probably won\u2019t add lots of Index-specific interactions. It\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll get the same control schemes in a slightly different package. Fortunately, Vive and Rift games can be translated pretty well to the Index based on titles I\u2019ve tried with official support. You can play games seemingly without optimization, although sometimes they translate the controls in weird ways. Doom VFR puts its weapon wheel on the Index\u2019s basically two-directional trackpad, for instance.\n\nThe controllers\u2019 only major hardware issue is the lack of tactile feedback. When you\u2019re using it as a basic grip button, you don\u2019t get solid confirmation that you\u2019ve squeezed hard enough. So if you fail to pick something up in a game, it\u2019s not immediately clear why.\n\nThe Index\u2019s screen easily outstrips the Rift or Vive; at 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye, it\u2019s got the same resolution as the high-definition Vive Pro. You can find headsets with a bigger pixel count, including the HP Reverb. But as Road to VR has pointed out, the Reverb isn\u2019t a consumer-focused headset, and it uses clunky Windows Mixed Reality controllers. Images on the Index look smooth and bright, especially with refresh rates that can reach up to 120Hz. (There\u2019s an experimental 144Hz mode, which didn\u2019t feel like a noticeable improvement to me.) I\u2019ve seen some complaints about grayish-blacks due to the LCD display, but it\u2019s still a very impressive screen.\n\nI was using the Index with a recent, high-end Lenovo Legion gaming laptop, so I can\u2019t speak to its performance with a lower-powered gaming PC. In theory, you can use it with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD RX480 graphics card at the low end, but a GTX 1070 or higher is recommended.\n\nValve also promises a \u201ctypical\u201d field of view up to 20 degrees wider than the standard 100 to 110 degrees. Basically, the field of view depends on how far the Index\u2019s screen gets from your eyes. When you dial it all the way out, the Index has the same goggle-like effect you\u2019ll find in other headsets. As it gets closer, though, your peripheral vision starts filling out. Dialed all the way in, the Index\u2019s only compromise is a black half-circle at the very edge of the screen.\n\nI couldn\u2019t keep the lenses quite this close. The plastic rims dug into my forehead too much, despite buffering from the headset\u2019s padded mask. But even at a comfortable distance, my field of vision felt more natural and less limited.\n\nOverall, though, the Index is still offering first-generation VR. It\u2019s not qualitatively different from the Rift or Vive. You won\u2019t find features like eye tracking or exotic displays-within-displays to improve the resolution. After the wireless Oculus Quest, the cable feels more limiting than ever. And unlike a gaming PC or other hardware with a predictable development cycle, the Index isn\u2019t future-proof. We\u2019re nearing the end of Oculus\u2019 first-generation headset lineup, for instance. So in a few years, people might want very different things out of a VR system.\n\nThe Index isn\u2019t necessarily the \u201cbest\u201d VR headset \u2014 at least, not for everybody. Unless the price drops in the future, it\u2019s a product for people who play VR games very heavily, use headsets for professional work, or have a very large disposable income. But within those limitations, it delivers high-quality virtual reality with very few compromises.", "description": "The $999 Valve Index ships today.
