The test with Sharing Energy and eRex is scheduled to run until December 2019.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in August, Power Ledger has announced the completion of a joint trial of a blockchain-based system for post-FIT surplus power in Osaka in partnership with Japanese Kansai Electric Power.", "description": "Australian energy tech firm Power Ledger to run blockchain-enabled energy trading trial in Japan\u2019s Kanto region by December 2019", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80ZDg3NWNhMmJlYzE5YWM3ODdlNDU0OTJhZWM5ZmU2MS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
