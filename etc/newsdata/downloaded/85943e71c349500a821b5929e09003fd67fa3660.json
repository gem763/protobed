(Submitted by Erynn Moar)\n\nThe City of Winnipeg ordered a state of emergency itself hours later to access the resources to recover from a storm it estimated would cost the city tens of millions of dollars.\n\n\"We're working as hard as we can and as fast as we can to get safe, reliable power back to all Manitobans,\" Grewal said.\n\nThe public utility had no estimate for when lights would be flicked on for more than 30,000 residences and businesses without power Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe early snowstorm brought heavy snow, freezing rain and strong winds to the southern parts of the province, breaking trees still laden with leaves and downing power lines. Thousands of people have been without power since Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government and Canadian Red Cross is supporting the evacuations of 16 First Nations communities, predominantly in Winnipeg, but also in Brandon and Dauphin.\n\nVolunteers have been busy making an emergency shelter at the RBC Convention Centre in Winnipeg for as many as 1,000 evacuees. They would set up more cots if needed, said spokesperson Jason Small.\n\nOn the ground, Manitoba Hydro staff are working as long as 16 hours a day to fix a power network marred by a storm that was worse than expected, Grewal said.\n\nHydro has called other utilities to provide replacement towers, specialized electrical equipment and additional staff, she said.\n\n\"It is challenging to replace transmission towers. We are fortunate, though, that the utilities we're working with have equipment and we're already sourcing towers from our suppliers in Ontario,\" Grewal said.\n\nMany of the roads that staff have encountered are impassable.\n\n\"The challenge is the logistics to get that equipment to the locations we need given the limited access. That's our primary issue is access.\"\n\nManitoba Hydro says hundreds of hydro poles and transmission lines were damaged during a destructive, slow-moving storm. (Submitted by Manitoba Hydro)\n\nThousands evacuated\n\nClarke said between 14 and 16 First Nations are affected by power outages and bad weather. Of the roughly 15,000 people in those communities, around 5,000 people will probably be evacuated.\n\n\"Chiefs are also telling me their families, their people are scared, they're stressed,\" she said. \"It's very difficult for the leadership and the First Nations to deal with this. They're struggling to make sure their people are safe.\"\n\nTree branches weighed down by wet, heavy snow fell throughout Winnipeg late last week. (Bartley Kives/CBC)\n\nThe premier said the province has deployed around 200 pieces of heavy equipment, including private contractors, to clear roads and highways, but the progress has been slow because of drifting snow.\n\nAt the peak of the storm, roughly 2,700 kilometres of road were closed, Pallister said. He expects the majority of highways to reopen by the end of the day Sunday.\n\nHe said there's relief in sight, with no rain expected in the coming days and temperatures that are just above freezing.\n\n\"This means gradual melting and will reduce overland flooding potential in some parts of the province where we have seen significant rainfall and snowfall,\" he said.\n\nPallister added that rivers are expected to stay within their banks and they are deploying water-filled barriers as a precaution to protect vulnerable homes.", "description": "As many as 5,000 people may be evacuated from First Nations communities as Manitoba reels from a\u00a0snowstorm that\u00a0left tens of thousands of people without power at a time\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including the entire city of Portage la Prairie\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and\u00a0forced the province and capital city to declare\u00a0states of emergencies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320151.1571003497!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hydro-transmission-damaged.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
