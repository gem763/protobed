REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nInstead, because of standard White House protocol for handling phone calls between the president and other world leaders, a transcript is likely to be put together from written notes by U.S. officials who listen in.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday a \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of the July 25 call would be released on Wednesday. In it, the Republican president is alleged to have pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden, the U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner.\n\nThe transcript would show the call was \u201ctotally appropriate,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\nHowever, standard practice when a president is talking to a foreign leader is not to make a recording but to have at least two and sometimes more note-takers from the National Security Council (NSC) on the call, a former senior NSC official told Reuters.\n\nThose note-takers are themselves usually Central Intelligence Agency officers on assignment to the NSC, he said.\n\nTheir notes serve as the principal record of such calls, the former official said. He was not aware of any electronic recordings made by the U.S. government on calls between Trump and other world leaders.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence during the Obama presidency, said not only would any so-called transcript be based on notes, but it would also likely be incomplete because the note-takers usually do not include issues that could be controversial if they became public.\n\n\u201cTypically a note-taker will write notes about what the principal says in a fashion that does not embarrass their principal,\u201d said Farkas.\n\nA former White House senior official concurred there was unlikely to be a recording.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no physical recording but there are a lot of people listening and taking contemporaneous notes of these calls,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhen you read it, it looks almost like a transcript.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no comment.", "description": "Details from a phone call made by Donald Trump that has led the U.S. House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against the president isn't likely to come from a recording or be verbatim, former White House and national security officials say.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433524310&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N2CV", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
