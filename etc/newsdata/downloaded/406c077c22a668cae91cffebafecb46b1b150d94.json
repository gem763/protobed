It was the first time that so many Democratic presidential hopefuls have shared the same stage on one night.\n\nBut the attention was almost all focused on one candidate, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has emerged as the frontrunner after a slow and steady rise in her support, and who has crystallized her position in recent months as the party\u2019s intellectual and ideological center of gravity. Questions were framed around her policy positions, her past statements, her agenda; other candidates staked their claim to positions almost exclusively in relation to where Warren stands.\n\nEven on the rare occasions when Warren was not speaking, not directly being spoken to, and not being spoken about, her dominance hung over the conversation, making itself known in unexpected moments. At one point, a moderator, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, addressed another contender \u2013 the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar \u2013 by Warren\u2019s name. Klobuchar smiled and graciously deflected, but within minutes, she was bringing up Warren herself.\n\nWarren\u2019s new dominance reflects not only her slow but dramatic rise in the polls, where she is now besting the longtime establishment favorite, Joe Biden, but also a renewed Democratic political landscape in the wake of the opening of an impeachment inquiry against Trump in the House of Representatives. At the debate, the impeachment proceedings provided a brief opportunity for unity among the ideologically divided candidates, with a softball opening question about the inquiry providing all of them an opportunity to voice their distaste for Trump. But the unity ended there. From that point on, half of the stage dedicated themselves to the project of attempting to discredit Warren.\n\nRelated: Trump, abortion and attacks on Warren: the Democratic debate's key takeaways\n\nShe was attacked by Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg over how she plans to pay for Medicare for All. She was attacked by Andrew Yang over her plan to break up big tech and enforce a strict antitrust agenda. She was attacked by Kamala Harris, who alleged that Warren was hypocritical for, of all things, not calling on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account. She was attacked by Joe Biden for supposedly being \u201cvague\u201d on Medicare for All. She would have been attacked by Tulsi Gabbard for her lack of military experience, except Gabbard was cut off by a moderator.\n\nFor the most part, Warren weathered these attacks with patience, grace, and an agility in her rhetoric that rivals that of a gymnast on a balance beam. She refused to take the bait repeatedly offered to her by moderators and other candidates, who attempted to goad her into saying that she would raise taxes to cover Medicare for All. This denied her opponents a video clip that they could use to discredit her; instead, she hammered home the larger point that total costs would go down under her plan. She refused to get mired in the petty point of whether Twitter should suspend Trump\u2019s account; instead, she focused on how big tech companies have too much influence over our politics to go unregulated. She wouldn\u2019t concede Andrew Yang\u2019s dubious assertion that unregulated tech giants encourage innovation; instead, she focused on the ways that monopolies in all sectors of the economy \u2013 she cited agriculture and pharmaceuticals \u2013 need to be broken up to protect consumers.\n\nIt was a frontrunner\u2019s strategy, a deflection technique meant to avoid inconvenient commitments and stymie the attack strategies of her rivals. Warren made moral cases instead of economic ones, refusing to get bogged down in the kinds of specifics that can only be communicated poorly and haphazardly to voters within the confines of the contentious debate format. To make her case in a general election, she will have to become more willing to communicate the details of her multitudinous plans on a mass scale, more ready to get down to brass tacks on television and on the debate stage. But Tuesday\u2019s debate was her first as the object of rivals\u2019 ire \u2013 before tonight, her opponents had more or less held their fire against her. The discipline and poise she showed in this new role bodes well for her performance in a general election against the erratic and taunting Trump. He will bait her and goad her, and she will be able to calmly and convincingly remain on message.", "description": "Warren weathered attacks from opponents with patience, grace and an agility in her rhetoric that rivals that of a gymnast on a balance beam \u2018The attention was almost all focused on one candidate.\u2019 Photograph: John Minchillo/APOn Tuesday night, 12 candidates crammed on to the stage at Ohio\u2019s Otterbein", "authors": ["Moira Donegan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/alZ4rCoo2oYAQFyML3bN0g--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/555aa77a7f9e6576d3de4575457cd2d0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
