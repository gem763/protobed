Having returned after a season in the second division, it is now facing the prospect of going right back to the lower tier.\n\nNew coach Achim Beierlorzer was supposed to lead the side to midtable stability and even perhaps a European qualification place, but the 51-year-old faces a huge challenge to turn his team\u2019s fortune around after Sunday\u2019s 4-0 loss at home to Hertha Berlin.\n\nAfter a tough series of games against the likes of Bayern Munich, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund, Cologne fans had been hopeful of the first win of the season against Hertha, which only ended its poor start to the season with a win over last-place Paderborn the week before.\n\nIt was the Cologne\u2019s third home game of the season, but a series of setbacks soon spoiled the party atmosphere.\n\nMidfielder Dominick Drexler got injured in the sixth minute, then Javairo Dilrosun scored for the visitors and defender Jorge Mer\u00e9 was sent off before the break after an intervention by video review.\n\n\u201cEverything that could go wrong, went wrong,\u201d goalkeeper Timo Horn said. \u201cDrexler injured himself with his first touch, we defended badly before the first goal, and it doesn\u2019t get any easier when you\u2019re chasing a game with a player less.\u201d\n\nHertha substitute Vedad Ibisevic came on in the second half and promptly scored two goals before Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata completed the rout.\n\n\u201cIt was actually a good game,\u201d Cologne sporting director Armin Veh said of what had been an encouraging performance before Dilrosun scored in the 23rd. \u201cWe were too sloppy for the goals.\u201d\n\nVeh appeared resigned to a relegation battle with fellow promoted sides Paderborn and Union Berlin.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re in a fight for survival,\u201d said Veh, adding he was convinced \u201cwe will do better and get our points.\u201d\n\nCologne has three points from its win in Freiburg. It has the league\u2019s worst attack with four goals scored.\n\nIts next game is Saturday at Schalke, which is on a four-game winning streak and ended former leader Leipzig\u2019s unbeaten start to the season on Saturday.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S BUNDESLIGA\n\nLeague leader Wolfsburg displayed its might by crushing Jena 8-1 at home in the women\u2019s Bundesliga on Sunday.\n\nPernille Harder scored a hat trick in Wolfsburg\u2019s rout as the defending league and cup champions maintained their perfect start to the season in impressive fashion. Wolfsburg has scored 21 goals and conceded two in five wins from five games.\n\nBayern Munich, Hoffenheim and Frankfurt kept pace with wins on Sunday.\n\nLina Magull scored twice in Bayern\u2019s 4-0 win at home over bottom side Duisburg, which has lost all of its games.\n\nThe 23-year-old Tabea Wa\u00dfmuth scored four goals in Hoffenheim\u2019s 5-1 win at Freiburg. Frankfurt defeated visiting Cologne 1-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cologne's new mascot, a handsome goat named Hennes IX, has not brought good luck to the promoted German side so far.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/germany_bundesliga_soccer_47122_c0-337-3516-2387_s1770x1032.jpg?209db0063dbf9d6433de3c18c03a2dfa5d5acc4b", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
