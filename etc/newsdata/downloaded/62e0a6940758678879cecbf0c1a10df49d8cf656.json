(AP) - About 1,400 New Hampshire residents will have to find new health insurance plans after state regulators said they had been sold illegal policies.\n\nThe state insurance commissioner on Wednesday ordered Aliera Healthcare and Trinity Healthcare to stop selling or renewing insurance in New Hampshire. Officials say Aliera has been marketing and administering health coverage on behalf of Trinity, which calls itself a health care sharing ministry.

But regulators say Trinity doesn\u2019t meet the requirements to be considered legitimate.\n\nCommissioner John Elias says his department got dozens of complaints. Trinity didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "About 1,400 New Hampshire residents will have to find new health insurance plans after state regulators said they had been sold illegal policies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
