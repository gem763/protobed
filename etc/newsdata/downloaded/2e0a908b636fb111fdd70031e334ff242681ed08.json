Weaker domestic and foreign demand would lead to lower trajectories for employment, wages and household income.\n\n\u201cAs a result of all these changes, household spending, business investment and exports would be weaker and real GDP would be about 4.5 per cent lower by the end of 2021 relative to the base-case projection,\u201d the bank said.\n\nThe Canadian dollar would depreciate by roughly 15 per cent and \u201cplay a key role\u201d in the domestic economy\u2019s ability to adjust to a weaker global economic outlook by helping contain adverse effects on exports and income.\n\nThe forecast assumes no new tariffs would be imposed and that monetary and fiscal policies in Canada and the rest of the world did not respond to additional economic weaknesses.\n\nWeaker potential output associated with less business investment would negatively affect the supply side economy, the bank suggested. However, these supply effects, combined with a lower Canadian dollar, would partially mitigate the negative impact of weaker aggregate demand on inflation.\n\nOverall, the bank estimated in its scenario, CPI inflation would be 0.7 percentage points lower than in the base case in 2021.\n\nGlobal GDP would drop by 2.25 per cent by the end of 2021 while commodity prices would plunge by approximately 20-25 per cent.\n\nIn July, the Bank of Canada released a scenario projecting Canada\u2019s economy would shrink by around 6 per cent by end-2021 if the United States increased tariffs on all imports by 25 per cent and its trading partners followed suit.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "A pronounced global slowdown would hit the Canadian economy with lower trajectories for employment, wages and household income, bank projects", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bank-of-canada-money.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
