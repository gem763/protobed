Then old friends saw his photo in a newspaper.", "language": "en", "text": "Mechling, executive director of the South Austin Museum of Popular Culture, woke up early that day to an email from a friend: Was the Coy Featherston in that photo the same one she grew up with in Corpus Christi?\n\nAD\n\nMechling sprung into action. She canvassed the streets near the University of Texas at Austin where people experiencing homelessness frequently spent time. On her third trip, four days later, she found Featherston outside St. Austin Catholic Parish near the university.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let things linger when you see something like this,\u201d Mechling, 65, told The Washington Post. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to rally the troops and jump right in.\u201d\n\nThe troops, indeed, were rallied. In the weeks since Mechling reunited with Featherston, several high school friends banded together to find him a spare bedroom and launch a GoFundMe page that has raised more than $10,000 for him, as the American-Statesman first reported.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is going to work,\u201d Featherston, 68, told The Post. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it will, and that\u2019s all I can do. I can only be positive about everything.\u201d\n\nMechling said she had talked with Featherston on-and-off over the years and knew he had fallen on hard times. When she saw him feeding stale bagels to pigeons outside the church where he had been sleeping, she recognized him immediately.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she offered him coffee and a breakfast taco from Whataburger, and the pair hugged. When Featherston agreed to go home with her, Mechling loaded his belongings into her truck and told their mutual friends that she had found him.\n\nBy the time they arrived at Mechling\u2019s home, their friends had mobilized to collect shoes and clothing for Featherston. The group went out for food, watched TV and reunited with more friends before Featherston slept in a real bed for the first time in months.\n\nFeatherston is now staying in another friend\u2019s spare bedroom until he finds a more stable place to live. People donated a bicycle and art supplies. They\u2019re helping him navigate his Social Security benefits and working to get him access to mental-health care.\n\nIn high school, Featherston earned the yearbook superlative \u201cBest All Around Boy.\u201d He played football and baseball before graduating in 1971, and he attended the University of Texas on a football scholarship. He later worked as a roadie for Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFeatherston eventually lost that job, and his brother was killed in what friends say was a case of mistaken identity. Life became difficult for Featherston, who said he worked various jobs in Atlanta before being laid off and losing his apartment. He said he faced a few misdemeanor charges when he fought to save his property from theft, and he returned to Austin in December in search of work.\n\n\u201cIt seems as though I\u2019ve become the poster boy for homeless citizens here in Austin, and that doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Featherston said. \u201cI want people to be aware of the fact that it can happen to them, too, if you don\u2019t have a lot of things in place where it should all be.\u201d\n\nDon Vanderburg, who is hosting Featherston in his home, said he didn\u2019t think twice about taking in his old friend. Featherston had once played in Vanderburg\u2019s band, and the two became close.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter that it was 52 years later,\u201d Vanderburg said. \u201cCoy has character that few people have. He\u2019s honest, and he\u2019s trustworthy.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of Patrick Judd, who created the GoFundMe page, Featherston is the same fun-loving guy he always was. Hearing his story also gave Judd a newfound sense of empathy for people who are homeless, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all really excited about Coy possibly getting his life back,\u201d Judd said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be luckier in lots of ways, though he\u2019s had some really horrible luck for many years.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Coy Featherston's former classmate canvassed Austin for four days until she found him feeding pigeons outside a church.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aPERSUcEpt0bHUR4M2LuGSQXPU4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7I6756XMJRDELHZTLTVWNPRZXA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
