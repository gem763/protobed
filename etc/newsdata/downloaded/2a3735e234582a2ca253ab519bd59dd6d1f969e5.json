She's kind of a mini Rick Rubin in her own way.\n\n'I'm not just saying this because she's my girlfriend. She has a credit on the album itself, and it's not just a shout out, it's genuine work.'\n\nRetweeting a video posted by the publication, James corrected the headline, which included: '@jamesblake discusses his latest album 'Assume Form,' how his girlfriend Jameela Jamil inspired the record...'\n\nCandid: James also noted that women are unfairly labelled as an 'inspiration' and 'muse,' after his comments about Jemeela during a chat with Billboard were condensed, to his displeasing\n\nCorrection: Retweeting a video posted by the publication, James corrected the headline\n\nThe difference: James pointed out how differently women who assist their partners with creating music are spoken of, in comparison to male producers who only make 'tiny changes'\n\nThe singer tweeted: 'Not just inspired it - she actually worked on it.
