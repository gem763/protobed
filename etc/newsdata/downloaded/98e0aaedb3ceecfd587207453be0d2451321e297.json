Morey confirmed to the Florence Morning News via email on Monday that he had refused the sacrament to Biden.\n\n\u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Father Morey, pastor at St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, said. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d\n\nBiden, who is Catholic, would not confirm whether he had attended Mass at St. Anthony\u2019s. The campaign told the Florence Morning News that \u201cif he did attend, he did so in a private capacity.\u201d\n\nBiden has said in the past that he is \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d to abortion, but publicly advocates for its protection, including the establishing of a federal law to preserve the right to abortion even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\n\nBiden flipped multiple times on the campaign trail earlier this year over support for the Hyde amendment, which bans federal funding of abortion under Medicaid except in rare circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working through the finer details of my health care plan like others in this race, and I\u2019ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,\u201d Biden said during a Democratic National Committee gala in Atlanta in June. \u201cIf I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s ZIP code.\u201d\n\nDenial of communion to politicians who publicly support abortion has long been a hot-button topic. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote in 2004 that \u201csuch decisions rest with the individual bishop in accord with the established canonical and pastoral principles.\u201d Morey\u2019s email said that the matter of pro-choice Catholic politicians is a difficult situation, but his responsibility remains to minister to souls.\n\n\u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey\u2019s statement concludes.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was denied Holy Communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on Sunday because of his public stance on abortion.Father Robert E.
