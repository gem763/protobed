And I am indebted to him for that because acting has given me such an incredible life.\"\n\nThe star, who is generating Oscar buzz for his menacing, psychologically dark portrayal of comic book character The Joker, was speaking after being presented with the TIFF Tribute Actor Award.\n\nHe described how, when he was 15, River \"made me watch\" a VHS copy of the Martin Scorsese / Robert DeNiro classic Raging Bull in an attempt to rekindle his love of acting.\n\n\"And the next day he woke me up, and he made me watch it again.
