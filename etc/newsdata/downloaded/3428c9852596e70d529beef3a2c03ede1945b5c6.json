According to the study, liberals and women are more likely to desire punishment for a controversial person if they issued a public apology.\n\nThe peer-reviewed study was published in the academic journal Behavioural Public Policy by political psychologist Richard Hanania.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked to read two different stories about real-life controversies, one in which the public figure at the center of a scandal apologized, and one in which they didn\u2019t.\n\nIn one test, participants were presented with the story of Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard University who was forced out of his role after suggesting that men and women have innate biological differences that can lead to different career outcomes and unequal representation in certain fields.\n\nLiberals and women who read a story in which Summers apologized for his comments were more likely to say that he ought to be punished. However, liberals and women who read a version of the story in which Summers didn\u2019t apologize, and stuck by his statements, were less likely to say he should face punishment.\n\nThe effects on other demographics were smaller or neutral, according to the study.\n\nHanania\u2019s study quickly gained traction on social media, with Vox founder Ezra Klein suggesting it could help explain why President Trump, not a man known for his public apologies, was so successful in his 2016 campaign.\n\nI remember watching this dynamic play out in 2016: when Clinton apologized on her emails, it validated criticisms of her and made it harder for her supporters to fight back. When Trump refused to apologize for outlandish behavior, it fired up his side and flummoxed the media. https://t.co/DhtgHF3G01 \u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) October 27, 2019\n\nThe findings of Hanania\u2019s study indicate that public apologies don\u2019t immediately affect voting behavior. In one test, participants were asked to read two stories about Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), one in which he apologized for controversial comments on civil rights, and one in which he did not. The test found that neither story immediately shifted participants\u2019 voting behavior one way or the other.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t imply that there aren\u2019t longer-term effects with public apologies. One public apology might not immediately shift someone\u2019s voting decision, but repeated public apologies over time may change their opinion of a politician.\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
