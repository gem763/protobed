Without his eye for the outrageous, without his willingness to unpack the complicated stories most reporters would tell you are impossible to tell on television. Most of all, without his elegant, spare writing that serves the story without ever calling attention to itself. As Kroft, and everyone here just calls him \"Kroft,\" says, \"It's always about the story.\"\n\nLesley Stahl walks with Steve Kroft\n\nWe had some questions of our own when we talked with the 74-year-old, newly-retired correspondent at his waterfront home on Long Island's Peconic Bay.\n\nLesley Stahl: \"60 Minutes.\" People do not walk away from this, Steve. And there's a lotta people want to know why. I want to know. I tried to talk you out of it.\n\nSteve Kroft: Right.\n\nLesley Stahl: I'm surprised. How can you walk away from this?\n\nSteve Kroft: I've always felt like-- I had-- great amount of respect-- for people who-- who've left their professions when they were on top. And I felt that-- that this was the time for me to-- to go. That there were other things that I wanted to do, that I still had the energy to do it, and I still had the interest in doing it.\n\nThirty years ago, when Kroft joined \"60 Minutes,\" giants roamed the halls.\n\nMike Wallace and Morley Safer, Ed Bradley and Harry Reasoner.\n\nSteve Kroft's first \"60 Minutes\" piece\n\nKroft was a veteran of the CBS London Bureau and the newsmagazine \"West 57th.\" But \"60 Minutes\" was a whole new league.\n\nLesley Stahl: Was the red carpet out for you? Did you have a tough time in the beginning?\n\nSteve Kroft: Well, I think everybody who comes to that show as a correspondent has a tough time at the beginning. It's very intimidating, and\u2026\n\nLesley Stahl: But-- but didn't you once say that there-- that there was-- a hazing period for you?\n\nSteve Kroft: It was more a period where I was, like a junior partner in a law firm.\n\nLesley Stahl: Ah, there you go.\n\nSteve Kroft: That's the way it felt. Ya know, if you were fighting over a story, there wasn't any question--\n\nLesley Stahl: Forget it. Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: --who was going to get it. I was not going to get it.\n\nLesley Stahl: Right. That's kinda hazing. We go-- we all go through that--\n\nSteve Kroft: Yeah, yeah. It wasn't like a level playing field. There was seniority involved. And the place was very competitive. You know, and I never quite felt like I made it. In part, because, in some ways, if I did, really, a good story, it just created more antagonism, particularly for Mike.\n\nLesley Stahl: He'd-- yeah, he would be jealous. And--\n\nSteve Kroft: He would be jealous.\n\nSteve Kroft: And then he'd try to steal the producer.\n\nLesley Stahl: The prod-- but what about-- didn't Dan Rather sorta give you a warning?\n\nSteve Kroft: He said \"It's like a jungle, and there's a lot of big cats over there. And they can just with one swipe of the hand, you'll be limping for, like, a year.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: Welcome to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nSteve Kroft: Welcome to \"60 Minutes.\" And he was pretty much right. He was pretty much right.\n\n\"I think you can scrape the bottom of hell with a fine tooth comb and never come up with a man like Steve Kroft.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: Very early on, you were doing stories that are iconic stories for \"60 Minutes,\" that people want to see again and again. Like, Chernobyl. That-- wasn't that your very first season?\n\nSteve Kroft: Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you just walked into radioactive city. I remember watching that and thinking, is that guy crazy?\n\nKroft from Chernobyl story: The only sign of life is the music, piped in continuously to keep the decontamination crews that have to be here from going crazy... In some hot spots we found radiation levels 100 times normal.\n\nLesley Stahl: Were you ever nervous about that or?\n\nSteve Kroft: I wasn't nervous, because we had done a lot of research.\n\nLesley Stahl: People don't appreciate how much research goes into our stories. Not just on whether we're gonna be in danger or not. But--\n\nSteve Kroft: That's what makes 'em so good.\n\nBefore he was a familiar face on Sunday night, Kroft went undercover in Houston to explore the classic scam of rolling back the odometers on used cars.\n\nHe met Bill Whitlow, who was a master of the art.\n\nSteve Kroft: He was a crazy Texas character. And everybody in the used car business brought 'em to Bill, and Bill would roll back the odometers.\n\nKroft from report to Whitlow: This is not exactly legal, right?\n\nWhitlow: It's not exactly legal, no.\n\nSteve Kroft: He laid out his whole scam for us. And when it was all over I thought we needed to give him a heads up.\n\nKroft to Whitlow: See that picture? There's a TV camera back there.\n\nWhitlow: Yeah.\n\nKroft: We've been taping this whole thing.\n\nWhitlow: Well, alright.\n\nLesley Stahl: And then, one of the great lines. \"There's the good news and the bad news.\"\n\nKroft to Whitlow: The good news is, we're not cops.\n\nWhitlow: Well, I didn't think so.\n\nKroft: The bad news is, is we're \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nA few years later, a \"60 Minutes\" team talked with Bill Whitlow in federal prison. He was no longer unperturbed.\n\nWhitlow: I think you can scrape the bottom of hell with a fine tooth comb and never come up with a man like Steve Kroft.\n\nKroft keeps a needlepoint pillow with Whitlow's words on his couch.\n\nLesley Stahl: As a badge of honor.\n\nSteve Kroft: As a badge of honor.\n\nLesley Stahl: You know, you've interviewed a lotta grifters and scammers.\n\nSteve Kroft: Conmen, yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, conmen.\n\nLesley Stahl: What category of person do you most like to talk about, interview, write about?\n\nSteve Kroft: One of my favorite interviews was John Martarano, who was a hitman for Whitey Bulger, who killed something like 26 people.\n\nKroft to Martarano: A lot of people would say you're a serial killer.\n\nMartarano: I might be a vigilante but not a serial killer.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why was that your favorite?\n\nSteve Kroft: Because he was just really interesting and he came to play.\n\nSteve Kroft: You could engage with him and he would talk to you.\n\nMartarano: That's the trap door for the cellar.\n\nKroft to Martarano: Anybody go down there and never come up?\n\nMartarano: I think so, yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: He was very honest about how he got in the business and he just kind of considered it a job.\n\nWhen a falling light almost hit the Clintons\n\nKroft's best-known interview, and perhaps most historically important, came on Super Bowl Sunday, 1992, when the then-governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary tried to save his presidential campaign from a tabloid sex scandal.\n\nLesley Stahl: They wanted to go somewhere that had a good reputation and answer the questions.\n\nSteve Kroft: One time. They wanted to answer the questions once.\n\nLesley Stahl: One time.\n\nSteve Kroft: So there was a lotta pressure to keep asking the questions.\n\nSteve Kroft: And they wanted Hillary to be part of it.\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, she came on to defend him.\n\nSteve Kroft: She did.\n\nHillary Clinton: You know, I'm not some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him\u2026\n\nLesley Stahl: It is said that this interview saved his presidential campaign, but it also almost killed them.\n\nSteve Kroft: Oh right, with the light falling down?\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, can you walk us through what you're seeing?\n\nSteve Kroft: A wall-mounted lamp, a high-powered-- a television lamp, like--\n\nLesley Stahl: One of these things?\n\nSteve Kroft: Right. It just sprung off the wall. It sounded like an explosion. I didn't know what had happened\u2026\n\nLesley Stahl: Well she jumped. And it really did come close to her. Do you remember what she said?\n\nSteve Kroft: Jesus Mary and Joseph.\n\nLesley Stahl: Not what I would have said.\n\nSteve Kroft: Not what I would have said either.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you've covered politicians, celebrities, athletes, eccentrics.\n\nSteve Kroft: Conmen, mobsters.\n\nLesley Stahl: were you ever scared?\n\nSteve Kroft: No. Because, first of all, you're in a room with-- like we are right now where you have-- lots of people here.\n\nLesley Stahl: Protection.\n\nSteve Kroft: Because you--\n\nLesley Stahl: You have your producers protecting you.\n\nSteve Kroft: Right. So I was never really worried that-- that I was gonna come under any-- physical threat.\n\nSteve Kroft: But I was nervous the whole time I was in Beirut. And I spent a lot of time in Beirut.\n\nSteve Kroft: I was nervous the whole time I was in Zimbabwe where we had done a really tough interview with Robert Mugabe.\n\nSteve Kroft: And then we were followed by the secret police. And there was a group of marauders that came over and I was pretty nervous.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah. The craziness of--\n\nSteve Kroft: The craziness.\n\nLesley Stahl: --all of this.\n\nSteve Kroft: It was fun. You know, it was-- huge adrenaline rush. As Churchill said, \"The most exhilarating moment in life is to be shot at without result\", and it's true.\n\nKroft with Barack Obama in one of their early interviews\n\nKroft insists that covering politics is never exhilarating for him. So it's ironic that his most frequent interviewee was a politician. For 10 years, beginning in 2007, from the campaign trail to the Oval Office, he covered Barack Obama.\n\nLesley Stahl:I think you interviewed him 16 times.\n\nSteve Kroft: Uh-huh. It's a lot.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you have a relationship?\n\nSteve Kroft: The only thing we had was a reporter-subject relationship.\n\nSteve Kroft: I think he knew that we were not gonna burn him, That we were going to ask tough questions, but we were gonna let him answer them.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you ran 'em.\n\nSteve Kroft: Well, we edited them down But we were really careful to be able to distill what he was saying. And-- and I think he appreciated that-- and was comfortable with it.\n\nSteve Kroft: Everybody would come up to me in-- in the White House and would say, \"This is the only time, in these interviews, when you see the guy we see everyday.\" And in all the interviews we did with him, I never once saw him lean on an aide or ask for a clarification or, am I saying this right, or anything. 'Cause he understood the issues. I don't think I've ever interviewed a politician quite like that, you interview lots of people in Congress. Some of 'em can't answer anything without four aides in the room-- you know, stopping 'em saying, \"Well, that's not exactly right,\" and, you know.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you ever feel that you should have pushed harder?\n\nSteve Kroft: I don't think it was a matter of pushing hard. I think that that criticism came from the fact that I didn't get angry with him. And at the time that I came up and started doing interviews with the president, there was a long track record of how people did interviews with the president.\n\nLesley Stahl: You showed the office respect.\n\nSteve Kroft: Yes, and you showed the office respect.\n\nOld-school standards come naturally to him.\n\nKroft during his Stars and Stripes days\n\nLesley Stahl: You grew up in Kokomo, Indiana.\n\nSteve Kroft: Kokomo, Indiana.\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you think you brought from Kokom,o that perhaps makes your sensibility different from your East-West Coast colleagues?\n\nSteve Kroft: Well, I think that, I still think of the Midwest as being the heartland of the country. Different values. Very religious, for the most part. Or more religious than--\n\nLesley Stahl: East-West Coast.\n\nSteve Kroft: Than the East-West Coast. And a lot of the people that I know in New York who have been very successful came from the Midwest. And I thought, you know, they send kids off to fight wars.\n\nIncluding Kroft. He graduated from Syracuse University with an eye on Madison Avenue.\n\nSteve Kroft: Then I got drafted, and then I ended up in Vietnam. and I decided I didn't want to be in advertising anymore. I wanted to be in journalism.\n\nLesley Stahl: Because when you were in the service, you were writing for Stars and Stripes?\n\nSteve Kroft: I was a correspondent photographer for Stars and Stripes, which was the highest journalism job in the Army, and a great job.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you got to meet a lot of the network correspondents then.\n\nSteve Kroft: And I knew immediately that that's what I wanted to do. That's when I wanted to be a foreign correspondent.\n\nOne striking part of Steve Kroft's 30 years of \"60 Minutes\" was his range. He set out to be a foreign correspondent, but overseas reporting accounted for only a fraction of his 500 stories. There was almost no category he couldn't, or wouldn't, handle. He dug into medicine and sports, finance and entertainment, authors and autocrats. If the story was good, he was up for telling it. Sometimes, way, way up. Other times, way, way down. Or he'd venture into a minefield.\n\nKroft searched out eccentrics and spoke with the most chilling and the most quirky, among them, America's last Lord of the Manor. And the leather-clad first citizen of interior design. Kroft took a look into the life of spy-turned-spy novelist John LeCarre. And explained the financial weapons of mass destruction behind the Great Recession.\n\nLesley Stahl: You took on the task of explaining really complicated economic swaps and secularizations and--\n\nSteve Kroft: Securitization, derivatives.\n\nLesley Stahl: That. That.\n\nKroft reporting on the Great Recession: Savvy investors figured out that the cheapest, most effective way to bet against the entire housing market was to buy credit default swaps. In effect, taking out inexpensive insurance policies that would pay off big when other people's mortgage investments went south.\n\nLesley Stahl: I-- no one else would have even thought of writing those stories that you wrote. And you then were able just to make it so understandable.\n\nSteve Kroft: I'm not an expert on that kind of stuff. So it had to be put into language that I understood, that I thought I could explain.\n\nLesley Stahl: Have you done a lot of stories that ended up with changed legislation or changed rules or changed the world?\n\nSteve Kroft: There was a story called \"The Insiders.\" It was a story about insider trading in Congress and the fact that there were no laws against it.\n\nKroft reported how middle class politicians became millionaires, profiting from inside information they learned on Capitol Hill, while a reform bill, called the \"Stock Act,\" languished in obscurity.\n\nSteve Kroft: We stood outside the capitol and talked to Congressmen who were coming up. \"You know anything about the stock act?\" \"Nah, I don't think so.\"\n\nSteve Kroft: After the story ran, um, the bill was passed.\n\nLesley Stahl: Mmm-hmm. But-- but when you-- when you're working on stories like that, aren't you in a rage, just furious, the injustice, the unfairness?\n\nSteve Kroft: Some of the times--\n\nLesley Stahl: The sliminess?\n\nSteve Kroft: A lot of the times, my reaction is, like, I can't believe-- I can't believe this is going on. I can't believe that nobody has discovered it, nobody has tried to put a stop to it. You know, I love stories that have a bit of absurdity to it. And my favorite stories are government stories where you say, \"You're not gonna believe this is going on. It's been going on for a long time, and nothing has ever been done about it.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: One of the stories you did that had a huge emotional impact was Bob Dole.\n\nSteve Kroft: Mmm-hmm.\n\nIn 1993, Bob Dole was the Senate Minority Leader and preparing a presidential run against Bill Clinton.\n\nLesley Stahl: When he was telling you about what happened to him in the war\u2026\n\nKroft to Bob Dole: Did you realize how badly you were wounded?\n\nDole: No, I didn't have any idea. I just knew I couldn't get up.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did he break down?\n\nSteve Kroft: He did.\n\nDole: I remember my dad coming up on Christmas, he had to stand all the way on the train. The trains are so crowded. He got up there, his ankles were swollen. (Crying)\n\nSteve Kroft: I think we stopped the cameras. I think also it's self-assuring. If you see somebody that loses control, you say, \"Let's just stop the cameras.\" And let them--\n\nLesley Stahl: Collect themselves.\n\nSteve Kroft: Collect themselves. And the-- you need to be judicious at it. Too many times on television, it's just cheap-- you know, it's just cheap emotion.\n\nKroft took particular care with the in-studio introductions to his stories. His writing could be light and irreverent or transform the potentially morbid into amusing.\n\nHe labored over every line of every script, and then would rewrite his rewrites. Well into his 60s and 70s, Kroft was pulling all-nighters like a college sophomore trying to make sure his term papers were always an \"A.\"\n\nSteve Kroft: It's not an easy process. People think you're a good writer, you just sit down and do it. It takes a lotta work. And all-- it takes a lotta time to do it. And-- to make it good--\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, I heard that they would-- that the boss would approve your story, done, wrapped, finished, and you'd get a whole new idea and start rewriting all over again, after it had been approved.\n\nSteve Kroft: I think mostly it was kind of, like, this is pretty good, you know. And I'd say, \"Well, I'd like to run it through the typewriter one more time,\" and they'd say, \"All right.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, in the middle of the night.\n\nSteve Kroft: In-- in the middle of the night. (LAUGH)\n\nLesley Stahl: Come on. Fess up. (LAUGH)\n\nSteve Kroft: It's not exactly, I mean, you're-- I'm not disagreeing with the spirit of what you're saying. OK.\n\nLesley Stahl: Because you're notorious for working very late at night.\n\nSteve Kroft: Very late.\n\nSteve Kroft: So normally at noon is about when I would get-- (LAUGH)\n\nLesley Stahl: Start.\n\nSteve Kroft: Started. I would get the mood to write, and then, you know, hopefully was outta there by-- I sometimes, we stayed till, you know, like, 4:00 for a screening the next day.\n\nLesley Stahl: 4 a.m.?\n\nSteve Kroft: Yeah. (LAUGH)\n\nLesley Stahl: But it was hard for you, am I right?\n\nSteve Kroft: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: I mean, that.\n\nSteve Kroft: Well, eventually, really you-- eventually you come up with a hard deadline. (LAUGH)\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, like, 7 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nSteve Kroft: That's it. Usually before that.\n\nLesley Stahl: What about people you interviewed who completely surprised you. You thought they were going to be one thing but they turned out to be completely different.\n\nSteve Kroft: The one that immediately comes to mind was Clint Eastwood\u2026 I did not think I was going to like him based off of the kind of movies that he had made.\n\nLesley Stahl: He was a tough interview\u2026\n\nSteve Kroft: He was sort of a tough interview, but the person was completely different.\n\nLesley Stahl: Didn't he just stare you down or you stared him down.\n\nSteve Kroft: Yeah, but that question was kind of like when we said we have to talk about all the wives and stuff and I thought, \"OK.\" So I tried to like frame the question in a way that it was likely not to get him really angry.\n\nKroft to Clint Eastwood: Seven kids with five women, not all of them you were married to.\n\nClint Eastwood: No.\n\nSteve Kroft: He just reacted by just staring at me in silence.\n\nKroft to Clint Eastwood: I don't think I've had anybody look at me like that before. It's a real Clint Eastwood look.\n\nSteve Kroft: Some of the most effective television you know, everybody feels like everything has to be, like, no silence, you know, like five seconds on television of silence is just like an eternity.\n\nKroft had a way with celebrities and the famous, when he chose to do them, which wasn't often.\n\nSteve Kroft: One of my favorite stories was the Eagles. You know, they were together, they broke up, they had a singles career, they got back together, they broke up again, and Glenn Frey and Don Henley clearly did not like each other very much.\n\nSteve Kroft: I think it was Frey that was talking and Henley was just rolling his eyes.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you got the shot-- (LAUGH)\n\nSteve Kroft: Like it was so much BS. (LAUGH) It's the one thing everybody remembered from the piece. (LAUGH)\n\nSteve Kroft: Some people open up and let you see and do anything you want.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas fit that category.\n\nSteve Kroft: Those are really the ones that are the most fun, because you get to see them over in different settings. Samuel L. Jackson was like that\u2026 Dustin Hoffman was like that\u2026 Tom Hanks was pretty much up for anything.\n\nSteve Kroft: I can remember doing a profile on Jerry Seinfeld\u2026\n\nLesley Stahl: It was hilarious.\n\nSteve Kroft: It was hilarious because he was hilarious\u2026 He liked being interviewed, he loved the idea of being on \"60 Minutes\" because his mother was a big fan, and there wasn't anything you couldn't ask him.\n\nLesley Stahl: But there was one moment where you did ask him what could've been an embarrassing question.\n\nKroft to Jerry Seinfeld: You think you're immature?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Oh yeah.\n\nKroft: Sexually?\n\nSeinfeld: Yeah.\n\nKroft: Why?\n\nSeinfeld: I am not going to talk about\u2026(LAUGHTER) being sexually immature on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nKroft: But you think you are.\n\nSeinfeld: It's not \"60 Swinging Minutes.\"\n\nKroft: Right, right.\n\nSeinfeld: Can we get some powder on my face\u2026 I'm sweating\u2026 God.\n\nSteve Kroft: And then you get people\u2026\n\nLesley Stahl: This is off limits, this is off limits\u2026\n\nSteve Kroft: Right. The most extreme example of that was Beyonc\u00e9. She controlled everything.\n\nSteve Kroft: We had a couple of brief moments with her and a short interview, and couple of walk-throughs and that was it.\n\nLesley Stahl: Ya know, when you told me you were gonna leave, I thought of all the important things you had done for the show. And those stories that you wrote about the collateralization and all of that. You gave the show a dimension, an important dimension that we hadn't had before. We're really gonna miss you.\n\nSteve Kroft: I'm gonna miss you too, Lesley. But I'm not gonna be a complete stranger. I'm gonna be, you know, I'll-- I'm-- I'm sure I'll see you.\n\nLesley Stahl: But I'm saying something-- not about personal. I mean, it's about your contribution over your 30 years to the show that was huge. You gave us depth. You-- you brought \"60 Minutes\" to places that no other television journalism could ever have gone without you. And I think we still need it. And a lot of us are very unhappy that you're leaving. And we don't think that 74 is old. (LAUGH) Some of us anyway.\n\nSteve Kroft: Look I thank you. It means a lot to me to hear you say that. And-- the-- \"60 Minutes\" will be fine, just fine.\n\nProduced by L.
