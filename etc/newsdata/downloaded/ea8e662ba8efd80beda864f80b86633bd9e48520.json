Photographer Liisa Jokinen caught plenty of peacocks working the streets outside shows for Lou Dallas, LaQuan Smith, and Sies Marjan. Scroll down to see 17 fashion people \u2014 stylists, writers, influencers, and designers \u2014 explain how they decided what to wear to the shows.\n\nGrey\u2026, 22, vigilante/curator\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing pink and lilac veils with a vintage Ralph Lauren skirt from Shop Berriez and Melissa platform shoes. My style is inspired by the \u201970s and \u201980s, and interesting characters like Howard Hughes and Eartha Kitt. My style philosophy is to dress as if you were meeting yourself for the first time \u2014 your ideal self, the self you saw in your mind\u2019s eye as a child, the person you always thought you\u2019d be someday. Dress just like that and give the world hell!\u201d\n\nInstagram: @rugratsinparis\n\nShawn Lakin, 25, senior fashion editor at Document Journal\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage dress from the Corner Store and Maryam Nassir Zadeh boots. My mom inspires my style. My style philosophy is to buy less and pass it on.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @shawnmlakin\n\nDarrell James, 32, sales and wardrobe consultant\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy top is Joe Chia, my pants are Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, my shoes are from To Boot, and my bag is Louis Vuitton. Traveling inspires me.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @darrelljames7\n\nDeborah Ababio, 35, executive assistant to British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a sweater by DV, a vintage skirt, boots by Karen Millen, and a bag by Reserve.

My style is inspired by vintage tailoring, the \u201940s and the \u201970s, Parisian grandmothers, and skater boys. My style philosophy is to wear whatever makes you feel like you\u2019re expressing your insides on the outsides. Be fearless and have a good time.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @hannahbaxward\n\nGabriella Karefa-Johnson, 27, stylist and fashion director, GARAGE Magazine\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI am wearing a Matthew Adams Dolan shirt, a vintage blazer and Levi\u2019s jeans, a Jil Sander bag, Celine shoes, and Carolina Lemke sunglasses.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @gabriellak_j\n\nGrace Stratton, 18, student and sales associate at Brandy Melville\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a puffy vintage-inspired white shirt with gold jeweled buttons, an orange vintage lampshade (yes, it\u2019s a lampshade, haha), vintage suede brown shorts, and vintage cowboy boots.

Clean lines plus extra details. Always wear a men\u2019s jacket if you don\u2019t know what to wear. Now I\u2019m wearing a top by Keti Chkhikvadze, pants by Tako Mekvabidze, shoes by Linea Rosa, and bag by Maissa.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @olgayanul\n\nOluwabukola Becky Akinyode, 30, stylist and market editor at Out of Order magazine\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Sies Marjan dress, earrings by Tuza, and shoes by Charles David. I\u2019m inspired by anything that\u2019s aesthetically pleasing whether it is art, fashion, or film. My style philosophy is to do the most but never take myself too seriously. Sometimes people look at fashion like it\u2019s a matter of life and death, but it\u2019s supposed to be fun.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @thetrillestb\n\nSadaf H Nava, 30, musician and visual artist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Lou Dallas top and a skirt hand-crocheted by my mom.

When you look good, you feel good.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @robynmowatt\n\nTakuro Ogasawara, 53\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Toga jacket and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons pants.

I\u2019m inspired first and foremost by the people I see walking the streets of New York. My color palette is always shifting, but recently I\u2019ve found myself attracted to jewel tones. I have to be comfortable in what I\u2019m wearing and always love to add something that\u2019s slightly shocking or at least eye-catching.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @callanmalone\n\nTiffany M.
