(See his track record here.)\n\nIn return, Mundipharma receives global commercial rights to rezafungin excluding the U.S. and Japan, the analyst said.\n\nWedbush sees the total deal value to be in excess of $534 million.\n\nThe equity investment will be enacted by way of a private placement of 4.78 million new shares issued at $1.884 each, a 20% premium to the 10-day volume weighted average price, he said.\n\n\"Additionally, we see substantial synergies between both companies given Mundipharma already has a significant global commercial reach with annual sales over \u20ac2B in a variety of therapeutic areas including diabetes, respiratory, oncology, pain and biosimilars,\" Driscoll said.\n\nThe firm recommends buying Cidara shares given the removal of the financing overhang as well as an improving reimbursement environment for antibacterials and antifungals.\n\nSpecifically, Wedbush encourages long-term investors to buy into the shares ahead of the mid-2020 Phase 3 ReSTORE data readout.\n\nThe Price Action\n\nFollowing the roughly 40% rally on Tuesday, Cidara shares were giving back some of the gains, trading down 11.91% at $2.07 at the time of publication Wednesday.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nThe Daily Biotech Pulse: Puma Leaps, Aerie Borrows, Hepion Back In Nasdaq's Good Books\n\nCidara Rallies On Development Deal For Lead Antifungal Medication\n\nLatest Ratings for CDTX\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Upgrades Neutral Outperform Jun 2019 Initiates Coverage On Outperform May 2019 Downgrades Outperform Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CDTX\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
