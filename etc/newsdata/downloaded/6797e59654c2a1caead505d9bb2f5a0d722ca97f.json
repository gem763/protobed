The other, which I stumbled across as an undergrad majoring in business administration, is a business and tech newsletter called Morning Brew.\n\nFounded in 2015 by two business students at the University of Michigan, Morning Brew delivers the important business news of the day with a concise, approachable, and witty style. It greets its one million subscribers, who are mainly in their mid-to-late-20s and work in finance, tech, and consulting, every weekday around 7 a.m., informing them about what's happening in the business world, and why they should care.\n\nGmail\n\nThough the formatting has changed over the years and continues to evolve, you can usually expect the following:\n\nNews blurbs covering the latest in any industry going through change, not only finance and tech, but also media and entertainment, auto, manufacturing, food, retail, and real estate. International news, the government, and the economy also frequently make their way into the newsletter.\n\nAn easy-to-read summary of the stock markets\n\nAn earnings announcement calendar for the week\n\nSponsored content relating to a useful service or product\n\nA news quiz\n\nWhat Morning Brew does especially well \u2014 and why it's popular among millennials in particular \u2014 is holding the limited attentions of its readers through a personable tone and easy-to-read format.\n\nIt's organized well and broken down into sections, which are often further split into bullet-pointed facts and insights. A GIF or two scattered in the newsletter is not an uncommon sight, and brainteasers or word puzzles also keep things interesting.\n\nFounders Alex Lieberman and Austin Rief started Morning Brew to help their fellow students understand the business world without confusing them or putting them to sleep.\n\nIts readership has since expanded past the college student, but the desire for engaging and relatable, yet useful and informative content remains the same. After taking a few minutes to read Morning Brew, you feel like you've just had a chat with your friend who reads all the major papers cover to cover and tells you all the highlights.\n\nIt's free to subscribe to and read Morning Brew. To unlock access to its weekend newsletter, Light Roast, and earn other rewards, you can refer your friends to subscribe as well.", "description": "Morning Brew delivers the important business news of the day with a concise, approachable, and witty style.", "authors": ["Connie Chen"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c49b8f02bdd7f7e272b3058-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
