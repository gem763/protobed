His T20 record is phenomenal and nothing is more valuable in white-ball cricket than mystery spin.\n\nLewis Gregory, who looks set to make his England debut in New Zealand this winter, is a star player with both bat and ball and is well-deserving of his \u00a3100k pay-day.\n\nTrent Rockets will have a couple of wicketkeepers to choose from next summer but there is a strong case to be made for Ben Cox, who is rated as one of the best gloveman in England and was picked up for just \u00a340k.\n\nJoe Root\u2019s Trent Rockets signed Rashid Khan (Picture: Getty)\n\nSouthern Brave\n\nAndre Russell (\u00a3125k), David Warner (\u00a3125k), Shadab Khan (\u00a375k)\n\nMahela Jayawardene admitted he could not believe his luck when Australia opener David Warner was still available to be picked as his second marquee signing, having already snapped up West Indian hero Andre Russell.\n\nWarner\u2019s struggles during the recent Ashes series were well documented but he is a different beast in limited-overs cricket. In the 2019 Indian Premier League, Warner scored almost 700 runs in 12 innings at an average of 69 and a strike-rate of 144.\n\nRussell is the most coveted all-rounder in the world and will add considerable firepower to a bowling attack that also includes England World Cup hero Jofra Archer. The fact he smashes it miles and is a gun fielder will also come in handy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthern Brave needed to add a spinner to their ranks and spent \u00a375k on Pakistan\u2019s Shadab Khan, whose economy rate in T20 cricket is less than seven. Another top signing for a team that will be tough to beat.\n\nAndre Russell secured a \u00a3125k contract with Southern Brave (Picture: Getty)\n\nNorthern Superchargers\n\nAaron Finch (\u00a3125k), Mujeeb Ur Rahman (\u00a3125k), Ben Foakes (\u00a360k)\n\nWith much of the limelight focusing on David Warner, fellow Australia opener Aaron Finch went somewhat under the radar ahead of the draft.\n\nBut the 32-year-old, whose T20 career has yielded nine centuries and almost 10,000 runs, was duly snapped up by Northern Superchargers for \u00a3125k. As one of the most prolific run-scorers in T20 cricket, it looks money well spent.\n\nDespite already having Adil Rashid on their books, Northern Superchargers decided to bolster their spin options with the highly-rated Mujeeb Ur Rahman heading to Leeds.\n\nThe 18-year-old is following in the footsteps of compatriot Rashid Khan and has quickly established himself as a popular figure at drafts and auctions around the world.\n\nWith spin duo Rashid and Mujeeb potentially bowling 40 deliveries per match, the Superchargers knew an assured wicketkeeper would be key and England\u2019s Ben Foakes certainly fits the bill.\n\nBen Stokes will play with Aaron Finch for Northern Superchargers (Picture: Getty)\n\nWelsh Fire\n\nMitchell Starc (\u00a3125k), Liam Plunkett (\u00a350k), Ryan ten Doeschate (\u00a350k)\n\nWith gun batters Jonny Bairstow, Colin Ingram and Tom Banton already signed, Welsh Fire were expected to spent a large portion of their funds on a star bowler and made Australia\u2019s Mitchell Starc their first pick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarc is a brilliant one-day bowler \u2013 he holds the record for the most wickets taken at a single World Cup \u2013 and his left-arm pace offers the kind of variation that T20 captains crave.\n\nLiam Plunkett, a key member of England\u2019s World Cup-winning squad, could also prove to be a shrewd signing and only cost \u00a350k.\n\nFire\u2019s other recruit in that price bracket \u2013 Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate \u2013 will bring valuable experience as well as an ability to shape matches with bat and ball.\n\nJonny Bairstow will join forces with Australia rivals Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc (Picture: Getty)\n\nOval Invincibles\n\nSunil Narine (\u00a3125k), Hardus Viljoen (\u00a360k), Laurie Evans (\u00a330k)\n\nIt has been Sunil Narine\u2019s ability with the bat as much as the ball that has seen him emerge as one of the most in-demand players in world cricket.\n\nThe West Indies star has always been a brilliant spin bowler but his batting has improved immeasurably and seen his value shoot up as a result.\n\nHe is almost nailed on to bowl 20 balls a game for Oval Invincibles and will likely open alongside Jason Roy. All in all, his \u00a3125k purchase is sound business.\n\nThe south London team signed the Curran brothers ahead of the draft but South African Hardus Viljoen could be the pick of their seam attack, having taken 18 wickets for Kent in last season\u2019s T20 Blast and rarely returning untidy figures.\n\nHis presence at The Oval \u2013 along with Sam Billings and Alex Blake \u2013 will also appeal to Kent fans who The Hundred chiefs hope will grow an affinity with the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was surprising that Laurie Evans did not attract a more lucrative contract, with Oval Invincibles selecting the Warwickshire batsman with their very last pick at \u00a330k, but he is a more than decent squad player who will challenge for a place in the starting XI.\n\nOval Invincibles added England\u2019s Sam Billings to their ranks (Picture: Getty)\n\nManchester Originals\n\nTom Abell (\u00a3100k), Mitchell Santner (\u00a350k), Joe Clarke (\u00a340k)\n\nIt was inevitable that Somerset man Tom Abell would be handed a Hundred gig and he did not come cheaply, with Simon Katich\u2019s Manchester Originals spending \u00a3100k to secure his signature.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant sum of money but in Abell, the Old Trafford-based team have acquired a talented player who is rated highly at Somerset.\n\nHe averaged almost 45 in last summer\u2019s T20 Blast and scored his runs at a strike-rate of close to 180. Evidently Abell can play and he will flourish in the Manchester Originals\u2019 top order.\n\nThe \u00a350k signing of Mitchell Santner also makes a lot of sense. The 27-year-old has developed into a key player for New Zealand in one-day cricket and played in the 2019 World Cup final.\n\nJoe Clarke did not enjoy his most prolific season in the Blast for Nottinghamshire but there are not many more skilful batsman in the domestic game who were available for just \u00a340k.\n\nManchester Originals signed a number of domestic stars (Picture: Getty)\n\nLondon Spirit\n\nGlenn Maxwell (\u00a3125k), Mohammad Nabi (\u00a3100k), Mark Wood (\u00a375k)\n\nLondon Spirit were arguably dealt the toughest hand at the draft. They picked seventh and already had Eoin Morgan as one of their \u00a3125k stars, meaning just one of the first 18 picks came from their coach Shane Warne.\n\nThey pressure was on, therefore, to nail their opening selection and they appear to have done a good job with Australia star Glenn Maxwell.\n\nA destructive batsman, a handy bowler and a gun fielder, Maxwell can make a big impact in a tournament seemingly designed for him.\n\nAfghanistan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi, signed for \u00a3100k, is another fine addition. The 34-year-old was brilliant in his brief spell with Kent last summer and can bat anywhere in the top six.\n\nThe likes of Lasith Malinga, Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada went unsold at the draft and it is easy to see why when there were a number of suitable and cheaper alternatives available.\n\nOnes of those was England World Cup-winner Mark Wood. \u00a375k for a player who can bowl 90mph and should be available for the entire competition seems like a no-brainer.\n\nLondon Spirit head coach Shane Warne (Picture: Getty)\n\nBirmingham Phoenix\n\nBenny Howell (\u00a375k), Cameron Delport (\u00a350k), Riki Wessels (\u00a330k)\n\nHaving been assigned Chris Woakes and Pat Brown ahead of the draft, Birmingham Phoenix would not necessarily have identified domestic seam bowlers as a key area to target.\n\nBut Benny Howell has been a consistent performer for Gloucestershire over the past five years and could turn out to be a shrewd signing.\n\nThe same can be said for Essex batsman Cameron Delport, who smashed a 38-ball century in the T20 Blast in July and went on to help the Eagles win the competition for the first time in their history.\n\nSomewhat bizarrely, Andrew McDonald\u2019s Birmingham Phoenix had not signed a wicketkeeper until the penultimate round of the draft.\n\nBut a bargain deal for Riki Wessels \u2013 a talented batsman and solid gloveman \u2013 has vindicated the team\u2019s decision to hold off and wait for the value.\n\nBirmingham Phoenix signing Ravi Bopara (Picture: Getty)", "description": "The first draft in British sport was complete on Sunday evening, with the eight teams competing in the new Hundred competition selecting their squads.
