REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo\n\nA case has been registered against two suspects in Bengaluru after they approached a member of the Indian women\u2019s team, Ajit Singh, the head of the Anti-Corruption Unit at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), told Reuters by telephone.\n\n\u201cShe was approached before a home series by people who expected her to be part of the India squad and wanted her to play according to their script,\u201d Singh said without identifying the player.\n\n\u201cShe asked them to call to another number, recorded the conversation and reported the approach to us,\u201d Singh said.\n\nIn another incident, several players in this year\u2019s Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) were approached by suspected fixers.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to find out what their purpose was. They tried to contact through social media. The moment these players realised something was wrong, they cut out the approaches and reported to us,\u201d Singh said.\n\nSingh said no player was being probed.\n\n\u201cI consider it a success of our education programme that in both cases, the players did the right thing by reporting the approaches.\n\nIndian Premier League (IPL), BCCI\u2019s showpiece Twenty20 competition, was blighted by illegal betting with former India paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth handed a ban following a spot-fixing scandal in 2013.\n\nThe Chennai and Rajasthan franchises were also subsequently suspended from the IPL for two years after key officials from both teams were found guilty of illegal betting.", "description": "The Indian cricket board has launched investigations into suspected match fixers who approached a member of the women's national team and players in a regional Twenty20 league, its anti-corruption head said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Amlan Chakraborty", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430776978&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0LA", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
