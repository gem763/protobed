The top two teams in each group progress to the quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cWe have to be at our absolute best if we are to beat them - we are at the stage already where there are no second chances,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cThat\u2019s a message we have been emphasizing to the players this week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSouth Africa: Willie le Roux, Cheslin Kolbe, Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende, Makazole Mapimpi, Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Faf de Klerk; Duane Vermeulen, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Siya Kolisi (captain), Lood de Jager, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Bongi Mbonambi, Tendai Mtawarira.
