I don't want these farmers to give up,' she said while choking back tears.\n\nOne Nation leader Pauline Hanson has broken down in tears while talking about the plight of struggling dairy farmers\n\nJones himself also broke down in tears days earlier while talking about farmers battling through intense drought\n\nJones told Ms Hanson to 'go and have a rest' before saying she was 'worn out, as are the farmers'.\n\nMs Hanson's milk price proposal is supported by Labor and crossbench senators but opposed by the Coalition and independent Cory Bernardi.\n\nJones himself also broke down in tears days earlier while talking about farmers battling through intense drought.\n\nDuring his Sky News show on Tuesday night Jones said he had experienced similar struggles.\n\n'I have been exactly where the people of Bourke are,' he said.\n\n'My old man would be ashamed of me if I didn't fight.'\n\nJones then became overwhelmed with emotion and gestured for an ad break.\n\nHe has been scathing of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's reaction to the issue, urging him to do more to help farmers who cannot afford feed and water to keep livestock alive.\n\nJones furiously argued with Mr Morrison about drought relief during an explosive interview on 2GB on Tuesday.\n\nIn one particularly heated moment, the radio host interrupted Mr Morrison and bluntly told him: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nAfter the interview Jones was overrun with calls from listeners, many of whom voted Liberal, as they lined up to slam the Prime Minster, calling him 'arrogant' and a 'waste of space'\n\n'These people, Prime Minister, cannot survive today,' Jones said angrily.\n\n'They are sending the breeding stock to the sale yard to be slaughtered, they're walking off their farms.\n\n'They need cash now. Now. Just as we gave a billion dollars to Indonesia over a tsunami. This is a drought tsunami.'\n\nMr Morrison explained that he couldn't make it rain and that $318million has already helped in the past year.\n\n'The direct cash grant support is going into farming communities, including directly to farmers,' Mr Morrison said.\n\nBut Jones interrupted, saying: 'They're not getting it!'\n\nMr Morrison continued: 'Alan, if you could let me finish. There's $318.5 million...'\n\n'I don't know where the money is Prime Minister,' Jones interjected.\n\nAs Mr Morrison tried to make his point, Jones cut in with a blunt remark: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nMr Morrison continued trying to explain how aid has helped while a frustrated Jones kept interjecting and asking: 'How does that feed a cow?'\n\nJones criticised the Farm Household Allowance scheme, which gives farmers fortnightly payments and, in some cases, lump sum payments of up to $12,000\n\nJones then criticised the Farm Household Allowance scheme, which gives farmers fortnightly payments and, in some cases, lump sum payments of up to $12,000.\n\n'You say Farm Household Allowance. Now PM, come on. You go and tell Jenny that she can live on $250 a week,' Jones said.\n\n'It's not $250 a week Alan. It's not just that,' Mr Morrison replied.\n\n'If you live in the city, and your business goes bust or you lose your job, then you have access to Newstart. But if you are on a farm property and you get access to the Farm Household Allowance.'\n\nJones did not accept his answer and pressed the PM further by asking: 'Why are they walking off? Why are they sending their cattle to slaughter?'\n\n'Because of the drought, that's why,' said the PM.\n\nMr Morrison then admitted he couldn't save farmers from some hardship.", "description": "Australian senator and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has broken down crying on shock jock Alan Jones'morning show discussing the struggling dairy farming industry.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19865040-0-image-a-2_1571359697691.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
