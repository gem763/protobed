The original products have since been destroyed and the display sanitized\n\nThe footage was originally posted on YouTube on October 9 with a caption from Mr Allison that read: 'I was going to grab some pre-sliced meat and cheese from the Grab&Go section when I saw this scruffy old mouse/rat scurry out from the middle of this center-floor cooler.\n\n'Completely ignoring me [he] went right for a package of Swiss (obviously) and went to town on the plastic wrapping.\n\n'No matter how close I got Ralph fearlessly ignored the camera...\n\n'I passed on the deli and bought some chips and dip instead.'\n\nJohn Ryan, the mayor of Alsip, was not quite as laid-back about the rat's appearance, according to a post on a Facebook page titled Village of Alsip.\n\nIt stated that Mr Ryan had dispatched both a Building Commissioner and Health Inspector.\n\nIt also said: 'The store manager and HR person confirmed the original products were destroyed, the display has been sanitized, pest control was dispatched and the pest control log book is up to date and reflected two visits this week to address the vermin issue.\n\n'No one has any knowledge of how the rodent accessed the store.'\n\nFood 4 Less has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Christopher Allison recorded the footage as he did a late-night shop at the Food 4 Less store in Alsip, Illinois, in America.
