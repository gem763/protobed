They have been meeting with Michel Barnier\u2019s team,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister will be seeing President Juncker tomorrow, I\u2019ll be meeting with Michel Barnier tomorrow, so there\u2019s extensive talks been happening both at a technical level but also at a political level. So there has been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. We can see a landing zone in terms of a future deal but there is significant work still to do.\u201d\n\nJohnson is committed to getting rid of the backstop, the guarantee central to Theresa May\u2019s rejected deal in which the UK would effectively stay within the EU\u2019s customs union if no other solution for the Irish border could be reached before the end of a post-exit transition period.\n\nAnother option would be a backstop just for Northern Ireland, but the government has rejected this. Barclay said while it was vital for the UK to \u201cleave as a whole\u201d, some divergence already existed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\n\u201cWe can get into those details as part of the talks. But that is different from the principle of the backstop, and the backstop needs to go,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking later, Patel was more cautious, saying she did not want to \u201cpre-empt\u201d the talks, but accepted the Irish border issue had moved on from the backstop in terms of discussions with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we have to deal with the backstop issue, and people said, under the Theresa May deal, that the withdrawal agreement would never be considered or looked at again, and neither would the political declaration,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are in different territory right now, so it\u2019s no point arguing about the past. We are moving forward now as a government, collectively, focused on leaving but leaving with a deal.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe have to leave and we have to leave with a deal on 31 October, and there\u2019s no point right now trying to prejudge the discussions that are taking place.\u201d", "description": "Stephen Barclay and Priti Patel insist focus is on achieving agreement before 31 October", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Jonathan Freedland", "Ell Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/690483bb65b87873da4c6f48f62102f62ebb27b5/119_155_2654_1593/master/2654.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=618904f3654a76682197602ac0ac95cc", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
