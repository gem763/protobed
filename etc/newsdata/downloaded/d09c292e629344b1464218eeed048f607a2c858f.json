Other officials in separate parts of the White House will also listen in on conversations and take notes, known as a \"memorandum of telephone conversation,\" which would often be combined with automated computer transcriptions.\n\nDuring the Trump presidency, the White House began to limit the number of people allowed to listen in on Trump's phone calls after transcripts of Trump's calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked, according to The New York Times.

The White House last week also released a memo about the call, which appeared to confirm that Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nUS House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday that Congress is determined to get access to Donald Trump's calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders.\n\n\"I think the paramount need here is to protect the national security of the United States and see whether in the conversations with other world leaders \u2014 and in particular with Putin \u2014 that the president was also undermining our security in a way that he thought would personally benefit his campaign,\" Schiff said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"", "description": "Trump's phone calls are at the center of a whistleblower complaint filed last month which has since triggered a formal impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b58703ed30cd41c008b4691?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
