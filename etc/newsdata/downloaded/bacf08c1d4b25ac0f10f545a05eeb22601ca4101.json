But the reality is more nuanced, according to EU diplomats who doubt the bloc will ever throw the U.K. off a cliff without a safety net. The pound dipped on the comments, and then recovered.\n\nSelling the Deal\n\nAfter sealing a revised deal with the EU on Thursday, Johnson is spending Friday frantically talking to politicians from his own and other parties as he tries to rustle up a majority. The prime minister needs to add 61 votes to the tally his predecessor Theresa May managed when her version of the Brexit deal was defeated for a third and final time in March.\n\nThe new agreement differs from May\u2019s agreement because only Northern Ireland rather than the whole U.K. will continue to apply the EU\u2019s customs rules. That\u2019s upset the province\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party whose MPs say they won\u2019t back Johnson\u2019s deal on Saturday.\n\nIf Johnson loses the vote, he\u2019s obliged by law to request from the EU another extension by the end of the day. But any postponement must be approved unanimously by the EU\u2019s 27 leaders so Macron would have a veto.\n\nEU officials were expecting such an intervention by Macron, who made similar noises before approving a Brexit delay in April, but they said that it\u2019s very unlikely that he or any other leader would prevent another one, particularly if the U.K. was headed for a general election. While the bloc is just as keen to get Britain\u2019s departure over the line as Johnson, it considers a no-deal exit in two weeks a far worse prospect than another postponement.\n\nEnvoys from the 27 remaining countries and the European Commission are due to meet on Sunday to discuss next steps should Johnson\u2019s deal fall.\n\nThe French have consistently taken a hard line in Brexit negotiations and Macron argues that the tight deadline he insisted on the last time the process was extended helped force Johnson into concessions. Several EU governments privately now regret delaying Brexit from April until October, acknowledging that it took the pressure of the U.K. to pass a deal.\n\n\"I was alone and I don\u2019t think I was wrong,\" Macron said, referring to the decision six months ago.\n\nOther leaders were more circumspect on the issue, with Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, which stands to be affected most by a no-deal Brexit, saying a delay isn\u2019t guaranteed and Luxembourg premier Xavier Bettel insisting the ball was now in the U.K. Parliament\u2019s court.\n\n\u201cWe have done our job,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a plan A, but there\u2019s no plan B.\"\n\n(Updates with context throughout.)\n\n--With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Helene Fouquet in Paris at hfouquet1@bloomberg.net;Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- French President Emmanuel Macron heaped pressure on the British Parliament to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union shouldn\u2019t be delayed a moment longer.With Parliament due to vote on the revised agreement on Saturday, Macron\u2019s remarks echoed", "authors": ["Helene Fouquet", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WSdmnZYpC7P9paH__gVRMA--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/331cdeb1d409dcfcb558d9e0ad2b29f6", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
