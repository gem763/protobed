In the event of any attack on such a caravan, special operations forces and US military aircraft are immediately called in to protect it,\u201d he said. According to Konashenkov, the US-controlled company Sadcab, established under the so-called Autonomous Administration of Eastern Syria, is engaged in the export of oil, and the income of smuggling goes to the personal accounts of US PMCs and special forces. The Major General added that as of right now, a barrel of smuggled Syrian oil is valued at $38, therefore the monthly revenue of US governmental agencies exceeds $30 million.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nImage 4: Gathering of vehicles in Syria, Deir ez-Zor province, 10 km east of Mayadin, September 8, 2019.", "description": "The Russian military just dropped a geopolitical bomb, with satellite imagery supposedly showing the United States smuggling oil from Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QW6ubzSXU4GyuKHPh5wa2Q--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMjcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/24f5101378b422e516ab0ca32cd339e6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
