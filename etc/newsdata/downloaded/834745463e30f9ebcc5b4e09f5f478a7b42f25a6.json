The video of the St Kevin\u2019s boys has everyone talking, with discussion ranging from white male privilege and the culture of private schools, to the demise of Aussie larrikinism.\n\nThe only thing I can think about is how poorly timed the boys were. If they had waited a few more years until they were in college at uni, they would have gotten away scot free.\n\nThe song, while out of place on a tram, would have felt right at home in our university residencies, a place I\u2019m certain many of those boys will find themselves in a few years. On the campuses where our country\u2019s future leaders are finding their feet, they\u2019ll find a space where finally, boys are allowed to be boys.\n\nI can speak to this culture first hand. As a previous president of the Macquarie Women\u2019s Collective, I received more disclosures of violence and assault than I could count. During the last weeks I spent at my college, I was unable to go to the dining room because there were perpetrators at every table. At one point during my time there, I spoke out about the culture of casual gendered violence and one male student\u2019s response scared me so much that I locked myself in my room for a day. Until the day I left, I was always scared of something happening because he knew where I lived.\n\nREAD MORE More St Kevin's Students Have Reportedly Been Filmed Singing The Same Sexist Chant\n\nBut don\u2019t just take my word for it. Nina Funnell and Anna Hush of End Rape on Campus put together The Red Zone Report at the beginning of last year, detailing instances of sexual violence in colleges and residencies all around Australia.\n\nThe 211 page report is filled to the brim with stories of boys only a little older than the ones from St Kevin\u2019s.\n\nBoys who masturbate into containers of shampoo or body wash left by girls in bathrooms so that female students will later wash themselves with a mixture of the product and their semen, boys who create Facebook groups called \u201cdefine statutory: pro-rape, anti-consent\u201d, boys who discuss details of a student\u2019s rape over the PA system for the college to hear.\n\nIf you think the St Kevin\u2019s song and these incidents are unrelated, think again. Violence and discrimination exists in a pyramid, with things like \u201clocker room talk\u201d and casual sexism at the bottom, providing the foundations for more violent acts, like cat calling and revenge porn. This in turn supports violence further up the pyramid, like rape and murder. These incidents and the video of the St Kevin\u2019s boys bloomed from the same culture, one that demeans women, protects rapists, and ensures that boys and men are always prioritised, no matter what.\n\nUniversities and colleges were built on the foundations of colonialism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, and ableism, and were created to benefit largely rich, white, able-bodied men. It\u2019s these values that are instilled within our country and learnt through our education systems, presenting themselves in our justice systems, boards, offices, and parliaments. It\u2019s why we have at least one woman a week dying at the hands of violence, usually by domestic violence.\n\nOver two years ago, the Australian Human Rights Commission released the first report into sexual harassment and sexual assault on Australian university campuses, finding that 1 in 5 students had been sexually harassed at university or a university affiliated event in 2016 alone, while 1.6% of students had been sexually assaulted in the same year. Of those statistics, 87% of those who had been sexually assaulted and 71% of those who had been sexually harassed reported that the perpetrator was male.\n\nIf we\u2019re truly going to change the violent, sexist culture of Australia, our universities and schools are where we should be looking.\n\nThey might be 20-something year old students now, but they\u2019ll be the ones making our laws in the decades to come.", "description": "The St Kevins boys caught chanting a misogynistic rhyme on a Melbourne tram are Australia's next leaders, which is why we need change in schools.", "authors": ["Lydia Jupp"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-28-at-2.47.40-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
