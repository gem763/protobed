He remains blindingly quick on his feet and an ingenious, hilarious mimic who can summon a big top of characters in seconds. With a soft voice and laid-back manner, he can seem remote, until he switches into a character, which he does often; raising his volume and intensity, he commits, firmly in the moment.\n\nAs is clear from his performance in \u201cDolemite,\u201d one of his finest, Murphy\u2019s star power is undiminished. But there\u2019s a new tenderness and mature vulnerability in this role that also comes out in person. Asked how his sense of humor has changed, he conceded: \u201cI\u2019m mushier than I used to be.\u201d\n\nHis new movie provides some evidence. Murphy \u2014 who came up with the idea, and the title, for the blaxploitation parody \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka, \u201d which Keenen Ivory Wayans eventually directed in 1988 \u2014 takes a much warmer, more reverent approach to Rudy Ray Moore, a star of the blaxploitation era. \u201cEd Wood,\u201d Tim Burton\u2019s affectionate 1994 portrait of a B-movie auteur, was an inspiration. (They even hired the same screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski).", "description": "In a wide-ranging interview, the star explains why he\u2019s returning to stand-up and the big screen, why he regrets leaving and why it\u2019s hard to watch himself in \u201cRaw\u201d these days.", "authors": ["Jason Zinoman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/arts/29eddie-murphy-1/29eddie-murphy-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
