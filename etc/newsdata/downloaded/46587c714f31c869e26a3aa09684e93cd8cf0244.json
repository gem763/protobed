Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.\n\nIn the U.S., the criminal investigative arms of the Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement collaborated on the investigation.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Welcome to Video was launched on the Darknet in June 2015.\n\nUndercover investigators say that the site's upload page had the instruction 'Do not upload adult porn over the age of 15.'\n\nThe website's upload page (above) included a message telling users not to upload adult porn\n\nThe site hosted more than 200,000 videos of sickening child abuse, including the rape of infants and toddlers, the indictment said.\n\nUsers would purchase videos with 'points', which they could earn by uploading new videos, referring new users, or simply paying with bitcoin.\n\nProsecutors say that Son was the administrator of the site, which raked in some $370,000 in bitcoin payments between 2015 and 2018.\n\nThe site's users downloaded child exploitation videos more than one million times in the same time period, according to court documents.\n\nSon is currently serving an 18-month sentence in South Korea, and U.S. authorities are expected to seek his extradition to face justice in America.\n\nHow investigators unraveled the child porn plot\n\nPolice in the UK found a link to he site on the computer of Matthew Falder, 37\n\nThe Welcome To Video site first came to the attention of law enforcement in June 2017, when police in the UK arrested Cambridge graduate Matthew Falder, a geophysicist from an affluent family who led a secret life trading images of child sex abuse.\n\nFalder later admitted 137 offenses, including voyeurism, encouraging child rape, and sharing images showing the abuse of a newborn baby, and has been jailed for 25 years.\n\nThe National Crime Agency, Britain's equivalent of the FBI, found a link to the Welcome To Video website on Falder's computer, and launched a joint investigation with authorities in the U.S., Germany and elsewhere.\n\nIn the U.S., agents with the IRS and Homeland Securing Investigations, a division of ICE, began the meticulous work of tracking the website's operator.\n\nThe NCA uncovered Welcome To Video during its investigation into the geophysicist Dr Matthew Falder. His computer is pictured above in an evidence photo\n\nAs investigators scrutinized the website's source code, they discovered two occasions where the IP address of the server had not been fully concealed.\n\nThose two IP addresses were traced to a service provider in South Korea, and were registered to an account at Son's address, according to the indictment.\n\nMeanwhile, IRS investigators were also able to track payments made by undercover agents to the Welcome To Video bitcoin account.\n\nThe payments were tracked through to a wallet account that Son held with a bitcoin exchange, where he had to register with his name and contact information in order to convert the bitcoin\n\nA warrant was issued for Son's arrest by a U.S. federal magistrate judge in February 2018.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, agents from the IRS-CI, HSI, the UK's NCA, and Korean National Police in South Korea arrested Son and seized the server used to operate Welcome To Video.\n\nUsing a sophisticated analysis of bitcoin transactions, which are recorded on the public blockchain, the investigators were also able to backtrace many of the payments to the website, and unmask its users.\n\nThe website (above) sold download privileges for bitcoin, which allowed IRS investigators to trace the transactions on the blockchain to wallet accounts registered to Son\n\nHundreds of arrests followed around the world in the following months.\n\nTwo users of the Darknet market committed suicide subsequent to the execution of search warrants.\n\nThe operation resulted in the seizure of approximately eight terabytes of child sexual exploitation videos, which is one of the largest seizures of its kind, officials said.\n\nThe files included over 250,000 unique videos, and 45 percent of the videos contain new images that have not been previously known to law enforcement.\n\nAnalysis of the files led to identification of some of the abused children, 23 of whom have been located and rescued so far.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is currently in the process of analyzing thousands more videos, in hope of identifying and rescuing the child victims they depict.", "description": "Jong Woo Son, 23, a South Korean national, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington DC for running the site Welcome To Video, prosecutors announced on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19791654-0-Welcome_to_Video_the_site_used_by_paedophiles_around_the_world_h-a-13_1571239962765.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
