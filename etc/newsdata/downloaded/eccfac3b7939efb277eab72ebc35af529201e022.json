As soon as they scored it was starting to kick off again and you could see the Haringey players were getting abused and felt unsettled.\n\n\u201cThe referee was seen removing the bottles thrown at the players and then the managers of both teams went on and escorted their teams off the pitch.\n\n\u201cI went into the changing room with the boys, the referee called in both captains and managers to have a talk about what to do next. The boys made a group decision to make a stand and not go back out to play.\n\n\u201cThe officials and Yeovil manager came into the Haringey changing room and said they will back whatever decision the Haringey boys made, so that was class from them.\n\n\u201cThe boys were disgusted and you could see a few were distraught from getting abused like that.\u201d\n\nLoizou told Sky Sports News with regard to taking his players off: \u201cThere was no way that two or three of those players could have continued playing. What they heard was disgusting, they looked frightened.\u201d\n\nRowe wrote on Twitter: \u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019m tweeting this and it\u2019s 2019 but today I was a victim of racism, in what was supposed to be a great day for HaringeyBoroFC. Another game of football ruined by racists.\u201d\n\nThe FA said in its statement on the matter that it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the allegation and was looking into the incident \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d.\n\nIt came just five days after England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria that was halted twice as fans were warned about racist behaviour.\n\nEngland forward Raheem Sterling retweeted a news report about the Haringey players walking off and posted the message \u201cmore of this\u201d, accompanied by two hands clapping emojis.\n\nTyrone Mings, targeted in Bulgaria on what was his England debut, also expressed his support, tweeting: \u201cWell done for taking a stance, sometimes it can get brushed off in lower leagues but everyone stands with you. Our country isn\u2019t perfect either.\u201d\n\nThe football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out praised the \u201cswift and decisive action\u201d taken by Loizou and his players.\n\nKick It Out said in a statement: \u201cThe reports relating to events at Haringey Borough...are of alleged racist abuse, and yet again means players are continuing to receive discriminatory abuse while doing their job.\n\n\u201cThe Haringey manager and players took swift and decisive action as a result of the abuse, similar to that taken by the England team out in Bulgaria just five days ago.\n\n\u201cKick It Out has informed the FA and will support the club in identifying the offender(s) to ensure appropriate action is taken and strong punishment issued.\u201d\n\nPA Sport also contributed to this report", "description": "Haringey Borough players were left \u201cdisgusted\u201d and \u201cdistraught\u201d after alleged racist abuse during their\u00a0abandoned FA Cup clash against Yeovil, according to former Borough defender Michael\u00a0O\u2019Donoghue, who attended the game.
