Specifically, Trump was referencing the Steele dossier that launched Special Counsel Robert Mueller's two year investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller ultimately found no collusion took place despite Democrats' continual insistence that it did happen.\n\nWe have also learned that the Democratic National Committee actually went to Ukraine to dig up dirt on Trump as a means of keeping him from being elected in 2016.\n\n\"When you look at what is going on, and then you see all of this horrible stuff, and then you hear about Ukraine. You have been hearing about it. I heard Clinton was involved. I heard they got somebody who wrote the fake dossier. Was it out it out of Ukraine?\" Trump asked.\n\nAccording to the president, Attorney General William Barr is determined to get to the bottom of what took place with the bogus Russia investigation and the Ukraine situation.\n\n\"Because you know what, we are investigating corruption. And I actually heard Gregg Jarrett and numerous people the other day say come I have an obligation to do it [investigate]. That is not a question, can I do it or don\u2019t I do it? We have an obligation to investigate corruption,\" Trump explained. \"That's what it was. In my opinion, that is what it was is corruption and if Ukraine would know something about the 2016 election, you have to give that information. I hope they would give the information and everybody agrees with me 100 percent.\"\n\nThe president said various experts have appeared on television shows, including Hannity's, saying Trump has an obligation to the American people to investigate the corruption surrounding the 2016 election.\n\nTrump believes Democrats have stopped focusing on the content of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky because multiple people, including Zelensky himself, said no pro quid pro took place during the call.\n\n\"When I'm talking to somebody, world leaders, almost anybody, I assume that State Department, I think Mike Pompeo was on, I think many people were on, many, many people were on, do you think I'm going to say something wrong when I feel there's 25 or 30 or two or 10 or something [listening], but there are a lot of people on these calls,\" he said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "He's not messing around..10/22/2019 9:15:30AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/294/311d5dd0-b2b0-4fdd-83da-86c860b3da8c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
