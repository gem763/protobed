In August, the Australia prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia would join a US-led mission in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIn August Morrison said Australia would send forces to the Middle East because \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d in the Gulf was a threat to Australian interests.\n\nThe British MP Tulip Siddiq said: \u201cIran have raised the stakes again and shown the UK\u2019s soft diplomatic responses to Iran\u2019s illegal and inhumane treatment of British prisoners has not worked. This is a wake-up call for the prime minister and the government to act urgently to bring our innocent citizens home.\u201d\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since being arrested while visiting relatives in April 2016. The regime accused her of working to \u201cspread propaganda against Iran\u201d, a charge she has strenuously and consistently denied.\n\nBoris Johnson, then the foreign secretary, was severely criticised over his handling of the case after he erroneously told the Commons that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was teaching journalism while in Iran.\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe was accused by Tehran\u2019s prosecutor general of running a \u201cBBC Persian online journalism course, which was aimed at recruiting and training people to spread propaganda against Iran\u201d.\n\nShe briefly worked for BBC Media Action, the corporation\u2019s international development charity, but had left more than five years before her arrest. At that time, she was working as a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the news agency\u2019s charitable arm, which has made clear she is not employed as a journalist and was in the country solely in a personal capacity.\n\nJohnson later corrected his mistake but it was used against her in court. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison and has suffered from mental and physical health problems during her incarceration.\n\nLast month her relatives said she and her fellow inmates in the notorious Evin prison had been placed under a strict new regime, meaning their visiting rights were restricted and they were no longer allowed to make international calls.\n\nAnother person made the object of the harsh new restrictions was Aras Amiri, an Iranian who has permanent-resident status in Britain. She lost her appeal against a 10-year jail sentence in Tehran after being accused of spying for the UK while she was visiting a sick relative year.", "description": "The two, believed to be tourists, are said to be in prison in Tehran after being arrested by authorities while travelling", "authors": ["Michael Mcgowan", "Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02d72bc1f51b9e502db57a50c5f6252cc922ac2/38_508_4818_2892/master/4818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=327dbe2649fa14590f03b18940a4f721", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
