The most famous was the FBI, then led by James Comey, interviewing her and then saying in July 2016 that there was no evidence that would lead to criminal charges being pursued. However, Comey did rebuke Clinton and her team for mishandling her email - with some chains of messages containing top secret information.\n\nAccording to the national archives, employees of government agencies should now generally only use personal email accounts in \u201cemergency situations\u201d and all emails should be stored according to record keeping guidelines.\n\nClinton\u2019s case was then reopened at the end of October 2016, just over a week before the presidential election, with Comey saying further emails that could pertain to the investigation were found. The case was closed by 6 November, with Comey telling Congress that after review of those emails their view of the case had not changed after all.\n\nTrump has refused to let it go, even mentioning it during a Q&A with reporters while meeting with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked whether he believes there are missing Clinton emails in Ukraine (there is no evidence for this) Trump said: \u201cI think there could be\u201d. It comes after a July phone call with Zelensky that is at the centre of the Democrat-led impeachment investigation against Trump, where the president asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavour\u201d which included helping look into the Clinton email scandal.\n\nThat call was also part of a whistleblower complaint that Democrats believe is key to the issue of impeachment - and that complaint has given Trump his own server-related case. It is likely to give him as much trouble as Clinton had with another election year around the corner.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump attacks 'spy' who gave whistleblower information, report says\n\nThe complaint - which is essentially made up of allegations from a number of officials that they say pose a risk to US national security - accuses White House officials trying to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the call. The complaint alleges that the conversation between Trump and Zelensky was removed from the computer system that typically houses such records and was loaded onto a separate electronic system that usually houses information of an \u201cespecially sensitive nature\u201d.\n\nAccording to the complaint, one White House official told the whistleblower that this was likely an abuse of the system as there was nothing \u201cremotely sensitive\u201d about the call. In the words of the whistleblower, such action \u201cunderscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired on the call\u201d.\n\nTrump says he has done nothing wrong, with the White House stating that the memo showing the contents of the call and the whistleblower complaint show \u201cno improper conduct\u201d by the president.", "description": "Donald Trump has made sure that nobody who even remotely follows his actions has been able to forget the scandal of Hillary Clinton using a private server to store emails.The president has repeatedly abused the former secretary of state since facing Clinton during the 2016 election campaign, with Trump", "authors": ["Chris Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FPAcm.oehou.jeFubSPgZg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/e6309d07aa5b43a5ce9abec28de07d5d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
