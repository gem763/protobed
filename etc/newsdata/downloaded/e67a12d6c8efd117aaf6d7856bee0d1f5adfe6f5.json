Slipping, tripping and falling are very common. Some falls can cause serious head injuries,\" said Bina Ali, a research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Maryland, who was first author of the study.\n\nTraumatic brain injuries from home furnishings and fixtures, primarily beds, were highest among infants and children up to 4 years old. Whereas traumatic brain injuries from sports and recreation -- especially football, bicycles and basketball -- were highest among children ages 5 to 19.\n\n\"The findings were not very surprising. Infants and younger children are often indoors, so we see that the leading causes of their head injuries are home furnishings and fixtures,\" Ali said.\n\n\"One interesting finding was that car seats is the fifth leading cause of traumatic head injuries in infants,\" she said. \"Car seats are effective in preventing injuries in infants when used properly in cars. However, sometimes car seats are used outside of the car as baby carriers. When they are handled inappropriately, they can pose a risk.\"\n\nFor instance, she said, a car seat could be placed on a table or countertop where there is a risk of falling and injuring the infant.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study had some limitations, including that the severity of these injuries were not investigated and the data included only patients admitted to emergency departments.\n\nThe researchers recommended strategies to prevent TBI in children around the home, including removing tripping hazards such as area rugs; improving lighting; avoiding hard surface playgrounds; increasing use of home safety devices such as stair gates; and using stairway handrails without sharp edges, among other strategies.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines last year for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term care of children and teens with traumatic brain injuries.\n\nThe guidelines include asking health care providers to avoid routinely conducting imaging tests on children who have mild TBIs, using age-appropriate symptom scales to diagnose concussions, assessing risk factors that would signal a prolonged recovery, providing kids and their parents with instructions on how to return to activities based on their symptoms, and counseling children to gradually return to non-sports activities after no more than two or three days of rest.", "description": "Traumatic brain injuries in children and adolescents is most often associated with hard floors, beds, football, stairs and bicycles, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190728074305-kid-riding-bike-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
