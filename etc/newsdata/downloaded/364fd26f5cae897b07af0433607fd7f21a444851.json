The once proud community was, in its heyday, the vanguard for the MAGA movement. Now it\u2019s just a sad group of self-declared victims whining about how unfairly they\u2019ve been treated by social media.\n\nBack in June, the subreddit was quarantined for \u201cthreats of violence against police.\u201d Widespread community outrage over an Oregon politician\u2019s threat to have law enforcement officers bring Conservative lawmakers back to session resulted in a rash of anti-police, pro-violence posts on the forum.\n\nThe quarantine essentially just forces visitors to acknowledge a disclaimer indicating the community is being given time to clean up its act. You can still access every post and comment \u2013 except those deleted by the community\u2018s own moderators.\n\nThis punishment didn\u2019t seem fair to anyone. The members of r/The_Donald were outraged that they\u2019d been targeted when so many other other groups on Reddit were allowed to get away with calls for violence (but her emails!). Those who saw the community as a hate group thought the punishment was lenient. Activists and journalists have written dozens of articles clearly documenting the misogyny, bigotry, and calls for violence that once permeated the vast majority of conversations on r/The_Donald.\n\nIt turns out, however, that giving r/The_Donald time to fix itself has been the most devastating thing that\u2019s happened to the online alt-right movement since the Daily Stormer and Infowars were taken offline. The subreddit no longer has any edge. It\u2019s admin and mods are so terrified they\u2019re going to miss a bad thread or get brigaded that nearly every single conversation ends up fizzling in preemptive warnings.\n\nThe current status of r/The_Donald is one of frustration. Its administration today posted snippets of an email the Reddit team sent them explaining why they\u2019d remain under quarantine. Per Reddit:\n\nWe\u2019ve been clear that we expect to see notable and sustained community transformation regarding reporting and downvoting behaviors. We once again measured this quantitatively over the 60 day appeal period, using the same methodology as at your last appeal, and which we use to evaluate all quarantined subreddits. Unfortunately, we did not see the required change in these measurements; your subscribers continue to upvote violative content at a significantly higher rate than subreddits of a similar size and topical focus to yours, in line with the figures we see in other quarantined subreddits, across the political spectrum. (Please do note that we understand it can be frustrating that we can\u2019t share this methodology with you. But given the fact that your subreddit is a frequent target of those who may disagree with you or the President politically, keeping the exact methodology confidential helps protect you against brigade attempts at gaming our statistics).\n\nThe r/The_Donald administration spends the entirety of its post expressing how unfair it is Reddit won\u2019t reveal the exact methodology behind its system. Ironically, their chief complaint is that it\u2019s easy to find examples of the kind of language that r/The_Donald was quarantined for on Reddit. This apparently indicates that the subreddit\u2019s admin is more interested in forcing Reddit to change its policy on inciting violence than on ensuring its community ceases doing so.\n\nEven more ironically, Reddit\u2018s forced r/The_Donald to abandon its pretense that its members support free speech and the Constitution. Conservative lawmaker Jim Banks has taken up r/The_Donald\u2019s fight with Reddit, like the over-protective parent of a 17-year-old athlete storming the field to demand the coach put their kid in.\n\nThe US Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and the right to free speech. This means that the government can\u2019t punish you for expressing yourself within the boundaries of the law. It also means the government can\u2019t punish a private company for dictating the terms of its service. This ancient comic by XKCD explains the situation eloquently:\n\nWhen a representative of the US government attempts to pressure a private company into changing its engagement policy, we\u2019re seeing literal censorship at work.\n\nWhen a private company tells people what they can and can\u2019t say on its platform, we\u2019re seeing the free market at work. Nobody has the inalienable right to use Reddit. Everybody has the opportunity to make their own social media site with whatever speech rules they choose.\n\nThe Constitution protects us from tyranny. Representative Banks has no more business dictating what Reddit should and shouldn\u2019t allow on its platform than he has telling the owner of a bait shop what color lures they\u2019re allowed to sell.\n\nThe quarantine\u2019s forced r/The_Donald to suffocate in its own hypocrisy. A year or two ago, any parent with an impressionable teen would have been smart to worry about the group\u2018s members radicalizing their kid. With enough exposure, it\u2019s easy for young folks or confused adults to buy into the whole \u201cred pill\u201d idea, as I wrote previously:\n\nThey subscribe wholeheartedly to the fantasy that they\u2019ve been \u201cred-pilled\u201d and thus have somehow magically gained the ability to convert folk wisdom and news articles into doctoral-quality thesis\u2019 on sociopolitical discourse. It\u2019s cute. I can\u2019t help but like their \u201cDunning-Kruger\u201d world and the simplicity it represents.\n\nBut now? The emperor has no clothes. The r/The_Donald subreddit isn\u2019t a non-stop campaign rally anymore. It\u2019s hard to imagine an influx of \u201cred pilled\u201d youth flocking to a message board full of people whining about having their \u201cfree speech\u201d stifled by a social media network.\n\nThe group still has plenty of active members. But r/The_Donald will never be the 24/7 Trump Train party-barge it once was.\n\nLet\u2019s check back in once this next 60 day appeal is up, shall we?\n\nRead next: Conservatives put national security at risk to storm impeachment proceedings", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/10/redditdonald.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
