It paves the way for the legislature to approve the measures next week before bringing them into force in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering new territory,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cOthers talk about it, but we\u2019re actually doing it.\u201d\n\nThe initiative put forward by the Left party\u2019s Katrin Lompscher, head of urban development and housing in the city\u2019s Senate, is intended to ease the burden on tenants after a property boom caused rents to double over the past decade. The political outcry has spooked investors as a separate campaign attempts to force Berlin\u2019s largest residential landlords to sell properties to the government, a move they say amounts to expropriation.\n\nBiggest Losers\n\nOne of the biggest losers has been Deutsche Wohnen SE, Berlin\u2019s largest apartment owner. Its shares have lost about 17% of their value since the rent-freeze plan was announced at the beginning of June. Vonovia SE shares fell when the plan was set out, but have since recovered.\n\nBerlin is not alone in contending with skyrocketing rental prices and a shortage of affordable housing. Spain\u2019s Socialist government pushed through a cap on rent increases earlier this year, and New Yorkers won historic rental protections from the Democrat-controlled state legislature.\n\nBerlin will allow landlords to impose an annual inflation-related rent increase of 1.3% from 2022. The legislation, expected to be rubber-stamped by the Senate on Tuesday, also permits small increases to cover renovation work.\n\nThe negotiations proceeded amid concern some of the proposals might not be constitutional. Mueller said he\u2019s confident the measures won\u2019t fall foul of the law.\n\nOther German cities recoiled at the development. Hamburg\u2019s mayor, Peter Tschentscher, told the Sunday edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the only way to avoid further rent increases is to build enough properties to keep pace with demand.\n\nEnforced sales and rent freezes will only deter investors from investing in new homes, he said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Blackman in Berlin at ablackman@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, Angela Cullen, Christopher Elser\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Berlin\u2019s governing parties struck a deal to freeze rents in the German capital for five years, marking one of the most radical plans to tackle spiraling housing costs in a major city.Mayor Michael Mueller announced the agreement between the Social Democrats, Greens and the Left party late", "authors": ["Andrew Blackman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
