He declined to directly address allegations by Chinese tech giant Huawei that the U.S. had tried to infiltrate its information systems.\n\nAnswering a question about the possibility China could unload its U.S. debt TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.57% amid the trade tensions, Trump said he wasn\u2019t worried at all since \u201cwe could refinance that very easily.\u201d China is currently the No. 2 holder of U.S. bonds, behind Japan. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been in a position where we\u2019ve had more people wanting to invest in our bonds,\u201d Trump said.\n\nU.S. stocks ended solidly higher thanks in part to the potential for new stimulus measures in China and the easing of tensions in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.94% rose 237 points, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.89% climbed 31 points and the Nasdaq COMP, -1.71% rose 102 points.\n\nRead: Dow rises more than 200 points as Hong Kong tensions ease, China signals stimulus.\n\nIRAN\n\nThe president also said it was possible he would meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly this month in New York.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey want to talk. They want to make a deal. Iran is not the same country they were 2\u00bd years ago.\u201d Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran and has said he\u2019s willing to meet Rouhani, but not drop U.S. sanctions.\n\nRouhani has rejected meeting Trump as long as sanctions remain in place.\n\nPENCE\u2019S IRELAND STAY\n\nTrump denied he had suggested that Pence stay at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland. The two-night stay has drawn fire from ethics watchdogs. Pence\u2019s chief of staff had said the vice president stayed there at Trump\u2019s suggestion. But Wednesday the president said he had \u201cno involvement.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Trump said the government was using \u201cmuch less here than anticipated\u201d in responding to Dorian and that help is needed at the border. Last week, the administration announced it would shift $271 million from within the Department of Homeland Security to help pay for more immigration detention beds at the southern border. Democrats slammed that decision.\n\nNow see: Navy ships moving out to sea to avoid Hurricane Dorian.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday talked up potential agreements with China and Iran, and said he had no role in Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s stay at a...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ681_trump__ZG_20190904133621.jpg"}
