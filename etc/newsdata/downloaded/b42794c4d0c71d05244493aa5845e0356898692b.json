I would say that I\u2019m an enabler of all colleagues across the House who want to express their different points of view. I thought the Brexiteers were in favour of taking back control of parliament being in the driving seat? Well, they can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, he came close to tears as he reflected on murdered MP Jo Cox.\n\nThe Buckingham MP was shown a video clip of him paying tribute to Ms Cox in the Commons following her death in 2016. Fighting back tears, Bercow told CNN that he remembered the moment \u201cvery keenly\u201d and \u201cthe sentiment is very raw\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cReally, Jo was a great exponent of that principle of political difference, personal amiability. It should be possible for us as democrats for us to disagree agreeably.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson and his advisers are reportedly ready to tell the Queen she cannot\u00a0sack him, even if he loses a no-confidence vote in the Commons later this month \u2013 a plan ridiculed by lawyers and historians. It comes as the Court of Session in Scotland decides this morning whether a clerk or another government official can sign and send a Brexit extension letter on the prime", "authors": ["Adam Forrest"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/18/Boris-Front-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
