To be clear, this alleged therapy is barbaric and inhumane, but repealing this law seemed to be the best path forward.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom had filed a federal lawsuit over ban in January on behalf of a therapist in Brooklyn, saying it violated free speech between a therapist and client.\n\nAlliance Senior Counsel Roger Brooks said that if the repeal goes through, the organization would \u201ccommend the move.\u201d\n\nHe called the law \u201creally quite extreme\u201d and pushed back against the idea that it was vulnerable only because of a more conservative Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a political issue as well-established First Amendment law,\u201d he said.\n\nA New York state ban that applies only to minors would still be in effect.\n\nThe therapy has been banned for minors in other states, as well. Brooks said there are currently challenges to some of those laws by other organizations, which he expected would continue.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A New York City law banning so-called gay conversion therapy would be repealed under legislation introduced Thursday over concerns that a pending federal lawsuit could lead to a decision unfavorable to the LGBTQ community if the case were to make it to the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Deepti Hajela"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2016/02/06/gay_conversion_new_york_c0-235-3522-2288_s1770x1032.jpeg?d61dd40ef6ffa3d7a4654317b9918050126bd8af"}
