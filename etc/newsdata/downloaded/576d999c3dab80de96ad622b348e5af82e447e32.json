As a novelist put on trial in Turkey for writing fiction, I longed for freedom of speech, and wanted to live in a place with a strong liberal democracy and stable democratic institutions. Back then, Britons were calm when they talked politics. Even when they disagreed, they seemed to remain controlled, and norms prevailed. In the post-Brexit era, that distinctive British calmness and sense of continuity is no more. Politics has become divisive, aggressive, emotionally charged. The dominant motto is to disrupt, dismantle and defeat. As my adopted country becomes increasingly polarized and drifts further away from Europe, I find myself seized by a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: Some of what I see in the U.K. today reminds me of what I\u2019ve seen happen in Turkey.\n\nDemocracy is far more fragile than generally assumed. It is a delicate ecosystem of checks and balances. Referendums and elections, however vital, are not enough to maintain a democracy. Let us not forget that Russia has elections. Turkey has elections. They are not democracies. In addition to the ballot box, democracy is about the rule of law, separation of powers, media freedoms, academic independence, human rights, women's rights and minority rights.\n\nThe political trajectory of Turkey holds important lessons for progressive-minded citizens across the world. The country has gone backward \u2014 at first gradually, and then with astonishing speed. Its fledgling democracy fell to pieces under tides of populist nationalism and populist authoritarianism. The government, guided by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, came to power with promises of reform, freedoms and pluralism, but delivered the exact opposite. Media diversity was crushed, academics and journalists were arrested, civil society was stifled from above. Turkey, once a resolute candidate for European Union membership, catapulted itself onto the periphery of Europe.\n\nIt all began with words: a toxic language of divisiveness, us and them, the \u201cpeople\u201d versus \u201cthe establishment.\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development Party portrayed itself as the sole representative of the people. \u201cWe are the people,\u201d said Erdo\u011fan. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Criticizing the government became tantamount to criticizing the people. All opposition was stymied in the name of the people.\n\nA similarly toxic rhetoric is taking hold in countries where populism is on the rise. In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n depicts any criticism directed at his government as an attack against the people, an attack against Hungary. The right-wing populist Freedom Party in Austria claims to be the voice of the people, accusing opponents of being the voice of high society. In Poland, the leader of the conservative ruling party, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski has called opposition members \"traitors.\"\n\nOnce, political scientists assumed that some European countries were historically inoculated against populism. Today, we have seen that\u2019s not the case.\n\nSuch inflammatory language is neither coincidental nor accidental. It lies at the heart of the populist strategy for electoral gain. Today in the U.K., hardcore Brexiteers call people who disagree with them \u201ctraitors\u201d and warn of \u201cbetrayal.\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been repeatedly criticized for naming a bill that would stop a no-deal Brexit as the \u201csurrender bill\u201d or \u201ccapitulation.\u201d\n\nThis kind of rhetoric has a damaging effect that goes beyond pure politics. When nationalism escalates, so does sexism and misogyny. Female opposition MPs have become easy targets. They receive death threats and constant abuse, and last month Labour MP Paula Sherriff asked the prime minister to tone down his language, telling the parliament that trolls, clearly emboldened by the new political climate, were echoing his words. Johnson\u2019s reply was that he had never heard such \u201chumbug\u201d in his life, though he later said it was a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\nSuddenly, politics has become a war zone and people\u2019s lives are in danger. Martial metaphors of destruction and death are used abundantly. Johnson says, \"I'd rather be dead in a ditch than agree to a Brexit extension.\" Meanwhile, benefiting from the chaos, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tells centrist parties, \u201cGet Brexit done or die!\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that the U.K. is undergoing tough and extraordinary times. European capitals are watching with concern. But it would be a historic mistake on the part of European intellectuals to forget that the U.K. is not alone in this. In truth, no country is immune to the rise of populist nationalism and tribalism. Once, political scientists assumed that some European countries were historically inoculated against such disruption. Today, from Germany to Sweden, Austria and Spain, we have seen that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe waves of nativism that are shaking the U.K. today are also waves that are ready to disrupt different parts of Europe tomorrow. It\u2019s important that we remember, as world citizens, that we are all in this mess together. What happens in one country has a direct impact on what happens elsewhere, and the solutions to today's problems \u2014 whether climate change or terrorism or the dark side of technology \u2014 can only be achieved by working together. Democracies wither away when countries feel isolated.\n\nElif Shafak is a novelist, public speaker and political scientist.
