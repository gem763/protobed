Chicago alt-rock band Wilco\u2019s 11th album is very much informed by today\u2019s global political climate. Subdued, stripped-back folk-rock instrumentation and a striding pace thread Ode to Joy together, creating an undercurrent of foreboding.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThat rhythm becomes most ominous on the hypnotic \u201cQuiet Amplifier\u201d, which adds eerie, high-pitch strings, increasingly discordant faster-tempo acoustic guitar and muted trumpets to its ghostly, distant march. Occasionally the pace plods, as on \u201cWe Were Lucky\u201d, with its extended guitar solos. But the album is lifted by the relatively upbeat \u201cEverybody Hides\u201d and \u201cHold Me Anyway\u201d, and is more than outweighed by tracks to place atop Wilco\u2019s vast canon. \u201cOne and a Half Stars\u201d swells steadily into one of the album\u2019s most affecting songs, layering harmonising vocals, arpeggiating synths and rippling guitars to the gentle strum and repetitive beat.\n\nOde to Joy follows frontman Jeff Tweedy\u2019s three solo albums and an autobiography detailing his depression and addiction. Here, his lyrics indirectly capture the sombre mood of political distrust. \u201cBright Leaves\u201d is about a crumbling relationship, with the chorus repeating \u201cyou never change\u201d, while imagery, of a white cross on the roadside (\u201cWhite Wooden Cross\u201d), and \u201cstaring at the knives in the drawer\u201d (\u201cBefore Us\u201d) add to the general unease. Tweedy\u2019s restrained vocals, meanwhile, are as dignified as the minimal music, their honesty exposed in unpolished edges.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The best albums of 2019 (so far) 1/67 Rina Mushonga \u2013 In a Galaxy It\u2019s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga. The singer-songwriter\u2019s nomadic personality is reflected in the vast scale of reference points on her new record, In a Galaxy. It\u2019s technically a follow-up to 2014\u2019s The Wild, the Wilderness, but the newfound boldness on this new work is startling. Since that first record, Mushonga has begun to incorporate themes of empowerment into her work. On \u201cAtalantA\u201d, she showcases her muscular vocals, which are capable of switching between an airy lilt to a deep, emotional moan, as she sings lyrics inspired by the Greek hunter goddess who refused to marry. In a Galaxy is a record that takes you far beyond the borders of the world you\u2019re familiar with, and into something altogether more colourful. (Roisin O'Connor) 2/67 Deerhunter \u2013 Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared? On Deerhunter\u2019s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it. Already Disappeared is not an easy album. It\u2019s often bleak and experimental: Cox\u2019s vocals burst through like distorted, burbling fragments of static, or appear muffled amid the instrumentation. This is a new side of Deerhunter that gives the listener much to contemplate. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) 3/67 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Remind Me Tomorrow After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten\u2019s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. On Remind Me Tomorrow, written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Van Etten dims her spotlight on toxicity and instead casts a warm glow behind the record\u2019s psychic overview. The anxiety and pride of impending parenthood converge on \u201cSeventeen\u201d, a paean to the invincibility and melancholy of adolescence. Addressing a younger version of herself, the 37-year-old sings of the carefree young and their mistrust of those defeated by time. After years making peace with drift and uncertainty, she\u2019s never sounded more sure of anything. (Jazz Monroe) Ryan Pfluger 4/67 Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 Amo BMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself. Closer \u201cI Don\u2019t Know What to Say\u201d is cinematic in its symphonic drama \u2013 perhaps inspired by their 2016 shows at the Royal Albert Hall that featured a full orchestra and choir \u2013 and becomes the album\u2019s most moving song. Over urgent, darting violin notes and soft strumming on an acoustic guitar, Sykes sings about the loss of a close friend, building to a hair-raising climax where he screams out the song\u2019s title one last time. Amo won\u2019t satisfy all of BMTH\u2019s fans, but it\u2019s certainly accomplished, catchy and eclectic enough to bring in some new ones. (Roisin O'Connor) 5/67 Nina Nesbitt \u2013 The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change Nesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R&B-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself. Several tracks tap into a Nineties R&B sound that UK women, from Mabel to Ella Mai, are excelling at right now. Assertive tracks \u201cLoyal to Me\u201d and \u201cLove Letter\u201d nod to TLC\u2019s \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cSurvivor\u201d, but there is vulnerability, too, in the acoustic guitar-led neo-soul of \u201cSomebody Special\u201d, and the tender heartbreak on \u201dIs it Really Me You\u2019re Missing\u201d. (Roisin O'Connor) Press image 6/67 Better Oblivion Community Center This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age \u2013 the longing to be at once noticed and invisible; the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good. As if to hammer home their parity, they even largely sing in unison \u2013 which might have had a plodding effect if the pair\u2019s voices weren\u2019t so distinct: Bridgers sings with a hazy assurance, Oberst with an emotive tremor. And when Bridgers\u2019 melody does sporadically glide above Oberst\u2019s, it is all the more potent for it. (Alexandra Pollard) 7/67 Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans \u2013 \u201cArianators\u201d \u2013 to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener\u2019s \u201cGod Is A Woman\u201d, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you\u2019re skanking along to the party brass of \u201cBloodline\u201d; the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of \u201cGhostin\u2019\u201d, which appears to address Grande\u2019s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a \u201cwingless angel\u201d with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown) Getty 8/67 James Blake \u2013 Assume Form The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album \u2013 Assume Form \u2013 with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: \u201cCan\u2019t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...\u201d The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album\u2019s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as \u201cvaporous\u201d promises to \u201cleave the ether, assume form\u201d and \u201cbe touchable, be reachable\u201d. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who\u2019ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem much warmer?\u201d (Helen Brown) Getty 9/67 AJ Tracey \u2013 AJ Tracey While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey's magpie\u2019s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date. The variety and scale of ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover Tracey sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than \u201cLadbroke Grove\u201d, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It\u2019s a thrilling work. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Ashley Verse 10/67 Sleaford Mods \u2013 Eton Alive The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There\u2019s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in \u201cKebab Spider\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe skint get used in loo roll shoes\u201d \u2013 but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be. Andrew Fearn\u2019s beats are no longer just the backdrop, they\u2019re threatening to take over this album. Surprising influences creep in, from Eighties R&B to the Human League, and on \u201cWhen You Come Up To Me\u201d, Williamson not only sings but there\u2019s a melancholy tone breaking through the anger. \u201cI don\u2019t want to flip the page/ Of my negative script,\u201d he intones on the final track, but there\u2019s just a hint that he does. (Chris Harvey) 11/67 Julia Jacklin \u2013 Crushing \u201cDo you still have that photograph?/ Would you use it to hurt me?\u201d asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of \u201cBody\u201d. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It\u2019s a masterclass in narrative songwriting. Those who fell for Jacklin\u2019s 2016 excellent debut, Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, will find a continuity of alternative attitude and vintage influences. But there\u2019s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Jacklin\u2019s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, with Jacklin sounding more confident in her contradictions: at once yearning to comfort a lover she\u2019s dumped and then, on \u201cHead Alone\u201d, declaring: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be touched all the time/ I raised my body up to be mine.\u201d Ah. Shucks. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an\u2019 all: Crushing is a triumph. (Helen Brown) Getty 12/67 Little Simz \u2013 GREY Area With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums \u2013 including 2017\u2019s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland \u2013 fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers. Yet you\u2019d be hard pushed to find a moment over the past few years where Simz has commented on this issue herself. Instead, she\u2019s been busy honing her craft for Grey Area, which sees her land on a new, bolder sound assisted by her childhood friend \u2013 the producer Inflo [Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s Love & Hate] \u2013 for a record that incorporates her dextrous flow and superb wordplay with an eclectic range of influences. The album takes in everything from jazz, funk and soul to punk and heavy rock, plus three carefully chosen features. (Roisin O'Connor) Jen Ewbank 13/67 Solange \u2013 When I Get Home Solange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose. This time, with When I Get Home, Solange has effectively given us permission to rest. Echoing similar movements seen in recent years, such as Fannie Sosa and niv Acosta\u2019s \u201cBlack Power Naps\u201d exhibition \u2013 which speaks to and hopes to remedy the socio-economic problem of higher rates of sleep deprivation among black people \u2013 the album has a calming, blissed-out quality, with its layers of sound and enveloping harmonies. And where better to dream than from the comfort of your own digs? Whether it\u2019s in the physical structure of a property that\u2019s shaped you over the years, or in the familiar sounds of the music and culture that your people have crafted, there seems to be a call to return to what is familiar. (Kuba Shand-Baptiste) Max Hirschberger 14/67 Foals \u2013 Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1) FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations \u2013 ambient rainforest throbs on \u201cMoonlight\u201d, deadpan EDM on \u201cIn Degrees\u201d, Afro-glitch Radiohead on \u201cCaf\u00e9 D\u2019Athens\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont) Alex Knowles 15/67 Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. \u201cBlack\u201d, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. \u201cVoices\u201d has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons. \u201cI could be the rapper with a message like you\u2019re hoping, but what\u2019s the point in me being the best if no one knows it?\u201d he challenges on \u201cPsycho\u201d, which flips scattershot between beats and moods as though the track itself is schizophrenic. Dave spends Psychodrama addressing issues caused by the generations who came before him. By the end of the album, he sounds like a figurehead for the hopeful future. Press image 16/67 Sigrid \u2013 Sucker Punch At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out. l enjoyed the muted, Afro-tinged authenticity of \u201cLevel Up\u201d and the conscious, pasty-girl reggae of \u201cBusiness Dinners\u201d (on which she refuses to be an industry angel) and I loved the Robyn-esque rush of \u201cBasic\u201d (which sees her yearning to shed love\u2019s complications). Sigrid has a raw energy and emotional briskness that can make you feel like you\u2019re doing aerobics in neon leg warmers atop a pristine mountain. (Helen Brown) Francesca Allen 17/67 Karen O and Danger Mouse \u2013 Lux Prima Lux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse \u2013 real name Brian Joseph Burton \u2013 during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn\u2019t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like \u201cDrown\u201d, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns. Danger Mouse is known for genre-hopping collaborations with artists such as Beck, the Black Keys and CeeLo Green, and he applies that approach here, too: the album is an impressive mix of blissed-out synths, psych-rock guitars and trippy hip-hop beats. Lux Prima is an accomplished record \u2013 proof that two wildly different minds can work seamlessly together. Maybe drunk-dialling isn\u2019t always such a bad idea. (Roisin O'Connor) Eliot Lee Hazel 18/67 The Cinematic Orchestra \u2013 To Believe This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah; strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm \u2013 both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat. Ma Fleur was emotive and piano-led, its themes of mortality and the passage of life captured so evocatively in the Patrick Watson collaboration \u201cTo Build a Home\u201d \u2013 which went on to soundtrack every TV show from Grey\u2019s Anatomy to Orange is the New Black. To Believe, however, feels more expansive in reach. (Elisa Bray) B+ 19/67 Lucy Rose \u2013 No Words Left Rose \u2013 who found fame in the UK\u2019s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band\u2019s growing hype \u2013 is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose\u2019s last record Something\u2019s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O'Connor) Getty 20/67 Nilufer Yanya \u2013 Miss Universe The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it\u2019s punctuated with mock adverts for \u201cWWAY HEALTH, our 24/7 care programme\u201d. But don\u2019t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya \u2013 who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage \u2013 grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith) Molly Daniel 21/67 Jenny Lewis \u2013 On the Line Here, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she\u2019s singing, \u201cI\u2019ve wasted my youth\u201d, it\u2019s in that sweet voice, with carefree \u201cdoo doo doo doo doo doos\u201d, and at a pace that\u2019s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It\u2019s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray) Press 22/67 Ty Segall \u2013 Deforming Lobes Comprising songs from Segall\u2019s eclectic (that\u2019s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom\u2019s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes. Opener \u201cWarm Hands\u201d, from Segall\u2019s self-titled 2017 LP, is essentially an epic jam; he grinds out fuzzy distortion and squalling riffs for a solid nine and a half minutes with a gleeful lawlessness. \u201cLove Fuzz\u201d, which serves as the opposing bookend at the album\u2019s close, is even wilder. This isn\u2019t a \u201cbest of\u201d selection \u2013 the band simply chose the tracks out of which they got the biggest kick. Deforming Lobes is unpredictable and invigorating \u2013 the best representation of Segall\u2019s restless creativity to date, not to mention the most fun to listen to. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Getty 23/67 Weyes Blood \u2013 Titanic Rising If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising \u2013 the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood \u2013 look no further than the American musician\u2019s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, \u201cThe Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.\u201d Neither of those is a particularly accurate description, but they do at least fit the album\u2019s refusal to loiter in any one genre. Slide guitars give way to violas, which usher in eerie synths. Organs crop up throughout, evoking both Renaissance music and a fairground attraction. The fragmented strings in \u201cMovies\u201d, a song about the falsities of Hollywood romance, recall the chaotic minimalism of Arthur Russell. And then there\u2019s that voice \u2013 at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. Titanic Rising isn\u2019t Bob Seger meets Enya. It\u2019s better. Alexandra Pollard 24/67 Chemical Brothers \u2013 No Geography Tension aside, there\u2019s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with \u201cGot to Keep On\u201d, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers; just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It\u2019s masterful production. (Elisa Bray) Press 25/67 Anderson .Paak \u2013 Ventura Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel \u2013 recorded around the same time \u2013 streamlines .Paak\u2019s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album. Rather than being an album of Oxnard offshoots, Ventura instead borrows heavily from .Paak\u2019s consistently brilliant 2016 record Malibu, itself a fresh slice of soulful funk. The singer croons over disco-infused, Quincy Jones-inspired trumpets on \u201cReachin\u2019 2 Much\u201d, masterfully interplays vocals from Smokey Robinson with violin flourishes on \u201cMaking it Better\u201d, and playfully raps about global warming on \u201cYada Yada\u201d. As .Paak sings on \u201cWinners Circle\u201d, \u201cThey just don\u2019t make them like this anymore\u201d. Considering how few artists have such command of their craft as .Paak, he\u2019s not wrong. (Jack Shepherd) 26/67 Loyle Carner \u2013 Not Waving, But Drowning Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday\u2019s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it\u2019s these. Familiar faces and themes serve as his trademarks. Fellow Mercury Prize nominee Jorja Smith and winner Sampha sound like old friends in their guest spots \u2013 they fit comfortably into Carner\u2019s landscape, built from classic hip-hop beats and warm piano loops. Over all of it, he raps with an easy flow in gruff yet honeyed tones. Above all, he is conscious of what family means to him, and so bookends the album with a poem from him to his mother Jean, and one from his mother to him. Not Waving, But Drowning has an emotional intelligence that shows just how strong Carner is when he\u2019s at his most vulnerable. (Roisin O'Connor) 27/67 Lizzo \u2013 Cuz I Love You No one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice \u2013 which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to \u2013 and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That\u2019s the predominant theme of the singer / rapper / flautist-extraordinaire\u2019s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You. When Lizzo played Coachella earlier this week, her set was plagued by technical problems. \u201cWhen I\u2019m headlining next time,\u201d she announced, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need my motherf**king ears to work.\u201d Judging by the strength of her third album, that might not be such an implausible assumption. (Alexandra Pollard) Luke Gilford 28/67 Fat White Family \u2013 Serfs Up! It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister \u201cOh Sebastian\u201d could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. \u201cFringe Runner\u201d is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic \u201cWhite Lines (Don\u2019t Don\u2019t Do It)\u201d; \u201cKim\u2019s Sunsets\u201d is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out \u201cBankrobber\u201d. Tarantino bossa novas and Velvets drones are all imbued with a luminous, cultured seediness, like the entire Cannes Film Festival owning up to its social diseases. Wonderfully unsettling. (Mark Beaumont) Morbid Books 29/67 Cage the Elephant \u2013 Social Cues On Cage the Elephant\u2019s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band\u2019s best work to date. Assisted by producer John Hill, whose previous credits include co-writing Portugal. The Man\u2019s mega-hit \u201cFeel it Still\u201d, the Kentucky-formed, Nashville-based Cage the Elephant remain faithful to their neo-soul influenced brand of garage rock but move to something darker and far more visceral. Single \u201cReady to let Go\u201d is by far the most explicit \u2013 a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending divorce. \u201cHouse of Glass\u201d is a sequence of frenzied mutterings with a buzzsaw guitar cutting through his attempts to convince himself of love\u2019s existence. Social Cues is an album where Shultz bares his soul, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Neil Krug 30/67 SOAK \u2013 Grim Town SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. Musically, she\u2019s developed her arrangements and become bolder, too. The tempo-shifting country-folk song \u201cGet Set Go Kid\u201d layers guitar, keys and subtle, harmonising backing vocals, unexpectedly building towards a cacophony of syncopated piano and saxophone. \u201cCrying Your Eyes Out\u201d appears to be a sombre piano ballad until it ramps up the angst with plaintive vocals, conjuring up a storm with swirling rhythms. On the melancholy, gently strummed guitar and piano-led \u201cFall Asleep, Backseat\u201d, Monds-Watson reflects on pretending to sleep as her parents make the painful decision to divorce. In a way, Grim Town portrays the journey from adolescence into young adulthood \u2013 with all the introspection, resignation and wide-eyed forays into love that entails. (Elisa Bray) Charlie Forgham Bailey 31/67 The Cranberries \u2013 In the End There\u2019s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries\u2019 final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. \u201cZombie\u201d was a protest song written by the band\u2019s late frontwoman Dolores O\u2019Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs \u2013 was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well. \u201cWake Me When it\u2019s Over\u201d, the third track on In the End, could be \u201cZombie\u201d\u2019s twin. On it, O\u2019Riordan, who recorded demos for the album\u2019s 11 tracks before her death in January last year, sings: \u201cFighting\u2019s not the answer/ Fighting\u2019s not the cure/ It\u2019s eating you like cancer/ It\u2019s killing you for sure.\u201d The band have spoken about how O\u2019Riordan was singing about leaving many of the negative things in her life behind. It sounds like The Cranberries found some kind of closure in this last record. Hopefully fans will, too. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) (Photo credit should read GUILLAUME SOUVANT/AFP/Getty Images) 32/67 Aldous Harding \u2013 Designer On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party. The New Zealand artist seems to derive a particular glee from unsettling her audience. Her Medusa\u2019s stare \u2013 witnessed at her live shows as well as in her music videos \u2013 has become the stuff of legend. She switches her vocal style song to song, moving from a lilting croon on \u201cThe Barrel\u201d to the quirky elocution of the title track. She joins forces once again with PJ Harvey collaborator John Harvey, and also enlists Welsh musicians Stephen Black (Sweet Baboo) and Huw Evans (H Hawkline) plus Clare Mactaggart on violin, giving Designer a generously textured feel. It\u2019s layered with whimsical flutes, intricate guitar picking and sombre bass lines that meander with casual abandon. At an age where the pressure is on to have everything worked out, Harding sounds delightfully free. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Claire Shilland 33/67 Big Thief - UFOF Big Thief\u2019s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you\u2019re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band\u2019s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. Often, Lenker offers the same kind of symbolic fatalism as the poetry of Christina Rosetti: \u201cWe both know/ Let me rest, let me go/ See my death become a trail/ And the trail leads to a flower/ I will blossom in your sail,\u201d she sings on \u201cTerminal Paradise\u201d. This deathly intrigue is drawn from Lenker\u2019s own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don\u2019t come away from this record feeling downcast. It\u2019s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO) 34/67 Collard - Unholy On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. Guest rapper Kojey Radical takes on the role of preacher for \u201cGround Control\u201d. There\u2019s a sax on \u201cSacrament\u201d that\u2019s loaded with longing, while the grunge-gospel stylings of \u201cMerciless\u201d offer ominous guitars and Collard\u2019s reverent croons. On the lustful \u201cHell Song\u201d he sings \u201cless is more\u2026 but more is good\u201d. You\u2019re inclined to agree with him. (RO) 35/67 Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she\u2019s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger \u201cJulien\u201d, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single \u201cParty For One\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ll be the one/ If you don\u2019t care about me/ Making love to myself/ Back on my beat\u201d), the vibe remains positively jubilant. The euphoric, Eighties synth-laden \u201cWant You in My Room\u201d is most distinctive, both vocally and melodically, and was co-written and produced by Jack Antonoff, indie tunesmith for fun. and Bleachers. But \u201cParty For One\u201d remains the album\u2019s highlight, harnessing the bouncy energy of Jepsen\u2019s breakout hit. It is the perfect upbeat end to an album of polished pop. Perhaps this will put her at the top where she belongs. (Elisa Bray) Getty Images for Spotify 36/67 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going,\u201d Tyler, the Creator begins on the song \u201cI THINK\u201d. \u201cBut I know what I\u2019m showing.\u201d The US artist\u2019s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. The production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR he\u2019s like the Minotaur luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. (RO) 37/67 Flying Lotus - Flamagra It\u2019s been a long wait for Flying Lotus\u2019s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years \u2013 snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat\u2019s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label. But it was worth the wait. Flamagra \u2013 a playful yet melancholic, skittish yet meditative 67 minutes of cosmic genius \u2013 is one of Flying Lotus\u2019s most accessible releases. A 27-track masterpiece, the album features the likes of Anderson .Paak, Little Dragon, David Lynch, and Solange, and serves up a hot, textural mix of hip-hop, psychedelia, funk, soul, jazz and electro. (Ellie Harrison) 38/67 The Amazons - Future Dust A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson\u2019s vocals, the rest of the band\u2019s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on \u201c25\u201d. \u201cAll Over Town\u201d is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace. If there\u2019s a twist here, it\u2019s final song \u201cGeorgia\u201d, which takes its classic-rock licks straight out of the Eagles\u2019 songwriting book. But this is an album that shows a band who\u2019ve grown stronger and unafraid to flex their muscle. (Elisa Bray) Alex Lake 39/67 Skepta - Ignorance is Bliss In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it\u2019s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There\u2019s no attempt to chase someone else\u2019s wave here; no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials \u2013 brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. \u201cWe used to do young and stupid,\u201d Skepta concludes on \u201cGangsta\u201d. \u201cNow we do grown.\u201d (Ian McQuaid) Boy Better Know 40/67 Bruce Springsteen - Western Stars Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It\u2019s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David\u2019s \u201cDo You Know the Way to San Jose?\u201d, and it\u2019s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. Springsteen\u2019s sublime portraiture of the American struggle \u2013 his protagonists walking with him through the ages of life as he goes \u2013 endures. \u201cHitch Hikin\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe Wayfarer\u201d are both charmed odes to the lost and rootless. Where most rock superstars sink into trad tedium by 69, Springsteen is still crafting sophisticated paeans of depth and illumination, a rock grandmaster worthy of the accolade. A must-have for anyone who has a heart. (Mark Beaumont) 41/67 Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singers/songwriters/genres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. You\u2019ll already have heard \u201cNothing Breaks Like a Heart\u201d, on which Miley Cyrus channels the quavering, fearless bluegrass spirit of her godmother Dolly Parton over a briskly plucked guitar. Ronson\u2019s production is so sharp that you all but see the steel strings rise like a hi-definition hologram from your speakers. It's a style that makes fans of vintage engineering wince, but snags the ear like a fishhook. And those quicksilver hooks just keep coming. (Helen Brown) 42/67 The Raconteurs - Help Us Stranger Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (\u201cWhat\u2019s Yours Is Mine\u201d); country soul (\u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying)\u201d); psych (a cover of Donovan\u2019s \u201cHey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)\u201d); blues and bluegrass (\u201cThoughts and Prayers\u201d). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn. From frenetic opener \u201cBored and Razed\u201d, you can sense the compelling chemistry between Benson and White playing out on stage as the duo harmonise or sing in unison, and White strikes frenzied riffs alongside Benson\u2019s melodic guitar chops. The energy here is thrilling, the strong rhythm section provided by former Detroit garage band The Greenhornes\u2019 bassist Jack Lawrence and drummer Patrick Keeler. The bass and riff-driven \u201cNow That You\u2019re Gone\u201d feels stripped back by comparison; it\u2019s perfectly crafted. Help Us Stranger has been a long time coming, but it was worth the wait. (Elisa Bray) David James Swanson 43/67 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of Ecstasy When Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006\u2019s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they've released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008\u2019s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, \u201cReady for the Floor\u201d) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Philippe Zdar \u2013 one half of the French duo Cassius and producer for the likes of MC Solaar and Phoenix \u2013 helps the band reconcile their house and hip-hop influences. The late musician had a free-spirited approach that suits Hot Chip on the psychedelic \u201cClear Blue Skies\u201d, and there are nods to early Nineties French house via the glitchy funk and vocoder effects of \u201cSpell\u201d (an album highlight).. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor\u2019s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (Roisin O'Connor) Ronald Dick 44/67 Banks \u2013 III The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. \u201cGimme\u201d demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it; \u201cContaminated\u201d mourns a toxic relationship that can\u2019t be saved; and \u201cStroke\u201d is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus \u2013 laid over a funk guitar riff. III is Banks\u2019s most cohesive album to date because she\u2019s no longer restricting herself to exploring one feeling at a time. The way she has structured this record takes the listener through the complicated yet nuanced emotions of a woman who has recently learnt to accept everything she feels. She embraces her pain, and as a consequence is able to let it go. (Roisin O\"Connor) Press image 45/67 Mini Mansions \u2013 Guy Walks into a Bar Mikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford; his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner\u2019s more adenoidal tone on opener \u201cWe Should Be Dancing\u201d. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener\u2019s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O'Connor) 46/67 Marika Hackman \u2013 Any Human Friend Hackman\u2019s debut album, 2015\u2019s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair \u2013 though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I\u2019m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer \u2013 a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman\u2019s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Written in the aftermath of Hackman\u2019s split from fellow musician Amber Bain \u2013 aka The Japanese House, who released her own reflection on their break-up on her debut album Good at Falling \u2013 Any Human Friend is a satisfyingly dismal affair that is certainly not suitable for the four-year-old who inspired it. (Alexandra Pollard) 47/67 Slipknot \u2013 We Are Not Your Kind Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of \u201cSolway Firth\u201d (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them \u2013 this may be one of the band\u2019s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (Roisin O'Connor) 48/67 Sleater-Kinney \u2013 The Center Won't Hold There\u2019s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won\u2019t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something \u2013 though they never seem quite sure what. \u201cDisconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,\u201d sings Brownstein \u2013 her singular voice all yelps and creaks \u2013 on \u201cHurry On Home\u201d. On \u201cReach Out\u201d, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein\u2019s but no less commanding, \u201cReach out and see me, I\u2019m losing my head.\u201d Quietly discordant piano ballad \u201cBroken\u201d pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: \u201cMe, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.\u201d The Center Won\u2019t Hold is a reference, it seems, to the 1920 WB Yeats poem \u201cSecond Coming\u201d: \u201cThings fall apart, the centre cannot hold.\u201d If this is Sleater-Kinney falling apart, then what a beautiful collapse it is. (Alexandra Pollard) Nikko LaMere 49/67 Rapsody \u2013 Eve The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody\u2019s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock\u2019s \u201cWatermelon Man\u201d (\u201cWhoopi\u201d) and Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d (\u201cCleo\u201d), offers a smooth R&B joint with \u201cAaliyah\u201d featuring the late singer\u2019s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is \u201can ode to the black woman\u2019s body\u201d. As on Laila\u2019s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody\u2019s natural feel for funk \u2013 \u201cMichelle\u201d (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff \u2013 but other tracks, such as closer \u201cAfeni\u201d, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist\u2019s duty, \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned, is to reflect the times\u201d. This is precisely what Rapsody has done \u2013 in the most resonant way possible. 50/67 Taylor Swift \u2013 Lover Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cMe!\u201d, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track \u201cForgot That You Existed\u201d is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. \u201cSomething magical happened one night,\u201d she sings. \u201cI forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift\u2019s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard) 51/67 Sheryl Crow \u2013 Threads One could argue that there\u2019s too much eclecticism here \u2013 that if this really is Crow\u2019s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn\u2019t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on \u201cFlying Blind\u201d \u2013 her steely determination on this record has you believing that she\u2019ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O'Connor) Dove Shore 52/67 Common \u2013 Let Love There\u2019s more of a soul influence here \u2013 \u201cHER Love\u201d, the counterpoint to his 1994 track \u201cI Used to Love HER\u201d, benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while \u201cMemories of Home\u201d skitters over a muffled bass and Common\u2019s recollections of his past \u2013 including an incident where he was molested by a family member. Where Black America Again was notable for its sharp, observational urgency, Let Love feels far more personal, and softer in tone. Common\u2019s optimistic nature gives it an uplifting vibe, and while closer \u201cGod is Love\u201d is gently critical of people who use their religion to persecute others, the message is one of learning from our mistakes. It couldn\u2019t be more timely. (Roisin O'Connor) File image 53/67 Lana Del Rey \u2013 Norman Fucking Rockwell! This is Del Rey at her most assertive \u2013 personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey\u2019s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201cbelieves it\u2019s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he\u2019s famous\u201d) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from \u201cHappiness Is a Butterfly\u201d, that is. \u201cIf he\u2019s a serial killer, then what\u2019s the worst that can happen to a girl who\u2019s already hurt?\u201d she asks. Crikey. \u201cWe were so obsessed with writing the next best American record,\u201d sings Del Rey on \u201cNext Best American Record\u201d. This isn\u2019t it, but it\u2019s pretty great all the same. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty Images 54/67 Ezra Furman \u2013 Twelve Nudes Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted \u201cooh oohs\u201d via The Rolling Stones\u2019s \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d on opener \u201cCalm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone\u201d. \u201cTransition from Nowhere to Nowhere\u201d is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while \u201cRated R Crusaders\u201d shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the Israel/Palestine conflict. His sardonic yet sensitive approach to gender and sexuality on \u201cI Wanna Be Your Girlfriend\u201d is a reminder, if one was needed, why he was so well-suited to scoring the soundtrack for Netflix\u2019s Sex Education. Each song feels personal yet relatable \u2013 the deep-rooted despair felt on \u201cTrauma\u201d at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on \u201cWhat Can You Do But Rock n Roll\u201d. Twelve Nudes is Furman\u2019s most urgent and cathartic record to date. (Roisin O'Connor) Jessica Lehrman 55/67 The Black Keys \u2013 Let's Rock! If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011\u2019s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let\u2019s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener \u201cShine a Light\u201d, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontman/guitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over AC/DC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving \u201cLo/Hi\u201d, while the languid \u201cSit Around and Miss You\u201d is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in \u201cTell Me Lies\u201d and it\u2019s not just the lyrics that\u2019ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. Indeed, so heavily do The Black Keys wear their influences that the record \u2013 their ninth \u2013 risks coming across like Stars in Their Eyes: The Rock Edition. But if this is genre pastiche, it\u2019s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (Patrick Smith) 56/67 Thom Yorke \u2013 ANIMA The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener \u201cTraffic\u201d, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point). Yorke often tends to make his most explicit political comments outside of music: in a recent interview, for example, he complained about how discourse has regressed, referring to British and American politics as \u201ca Punch and Judy show\u201d. But there are moments here where you feel his rage: \u201cGoddamned machinery, why don\u2019t you speak to me?/ One day I\u2019m gonna take an axe to you,\u201d he growls on \u201cThe Axe\u201d. (Roisin O'Connor) Greg Williams 57/67 Nas \u2013 The Lost Tapes II There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on \u201cWho Are You\u201d against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. \u201cAdult Film\u201d features a gorgeous piano riff; the Pete Rock-produced \u201cThe Art of It\u201d has a delicious funk vibe; \u201cIt Never Ends\u201d comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018\u2019s Nasir) didn\u2019t pan out \u2013 perhaps because West\u2019s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas\u2019s penchant for procrastination \u2013 \u201cYou Mean the World to Me\u201d sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it\u2019s a standout on this album. Maybe Nas never really lost it, but The Lost Tapes II sounds like an artist rediscovering his love for hip hop in the most joyous and satisfying way. It\u2019s hard not to consider his timing for this release, just three months since the 25th anniversary of Illmatic. It feels a lot like a third coming. (Roisin O'Connor) Rex 58/67 The Flaming Lips \u2013 King's Mouth For all the album\u2019s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek \u2013 save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics \u201cwhen you stepped on your cat\u201d on \u201cHow Many Times\u201d. Epic highlight \u201cElectric Fire\u201d and celestial album-closer \u201cHow Can a Head\u201d capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. Just as the preceding art installation invited viewers to enter its vast head of LED lights and wonder, this album does the same. (Elisa Bray) Warner Bros Records 59/67 Bat for Lashes \u2013 Lost Girls Given our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground \u2013 and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys; expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith) Jen Ewbank 60/67 MUNA \u2013 Saves the World MUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry\u2019s summer smash \u201cNever Really Over\u201d, or Taylor Swift\u2019s feminist clap back \u201cThe Man\u201d, and you\u2019ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017\u2019s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time. If there\u2019s any justice, its follow-up, Saves the World, should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single \u201cNumber One Fan\u201d banishes intrusive thoughts \u2013 \u201cNobody likes me and I\u2019m gonna die\u201d \u2013 just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek.(Alexandra Pollard) 61/67 Pixies \u2013 Beneath the Eyrie Tales of witchy curses (\u201cOn Graveyard Hill\u201d) and spirit reincarnation (\u201cDaniel Boone\u201d) feel like they\u2019ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album\u2019s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. \u201cReady for Love\u201d is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal\u2019s now-permanent replacement), while lead single \u201cCatfish Kate\u201d \u2013 a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan \u2013 is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray) BMG 62/67 Jenny Hval \u2013 The Practice of Love This endlessly fascinating artist\u2019s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016's Blood Bitch, examining one\u2019s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray) There\u2019s an interior dialogue throughout, which is sometimes more intriguing than musically engrossing. Take the title track, whose spoken-word monologue morphs into a recorded conversation in which a woman discusses how childlessness in her late thirties affects her place in society, over the sparsest electronica. Tore Setre 63/67 Metronomy \u2013 Metronomy Forever This is Metronomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy \u201cUpset My Girlfriend\u201d, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they\u2019re in, it\u2019s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness; like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White) 64/67 Charli XCX \u2013 Charli Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: \u201cI put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!\u201d I felt that spirit through almost every the clink, clunk, crash and molten flare of this album. It ends with another Sivan collaboration: \u201c2099\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, f**k up, future, future...\u201d they intone. Charli\u2019s always so much cooler when she swaps the people-pleasing nostalgic for the free-wheeling futuristic. (Helen Brown) Getty/Pandora 65/67 Sam Fender \u2013 Hypersonic Missiles Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen \u2013 on Hypersonic Missiles they\u2019re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen\u2019s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation \u2013 not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O'Connor) 66/67 Liam Gallagher \u2013 Why Me? Why Not. Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. \u201cGotta live for something besides yesterdays,\u201d Gallagher snarls on \u201cBe Still\u201d. The downbeat \u201cOnce\u201d forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (\u201cI remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once\u201d). And \u201cNow That I\u2019ve Found You\u201d is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. \u201cI know it\u2019s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,\u201d he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars. (Adam White) 67/67 Brittany Howard \u2013 Jaime The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on \u201cShort and Sweet\u201d, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard\u2019s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On \u201cHe Loves Me\u201d, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she\u2019s long since stopped going to church. There\u2019s no track on Jaime that is likely to make waves \u2013 not in the same way as some of the better-known Alabama Shakes tracks, such as \u201cHold On\u201d or \u201cThis Feeling\u201d (the latter of which was recently used to remarkable effect in the final scene of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag). But what lovely ripples it makes. (Alex Pollard) Brantley Gutierrez 1/67 Rina Mushonga \u2013 In a Galaxy It\u2019s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga. The singer-songwriter\u2019s nomadic personality is reflected in the vast scale of reference points on her new record, In a Galaxy. It\u2019s technically a follow-up to 2014\u2019s The Wild, the Wilderness, but the newfound boldness on this new work is startling. Since that first record, Mushonga has begun to incorporate themes of empowerment into her work. On \u201cAtalantA\u201d, she showcases her muscular vocals, which are capable of switching between an airy lilt to a deep, emotional moan, as she sings lyrics inspired by the Greek hunter goddess who refused to marry. In a Galaxy is a record that takes you far beyond the borders of the world you\u2019re familiar with, and into something altogether more colourful. (Roisin O'Connor) 2/67 Deerhunter \u2013 Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared? On Deerhunter\u2019s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it. Already Disappeared is not an easy album. It\u2019s often bleak and experimental: Cox\u2019s vocals burst through like distorted, burbling fragments of static, or appear muffled amid the instrumentation. This is a new side of Deerhunter that gives the listener much to contemplate. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) 3/67 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Remind Me Tomorrow After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten\u2019s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. On Remind Me Tomorrow, written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Van Etten dims her spotlight on toxicity and instead casts a warm glow behind the record\u2019s psychic overview. The anxiety and pride of impending parenthood converge on \u201cSeventeen\u201d, a paean to the invincibility and melancholy of adolescence. Addressing a younger version of herself, the 37-year-old sings of the carefree young and their mistrust of those defeated by time. After years making peace with drift and uncertainty, she\u2019s never sounded more sure of anything. (Jazz Monroe) Ryan Pfluger 4/67 Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 Amo BMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself. Closer \u201cI Don\u2019t Know What to Say\u201d is cinematic in its symphonic drama \u2013 perhaps inspired by their 2016 shows at the Royal Albert Hall that featured a full orchestra and choir \u2013 and becomes the album\u2019s most moving song. Over urgent, darting violin notes and soft strumming on an acoustic guitar, Sykes sings about the loss of a close friend, building to a hair-raising climax where he screams out the song\u2019s title one last time. Amo won\u2019t satisfy all of BMTH\u2019s fans, but it\u2019s certainly accomplished, catchy and eclectic enough to bring in some new ones. (Roisin O'Connor) 5/67 Nina Nesbitt \u2013 The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change Nesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R&B-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself. Several tracks tap into a Nineties R&B sound that UK women, from Mabel to Ella Mai, are excelling at right now. Assertive tracks \u201cLoyal to Me\u201d and \u201cLove Letter\u201d nod to TLC\u2019s \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cSurvivor\u201d, but there is vulnerability, too, in the acoustic guitar-led neo-soul of \u201cSomebody Special\u201d, and the tender heartbreak on \u201dIs it Really Me You\u2019re Missing\u201d. (Roisin O'Connor) Press image 6/67 Better Oblivion Community Center This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age \u2013 the longing to be at once noticed and invisible; the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good. As if to hammer home their parity, they even largely sing in unison \u2013 which might have had a plodding effect if the pair\u2019s voices weren\u2019t so distinct: Bridgers sings with a hazy assurance, Oberst with an emotive tremor. And when Bridgers\u2019 melody does sporadically glide above Oberst\u2019s, it is all the more potent for it. (Alexandra Pollard) 7/67 Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans \u2013 \u201cArianators\u201d \u2013 to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener\u2019s \u201cGod Is A Woman\u201d, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you\u2019re skanking along to the party brass of \u201cBloodline\u201d; the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of \u201cGhostin\u2019\u201d, which appears to address Grande\u2019s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a \u201cwingless angel\u201d with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown) Getty 8/67 James Blake \u2013 Assume Form The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album \u2013 Assume Form \u2013 with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: \u201cCan\u2019t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...\u201d The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album\u2019s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as \u201cvaporous\u201d promises to \u201cleave the ether, assume form\u201d and \u201cbe touchable, be reachable\u201d. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who\u2019ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem much warmer?\u201d (Helen Brown) Getty 9/67 AJ Tracey \u2013 AJ Tracey While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey's magpie\u2019s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date. The variety and scale of ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover Tracey sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than \u201cLadbroke Grove\u201d, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It\u2019s a thrilling work. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Ashley Verse 10/67 Sleaford Mods \u2013 Eton Alive The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There\u2019s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in \u201cKebab Spider\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe skint get used in loo roll shoes\u201d \u2013 but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be. Andrew Fearn\u2019s beats are no longer just the backdrop, they\u2019re threatening to take over this album. Surprising influences creep in, from Eighties R&B to the Human League, and on \u201cWhen You Come Up To Me\u201d, Williamson not only sings but there\u2019s a melancholy tone breaking through the anger. \u201cI don\u2019t want to flip the page/ Of my negative script,\u201d he intones on the final track, but there\u2019s just a hint that he does. (Chris Harvey) 11/67 Julia Jacklin \u2013 Crushing \u201cDo you still have that photograph?/ Would you use it to hurt me?\u201d asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of \u201cBody\u201d. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It\u2019s a masterclass in narrative songwriting. Those who fell for Jacklin\u2019s 2016 excellent debut, Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win, will find a continuity of alternative attitude and vintage influences. But there\u2019s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Jacklin\u2019s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, with Jacklin sounding more confident in her contradictions: at once yearning to comfort a lover she\u2019s dumped and then, on \u201cHead Alone\u201d, declaring: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be touched all the time/ I raised my body up to be mine.\u201d Ah. Shucks. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an\u2019 all: Crushing is a triumph. (Helen Brown) Getty 12/67 Little Simz \u2013 GREY Area With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums \u2013 including 2017\u2019s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland \u2013 fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers. Yet you\u2019d be hard pushed to find a moment over the past few years where Simz has commented on this issue herself. Instead, she\u2019s been busy honing her craft for Grey Area, which sees her land on a new, bolder sound assisted by her childhood friend \u2013 the producer Inflo [Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s Love & Hate] \u2013 for a record that incorporates her dextrous flow and superb wordplay with an eclectic range of influences. The album takes in everything from jazz, funk and soul to punk and heavy rock, plus three carefully chosen features. (Roisin O'Connor) Jen Ewbank 13/67 Solange \u2013 When I Get Home Solange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose. This time, with When I Get Home, Solange has effectively given us permission to rest. Echoing similar movements seen in recent years, such as Fannie Sosa and niv Acosta\u2019s \u201cBlack Power Naps\u201d exhibition \u2013 which speaks to and hopes to remedy the socio-economic problem of higher rates of sleep deprivation among black people \u2013 the album has a calming, blissed-out quality, with its layers of sound and enveloping harmonies. And where better to dream than from the comfort of your own digs? Whether it\u2019s in the physical structure of a property that\u2019s shaped you over the years, or in the familiar sounds of the music and culture that your people have crafted, there seems to be a call to return to what is familiar. (Kuba Shand-Baptiste) Max Hirschberger 14/67 Foals \u2013 Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1) FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations \u2013 ambient rainforest throbs on \u201cMoonlight\u201d, deadpan EDM on \u201cIn Degrees\u201d, Afro-glitch Radiohead on \u201cCaf\u00e9 D\u2019Athens\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont) Alex Knowles 15/67 Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. \u201cBlack\u201d, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. \u201cVoices\u201d has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons. \u201cI could be the rapper with a message like you\u2019re hoping, but what\u2019s the point in me being the best if no one knows it?\u201d he challenges on \u201cPsycho\u201d, which flips scattershot between beats and moods as though the track itself is schizophrenic. Dave spends Psychodrama addressing issues caused by the generations who came before him. By the end of the album, he sounds like a figurehead for the hopeful future. Press image 16/67 Sigrid \u2013 Sucker Punch At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out. l enjoyed the muted, Afro-tinged authenticity of \u201cLevel Up\u201d and the conscious, pasty-girl reggae of \u201cBusiness Dinners\u201d (on which she refuses to be an industry angel) and I loved the Robyn-esque rush of \u201cBasic\u201d (which sees her yearning to shed love\u2019s complications). Sigrid has a raw energy and emotional briskness that can make you feel like you\u2019re doing aerobics in neon leg warmers atop a pristine mountain. (Helen Brown) Francesca Allen 17/67 Karen O and Danger Mouse \u2013 Lux Prima Lux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse \u2013 real name Brian Joseph Burton \u2013 during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn\u2019t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like \u201cDrown\u201d, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns. Danger Mouse is known for genre-hopping collaborations with artists such as Beck, the Black Keys and CeeLo Green, and he applies that approach here, too: the album is an impressive mix of blissed-out synths, psych-rock guitars and trippy hip-hop beats. Lux Prima is an accomplished record \u2013 proof that two wildly different minds can work seamlessly together. Maybe drunk-dialling isn\u2019t always such a bad idea. (Roisin O'Connor) Eliot Lee Hazel 18/67 The Cinematic Orchestra \u2013 To Believe This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah; strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm \u2013 both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat. Ma Fleur was emotive and piano-led, its themes of mortality and the passage of life captured so evocatively in the Patrick Watson collaboration \u201cTo Build a Home\u201d \u2013 which went on to soundtrack every TV show from Grey\u2019s Anatomy to Orange is the New Black. To Believe, however, feels more expansive in reach. (Elisa Bray) B+ 19/67 Lucy Rose \u2013 No Words Left Rose \u2013 who found fame in the UK\u2019s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band\u2019s growing hype \u2013 is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose\u2019s last record Something\u2019s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O'Connor) Getty 20/67 Nilufer Yanya \u2013 Miss Universe The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it\u2019s punctuated with mock adverts for \u201cWWAY HEALTH, our 24/7 care programme\u201d. But don\u2019t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya \u2013 who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage \u2013 grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith) Molly Daniel 21/67 Jenny Lewis \u2013 On the Line Here, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she\u2019s singing, \u201cI\u2019ve wasted my youth\u201d, it\u2019s in that sweet voice, with carefree \u201cdoo doo doo doo doo doos\u201d, and at a pace that\u2019s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It\u2019s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray) Press 22/67 Ty Segall \u2013 Deforming Lobes Comprising songs from Segall\u2019s eclectic (that\u2019s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom\u2019s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes. Opener \u201cWarm Hands\u201d, from Segall\u2019s self-titled 2017 LP, is essentially an epic jam; he grinds out fuzzy distortion and squalling riffs for a solid nine and a half minutes with a gleeful lawlessness. \u201cLove Fuzz\u201d, which serves as the opposing bookend at the album\u2019s close, is even wilder. This isn\u2019t a \u201cbest of\u201d selection \u2013 the band simply chose the tracks out of which they got the biggest kick. Deforming Lobes is unpredictable and invigorating \u2013 the best representation of Segall\u2019s restless creativity to date, not to mention the most fun to listen to. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Getty 23/67 Weyes Blood \u2013 Titanic Rising If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising \u2013 the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood \u2013 look no further than the American musician\u2019s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, \u201cThe Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.\u201d Neither of those is a particularly accurate description, but they do at least fit the album\u2019s refusal to loiter in any one genre. Slide guitars give way to violas, which usher in eerie synths. Organs crop up throughout, evoking both Renaissance music and a fairground attraction. The fragmented strings in \u201cMovies\u201d, a song about the falsities of Hollywood romance, recall the chaotic minimalism of Arthur Russell. And then there\u2019s that voice \u2013 at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. Titanic Rising isn\u2019t Bob Seger meets Enya. It\u2019s better. Alexandra Pollard 24/67 Chemical Brothers \u2013 No Geography Tension aside, there\u2019s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with \u201cGot to Keep On\u201d, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers; just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It\u2019s masterful production. (Elisa Bray) Press 25/67 Anderson .Paak \u2013 Ventura Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel \u2013 recorded around the same time \u2013 streamlines .Paak\u2019s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album. Rather than being an album of Oxnard offshoots, Ventura instead borrows heavily from .Paak\u2019s consistently brilliant 2016 record Malibu, itself a fresh slice of soulful funk. The singer croons over disco-infused, Quincy Jones-inspired trumpets on \u201cReachin\u2019 2 Much\u201d, masterfully interplays vocals from Smokey Robinson with violin flourishes on \u201cMaking it Better\u201d, and playfully raps about global warming on \u201cYada Yada\u201d. As .Paak sings on \u201cWinners Circle\u201d, \u201cThey just don\u2019t make them like this anymore\u201d. Considering how few artists have such command of their craft as .Paak, he\u2019s not wrong. (Jack Shepherd) 26/67 Loyle Carner \u2013 Not Waving, But Drowning Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday\u2019s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it\u2019s these. Familiar faces and themes serve as his trademarks. Fellow Mercury Prize nominee Jorja Smith and winner Sampha sound like old friends in their guest spots \u2013 they fit comfortably into Carner\u2019s landscape, built from classic hip-hop beats and warm piano loops. Over all of it, he raps with an easy flow in gruff yet honeyed tones. Above all, he is conscious of what family means to him, and so bookends the album with a poem from him to his mother Jean, and one from his mother to him. Not Waving, But Drowning has an emotional intelligence that shows just how strong Carner is when he\u2019s at his most vulnerable. (Roisin O'Connor) 27/67 Lizzo \u2013 Cuz I Love You No one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice \u2013 which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to \u2013 and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That\u2019s the predominant theme of the singer / rapper / flautist-extraordinaire\u2019s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You. When Lizzo played Coachella earlier this week, her set was plagued by technical problems. \u201cWhen I\u2019m headlining next time,\u201d she announced, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need my motherf**king ears to work.\u201d Judging by the strength of her third album, that might not be such an implausible assumption. (Alexandra Pollard) Luke Gilford 28/67 Fat White Family \u2013 Serfs Up! It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister \u201cOh Sebastian\u201d could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. \u201cFringe Runner\u201d is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic \u201cWhite Lines (Don\u2019t Don\u2019t Do It)\u201d; \u201cKim\u2019s Sunsets\u201d is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out \u201cBankrobber\u201d. Tarantino bossa novas and Velvets drones are all imbued with a luminous, cultured seediness, like the entire Cannes Film Festival owning up to its social diseases. Wonderfully unsettling. (Mark Beaumont) Morbid Books 29/67 Cage the Elephant \u2013 Social Cues On Cage the Elephant\u2019s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band\u2019s best work to date. Assisted by producer John Hill, whose previous credits include co-writing Portugal. The Man\u2019s mega-hit \u201cFeel it Still\u201d, the Kentucky-formed, Nashville-based Cage the Elephant remain faithful to their neo-soul influenced brand of garage rock but move to something darker and far more visceral. Single \u201cReady to let Go\u201d is by far the most explicit \u2013 a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending divorce. \u201cHouse of Glass\u201d is a sequence of frenzied mutterings with a buzzsaw guitar cutting through his attempts to convince himself of love\u2019s existence. Social Cues is an album where Shultz bares his soul, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Neil Krug 30/67 SOAK \u2013 Grim Town SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. Musically, she\u2019s developed her arrangements and become bolder, too. The tempo-shifting country-folk song \u201cGet Set Go Kid\u201d layers guitar, keys and subtle, harmonising backing vocals, unexpectedly building towards a cacophony of syncopated piano and saxophone. \u201cCrying Your Eyes Out\u201d appears to be a sombre piano ballad until it ramps up the angst with plaintive vocals, conjuring up a storm with swirling rhythms. On the melancholy, gently strummed guitar and piano-led \u201cFall Asleep, Backseat\u201d, Monds-Watson reflects on pretending to sleep as her parents make the painful decision to divorce. In a way, Grim Town portrays the journey from adolescence into young adulthood \u2013 with all the introspection, resignation and wide-eyed forays into love that entails. (Elisa Bray) Charlie Forgham Bailey 31/67 The Cranberries \u2013 In the End There\u2019s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries\u2019 final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. \u201cZombie\u201d was a protest song written by the band\u2019s late frontwoman Dolores O\u2019Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs \u2013 was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well. \u201cWake Me When it\u2019s Over\u201d, the third track on In the End, could be \u201cZombie\u201d\u2019s twin. On it, O\u2019Riordan, who recorded demos for the album\u2019s 11 tracks before her death in January last year, sings: \u201cFighting\u2019s not the answer/ Fighting\u2019s not the cure/ It\u2019s eating you like cancer/ It\u2019s killing you for sure.\u201d The band have spoken about how O\u2019Riordan was singing about leaving many of the negative things in her life behind. It sounds like The Cranberries found some kind of closure in this last record. Hopefully fans will, too. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) (Photo credit should read GUILLAUME SOUVANT/AFP/Getty Images) 32/67 Aldous Harding \u2013 Designer On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party. The New Zealand artist seems to derive a particular glee from unsettling her audience. Her Medusa\u2019s stare \u2013 witnessed at her live shows as well as in her music videos \u2013 has become the stuff of legend. She switches her vocal style song to song, moving from a lilting croon on \u201cThe Barrel\u201d to the quirky elocution of the title track. She joins forces once again with PJ Harvey collaborator John Harvey, and also enlists Welsh musicians Stephen Black (Sweet Baboo) and Huw Evans (H Hawkline) plus Clare Mactaggart on violin, giving Designer a generously textured feel. It\u2019s layered with whimsical flutes, intricate guitar picking and sombre bass lines that meander with casual abandon. At an age where the pressure is on to have everything worked out, Harding sounds delightfully free. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Claire Shilland 33/67 Big Thief - UFOF Big Thief\u2019s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you\u2019re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band\u2019s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. Often, Lenker offers the same kind of symbolic fatalism as the poetry of Christina Rosetti: \u201cWe both know/ Let me rest, let me go/ See my death become a trail/ And the trail leads to a flower/ I will blossom in your sail,\u201d she sings on \u201cTerminal Paradise\u201d. This deathly intrigue is drawn from Lenker\u2019s own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don\u2019t come away from this record feeling downcast. It\u2019s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO) 34/67 Collard - Unholy On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. Guest rapper Kojey Radical takes on the role of preacher for \u201cGround Control\u201d. There\u2019s a sax on \u201cSacrament\u201d that\u2019s loaded with longing, while the grunge-gospel stylings of \u201cMerciless\u201d offer ominous guitars and Collard\u2019s reverent croons. On the lustful \u201cHell Song\u201d he sings \u201cless is more\u2026 but more is good\u201d. You\u2019re inclined to agree with him. (RO) 35/67 Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she\u2019s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger \u201cJulien\u201d, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single \u201cParty For One\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ll be the one/ If you don\u2019t care about me/ Making love to myself/ Back on my beat\u201d), the vibe remains positively jubilant. The euphoric, Eighties synth-laden \u201cWant You in My Room\u201d is most distinctive, both vocally and melodically, and was co-written and produced by Jack Antonoff, indie tunesmith for fun. and Bleachers. But \u201cParty For One\u201d remains the album\u2019s highlight, harnessing the bouncy energy of Jepsen\u2019s breakout hit. It is the perfect upbeat end to an album of polished pop. Perhaps this will put her at the top where she belongs. (Elisa Bray) Getty Images for Spotify 36/67 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going,\u201d Tyler, the Creator begins on the song \u201cI THINK\u201d. \u201cBut I know what I\u2019m showing.\u201d The US artist\u2019s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. The production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR he\u2019s like the Minotaur luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. (RO) 37/67 Flying Lotus - Flamagra It\u2019s been a long wait for Flying Lotus\u2019s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years \u2013 snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat\u2019s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label. But it was worth the wait. Flamagra \u2013 a playful yet melancholic, skittish yet meditative 67 minutes of cosmic genius \u2013 is one of Flying Lotus\u2019s most accessible releases. A 27-track masterpiece, the album features the likes of Anderson .Paak, Little Dragon, David Lynch, and Solange, and serves up a hot, textural mix of hip-hop, psychedelia, funk, soul, jazz and electro. (Ellie Harrison) 38/67 The Amazons - Future Dust A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson\u2019s vocals, the rest of the band\u2019s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on \u201c25\u201d. \u201cAll Over Town\u201d is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace. If there\u2019s a twist here, it\u2019s final song \u201cGeorgia\u201d, which takes its classic-rock licks straight out of the Eagles\u2019 songwriting book. But this is an album that shows a band who\u2019ve grown stronger and unafraid to flex their muscle. (Elisa Bray) Alex Lake 39/67 Skepta - Ignorance is Bliss In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it\u2019s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There\u2019s no attempt to chase someone else\u2019s wave here; no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials \u2013 brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. \u201cWe used to do young and stupid,\u201d Skepta concludes on \u201cGangsta\u201d. \u201cNow we do grown.\u201d (Ian McQuaid) Boy Better Know 40/67 Bruce Springsteen - Western Stars Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It\u2019s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David\u2019s \u201cDo You Know the Way to San Jose?\u201d, and it\u2019s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. Springsteen\u2019s sublime portraiture of the American struggle \u2013 his protagonists walking with him through the ages of life as he goes \u2013 endures. \u201cHitch Hikin\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe Wayfarer\u201d are both charmed odes to the lost and rootless. Where most rock superstars sink into trad tedium by 69, Springsteen is still crafting sophisticated paeans of depth and illumination, a rock grandmaster worthy of the accolade. A must-have for anyone who has a heart. (Mark Beaumont) 41/67 Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singers/songwriters/genres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. You\u2019ll already have heard \u201cNothing Breaks Like a Heart\u201d, on which Miley Cyrus channels the quavering, fearless bluegrass spirit of her godmother Dolly Parton over a briskly plucked guitar. Ronson\u2019s production is so sharp that you all but see the steel strings rise like a hi-definition hologram from your speakers. It's a style that makes fans of vintage engineering wince, but snags the ear like a fishhook. And those quicksilver hooks just keep coming. (Helen Brown) 42/67 The Raconteurs - Help Us Stranger Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (\u201cWhat\u2019s Yours Is Mine\u201d); country soul (\u201cSomedays (I Don\u2019t Feel Like Trying)\u201d); psych (a cover of Donovan\u2019s \u201cHey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)\u201d); blues and bluegrass (\u201cThoughts and Prayers\u201d). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn. From frenetic opener \u201cBored and Razed\u201d, you can sense the compelling chemistry between Benson and White playing out on stage as the duo harmonise or sing in unison, and White strikes frenzied riffs alongside Benson\u2019s melodic guitar chops. The energy here is thrilling, the strong rhythm section provided by former Detroit garage band The Greenhornes\u2019 bassist Jack Lawrence and drummer Patrick Keeler. The bass and riff-driven \u201cNow That You\u2019re Gone\u201d feels stripped back by comparison; it\u2019s perfectly crafted. Help Us Stranger has been a long time coming, but it was worth the wait. (Elisa Bray) David James Swanson 43/67 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of Ecstasy When Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006\u2019s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they've released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008\u2019s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, \u201cReady for the Floor\u201d) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Philippe Zdar \u2013 one half of the French duo Cassius and producer for the likes of MC Solaar and Phoenix \u2013 helps the band reconcile their house and hip-hop influences. The late musician had a free-spirited approach that suits Hot Chip on the psychedelic \u201cClear Blue Skies\u201d, and there are nods to early Nineties French house via the glitchy funk and vocoder effects of \u201cSpell\u201d (an album highlight).. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor\u2019s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (Roisin O'Connor) Ronald Dick 44/67 Banks \u2013 III The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. \u201cGimme\u201d demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it; \u201cContaminated\u201d mourns a toxic relationship that can\u2019t be saved; and \u201cStroke\u201d is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus \u2013 laid over a funk guitar riff. III is Banks\u2019s most cohesive album to date because she\u2019s no longer restricting herself to exploring one feeling at a time. The way she has structured this record takes the listener through the complicated yet nuanced emotions of a woman who has recently learnt to accept everything she feels. She embraces her pain, and as a consequence is able to let it go. (Roisin O\"Connor) Press image 45/67 Mini Mansions \u2013 Guy Walks into a Bar Mikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford; his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner\u2019s more adenoidal tone on opener \u201cWe Should Be Dancing\u201d. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener\u2019s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O'Connor) 46/67 Marika Hackman \u2013 Any Human Friend Hackman\u2019s debut album, 2015\u2019s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair \u2013 though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I\u2019m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer \u2013 a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman\u2019s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Written in the aftermath of Hackman\u2019s split from fellow musician Amber Bain \u2013 aka The Japanese House, who released her own reflection on their break-up on her debut album Good at Falling \u2013 Any Human Friend is a satisfyingly dismal affair that is certainly not suitable for the four-year-old who inspired it. (Alexandra Pollard) 47/67 Slipknot \u2013 We Are Not Your Kind Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of \u201cSolway Firth\u201d (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them \u2013 this may be one of the band\u2019s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (Roisin O'Connor) 48/67 Sleater-Kinney \u2013 The Center Won't Hold There\u2019s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won\u2019t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something \u2013 though they never seem quite sure what. \u201cDisconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,\u201d sings Brownstein \u2013 her singular voice all yelps and creaks \u2013 on \u201cHurry On Home\u201d. On \u201cReach Out\u201d, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein\u2019s but no less commanding, \u201cReach out and see me, I\u2019m losing my head.\u201d Quietly discordant piano ballad \u201cBroken\u201d pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: \u201cMe, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.\u201d The Center Won\u2019t Hold is a reference, it seems, to the 1920 WB Yeats poem \u201cSecond Coming\u201d: \u201cThings fall apart, the centre cannot hold.\u201d If this is Sleater-Kinney falling apart, then what a beautiful collapse it is. (Alexandra Pollard) Nikko LaMere 49/67 Rapsody \u2013 Eve The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody\u2019s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock\u2019s \u201cWatermelon Man\u201d (\u201cWhoopi\u201d) and Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d (\u201cCleo\u201d), offers a smooth R&B joint with \u201cAaliyah\u201d featuring the late singer\u2019s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is \u201can ode to the black woman\u2019s body\u201d. As on Laila\u2019s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody\u2019s natural feel for funk \u2013 \u201cMichelle\u201d (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff \u2013 but other tracks, such as closer \u201cAfeni\u201d, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist\u2019s duty, \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned, is to reflect the times\u201d. This is precisely what Rapsody has done \u2013 in the most resonant way possible. 50/67 Taylor Swift \u2013 Lover Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cMe!\u201d, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track \u201cForgot That You Existed\u201d is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. \u201cSomething magical happened one night,\u201d she sings. \u201cI forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift\u2019s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard) 51/67 Sheryl Crow \u2013 Threads One could argue that there\u2019s too much eclecticism here \u2013 that if this really is Crow\u2019s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn\u2019t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on \u201cFlying Blind\u201d \u2013 her steely determination on this record has you believing that she\u2019ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O'Connor) Dove Shore 52/67 Common \u2013 Let Love There\u2019s more of a soul influence here \u2013 \u201cHER Love\u201d, the counterpoint to his 1994 track \u201cI Used to Love HER\u201d, benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while \u201cMemories of Home\u201d skitters over a muffled bass and Common\u2019s recollections of his past \u2013 including an incident where he was molested by a family member. Where Black America Again was notable for its sharp, observational urgency, Let Love feels far more personal, and softer in tone. Common\u2019s optimistic nature gives it an uplifting vibe, and while closer \u201cGod is Love\u201d is gently critical of people who use their religion to persecute others, the message is one of learning from our mistakes. It couldn\u2019t be more timely. (Roisin O'Connor) File image 53/67 Lana Del Rey \u2013 Norman Fucking Rockwell! This is Del Rey at her most assertive \u2013 personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey\u2019s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201cbelieves it\u2019s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he\u2019s famous\u201d) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from \u201cHappiness Is a Butterfly\u201d, that is. \u201cIf he\u2019s a serial killer, then what\u2019s the worst that can happen to a girl who\u2019s already hurt?\u201d she asks. Crikey. \u201cWe were so obsessed with writing the next best American record,\u201d sings Del Rey on \u201cNext Best American Record\u201d. This isn\u2019t it, but it\u2019s pretty great all the same. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty Images 54/67 Ezra Furman \u2013 Twelve Nudes Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted \u201cooh oohs\u201d via The Rolling Stones\u2019s \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d on opener \u201cCalm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone\u201d. \u201cTransition from Nowhere to Nowhere\u201d is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while \u201cRated R Crusaders\u201d shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the Israel/Palestine conflict. His sardonic yet sensitive approach to gender and sexuality on \u201cI Wanna Be Your Girlfriend\u201d is a reminder, if one was needed, why he was so well-suited to scoring the soundtrack for Netflix\u2019s Sex Education. Each song feels personal yet relatable \u2013 the deep-rooted despair felt on \u201cTrauma\u201d at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on \u201cWhat Can You Do But Rock n Roll\u201d. Twelve Nudes is Furman\u2019s most urgent and cathartic record to date. (Roisin O'Connor) Jessica Lehrman 55/67 The Black Keys \u2013 Let's Rock! If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011\u2019s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let\u2019s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener \u201cShine a Light\u201d, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontman/guitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over AC/DC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving \u201cLo/Hi\u201d, while the languid \u201cSit Around and Miss You\u201d is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in \u201cTell Me Lies\u201d and it\u2019s not just the lyrics that\u2019ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. Indeed, so heavily do The Black Keys wear their influences that the record \u2013 their ninth \u2013 risks coming across like Stars in Their Eyes: The Rock Edition. But if this is genre pastiche, it\u2019s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (Patrick Smith) 56/67 Thom Yorke \u2013 ANIMA The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener \u201cTraffic\u201d, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).
