Photo: William DeShazer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nJustin Moore, 35, a country music singer and songwriter from Poyen, Ark., on his Razorback tour bus, as told to A.J. Baime.\n\nWhen you start out in this business and you get the opportunity to travel by tour bus, you are at the mercy of whatever you can afford. Then, if things go your way, you can start to make your tour bus nicer. The Razorback bus is the second one that my wife and I have designed. I spend so much time on this bus, I wanted to make it feel more like home.\n\nWe have a lot of exposed brick in our house in Arkansas, so we put real exposed brick in the bus. I am an outdoors guy. I was raised hunting and fishing, so the bus has drawer handles made out of deer antlers. The handle on the inside of the main door is made out of a replica shotgun.\n\nPhotos: The Bus Is Its Own Show Country star Justin Moore shows off his beloved Razorback tour bus from a stop in Louisville, Ky.

He wrote his new single, \u2018The Ones That Didn\u2019t Make It Back Home,\u2019 on the bus with the guitar pictured. William DeShazer for The Wall Street Journal On the road, I have two tour managers who sleep in bunks, and I have a bedroom in back with a full-size bed and a shower. There is even a walk-in closet. (I\u2019m short, so it\u2019s a walk-in closet for me.) I keep a guitar in the bedroom and when I have an idea, I grab it and record on my cellphone. In fact, my current single\u2014\u201cThe Ones That Didn\u2019t Make It Back Home\u201d\u2014I wrote on the bus. There are also a few TVs\u201417 of them, actually. When you grow up in the South, college sports are a huge deal, because many of the Southern states do not have professional teams. We watch a lot of games on the bus, and during football season when the weather cools off, we put games on two TVs outside the bus. During March Madness, we can put games on different TVs. Why do I call the bus Razorback? I live on the same land in Arkansas where I grew up, in a town of about 300. My wife and I have built a great relationship with the University of Arkansas, and the school gave us the OK to put the Arkansas Razorback logo huge across the back of the bus. I have the team colors as the paint scheme. This coming Saturday, we will be on the road in Iowa and the Razorbacks will be playing Ole Miss. This is a huge football rivalry, and my crew and I will be watching on the bus. It\u2019s not home, but it sure beats airports and airplanes. Write to A.J.
