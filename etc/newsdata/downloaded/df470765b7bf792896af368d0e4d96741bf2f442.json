Detectives showed him evidence and old videos in a bid to seek a confession\n\nIvan Milat pictured in May when he was transferred from prison to receive treatment in a public hospital for cancer which claimed his life on Sunday morning\n\nA detective said Milat responded to the videos with: 'People die, they should just get over it.'\n\nNSW police hoped their final interviews with Milat would solve a number of murders.\n\nThe serial killer was visited by varying combinations of detectives at least eight times during the last five months.\n\nMilat was shown the evidence which led to his conviction and he was told of authorities' suspicions about his involvement in further missing-person cases.\n\nDetectives spoke with Milat at the Prince of Wales Hospital and at the Long Bay jail hospital.\n\nThey thought about sending family members of victims to speak with Milat face-to-face but decided against it amid fears it would harm the relatives.\n\nMilat's seven victims were Melbourne couple Deborah Everist (top left) and James Gibson (bottom right), both 19, English backpackers Joanne Walters (bottom left) and Caroline Clarke (bottom second from right), and German backpackers Anja Habschied (top centre), Simone Schmidl (top right) and Gabor Neugebauer (bottom second from left)\n\nMilat served seven life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers, including British tourists Caroline Clarke (left) and Joanne Walters (right)\n\n'It was to try and get to him to admit to the other murders, but he wouldn't even admit to the ones he's been convicted of,' the detective said.\n\n'To be frank, he wouldn't admit to breathing.'\n\nMilat maintained his innocence until the end and family members of the clan also stand by claims the serial killer is innocent.\n\nHis nephew Alistair Shipsey said the 'real killers are still out there' and wished his uncle was given the chance of a retrial.\n\nBut Milat's brother Boris publicly denounced the serial killer and told 60 Minutes it was a 'big relief' that Milat was dead.\n\n'This man is just an evil right to the last bone of him. He was dead to me a long time ago,' Boris said.\n\n'Australia is rid of one of the notorious serial killers, psychopaths.'\n\nIvan Milat's brother Boris (pictured) said it was a 'big relief' the serial killer is dead\n\nThe 77-year-old, who is 'embarrassed' to be a Milat, said be bears no burden of grief for his late brother.\n\n'He deserves where he is and he deserves what he's got,' he said.\n\nBoris suspected there was money involved in Milat's killings and thinks his brother murdered people for the joy of killing and knowing he could get away with it.\n\nWhen asked about the backpackers and how their lives were tragically cut short, Boris said he would get 'emotional'.\n\nBoris was then forced to excuse himself from the interview before returning in tears.\n\nHe said 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown was pulling on his 'heartstrings' before adding that 'people have the right to die properly'.\n\nMilat is pictured with Maureen who he had an intimate relationship with for about one-year. She married Milat's brother Wally\n\nMaureen (pictured) said she believe's Milat is far from innocent and struggles to understand how the Milat family deny the murders\n\n'Seeing he's dead now, the whole saga is best forgotten but remember the victims\u2026 remember these innocent people as well,' he said.\n\nBoris also slammed his family for believing Milat's denial and claiming the police made it all up.\n\nHe said they must have 'small IQ's' because a 12-year-old child would be able to figure out Milat was a murderer.\n\nMilat's former sister-in-law Maureen said he was dead to her '20 or so years ago'.\n\nMaureen was married to Milat's brother Wally but admitted she had an intimate relationship with the serial killer 'on and off' for about one-year.\n\n'That's a part of my life I'm not really proud of... At certain points\u2026 just things happen,' she said.\n\nBut Maureen said she too hated Milat and was in no way defending the killer.\n\n'I believe he did it. He's not innocent,' she said.\n\nMilat (pictured at home before his arrest) was serving seven life sentences for the murder of seven backpackers in bushland south of Sydney\n\n'To me, he died 20 odd years ago, when he was arrested for this. I have no feelings whatsoever. He's just a person that's died. I'd rather remember the person I knew \u2013 a nice person.'\n\nShe added it was a 'bit creepy' to have had a relationship with a psychopath.\n\nMaureen said she struggles to understand how the Milat family deny the murders.\n\n'They all stick together... they're a strong group, strong family,' she said.\n\nRetired NSW police Assistant Commissioner John Laycock said there are a lot of questions still to be answered in the wake of Milat's death.\n\nWhen asked if he suspected if there were more bodies buried, Mr Laycock said he believed in the possibility.\n\n'He wouldn't plead guilty to breathing, and he certainly wouldn't confess to a murder, or to a homicide,' he said.\n\nPictured is a room in the hospital section of Long Bay prison where Milat died on Sunday\n\nMilat was hospitalised in May and again earlier this month for stomach and throat cancer before being returned to the hospital wing of the jail on Tuesday.\n\nHis death was slow and painful as the cancer spread to his liver, lungs, bones and lymph nodes and he developed fluid on his heart.\n\nMilat's body will be transferred to the New South Wales State Coroner who will decide, after consultation with his family, how it will be disposed.\n\nThere will be an inquest into his death, as is the case with all deaths in custody.\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the investigation into the killings, said there are at least three unsolved murders with good reasons to suspect Milat.\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 for the murder of seven backpackers in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney.\n\nMilat (pictured) is led from court during his trial in Sydney, Australia July 8, 1996\n\nHis victims were English backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters 22; Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19; and German backpackers Simone Schmidl, 20, Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20.\n\nHe stabbed most, decapitated one whose head has never been found and shot another 10 times in the head as if using her for target practice.\n\nMany were knifed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.\n\n'These seven young persons were at the threshold of their lives, with everything to look forward to - travel, career, happiness, love, family, and even old age,' said Justice David Hunt who jailed Milat for life in 1996.\n\n'It is clear that they were subjected to behaviour which, for callous indifference to suffering and complete disregard of humanity, is almost beyond belief.\n\n'They would obviously have been absolutely terrified, and death is unlikely to have been swiftly applied.'", "description": "The\u00a074-year-old was convicted in 1996 for the murder of seven travellers in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, between 1989 and 1992.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/14/20246242-0-image-a-16_1572187409997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
