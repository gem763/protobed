For decades, the buffoonery of black TV personalities \u2013 from Ainsley Harriott to Frank Bruno \u2013 was encouraged and expected by white producers. Pandering to British bigotry appeared a prerequisite for employment.\n\nHenry\u2019s breakthrough came as a teenager on the television talent contest New Faces. With his back to the audience, in that first dramatic appearance, he gave a passable impersonation of Frank Spencer (a much-mimicked TV character), but audiences were both aghast and thrilled when Henry turned round to reveal that he was black.\n\nA year later, aged 17, Henry was assured by Robert Luff, the entrepreneur and impresario, that his next step, appearing on The Black and White Minstrel Show, would prove his making. Henry doesn\u2019t shy away from this problematic stage of his career. For five years, he toured with the long-legged dance troupe the Television Toppers and their blacked-up partners, performing Al Jolson melodies; they were also a recurring delight for millions of Saturday evening viewers on British TV.\n\nLooking back now, Henry detects a degree of cynicism on Luff\u2019s part, for when the minstrel act was criticised, \u201cHis staff could point at me and say: \u2018How can we be racist? Look \u2013 we\u2019ve got Lenny Henry in the show.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe experience left Henry with a \u201cpalette of conflicting emotions\u201d. Born in Dudley to Jamaican parents, with a mother who was especially determined to assimilate, Henry now discerns in her the roots of his inversion of Malcolm X\u2019s maxim: \u201cPerhaps one of the products of [mum\u2019s] H\u2019Integration Project was that I was... told to fit in by any means necessary.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henry in his home town, Dudley, November 1978.

Through much of his early career he was an invisible man, a mimic with a chameleon-like personality, and unknowable to himself. Appearing at tough working men\u2019s clubs, he confesses now to being schooled in a comedy vocabulary targeting \u201cthick Irishmen\u201d, \u201clascivious blacks\u201d and \u201crandy housewives\u201d that was soon outmoded and no longer fit for purpose.\n\nAs the title suggests, the memoir is a cry of existential angst. \u201cBeginning to think,\u201d wrote Albert Camus, \u201cis beginning to be undermined.\u201d Henry took safety in not thinking, and he wrestles in the book with the lessons he might have learned, or hopes to impart. Nonetheless, in charting the popularity of the often cruel, cliched comedy of the period, Henry has written a painfully honest account of his ascendancy in British culture. Along the way the memoir offers insights into the one step forwards, two steps backwards evolution of racial enlightenment in the UK, evident in the excrement smeared on his front door in protest against his association with a white woman (Dawn French).\n\nThe opening lyrical passages of Who Am I, Again? soon default to a checklist of familiar adolescent concerns: he\u2019s thrilled to be considered friend material for an older white youth who drives a car; he styles himself in a Freeman\u2019s catalogue jacket; and the bedroom mirror tells him the obvious truth \u2013 that he\u2019s \u201ccooler than cold\u201d.\n\nThere are more rewarding moments when Henry breaks away from the text to render anecdotes in graphic novel form, poignantly yet humorously so in the revelation that the man he knew as \u201cUncle Bertie\u201d was in fact his biological father.\n\nNo amount of comedy, though, can shake the conviction that Henry is stalked by his association with the minstrelsy of his youth. Creative liberty from that show, and from his adoption of one-liner jokes (\u201claughter delivery mechanisms\u201d), came courtesy of Tiswas, the zany Saturday morning children\u2019s TV programme \u2013 with its caged celebrities, buckets of water, custard pies, and, arguably one of Henry\u2019s most inventive characters, the pretentious Rastafarian, Algernon Winston Spencer Churchill Gladstone Disraeli Palmerston Pitt the Younger Pitt the Elder Razzmatazz. He makes the bold assertion that Tiswas was part of the zeitgeist, ushering in alternative \u201canarchic, left-leaning performers\u201d. But what is remarkable about Henry has been his determination to steer a path away from his unfortunate past, to the restoration of a truer, more admirable self.\n\nLast year, at the Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture, Sir Lenny stood in front of assembled dignitaries and lambasted the government for its shameful treatment of his parents\u2019 peers (the Windrush generation) in its hostile environment policy.\n\nFollowing on from that speech, this memoir is a heartfelt atonement for the rewards of the prejudiced times that have led us to the mess we\u2019re in; and a reminder of who he really is, again. Increasingly, in answering racists and racist ideology, Henry has heeded the advice of his former colleague Victoria Wood: \u201cWhatever they say, just say something back.\u201d\n\nColin Grant\u2019s Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation is published by Vintage (\u00a318.99)\n\n\u2022 Who Am I, Again? by Lenny Henry is published by Faber (\u00a320).
