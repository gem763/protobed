Now, she can count The Real Housewives of Orange County\u2019s Kelly Dodd as another such burden. The two joined Andy Cohen on last night\u2019s Watch What Happens Live to compare their similar situations: McCain has to deal with liberal women every day, while Dodd has to fight with other California socialites. Both do it in the name of good television. Toward the end of the aftershow segment, Cohen asked McCain if she\u2019s ever felt like she was going to be fired from The View, after she claimed she goes to work \u201cassuming I\u2019m going to be fired every day anyway.\u201d (\u201cI do too!\u201d Dodd reminds us. \u201cI\u2019m on Game of Thrones, okay, I\u2019m on sorority Survivor on my show.\u201d)\n\nWhen McCain says that she has never actually thought she was going to get fired, Dodd chimes in, \u201cWell, she\u2019s a trust fund baby, so she doesn\u2019t have to worry!\u201d Cohen jumps to McCain\u2019s defense, explaining, \u201cWell, she\u2019s not a trust fund baby, she works, she\u2019s worked very hard. She\u2019s a published author.\u201d But Dodd digs her heels in, adding, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is she doesn\u2019t need the job.\u201d McCain, meanwhile, sits quietly and takes it. \u201cI\u2019m not offended, it\u2019s all right,\u201d she says. \u201cI come from privilege, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not going to deny that.\u201d\n\nBut Dodd cuts her off, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s a PHD, Papa Has Dough, it\u2019s OK.\u201d And that gets to McCain, who corrects her: \u201cHoney, it\u2019s actually my mother, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, Coors Light!\u201d Dodd shouts, confidently. \u201cBud Light, honey,\u201d McCain corrects again. (McCain\u2019s mother, Cindy, is chair of Hensley & Co., a major Bud Light distributor, which she inherited from her father.) Okay, honey?", "description": "The Real Housewives of Orange County star came for the View host for being a \u201ctrust fund baby\u201d on Andy Cohen\u2019s Bravo late-night show.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/recaps/25-kelly-dodd-meghan-mccain.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
