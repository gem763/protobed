The country had been unified just a few decades earlier, and d\u2019Annunzio\u2019s poems envisioned the newborn Kingdom of Italy as the long-awaited inheritor to the great Roman Empire. Civilization, he argued, had become feminized and soft, but in this idealized new Rome, men could become fierce warriors once more. He gave political speeches at ancient ruins, pushing for Italy\u2019s entrance into World War I, demanding that such blood and fire would help \u201csweep away all the filth!\u201d and birth a new, better, braver order. Admirers would often write such speeches down, parading through the streets with his pages. But other than a short-lived parliamentary tenure, d\u2019Annunzio had never held high office.\n\nFiume changed all that. On Sept. 12, 1919, flanked by a few black-clad former army buddies, known as \u201carditi,\u201d d\u2019Annunzio marched on the city \u2014 over the exasperated objections of the Italian government. \u201cEcce homo,\u201d he announced from the governor\u2019s mansion, echoing the words of Pontius Pilate in the Gospel of John when he recognizes that Jesus is the Messiah. D\u2019Annunzio was saying it about himself.", "description": "Gabriele d\u2019Annunzio pioneered the politics of the spectacle.", "authors": ["Tara Isabella Burton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/opinion/19burton6/19burton6-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
