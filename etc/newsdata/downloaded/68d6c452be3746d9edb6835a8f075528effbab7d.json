This should be a matter of great concern to all countries, especially emerging markets.\u201d\n\nSun\u2019s comments at the Bund Summit in China\u2019s commercial hub underscore Beijing\u2019s antagonism towards Libra as global regulators wrestle over how to deal with the U.S. social networking platform\u2019s plans to launch its own cryptocurrency.\n\nGovernments of emerging markets, particularly those enforcing capital controls, such as China, needed to be aware of Libra\u2019s implications for such curbs, he added.\n\nFor China, a digital currency such as Libra must strictly abide by forex regulations, and must not replace the yuan currency in domestic transactions, or \u201cit should be banned,\u201d Sun said.\n\nThe Chinese central bank set up a research team in 2014 to explore launching its own digital currency to cut the costs of circulating traditional paper money and boost policymakers\u2019 control of money supply.\n\nSigns have emerged in recent months that the effort is picking up pace, with the largely rubber stamp parliament passing a new law on cryptography on Saturday that was seen as supportive.\n\nLast week, President Xi Jinping also said China should hasten the development of blockchain technology, driving up blockchain-related stocks on Monday.\n\nChina is stepping up a crackdown on illegal capital flows facilitated by fintech, having shut down more than 2,000 illegitimate forex trading platforms, as well as numerous cross-border futures, securities and commodities systems, Sun said.", "description": "Governments in emerging markets must have greater say in the regulation of digital currencies that could facilitate illegal capital flows and disrupt foreign exchange management, a senior official of China's foreign exchange regulator said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
