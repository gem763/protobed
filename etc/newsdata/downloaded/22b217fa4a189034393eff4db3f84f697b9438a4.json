That\u2019s why every day between now and the start of the postseason we\u2019ll keep you updated on baseball\u2019s postseason picture.\n\nNot even two full days ago, the St. Louis Cardinals appeared to be locks to win the National League Central.\n\nTwo losses later, including a 19-inning marathon that began Tuesday night in Arizona and ended early Wednesday morning, it\u2019s not so certain anymore.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDuring that same time frame, the scorching hot Milwaukee Brewers gained two full games with back-to-back wins against the Cincinnati Reds. The Brewers also clinched a playoff berth, but can still catch St. Louis at just 1.5 back with four days left in the regular season.\n\nThe Brewers will play one more in Cincinnati on Thursday before finishing the season with a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies in Denver. The Cardinals head home for a three-game series against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThere\u2019s some irony in that scheduling given how last season ended. The Brewers swept the Cardinals in St. Louis during the final week in 2018 to help them catch the Cubs in the NL Central standings. They went on to defeat Chicago in a tiebreaker game.
