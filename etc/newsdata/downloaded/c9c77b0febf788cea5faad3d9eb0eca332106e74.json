She has since sailed to the US on a carbon-free yacht to address the United Nations' Climate Change Summit and participate in New York City's climate strike event, where she spoke on Friday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWe will make the world leaders act. We can, and we will,\u201d Ms Thunberg said on stage. \u201cAnd if you are part of that very small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you, because this is only the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cChange is coming whether they like it or not,\u201d she added, before thanking the crowd for showing up and organising demonstrations.\n\nAs is custom for youth-led movements, the makeshift banners and homemade signs were powerful and at times comedic. In London, one poster read: \u201cThe planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend\u201d while another stated: \u201cI wish my sex life was as hot as this planet\u201d. One man wearing a chicken mask had a banner saying: \u201cPoliticians stop chickening out!\u201d\n\nMany posters and activists had: \u201cThere is no planet B!\u201d written on them, some etching the phrase in markers on their arms and faces.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

School is important but so is my future.\n\n\u201cIf politicians were taking the appropriate action we need and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognised the world was changing in a negative way, then I would not have to be skipping school,\" she said, adding: \u201cI would be doing the maths exam I have studied for.\u201d\n\nProtests started in the Pacific islands, home to low lying nations that are most at risk from rising sea levels \u2013 before being held in Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and into Europe as the sun rose.\n\nThe first large-scale protests of Friday\u2019s \u201cglobal climate strike\u201d took place in Sydney and Canberra, with demonstrators calling on leaders in Australia, the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOne of the largest protests of the day was held later in downtown Manhattan, where elders from native tribes began the rally by playing traditional music and singing hymns as the crowd fell silent.\n\nChildren from each of New York's boroughs and many states across the country took part in a rally at Foley Square, before marching through Manhattan to Battery Park.\n\nNatalie Ochoa, a 17-year-old from Connecticut, said she travelled with her school's club for student Democrats \"to get our voices heard\". As she spoke, a woman wearing one of Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" hats walked past the crowd, shouting at the young people gathered in the square.\n\n\"She's here trying to start conflict and remind us that the White House does not represent us, and the old people in congress don't represent us ... I think it's pretty embarrassing for her,\" she said, adding about Mr Trump: \"He doesn't represent us at all.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But we need our politicians to act. And right when we need our leaders to step up, they continue to let us down. From filling the skies with more planes, to backing fracking in the UK and funding oil and gas projects abroad.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re standing shoulder to shoulder with young people,\u201d she added.\n\nThe protests come ahead of a climate summit at the UN next week convened by secretary-general Antonio Guterres to urge countries to up their climate efforts.\n\nHe said: \u201cI told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments. People want solutions, commitments and action. I expect there will be an announcement and unveiling of a number of meaningful plans on dramatically reducing emissions during the next decade, and on reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\u201d\n\nMore than 30 heads of state and government have signed an appeal for greater action to fight climate change circulated by Alexander Van der Bellen, Australia\u2019s president, ahead of next week\u2019s conference on global warming at the UN.\n\nThe Initiative for more Climate Ambition declares climate change the \u201ckey challenge of our time,\u201d adding \u201cour generation is the first to experience the rapid increase in temperatures around the globe and probably the last with the opportunity to effectively combat an impending global climate crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said two adults had been arrested on The Strand in central London in breach of an order dictating protesters must gather in a specific place in Westminster.\n\nSome companies actively helped staff take part by closing stores, including Patagonia and Ben & Jerry\u2019s, whose sign on their London shop on Wardour Street read: \u201cGone striking. Because ya know, the planet.\u201d\n\nAmong the many trade unions throwing their weight behind the strikes are the Trades Union Congress, the University and College Union, and Unite, while environmental campaigners, aid agencies and faith groups are joining the protests.\n\nBusiness, energy and clean growth minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he could not endorse children leaving school to take part but insisted \u201ctheir voices are being heard\u201d by the government.\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cIt is great that young people want to highlight the climate crisis, but we have consistently said that pupils should not miss school to take part in protests and should instead talk to their teachers about activities which can take place in school.\u201d\n\nStill, other politicians and school leaders have backed the youngsters walking out of school as part of the Youth Strike 4 Climate campaign. Suzie Longstaff, headmistress of Putney High School, a private girls\u2019 school, said young people should be able to make their own decisions about whether to take part in the action and that she applauded her students for having an environmental and social conscience.\n\nThe UN summit next week brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.\n\nThe issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.\n\nAs Friday\u2019s day of action got under way across scattered Pacific communities, students holding placards in Kiribati chanted: \u201cWe are not sinking, we are fighting\u201d. Children in the Solomon Islands rallied on the shoreline wearing traditional grass skirts and carrying wooden shields.\n\nHours later in Thailand, more than 200 young people stormed the Environment Ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death.\n\n\u201cThis is what will happen if we don\u2019t stop climate change now,\u201d said 21-year-old strike organiser Nanticha Ocharoenchai.\n\nConservative MPs were in sharp contrast to opposition parties Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, which all supported the strike. Tory MP Nick Gibb even claimed that missing out on one day of school could affect activists\u2019 GCSE results.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think [protesting] should be at the expense of a child\u2019s education because what we want is for the next generation to be as well educated as possible to tackle these kinds of problems, and you don\u2019t do that by missing out on an education.\u201d\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn backed the \u201cinspirational\u201d young people who are \u201cleading by example\u201d and \u201ceducating us\u201d about the climate crisis and species extinction.\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, joined protestors in Glasgow. She tweeted: \u201cWe demand immediate, strong action to stop irreversible damage. We must protect both our planet and future generations.\u201d\n\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan said he was \u201cstanding in solidarity\u201d with the strikers and was encouraging City Hall staff to take time out of their day to observe the strike, as he called for more action from government.\n\nThe protests continued throughout the day around the world and well into the evening in many major cities, where students remained energised by singing songs, dancing and leading chants.\n\nBefore leaving the stage in New York City, Ms Thunberg had one last reminder for her fellow climate activists: \u201cWe will be striking again next week on Friday,\u201d she said.\n\nIn fact, the strikes are set to continue weekly, with a clear rise in support from around the world \u2013 until the students\u2019 demands are finally met.", "description": "Millions of schoolchildren and protesters\u00a0around the world took to the streets on Friday in what is expected to be the largest climate protest in history.
