We are monitoring that as best we can. We still have forces in Syria working with the SDF, and one of the top priorities is these prisons.\u201d\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper gave a similar estimate of the number of escaped ISIS prisoners on Tuesday, but said the \u201cbig prison break\u201d officials expected has not occurred.\n\n\u201cOf the 11,000 or so detainees that were in prisons in northeast Syria, we\u2019ve only had reports of a little bit more than a hundred that have escaped,\u201d Esper told CNN.\n\nPresident Trump earlier this month ordered the withdrawal of about 1,000 U.S. troops stationed in northern Syria, saying he does not want the U.S. to \u201cpolice\u201d the area any longer. Republican and Democratic critics of the move warned that a U.S. troop withdrawal would make room for the Turkish invasion of the region, which proved true, and would leave Kurdish forces, who have been supported by U.S troops in fighting the Islamic State, open to attack.\n\nTrump announced earlier Wednesday that a \u201cpermanent ceasefire\u201d has been agreed to between Turkey and Kurdish forces in Syria and that Turkey\u2019s military operations in northern Syria have ceased. He added that the captured Islamic State prisoners are \u201csecured.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a few that got out, a small number, relatively speaking, and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured,\u201d Trump said of the escaped Islamic State prisoners.", "description": "The State Department confirmed Wednesday that more than 100 ISIS prisoners have escaped since Turkey's invasion of northern Syria following the Trump administration's withdrawal of about 1,000 U.S. troops from the region.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
