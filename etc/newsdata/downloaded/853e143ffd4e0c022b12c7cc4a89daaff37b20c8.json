Turkey agreed to the five-day pause to let the Kurdish-led SDF militia withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d Ankara had sought to capture.\n\nThe deal was praised by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it would save \u201cmillions of lives,\u201d while Turkey cast it as a complete victory.\n\nIf implemented, the deal would achieve all the main objectives Turkey announced when it launched its assault on Oct. 9: control of a strip of Syria more than 30 km (20 miles) deep, with the SDF forces - once U.S. allies in the years long fight against Islamic State - obliged to pull out.\n\nRepublican and Democratic senators accused Trump of having betrayed the Kurdish allies who were vital in fighting Islamic State militants, of brushing aside the humanitarian costs of Turkey\u2019s invasion and of being outwitted by Ankara.\n\nIt was unclear what if any damage came from the shelling heard on Friday.\n\nIt was also unclear whether the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would fully comply with the agreement, which would leave Turkish forces in charge of a swathe of territory that the Kurds once held with U.S. military support.", "description": "Shelling and gunfire resounded around the northeast Syrian town of Ras al Ain on Friday, a day after Turkey agreed with the United States to pause its offensive in Syria for five days to let Kurdish forces withdraw.", "authors": ["Mert Ozkan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442166585&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0BO", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
