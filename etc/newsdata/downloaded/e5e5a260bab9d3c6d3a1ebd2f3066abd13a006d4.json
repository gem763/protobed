He bragged about his personal properties from the presidential podium and suggested that he will hold next year\u2019s G-7 gathering at his Doral golf course in Florida, which has \u201cincredible\u201d conference rooms and \u201cmagnificent\u201d bungalows.\n\nAnd he defended both Vladi\u00admir Putin and Kim Jong Un, suggesting that the Russian strongman deserves an invite to future G-7 summits and that the North Korean dictator is an honorable man who will not let Trump down.\n\nThe U.S. president\u2019s news conference here was presaged by an aide saying Trump would answer anything if the first two questions stayed on topic. Trump seemed more interested when the questions went off topic \u2014 and for 68 minutes in a seaside auditorium, he offered a lens into his un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox mind, a range of false or dubious statements, and the myriad ways he has changed the presidency in 31 months.\n\nHe attacked former president Barack Obama\u2019s intellect while defending Putin for annexing part of Crimea \u2014 a move that drove Russia\u2019s expulsion from what was then called the G-8. To many world leaders, Putin\u2019s move was illegal and had nothing to do with Obama. To Trump, it showed that his predecessor was a sucker and that criticizing him (along with former vice president \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d Biden, in Trump\u2019s words) was fair banter. He veered into a similar diatribe on Obama not enforcing a \u201cred line\u201d in Syria, though he was not queried on the topic.\n\nGallery: 'Where's England?': Trump confused over definition of UK (HuffPost UK)\n\n\u00a9 Andrew Harnik/AP President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron arrive to participate in a joint news conference at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, Monday.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin outsmarted President Obama,\u201d Trump said, calling it \u201cvery embarrassing\u201d for Obama. The realpolitik of the world, he said, meant Russia should be in the room at future summits. And he said he would like to invite Putin next year to his golf course, claiming without evidence that other leaders agreed with his predilection \u2014 even as they said otherwise.\n\nAsked why he continued to falsely blame Obama for the annexation of Crimea, as he did almost a dozen times Monday, the president suggested that he knew the black journalist asking the question, Yamiche Alcindor of PBS News, had an ulterior motive. \u201cI know you like President Obama,\u201d he said, without saying how he knew that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not blaming him,\u201d he said, before blaming him extensively because \u201ca lot of bad things happened.\u201d \u00a9 Andrew Harnik/AP President Trump and and first lady Melania Trump board Air Force One in Biarritz, France, Monday to return to Washington following the G-7 summit.\n\nTrump admitted no blunder in his escalating trade fight with China, even as his flummoxing moves have rattled the markets and his own aides.\n\nIn four days, Trump imposed new tariffs on China, called the country\u2019s president an \u201cenemy,\u201d admitted \u201csecond thoughts\u201d on the escalating trade war, reversed course hours later to say he only wished he had raised the tariffs higher, and then vowed a deal would be coming soon \u2014 because China wants one desperately, in the president\u2019s telling. Doesn\u2019t that make it harder, a reporter asked, to make a deal?\n\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s how I negotiate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful over the years.\u201d\n\nHis assertion that China is itching to strike a compromise has been contradicted by multiple reports and Chinese officials. When Fox News reporter John Roberts expressed skepticism, Trump forged ahead by saying the Chinese had been working behind the scenes.\n\nGallery: Donald Trump: Life in pictures [Photos]\n\nTrump claimed to have gotten two phone calls on Sunday night from high-ranking Chinese officials seeking to negotiate a trade deal. \u201cHigh-level calls,\u201d he said. Chinese government officials said Monday that they were unaware of any such calls. When Trump asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to back him up, Mnuchin would only say there had been \u201ccommunication,\u201d avoiding the word \u201ccall.\u201d The treasury secretary quickly interjected again Monday afternoon to add \u201ccommunications.\u201d\n\nTrump suggested that within weeks he would be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. \u201cNow, is that based on fact or based on gut? It\u2019s based on gut,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cMaybe it works and maybe it doesn\u2019t. I say it all the time about everything.\u201d\n\nAlthough he said French President Emmanuel Macron asked his permission to invite Iran\u2019s foreign minister to the G-7, Macron said that he simply \u201cinformed\u201d Trump in advance of his plan and that it was Macron\u2019s idea alone.\n\nAt length, he boasted about his private properties. Trump refused to divest, unlike many of his predecessors, and has profited from an influx of Republican fundraisers and other political events. Questioned about the propriety of profiting from next year\u2019s summit of world leaders, he batted down any concern.\n\nWatch: Trump suggests hosting next G7 at his golf course (Independent)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about making money.\u201d\n\nHis resort in Miami, he said, would make a terrific locale for the G-7 because of its bungalows, proximity to the airport, large ballrooms and substantial parking.\n\n\u201cBiggest ballrooms in Florida,\u201d he said.\n\nHe offered an unproven claim, as he has done before, that the presidency has cost him $3 billion to $5 billion. He then moved on to praise his golf courses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Seeming to change course, he moved into a soliloquy about the nomenclature of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s England? What\u2019s happening with England? They don\u2019t use it too much anymore,\u201d Trump says he told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nHe described both Iran and North Korea in terms of their real estate potential, saying the countries would want to deal with Trump because they sit on valuable, or gentrifying, properties.\n\n\u201cA location that\u2019s a little rough neighborhood,\u201d he said of Iran, in the middle of the war-torn Middle East. \u201cBut eventually it\u2019s going to be a beautiful neighborhood.\u201d\n\nHe showed no concern that the North Korean dictator had violated U.N. resolutions by firing missiles, instead saying that Kim would not personally disappoint Trump. In a long-winded answer, Trump nodded to his wife, Melania, and claimed she had gotten to know Kim Jong Un very well; the White House later acknowledged that Kim and the U.S. first lady have never met.\n\nHe also jousted with journalists. When a French reporter charged at the podium without being called on, he pointed to Jim Acosta of CNN and grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s worse than you!\u201d he said, before explaining that his wife likes French wine.\n\nWhen Hallie Jackson, an NBC reporter, stood up, Trump said, \u201cHere we go,\u201d before repeatedly telling her she would get only one question.\n\nEven as he spent several days on Twitter decrying the \u201cFake and Disgusting News,\u201d he seemed much more enthusiastic once Macron left the stage and he was able to hold forth alone.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say I don\u2019t give you access,\u201d he said.\n\njoshua.dawsey@washpost.com\n\nToluse Olorunnipa contributed to this report.", "description": "The U.S. president offered a range of false or dubious statements during a freewheeling news conference at the close of the often contentious G-7 summit in France.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAGmADa.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1812&y=1762"}
