Some of them brought their cellphones into the secure room where electronics are not allowed, several lawmakers said.\n\nThe Republicans decried that the deposition was happening behind closed doors and said Americans should be able to read the transcripts of any interviews being conducted as part of impeachment. Democrats have promised to release the transcripts when doing so won\u2019t affect their investigation.\n\nRep.
