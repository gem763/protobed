I know what I am, what I did and what I can give, but I keep it to myself. People can have their say. I don't like to talk about myself, I like to talk about the collective.\"\n\nMessi has endured an injury-hit start to this season, managing just five appearances in all competitions for the Spanish giants so far.\n\nThe Argentine has opened up on those frustrations and said: \"It is difficult because your mind is fine; you think that you are 25 years old and that you can continue doing the same things [as before] at the time.\n\n\"But the body rules and there are circumstances in which you have to be more careful than before. Adapting to it requires a process and preparing differently for training and matches.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMessi also seemingly committed his long-term future to Barcelona by saying he has never considering leaving the club for pastures new.\n\nHe added: \"Everyone looks for their targets and their experiences. I never had the need to leave the best club in the world, that Barcelona are, and where I enjoy training, games and the city.\n\n\"[The city to club dynamic] is very complete and I was always sure about the targets at this club [rather than going to] look for it elsewhere.\"", "description": "The debate over which of Ronaldo and Messi is the better has raged over the years, with both superstars enjoying glittering careers", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20156833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nominees-for-the-Best-FIFA-football-play.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
