Perhaps in the early days of local manufacturing, we need to look at niche markets in South Africa where we can drive EV manufacturing.\u201d\n\nIronically, when BMW was marketing the i3 \u2013 which made its concept debut in 2011 \u2013 it used \u201cBorn Electric\u201d as its tagline, the mantra of the Joule.\n\nIn 2015 Gerhard Swart, co-founder and chief technical officer of Optimal Energy, wrote a paper on the lessons learnt from the Joule.\n\nIn it he states the \u201cproject died in the innovation chasm\u201d \u2013 the gap between knowledge generators and the market \u2013 and that it wasn\u2019t the huge amount of money required that killed it, arguing \u201cthis was feasible if the other factors were addressed\u201d.\n\nTwo of the main factors were government\u2019s heavy involvement and communication about the process, strategy, success and failures of the commercialisation of the Joule.\n\nParmar thinks pulling the plug too early hampered the market, but believes the legacy lives on through initiatives of uYilo which is \u201cexpanding the value chain and the investment of the Joule\u201d.\n\nSo, will we see another one?\n\n\u201cThe technology has changed rapidly in terms of what was put together [for the Joule],\u201d Parmar says.\n\nHe believes that instead of focusing on a competitive passenger car market, South Africa should rather look at the low-hanging fruits of the niche markets like ecotourism, battery manufacturing and minibus taxis.\n\nWith almost 50% of South Africans wanting pro-active manufacturers to ensure EVs are viable, the Joule will go down in history as a lost opportunity.", "description": "Did you know that in 2008 South Africa had four electric vehicle prototypes it showed off to the world?", "authors": ["Muhammad Hussain"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/1d868112290f464886687bc1573145ac.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
