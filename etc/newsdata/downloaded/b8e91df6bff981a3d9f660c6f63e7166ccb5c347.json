The interview would happen at another government location, specifically designed to handle classified briefings.\n\nBut sources familiar with the discussions tell ABC News that Democrats have discussed other ways to mask the official's identity, including obscuring the person's voice and appearance. The concern, sources say, is that congressional Republicans close to the president could seek to reveal their identity.\n\n(MORE: 2nd whistleblower comes forward after speaking with IG: Attorney)\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the discussions.\n\nThey also are discussing the possibility of tasking select congressional staff to handle the briefing, allowing that small group to brief lawmakers at a later date.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\n(MORE: White House won't say if Trump was joking about China investigating Biden)\n\nThe seven-page complaint alleged that Trump pushed a foreign power to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter, and that unnamed senior White House officials then tried to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call.\n\n\"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\" the first whistleblower stated, in a complaint filed Aug. 12.\n\nThe law protects whistleblowers from being retaliated against. But Trump has accused the whistleblower, identified as an intelligence official, of being a spy.\n\n\"Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe intelligence community's inspector general says the complaint was processed in accordance with the law.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.", "description": "House lawmakers are considering extraordinary lengths to mask the identity of a whistleblower whose complaint about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine triggered an impeachment inquiry, including possibly obscuring the person's voice or appearance, according to sources familiar with", "authors": ["Benjamin Siegel", "Katherine Faulders"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hDgtRt5DdP8U3uT03_opyw--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/capitol-hill-rt-ml-190724_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
