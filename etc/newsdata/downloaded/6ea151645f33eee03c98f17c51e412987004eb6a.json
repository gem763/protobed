Chinese tech giant Huawei also announced delays to its Mate X earlier this week.\n\nThe design marked a major departure from the homogeneous design of smartphones, which had continued with a uniform slab-like design since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.\n\nBy unfolding from a thin 4.6-inch smartphone into a 7.3-inch tablet, the Galaxy Fold essentially offered a new device category.\n\nSamsung is already working on a successor to the Galaxy Fold, according to recent reports.\n\nThe next version is expected to be thinner, smaller and cheaper, while also making use of a clamshell design.\n\nRather than folding out like a book like the Galaxy Fold, it will open up vertically like a classic flip phone.\n\nThe world's number one smartphone maker reportedly worked with American designer Thom Browne on the 6.7-inch device, which folds up into a \"pocketable square\".", "description": "Samsung has announced the release date for\u00a0its\u00a0Galaxy Fold smartphone.
