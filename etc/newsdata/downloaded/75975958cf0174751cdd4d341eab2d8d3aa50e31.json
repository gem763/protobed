Whether you prefer something fluffy and plush or something waffled and fast-drying, we can all agree on the importance of a towel that\u2019s soft, absorbent, and looks good after hundreds of uses and wash cycles. To find the best towels \u2014 the ones that are as good-looking as they are absorbent and durable \u2014 we asked eight interior designers and decorators to single out their go-tos. These are the ones they select for both client projects and their own homes. (As for the Twitter debate when Abdul Dremali asked how many bath towels a person should own \u2014 New York contributor Yashar Ali thinks five towels and five sheets each \u2014 we think four bath towels per person is a reasonable number.)\n\nBest hotel-style towels\n\nMatouk Milagro Bath Towel When shopping for your everyday bath towels, interior designer Ariel Okin says, \u201cyou want to take into account quality and durability. Especially for towels, which get washed a lot and sometimes bleached, investing in high-quality [ones] is a smart move.\u201d Among her top picks are these classic towels from the nearly century-old Massachusetts-based company Matouk. They\u2019re also a favorite of home stager Meridith Baer, who likes the 100 percent Egyptian cotton towels for a high-end look. $49 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nSerena & Lily Sonoma Bath Collection Interior designer Jess Blumberg, of Dale Blumberg Interiors, says it best, naming the three essential qualities of an ideal towel: \u201cAbsorbency, size, and luxuriousness.\u201d Made from an absorbent, heavyweight Turkish cotton that\u2019s woven to feel light and airy, these spa-style towels, chosen by both Okin and designer Tina Rich, certainly fit the bill. Okin says they\u2019re similar to Matouk in that they\u2019re \u201chigh-quality towels that are super absorbent, fluffy, and wear well over time [with] no rough fibers or pilling,\u201d and Rich adds that \u201cthey are plush, come in great colors, [and are] worth the price.\u201d $38 at Serena & Lily Buy\n\nSadem Ultra Collection 6-Piece Towel Set Jessica McCarthy, creative director at Decorist, says that when she\u2019s looking for towels for herself or a client, \u201cthe true deciding factor always needs to be durability and absorption.\u201d And while she recommends shopping for towels in person so you can get a feel of their weight and softness, she does call these towels from Sadem \u201cthe most plush and luxurious towels I have ever used.\u201d For prolonging the longevity of your towels, she recommends choosing classic hotel-white, as they can be bleached to look fresh and new. $70 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nBest waffle towels\n\nParachute Waffle Towels $20 (was $25, now 20% off) Mentioned by three designers \u2013 Baer, Rich, and Leanne Ford Parachute\u2019s waffle-weave Turkish cotton towels are a consensus favorite. Baer calls them \u201cfast-drying and very soft,\u201d while Ford likes that they\u2019re \u201cplush and warm in classic styles and colors.\u201d If you prefer the thin and moisture-wicking ease of waffle weave, try these. From $20 at Parachute Buy\n\nBest monogrammable towels\n\nWeezie Bath Towel For just a hint of color, Okin likes these piped-bordered towels from Savannah-based start-up Weezie. \u201cThey make beautiful towels in classic silhouettes that can be monogrammed, which I love,\u201d she says. \u201cI recently purchased a monogrammed set of light blue, piped white Weezie towels for my own home. They are really soft and have a classic look to them that ties the bathroom together really nicely.\u201d If you prefer no monogramming or piping, you can get them plain, too. $58 at Weezie Buy\n\nBest colorful towels\n\nGarnet Hill Signature Egyptian Cotton Towels If you aren\u2019t crazy for simple, hotel-white towels, you can still find a plush option in a bold shade. \u201cWhen choosing towels, I always start with a color in mind,\u201d says Rayman Boozer, principal designer at Apartment 48 Interior Design. \u201cLately, Garnet Hill seems to have all the perfect colors. In most cases I opt for something solid, vibrant, and atypical. This is an easy opportunity to add a pop of color to your bathroom.\u201d The extra thick and absorbent Egyptian cotton towels come in richly saturated hues like tangelo and cornflower blue. $26 at Garnet Hill Buy\n\nRestoration Hardware 802-Gram Turkish Bath Towel Baer says these soft Turkish towels \u201care my go-to as they are thick and luxurious.\u201d While the colors are a little more muted than the Garnet Hill range, there\u2019s still a wide variety to choose from, including a wintergreen juniper and a soft plum. $30 at Restoration Hardware Buy\n\nBest Turkish hammam-style towels\n\nScents And Feel Fouta Ibiza 100% Cotton Beach Towel When Blumberg wants to bring some texture and eclecticism to a space, she turns to Scents & Feel for their classic, hammam-style towels. \u201cWe love to add a little global flavor by bringing in a fouta, or a Turkish towel,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are made from 100 percent cotton, they\u2019re light, and they dry quickly, and add a cool factor to our clients\u2019 spaces.\u201d Opt for a brightly colored bold style or keep it minimal with a simple, black-and-white stitched design. $60 at Wayfair Buy\n\nTraditional Turkish Cotton Pestemal Bath Sheet McCarthy also likes these traditional-style towels, especially for small bathrooms, since they\u2019re thinner and lower-profile than most towels, while still being absorbent. \u201cI love how little room they take up, and if your bathroom does not get a lot of ventilation, they dry incredibly quickly,\u201d she says. $25 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nBest patterned towel\n\nMacKenzie-Childs Courtly Check Bath Towel A favorite of Sean Juneja\u2019s, founder and CEO of D\u00e9cor Aid, this checkered towel with bright yellow accents feels a little bit preppy and a little bit Scandinavian-style cool. Juneja says he\u2019s a fan because \u201cyou can be more playful with bath towel choices [and] they\u2019ll lend a bathroom a pop of color.\u201d $40 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nBest debossed towels\n\nHill House Home Cecil Bath Towels Unlike its more commonly seen counterpart, embossing, debossing involves stamping a design onto a surface for an indented, rather than raised, print. These towels, a favorite of Okin\u2019s, are debossed with the words \u201csoap\u201d and \u201cwater,\u201d a nod to a quote from photographer Cecil Beaton (\u201cWhat is elegance? Soap and water!\u201d). The white-on-white design makes the text just barely visible, adding a bit of dimension to these sleek, clean towels. $88 for 2 at Hill House Home Buy\n\nBest luxury towels\n\nJenni Kayne Turkish Bath Towel If you\u2019re willing to drop nearly $100 on a towel, this plush one from Jenni Kayne features subtle embossed stripes on one side and simple terry loops on the other, and comes highly recommended by Rich. \u201cI usually choose Turkish towels, which tend to be supersoft and lightweight,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is nothing I hate more than a chunky bath towel that looks like it\u2019s from your parents\u2019 bathroom in the \u201980s.\u201d With knotted fringe trim, it\u2019s slim but absorbent. $95 at Jenni Kayne Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
