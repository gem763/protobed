Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks during a town hall in New York, U.S., October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nBut voters in a town hall also pressed her on the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, climate change and healthcare, enabling the first-term congresswoman to display her progressive credentials on a range of issues.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, 29, has soared to prominence since her election a year ago, pushing the Democratic Party to veer to the left ahead of the November 2020 presidential election while becoming a favorite target of conservative Fox News and Republicans who consider her too radical.\n\n\u201cIf the government worked for us half as much as it works for billionaires and corporations, our lives would be transformed,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said before about 100 people at a public library in the borough of Queens.\n\nShe outlined an agenda that may find a path through the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives but would be sure to fail in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nHer \u201cJust Society\u201d proposal, comprising five separate bills, offers plenty of ammunition for critics and admirers.\n\nIt would overhaul federal guidelines on the poverty line, now defined as an individual earning less than $13,064 each year or a family of four earning less than $25,465.\n\nOcasio-Cortez would identify far more people as impoverished and make them eligible for government benefits.\n\nOther bills would steer federal contracts to companies that treat workers well, curb rent hikes by landlords, or restore rights to former convicts after they have completed jail terms.\n\nOne provision certain to spur supporters of Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies would extend federal benefits to undocumented immigrants.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told reporters afterward she had yet to fix a price tag to the proposal, but said some provisions would cost nothing and others would cut spending, for example, by reducing the jail population and lowering the cost of incarceration.\n\n\u201cThis is a question that is only asked about the general welfare of the public and it\u2019s not a question that we ask about war, it\u2019s not a question that we ask about the $2.1-trillion GOP tax cut,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\n\u201cFor those that may have a price tag attached to them, we\u2019re happy to have that conversation,\u201d she said, adding that the budget impact would be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n(This story corrects paragraph 9 to fix subject-verb agreement)", "description": "U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday promoted her ambitious welfare legislation to constituents in her home district in New York, finding a friendlier audience than she often encounters in the glare of Washington.", "authors": ["Daniel Trotta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436868496&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF93056", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
