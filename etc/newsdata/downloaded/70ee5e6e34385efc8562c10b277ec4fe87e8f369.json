Player ratings: England vs Tonga 1/33 England vs Tonga player ratings Getty 2/33 England AP 3/33 Elliot Daly - 7 Two good runs that gave England good field position, and a lovely pass for May to run onto in the lead up to Tuilagi\u2019s second try. But at fault for not being deep enough off Slade\u2019s pass that would have bagged him his own try. Getty Images 4/33 Anthony Watson - 7 Quiet game until he exploded into life late on with a mazy run from his own 22 to the Tongan 22, leaving defender after defender in his wake. AFP/Getty Images 5/33 Manu Tuilagi - 9 The star performer by a country mile. First try was born out of his brute strength as he burst through a tackle attempt from Kalamafoni and carried two over the line with him. Second try was more of a case of right place, right time, and he was a constant problem for Tonga to deal with all afternoon. AFP/Getty Images 6/33 Owen Farrell - 6 Pretty quiet throughout and missed his first conversion effort, but had one good run in the lead up to Tuilagi\u2019s opener. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/33 Jonny May - 7 Nice break and awareness to set up Tuilagi for his second try. Made a strong tackle on Tuitavake in the second half, but left the field with what looked like an injury soon after. EPA 8/33 George Ford - 6 Failed to get much going as a blunt England attack took too long to get firing. More was expected from the Ford-Farrell combination. Getty Images 9/33 Ben Youngs - 6 Fairly quiet throughout, though could have been a little different had he managed to ground the ball when he took a quick penalty. Replaced short of the hour by Willi Heinz. REUTERS 10/33 Joe Marler - 7 Strong work in the scum as England were rarely tested, but didn\u2019t manage to get through much carrying. World Rugby via Getty Images 11/33 Jamie George - 8 Excellent in the lineout as he hit all of his throws in an area where England are dominating the game. Looked to shake off an ankle niggle and was replaced soon after by Luke Cowan-Dickie, who was on hand to score the final try. PA 12/33 Kyle Sinckler - 6 Like Marler, a solid shift in the front row but guilty of conceding the first penalty in an ill-disciplined start to the match. World Rugby via Getty Images 13/33 Courtney Lawes - 7 Not as prominent as Itoje but still got through plenty of carrying for the side. PA 14/33 Maro Itoje - 8 Excellent in the air as George repeatedly went to him, and managed to pinch one of Tonga\u2019s throws along with sealing a turnover from a lineout maul. Carried well and got through plenty of defensive work. World Rugby via Getty Images 15/33 Tom Curry - 7 Lead the charge with 15 tackles but will need to up his work-rate with the ball in hand. Getty Images 16/33 Sam Underhill - 8 England\u2019s most prominent forward, winning a penalty at the breakdown and also managing to seal a turnover when first into the ruck. Unlucky not to score a try as his effort was held up by the slimmest of margins. Getty Images 17/33 Billy Vunipola - 6 Will be feeling the effects of Zane Kapeli\u2019s enormous tackle on him in the opening exchanges, and slightly faded from the game following the hit. Will need to be more prominent as the tournament wears on.
