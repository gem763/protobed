Maki Pitolo via unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28)\n\nUpdated records: Potter (18-8 MMA, 1-1 UFC), Pitolo (12-5 MMA, 0-1 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Pitolo won the striking battle 115-91, but Potter landed three takedowns en route to the win column.\n\nPotter on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cKeeping the pressure on him was definitely part of the game plan. If I had to describe that performance, it would be Dan Kelly-esque. Normally, if I get on top of people, it\u2019s usually over. He did a good job of defending.\u201d\n\nPotter on emulating coach Dan Kelly\n\n\u201cThe last time UFC was in this stadium, Dan Kelly got a win in almost the same style. That\u2019s huge to me, especially after what I\u2019ve gone through. I\u2019ve had a lot of downs in my career. Even though I\u2019m getting older, I\u2019m showing I have the skills to fight at the top level.\u201d\n\nPotter on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have a bit of a rest, but my last two fights have been in Melbourne. I\u2019d like to travel the world and maybe get that Vegas experience in my next fight.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Potter, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Callan Potter def.
