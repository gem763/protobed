She said in a statement that she knew one of those killed on August 3.\n\nState District Judge Angie Ju\u00e1rez Barill announced her recusal from the capital murder case of Patrick Crusius in a statement issued Wednesday, a week after her assignment to the case.\n\nShe also noted that her term of office ends in December 2020 since she's running for chief justice of the 8th Texas Court of Appeals and not her present seat. She said the case could go to a judge reasonably sure of seeing it through to completion.\n\nThe 21-year-old Crusius, of Allen, Texas, remains jailed without bond charged with capital murder of multiple persons. Prosecutors say they'll seek the death penalty.\n\nProsecutors have said Crusius surrendered to police after the attack saying, \"I'm the shooter,\" and that he was targeting Mexicans.\n\nA manifesto believed to have been written by the suspect and uploaded to the web forum 8chan expressed concerns about the growing Hispanic population of Texas. Officials have referenced the document and said the shooting may have a \"nexus\" to a hate crime.", "description": "Twenty-two people were killed at an El Paso Walmart on August 3", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/22/f2276104-1d46-4508-bee6-ed3ae577fcde/thumbnail/1200x630/2397ffed7c2adde57cd41db8f473254f/gettyimages-1166427842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
