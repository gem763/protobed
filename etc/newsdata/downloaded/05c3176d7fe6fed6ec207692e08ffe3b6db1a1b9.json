Do we remember him? Whatever. He has rented a convertible from Avis, Hammersmith and is whizzing it around various Chelsea-based bridges.\n\nLove Island\u2019s Laura Crane must be fuming; she dated Tristan earlier in the year but that went to hell, and now she\u2019s missed out on a spot on MIC, leaving it wide open for Zara McDermott.\n\nAbsolutely raging.\n\nDenise, Denise! Verity\u2019s mum is called Denise and she appears to be some kind of animal herder, having recently invested in a turkey\n\nVerity\u2019s mum is called Denise and she appears to be some kind of animal herder, having recently invested in a turkey.\n\n\u2018Oh my god, Mum, why do we need a turkey?\u2019 screams Verity, aghast as ever.\n\nTurns out Denise is a wordsmith as well as a poultry rearer. When Verity explains that she was wedged between Maeva and James on the return flight from Turkey, she says \u2018was there tension in the air?\u2019\n\nOh Denise! Denise, Denise!\n\nFreed from desire: Seb is soon distracted as Tristan joins them with news of his South African safari business, igniting desire in Seb\u2019s eyes\n\nTristan hasn\u2019t arrived at his destination and is still driving that Merc around. Finally he gets to the pub to meet Liv and Seb, who are pouring over Liv\u2019s photos of women with alopecia. But Seb is soon distracted as Tristan joins them with news of his South African safari business, igniting desire in Seb\u2019s eyes.\n\nAlso Seb looks like Draco Malfoy.\n\nIt\u2019s the same ol\u2019 story for Sam: he can\u2019t go for lunch with Zara, Melissa and Harry without them slating Jamie. For three people who hate the boy, they talk about him with such constancy.\n\nStrictly stressed: Poor Jamie\u2019s really in the wars but on the plus side he\u2019s got great orange accentual d\u00e9cor at his flat\n\n\u2018He\u2019s trying to belittle how you feel to make himself feel better!\u2019 Zara declares. \u2018He comes across as a good bloke but he just isn\u2019t!\u2019 Harry chirps. \u2018We really need to stop worrying about f**king Jamie Laing,\u2019 Melissa demands, throwing one of her trademarked eye-rolls across the room.\n\nThis gets back to Jamie who summons Harry for a discussion.\n\nThis is the debut appearance for Jamie\u2019s boot, worn to assist his Strictly Come Dancing-inflicted ligament tear.\n\nCould it be? There's a potential new romance on the cards for housemates Miles and Emily\n\nHe is absolutely at his wits\u2019 end with everything: the foot, Strictly, Sam, Harry\u2026 all of it. He is so annoyed that he goes right for the jugular and tells Harry he is \u2018fragile and weak\u2019. Harry says \u2018You\u2019re a c**k!\u2019 and storms out, to use Melissa\u2019s credit card to buy himself a box of Milk Tray.\n\nThere\u2019s a potential new romance in the air: housemates Miles and Emily.\n\nMiles explains that he walks around the house in his boxers with his top off and that this must be the reason Emily is now consumed with a newfound crazy desire for him.\n\nConfronted: Jamie summons Harry for a discussion\n\nMaeva is invited to drinks with Rosi, Amelia and Verity to try clearing the air after Turkey.\n\nInstead, she calls Verity \u2018a viper\u2019, which Amelia finds disgraceful.\n\n\u2018This is James speaking through your mouth,\u2019 Verity says. She then adds: \u2018I\u2019ve been there with James \u2013 I know you hate to hear that from my mouth.\u2019\n\nUnimpressed: Maeva calls Verity \u2018a viper\u2019, which Amelia finds disgraceful\n\nDoes Verity think people can speak from alternate orifices?\n\nVerity is always just so appalled at everything. She has coffee with Emily, Habbs and Liv the next day and learns of this Miles/Emily dalliance. Mouth (again!) agape, she cries: \u2018But you live together?\u2019\n\nChill out, Verity.\n\nClutching her pearls: Verity is always just so appalled at everything. She has coffee with Emily, Habbs and Liv the next day and learns of this Miles/Emily dalliance\n\nMytton and Jamie break the fourth wall for the second time this season (and in MIC history) by addressing the fact that they are TV personalities. They don\u2019t quite say the words \u2018Strictly Come Dancing\u2019 yet Mytton does acknowledge that Jamie is \u2018that p***k off Made In Chelsea\u2019.\n\nPoor Jamie\u2019s really in the wars but on the plus side he\u2019s got great orange accentual d\u00e9cor at his flat.\n\nLiv hosts a party for her Cosmo article and drops the F-bomb in her speech. Digby is there, having sat this season out to model. He is looking better than ever and Liv just needs to marry him now.\n\nGiven the boot: This is the debut appearance for Jamie\u2019s boot, worn to assist his Strictly Come Dancing-inflicted ligament tear\n\nEmily wants \u2018help at the gym\u2019 from Miles, which surely is a way of getting these two sweating buckets together at the weights lasso.\n\nVerity can\u2019t help but come over and assert that they live together yet again, with her mouth of disdain.\n\nThe poor girl really needs to calm down with the judgement. Nothing a weekend at Denise\u2019s turkey sanctuary won\u2019t fix.", "description": "Tristan has returned. Do we remember him? Whatever.
