People trust that their personal data \u2013 email addresses and phone numbers \u2013 are safe in the hands of tech companies, who have a legal duty to keep it safe.\"\n\nIt is understood that all of Twitter's 140 million global users could have been affected by the gaffe, although the company has not confirmed any figures. The firm generated $727m in advertising revenue in the second quarter of this year.\n\nTwitter had users' emails and phone numbers because it uses a security process called two-factor authentication, where they have to log in using a code which has been text to their mobile. They did not know this data would be used for advertising purposes.", "description": "Twitter has been accused of unfairly profiteering from the personal data of up to 14.", "authors": ["Natasha Bernal", "Tom Hoggins", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2018/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000175345422-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
