I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine.\n\nHe voiced similar concerns to the NSC's lead counsel after a meeting on 10 July, his prepared remarks say, as did Fiona Hill, a former NSC adviser on Russia who has testified to impeachment investigators.\n\n\n\nAt that meeting, Vindman said the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told Ukrainian officials that they needed to \"deliver specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the president,\" at which point then-national security adviser John Bolton cut the meeting short.\n\n\n\nAfter the meeting, according to Vindman's prepared remarks, Sondland said it was important that the Ukrainian investigations centre on the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others have made discredited allegations that when Biden was vice president, he had a prosecutor fired to halt an investigation into Burisma.\n\n\n\nBoth Vindman and Hill told Sondland his statements in the meeting were \"inappropriate,\" according to Vindman's prepared remarks. His testimony is at odds with that of Sondland, who spoke to congressional investigators in closed hearings this month. Sondland told them he did not understand \"until much later\" that Burisma was connected to the Bidens. Sondland said in his opening statement to them that he did not recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\n\n\n\nVindman could be an important witness in the probe. His statement notes his two decades in the Army, including combat in Iraq, where he was wounded. \"I am a patriot and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective or party or politics,\" he says.\n\nLaura Ingraham on Fox News, however, is already pushing the line that Vindman is a Ukrainian double agent.\n\nHere's a full report on Vindman's statement.", "description": "Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the US National Security Council, is testifying to\u00a0the House impeachment inquiry\u00a0over\u00a0concerns he raised about Donald Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky and the administration\u2019s bid to pressure the country into investigating the son of domestic political rival Joe B", "authors": ["Clark Mindock", "Joe Sommerlad", "Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/12/vindman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
