No final decision has been made. Those discussions were first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nAnti-tobacco activists and health groups were livid about the prospect of the White House\u2019s backtracking on mint, menthol or both.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cExcluding menthol would be huge \u2014 it means that kids will buy menthol,\u201d said Desmond Jenson, an attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn. \u201cIf you give them one flavor, that\u2019s what they will buy. It doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d\n\nScott Gottlieb, who served as Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, said Friday that the harm to youth of allowing mint and menthol flavors outweighs the benefit to adults of having flavored options.\n\n\u201cIf mint and menthol e-cigs remain on the market, the biggest beneficiaries are tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds which mass produce these products, harming kids who are largely using these brands,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cData suggests that adults who use e-cigs to successfully quit smoking aren\u2019t using these same products.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration declined to comment on whether the administration is considering excluding mint and menthol from its proposed ban. In a statement, it said that the agency in coming weeks will finalize a policy that would \u201cclear the market of unauthorized e-cigarette products in flavors that appeal to kids. The FDA plans to share more on the specific details of the plan and its implementation soon.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said she could not comment on the policy while it is still being drafted.\n\nInside the White House, members of the president\u2019s family, including first lady Melania Trump and senior adviser Ivanka Trump, have been helping to lead the push for a crackdown on youth use of e-cigarettes. The first lady has called e-cigarette use by children a \u201cgrowing epidemic\u201d with an estimated 5 million underage users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe need to be proactive before this gets out of control,\u201d Melania Trump announced at an Oct. 9 White House event with former teenage users of the products.\n\nThe first lady was also present for the Sept. 11 Oval Office announcement by HHS Secretary Alex Azar and acting FDA commissioner Norman \u201cNed\u201d Sharpless during a joint event with Trump where the proposed ban was announced. Under the plan, flavored products would be required to come off the market and could not return unless specifically cleared by the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe youth are drawn to flavored e-cigarettes, including mint and menthol,\u201d Azar said at the event, citing recent research.\n\nParscale reached out to Trump after that event to say that the decision was being made too quickly and that Trump needed more data, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the initial outreach from Parscale, Trump released a cryptic tweet on Sept. 13, which suggested the possibility of a different approach than the one Azar had announced in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cWhile I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes, we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s get counterfeits off the market, and keep young children from Vaping!\u201d\n\nA Washington Examiner op-ed written by a pro-vaping conservative activist, Paul Blair, with the headline \u201cBanning flavored e-cigarettes might cost Trump reelection,\u201d was circulated at the White House and considered the \u201cthe opinion of the campaign,\u201d according to a White House official involved in the process.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were getting crushed by the e-cig industry that first 48 hours,\u201d said the official, who called Parscale\u2019s intervention \u201cannoying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump advisers compiled a binder of evidence supporting the idea of strong new measures to combat youth vaping, according to a person familiar with the effort. The documents included public polling, supportive editorials, statements from the scientific and medical community and statements from elected leaders. White House officials have said that banning e-cigarette flavors could help Trump with voters outside his core base, including among suburban moms.\n\nAt the same time, there have been public signs of a crack in White House support for banning all favors, as Azar and the White House press office originally announced.\n\nAD\n\nSenior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested to reporters Friday that menthol could be viewed as a type of tobacco flavoring.\n\n\u201cI think the conversation is less about flavors and more about adults and youth,\u201d she said. \u201cI recognize that menthol tastes like tobacco. Many adults like menthol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nConservative activists and trade groups organized a protest by e-cigarette users at a recent Trump rally in Dallas, and have said that any attempt to restrict flavors would take away the freedoms of adults.\n\n\u201cFlavors are vaping. Vaping is flavors,\u201d said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who declines to say if he or his group has received funding from the e-cigarette industry. \u201cIt is a vote-moving issue in the same way being a home-schooler is or concealed carry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGreg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement that while he is \u201cheartened\u201d to see the White House beginning to back off the flavor ban, \u201ccarving out certain flavors to benefit one company simply will not be effective at achieving any of the White House\u2019s goals.\u201d\n\nConley said in an interview Thursday that mint and menthol account for a relatively low proportion of the sales at vape shops and exempting them would not save retailers from financial peril. \u201cIt won\u2019t satisfy the voters that Trump is trying to appease,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nRather than a flavor ban, many in the vaping industry would prefer tougher sales restrictions that keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of kids, he said.\n\nJuul, which is the largest e-cigarette company, has removed all flavors from the market except tobacco, menthol and mint, and it has said recently that it was reviewing whether to suspend sales of the latter two as well. Mint and menthol accounted for almost 60 percent of Juul\u2019s $3.3 billion in retail sales in the United States last year, according to a Wells Fargo analyst report from last month.\n\nJuul spokesman Austin Finan said the company will continue to refrain from lobbying the administration on its e-cigarette flavor policy and \u201cwill fully support and comply with the final policy.\u201d\n\nThe company has employed a number of former Trump White House officials, including former counselor to the president Johnny DeStefano, former vice presidential adviser Rebeccah Propp and former communications adviser Josh Raffel.\n\nAltria, the tobacco giant that has a 30 percent stake in Juul, also has said it is opposed to youth vaping and that it would not lobby against the administration\u2019s e-cigarette proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re not lobbying in opposition to the administration\u2019s current e-vapor proposal, and we look forward to reviewing the FDA\u2019s new e-vapor guidance when it is issued. Juul\u2019s top executive was replaced last month with a former Altria executive.\n\nJeff Miller, a lobbyist with close ties to Vice President Pence, reported that his firm was paid $60,000 by Altria from July through September 2019 to lobby HHS, the Executive Office of the President and the White House on \u201cissues related to the regulation of tobacco products including \u2026 [the] WH Administration Initiative to ban flavored vaping products.\u201d\n\nAltria reported paying its in-house lobbyists more than $2 million to lobby Congress, the FDA, the White House and the Office of Management and Budget on issues including \u201cFDA Guidance on E-Vapor.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with Altria\u2019s lobbying strategy said the disclosures reflect efforts to gather information \u2014 not to take a position on the White House proposed ban.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been clear: Don\u2019t get involved in any of the flavor ban issues at all. They just want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. \u201cWe make calls to our contacts in government to say, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s going on with the issue, what are you hearing, what do you think they\u2019re going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe intelligence-gathering has made clear, the person said, that \u201cthere\u2019s disagreement among folks in the White House. The concern is, there\u2019s a lot of adults that switched to mint and menthol to quit smoking. So how do you handle that?\u201d", "description": "The warning comes as administration weighs excluding mint or menthol from the proposed ban on all non-tobacco flavored e-cigarette products.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Laurie Mcginley", "Reporter Covering Health", "Neena Satija", "Investigative Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KcgNmiX0Wyb47v2rOwh4kvl-QfU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCYE4CHXKEI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
