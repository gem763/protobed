It\u2019s time to ditch the chicken and waffles and embrace the greens\n\nSeptember marks the end of summer and the start of a new school year. Parents and caregivers will soon begin packing school lunches or dispensing money into their children\u2019s lunch accounts, leaving them at the mercy of the government for sustenance.\n\nMy parents decided to go with the latter. They tried meal prepping before the term was even coined, but a kid can only eat so many Lunchables and peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. It was therefore agreed that my siblings and I would eat the standard cafeteria food at our public school.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s where my problems began.\n\nFast forward 15 years. I am now 24. It\u2019s 7pm and I\u2019m starving. I pull myself up three flights of stairs to my apartment. The day has flown by, and I\u2019m feeling a little faint.\n\nMy eyes scan the kitchen for something to eat. I open and close the cabinets and refrigerator door several times before deciding on \u2026 Cheetos. I eat about half the bag for dinner and watch season three of Stranger Things until I fall asleep on the couch. I wish Cheetos were carrots, I really do. I wish carrots tasted like Cheetos, but they taste like water and tree bark. And don\u2019t even get me started on green vegetables.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a junk food propaganda piece. I agree that most fast food is artificial (and probably carcinogenic). I try to limit myself to eating absolute garbage to just once a week, but considering I hate vegetables, that can be tricky.\n\nFood apartheid: the root of the problem with America's groceries Read more\n\nI suspect my hate affair with veggies can be traced to my Texas upbringing. I grew up in Houston, where we have the best tacos in the nation \u2013 not to mention the honey-butter chicken biscuit. The state-mandated fruit and vegetable requirement for public school cafeterias is three pieces of lettuce swimming in ranch dressing and a peach cobbler. And when I met up with friends after school, we\u2019d go to Whataburger.\n\nMy mother was a high school English teacher who went to college at night to complete her PhD. My dad was a traditionalist who came home from work at 7.30pm every night. I still don\u2019t know what his job was (Finance? Consulting? The mafia?) but I knew the time he came home, because that\u2019s when my brother and I would turn off the TV and run to the kitchen to hide our tortilla chips and ramen noodles. The sound of a garage door opening still strikes fear into my soul.\n\nMy parents did not encourage junk food. In fact, when I would bring home Tastykakes or Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, I\u2019d find them in the trash the next day. My mom was watching her weight and didn\u2019t want to be tempted: she lost 60lb over the course of my middle school years. She never found my drawer of hidden snacks.\n\nDinner was whatever my mom had made the previous night and left in the freezer. Sometimes it was lasagne, sometimes biryani. She made spinach and eggplant dishes quite often, but with no one to look over my shoulder when I was eating, I left it untouched. My father would eat on his chair in the living room while watching soccer or The West Wing while I ate in the kitchen, hogging the phone line talking to Kelly or Nicole about Kyle or Chad. (I lived in a very white suburb.)\n\nOn the days my mom slaved over her dissertation on American syncretism, my dad would bring home McDonald\u2019s or Chick-fil-A. Needless to say, I lived for those days. I felt like I would rather starve than eat another helping of rice, daal or cauliflower.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lone Star-shaped breakfast waffles.

Though I worked out all the time with my fitness-crazed roommate, I lived above a Taco Bell and down the street from an establishment called the Potato Shack. A coffee, a beer or pretzels was considered a meal.\n\nFor many Americans, this isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. Food deserts form the tapestry of American cuisine,and most suburbs have a McDonald\u2019s or a Burger King lurking nearby. Drive-thrus serving burgers, fries and milkshakes are common, but drive-thrus serving salads are rare gems, if any exist at all. Time and accessibility are factors that determine what the average American family decides to eat for dinner.\n\nYou might envision me as a whale of a woman hunched over her laptop typing this with Cheeto-stained fingertips. While I\u2019m not there (yet), my future is not bright if I continue on this path. No longer can I eat a family-size bag of Orville Redenbacher buttery popcorn and maintain my figure. I\u2019m getting older and my hips don\u2019t lie. Neither does my cholesterol.\n\nI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m better than that. I\u2019m a grown woman living in New York who needs to suck it up and chow down on a salad. I\u2019ve been experimenting with tricking myself into eating healthier \u2013 yes, like a toddler \u2013 so I grow into the habit.\n\nI\u2019ve started eating zucchini noodles, which really do taste like spaghetti if you close your eyes and gulp them down. I discovered I love butternut squash soup. Granted, these are often preludes to a burger or ice cream, but I\u2019m getting there. I\u2019m also really into baba ganoush.\n\nI still enjoy working out, but as my best friend reminds me, abs are (allegedly) made in the kitchen. I know it\u2019s time to abandon the Texas way and adopt a new lifestyle. I\u2019m also sick of my judgmental colleagues, who sound like paid spokespeople for Michelle Obama\u2019s Let\u2019s Move! campaign. They never fail to mention they grow vegetables on the window sills of their Brooklyn apartments and how delicious they find kale. (Liars!) I won\u2019t lie \u2013 my new health kick is partially due to my desire to not feel sluggish, but it\u2019s mostly to get these annoying colleagues off my back.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to maintain a healthy lifestyle, just know you are not alone. Let\u2019s make a pledge to stop eating monochromatic meals of brown and yellow starches and incorporate some color on to our plate. It won\u2019t happen overnight. But I\u2019ll be damned if one more person shames me for eating a cheesy gordita crunch for lunch again.", "description": "I grew up in Texas, where food is fast and portions are vast.
