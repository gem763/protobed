Every step of the journey, breathing every breath with these men, felt integral. And there is no better way to tell the story than with one continuous shot.\"\n\nUse of continuous-shot cinematography has increased in recent years, with the fellow award winner Emmanuel Lubezki employing it masterfully in various films like \"The Revenant,\" \"Gravity,\" and, perhaps most notably, in the stunning battle sequence from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2032s \"Children of Men.\"\n\n\"It's meant to make you feel that you are in the trenches with these characters,\" said the film producer Pippa Harris, who worked with Mendes on \"Jarhead\" and \"Revolutionary Road.\"\n\nBecause this filming technique requires the use of 360 degrees of each exterior, \"1917,\" like \"The Revenant,\" had to be shot using only natural light, a process that made actors and camera operators dependent on ideal weather conditions.\n\nA five-minute window of the sun ducking behind clouds could send the cast and crew scrambling into position.\n\nSelect action sequences were so extensive that cameras had to be hooked onto wires and pushed across landscapes by operators before traversing an elevated wire reminiscent of the Skycam used in NFL broadcasts. Operators would then have to regather the camera, unhook it, and run alongside characters before climbing into a moving vehicle for a faster sequence.\n\nDean-Charles Chapman plays Blake in \"1917.\" Universal\n\nMcKay said the filming process reminded him of acting onstage. \"It was like a piece of theater every take. Once you start, you can't stop. If something goes wrong, you just have to keep going.\"\n\nIn some movies, filmmakers \"might be able to cut around this or take that scene out,\" Mendes said. \"That's not possible on this film. The dance of the camera and the mechanics all have to be in sync with what the actor is doing.\"\n\n\"When you achieve that, it's really beautiful.\"\n\n\"1917\" is set for a limited Christmas Day release before hitting theaters nationwide on January 10.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch (\"The Imitation Game,\" \"Doctor Strange\"), Colin Firth (\"The King's Speech,\" \"Kingsman\"), Mark Strong (\"The Imitation Game,\" \"Zero Dark Thirty\"), and Richard Madden (\"Game of Thrones\") round out a star-studded cast.\n\nWorld War I garnered renewed interest following the release of Peter Jackson's (\"Lord of the Rings\") groundbreaking documentary, \"They Shall Not Grow Old.\"\n\nBased on the first two trailers, it looks as if Mendes is sure to do the Great War justice.\n\nWatch the second official trailer below.", "description": "To make it as immersive as possible, the filmmakers shot the entire film as a continuous shot that never departs from the two main characters.", "authors": ["J.D.
