REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam scrapped a scheduled meeting with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the highest profile U.S. politician to visit the city since anti-government protests broke out more than four months ago, the senator said on Saturday.\n\nLam had requested that the afternoon meeting be completely confidential and Cruz refrain from speaking with the media about it, Cruz told journalists in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cShe seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press operates,\u201d said Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas.\n\n\u201cMs. Lam\u2019s canceling the meeting is not a sign of strength. It\u2019s a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of fear of the protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nLam\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the canceled meeting.\n\nCruz, a vocal China critic who was stopping by Hong Kong for two days as part of a region-wide tour, was wearing black to show that he stands with the protesters in the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nStreet protests, filled often with black-clad people, started against a proposed extradition bill earlier this year but have escalated since June and morphed into a wider movement for democracy and against police violence.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam scrapped a scheduled meeting with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the highest profile U.S. politician to visit the city since anti-government protests broke out more than four months ago, the senator said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440032131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0DC", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
