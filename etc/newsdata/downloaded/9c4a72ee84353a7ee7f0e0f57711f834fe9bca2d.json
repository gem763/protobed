Oh, right, from pretty much every candidate running for president. Barack Obama said in 2008 that if he were elected, he would \u201claunch the most sweeping ethics reform in U.S. history. We will make government more open, more accountable and more responsive to the problems of the American people.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton in 1992 promised to \u201cbreak the stranglehold the special interests have on our elections and the lobbyists have on our government.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump promised to drain the swamp.\n\nDespite Warren\u2019s description of her plan as \u201cfar-reaching and aggressive,\u201d it amounts to little more than a grab bag of reforms, many of which have been tried before in one way or another. She\u2019d stop the revolving door between government service and lobbying. She\u2019d ban lawmakers and their staff members from serving on corporate boards. She\u2019d create a new Office of Public Integrity.\n\nWhatever the merits of Warren\u2019s specific anti-corruption proposals, the simple truth is that the rest of her agenda would have the exact opposite effect.\n\nThe problem with all these \u201canti-corruption\u201d efforts is that they are trying to treat the symptom, not the disease.\n\nAnd, in this case, the disease is Big G overnment . Put simply, the larger and more unencumbered the federal government is, the more it will feed the lobbyist industry and the political corruption that Warren says she wants to root out.\n\nAnd, boy, does Warren want Big Government. Her agenda \u2014 Green New Deal, Medicare for All, free college, a vast increase in the regulatory state \u2014 would more than double the size of government.\n\nThe connection between the size of government and corruption isn\u2019t just idle speculation.\n\nWriting in the Global Anticorruption Blog, Harvard law professor Matthew Stephenson says several studies have found a clear correlation in the U.S. between the size of state governments and corruption.\n\n\u201cWithin the U.S., when controlling for a number of other economic and demographic factors, states with larger public sectors seem to have higher corruption,\u201d he writes.\n\nA 1998 study, for example, shows \u201cgovernment size, in particular, spending by state gove r nments, does indeed have a strong positive influence on corruption.\u201d\n\nA 2012 study, titled \u201cLive Free or Bribe,\u201d looked at the number of government officials convicted in a state for crimes related to corruption and found that the more economic freedom there was in the state, the less corruption resulted.\n\n\u201cEconomic freedom,\u201d the study found, \u201chas a negative impact on corruption.\u201d\n\nWhat this means is that Warren\u2019s plan \u2014 which would result in a drastic expansion in government and an equally sharp reduction of economic freedom \u2014 would produce a steep increase in corruption.\n\nLikewise, Warren\u2019s massive government expansion would only embolden the lobbyist class.\n\nHere\u2019s one prime example: Before the Clinton administration decided to sic government antitrust lawyers on Microsoft in 1998, the company had almost no lobbying presence in Washington whatsoever. Within four years of the White House attack, Microsoft had, as CNN described it, \u201cone of the most dominating, multifaceted, and sophisticated influence machines around.\u201d\n\nNow take a look at the nearby chart. It tracks federal spending and lobbyist spending since 1998. The two lines are almost identical.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in this space before, Big Business likes Big Government precisely because Big Government butts into markets. Big companies can afford to hire an army of lobbyists to shape and mold federal rules, regulations and laws to their liking, and in ways that hamper upstart competitors.\n\nSo, by vastly expanding the size and intrusiveness of the federal government, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts would put even more power into the hands of the wealthy and well-connected and unleash government corruption on an unprecedented scale.\n\nIf you want less government corruption and if you want to neuter the power and influence of lobbyists, there\u2019s only one sure way to do it: Radically shrink the size of government.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many platitudes politicians spew, or how many good-government plans they produce, so long as the government inserts itself so deeply into the country\u2019s affairs, lobbying, cronyism, and corruption will be endemic.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
