That was even the view of South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus on Wednesday, when he was asked about it.\n\n'It was certainly interesting, it was certainly exciting,' he said.\n\n'It was certainly something new, and it brought some spice to the Test match. I don't think it was disrespectful, and it was something new for everyone in world rugby. I wouldn't make a big issue about it, but it's not for me to decide.'\n\nThe players revealed afterwards that the V-shape was the idea of their coach Eddie Jones, with Mako Vunipola admitting afterwards that 'we knew it would rile them up.'\n\nCaptain Farrell was pictured smirking while the dance was performed, with New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith saying afterwards that Farrell winked at him.\n\nOwen Farrell was caught on camera smirking at the New Zealand haka ahead of the semi-final\n\nSeveral England players spilled over into the New Zealand half and were told to step back\n\nFrance were fined \u00a32,500 for forming a V-shape and advancing on the haka in the 2011 final\n\nThe France team linked arms and walked up to within metres of the New Zealand team in 2011\n\nSmith said: 'We don't really do it to scare them. We do it for us, to represent our people, to represent New Zealand.\n\n'The All Blacks have been doing it for 110 years. I was looking at the guy straight opposite me and that was Owen Farrell. He was giving me a few winks.'\n\nProtocol states that players must not cross the halfway line while the haka is being performed but six players - Joe Marler, Billy Vunipola, Mark Wilson, Elliot Daly, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Ben Youngs - appeared to stand in the All Blacks half.\n\nMatch officials, including referee Nigel Owens, tried in vain to encourage them back into their own half and this was taken into account by World Rugby in their deliberations.\n\n'[Joe Marler] said he got confused,' Mako Vunipola said. 'He thought he was supposed to go all the way around it and go to their 10.\n\n'But because of that, he's the one who has to pay the fine. He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.'", "description": "England have been reprimanded and fined by World Rugby for their unorthodox response to the haka five days ago.
