But if you consider we still live in a car-based society, most households still have a car and people are still very willing to do their weekly shopping in a car, so you don\u2019t need to be in walking distance to a nice supermarket precinct,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are willing to drive to their Sunday brunch.\u201d\n\nPwC\u2019s CityPulse map \u2014 which rates suburbs out of 10 on \u201clive\u201d, \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cplay\u201d factors \u2014 also gives a picture of which middle-ring suburbs are flourishing. Across the city, the average for \u201clive\u201d is 5.2, for \u201cwork\u201d is 4.1, and for \u201cplay\u201d is 4.4.\n\nThese are the middle-ring suburbs to watch:\n\nmedia_camera Glen Waverley and surrounding suburbs like Mulgrave are flourishing, with a healthy mix of food, entertainment, shopping and leisure opportunities.\n\nEAST: MULGRAVE\n\nMulgrave\u2019s median price rose 19 per cent to $881,000 on the back of strong demand from younger buyers.\n\nREIV president Leah Calnan said the \u201cbridesmaid suburb\u201d to Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley gave buyers a more affordable entry to the housing market a suburb away from their dream postcode, while still being close to the Monash Freeway, Monash University and a revamped The Glen shopping centre and country club.\n\n\u201cMulgrave is probably a push-on effect from suburbs like Glen Waverley or Mount Waverley, where the median house price is in excess of $1 million, and therefore buyers look for the next suburb,\u201d she said.\n\nMulgrave has above-average live, work and play ratings on PwC\u2019s CityPulse map, at 5.9, 5.6 and 4.4 respectively.\n\nmedia_camera Living beachside, but not too far from the city, is one of the main drawcards of Beaumaris. Picture: David Smith\n\nSOUTH: BEAUMARIS AND CHELTENHAM\n\nCheltenham\u2019s golfing greens, sports clubs, easy access to the Westfield Southland, the Nepean Highway, public transport, parks, and cafes are putting it in high demand.\n\n\u201cLifestyle and sports facilities are always high on people\u2019s list of additional amenities they\u2019re looking for when they\u2019re house hunting,\u201d Ms Calnan says.\n\n\u201cAlso, access to public transport and to the freeways.\u201d\n\nIn fact it is so in demand that the median price hit $1.05 million in the three months to September \u2014 up almost 17 per cent.\n\nThe median price in fellow bayside suburb Beaumaris rose 20 per cent to $1.825 million in the September quarter, with buyers lured by a popular shopping strip, cafes, schools, public transport, golf clubs, a new sporting club and Southland.\n\nCheltenham has above-average live and play ratings on PwC\u2019s CityPulse map, at 5.9 and 5 respectively, and a work rating right on the Victorian average of 5.\n\nNORTH-EAST: DONCASTER AND DONVALE\n\nIn the northeast, Doncaster and neighbouring Donvale are luring buyers thanks to their proximity to the Eastern Freeway and EastLink, as well as Westfield Doncaster.\n\nThey are also a stone\u2019s throw away from the natural beauty of Warrandyte and surrounds, and an easy drive to the Yarra Valley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having that push-out effect people are looking for, maybe a little bit more land and closer to the Dandenongs, but still close to freeways and the CBD,\u201d Ms Calnan said.\n\nDoncaster\u2019s house prices jumped 14 per cent to a median of almost $1.28 million in the September quarter.\n\nDoncaster has live, work and play ratings well above average on PwC\u2019s CityPulse map, at 7.2, 4.7 and 6.6 respectively, while Donvale\u2019s ratings are 6.7 for live, 4.7 for work, and 5.7 for play \u2014 also above average.\n\nMORE FUTURE VICTORIA NEWS:\n\nRADICAL IDEA TO OVERHAUL VICTORIA\u2019S HIGH SCHOOLS\n\nTHE BEST PLACES TO LIVE IN MELBOURNE\n\nRADICAL \u2018RING OF CITIES\u2019 PLAN TO EASE MELBOURNE POPULATION CRUSH\n\nNORTH: COBURG\n\nMr Kuestenmacher expected to see a trend towards people demanding suburbs where everything was in walking distance.\n\n\u201cBut this is yet not the norm and most importantly, it is not as high a priority as the sheer number of bedrooms and the block size for people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of Coburg, for example, where you do have these pleasures available.\u201d\n\nMr Kuestenmacher said Coburg, 9km north of the city, would certainly continue to see growth, which will spread to neighbouring Coburg North and Pascoe Vale.\n\n\u201cThese areas are growing massively over the next couple of years, simply because people want to be as close as possible to the CBD and still have enough bedrooms,\u201d he says.\n\nCoburg\u2019s rise is reflected in its live, work and play ratings, with 7.1, 4.7 and 5.5 respectively \u2014 all above average.\n\nFuture Victoria map: How Victorians think about leisure options in their area\n\nWEST: POINT COOK\n\nPoint Cook is seeing its first wave of generational change, according to demographer Bernard Salt.\n\nAnd as younger people move further out from inner-suburbs such as Footscray and Newport, exciting things are happening in the suburb.\n\nmedia_camera Point Cook\u2019s popularity is soaring, with leisure opportunities including the air force museum at the RAAF base.

Its live rating is also above the city average at 5.5.", "description": "Some of Melbournes middle-ring suburbs are thriving much more than others \u2014 and millennials are leading the charge to put them firmly on the map.
