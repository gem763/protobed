Hurricane-force winds now extend outward up to 60 miles from the center, while tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles.\n\n\"It's going through some structural changes in terms of the eye and when it does that, the wind field expands,\" Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean said on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nShe added: \"So this storm is getting larger, it's going to affect more territory, even if the core of the strongest winds stay offshore.\"\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S PATH: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nIn the Bahamas, devastating images revealed the scope of the damage from Dorian's catastrophic daylong halt over the islands that flooded Abaco and Grand Bahama with walls of water that lapped into the second floors of buildings.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a historic tragedy,\" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said. \"The devastation is unprecedented and extensive.\"\n\nOfficials said that at least five people have died and 21 injured people were airlifted to the capital by the U.S. Coast Guard. Bahamian officials said they received a \"tremendous\" number of calls from people in flooded homes, with one radio station saying it received more than 2,000 distress messages, including reports of a 5-month-old baby stranded on a roof and a woman with six grandchildren who cut a hole in a roof to escape rising floodwaters.\n\n\"We're definitely in dire straits.\" \u2014 Bahaman Parliament member Iram Lewis\n\nVideos posted to Twitter showed the extent of storm surge, with floodwaters nearing the second-story of homes.\n\nParliament member Iram Lewis told The Associated Press his greatest fear was that waters would keep rising overnight and that stranded people would lose contact with officials as cellphone batteries died.\n\n\"It is scary,\" he said, adding that Grand Bahama's airport was 6 feet underwater and that people were moving from one shelter to another as floodwaters kept surging. \"We're definitely in dire straits.\"\n\nWinds and rain continued to pound the northwest islands. Abaco and Grand Bahama, neither much more than 40 feet above sea level at their highest points, are home to some 70,000 people.\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\nThe NHC has said that Dorian is forecast to slowly begin moving to the west-northwest Tuesday while continuing to pound Grand Bahama Island into the morning. The storm will then move \"dangerously close\" to Florida's east coast through Wednesday evening before taking aim at the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Wednesday night and Thursday.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina were ordered to evacuate, with South Carolina officials reversing all lanes of Interstate 26 from Charleston to head inland.\n\nBy Thursday night, Hurricane Dorian is forecast to be near or over the North Carolina coast, still as a Category 2 storm.\n\n\"We're talking about perhaps a major hurricane or category 2 moving in somewhere, the border between North and South Carolina, that's going to do devastating things to the low-lying areas,\" Dean said Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Florida's East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to South Santee River in South Carolina.
