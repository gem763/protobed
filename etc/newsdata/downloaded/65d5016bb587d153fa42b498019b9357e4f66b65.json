Your commute, your driving tendencies, cell phone contacts, even your Spotify playlists create an ocean of information that\u2019s collected, \u201canonymized\u201d and sold to any number of interested parties\u2014ranging from city planners to the marketing sector.\n\n\n\nThat data also creates a wonderful target for law enforcement and the potential for abuse when judicial oversight is eliminated from the equation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has long argued that the Fourth Amendment protects US residents against unjustified access by law enforcement looking for access to this data.\n\n\n\nThat fight came to a head in Georgia during Mobley v. State. After a double fatality back in 2014, law enforcement used data collected from both vehicles to impose a harsher prison sentence on Victor Lamont Mobley. Thanks to this data, Mobley\u2019s vehicle was found to have been going 97 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour speed limit zone.\n\n\n\nToday that conviction was overturned; the state supreme court ruling that law enforcement\u2019s decision to access this data without first obtaining a warrant constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court ruling overturns an earlier state Court of Appeals ruling that defended law enforcement\u2019s decision to skip the warrant.\n\n\n\nThe state of Georgia had tried to claim that downloading vehicle data stored in Mobley\u2019s vehicle without getting a warrant was justified under what is known as the \u201cvehicle exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement.\n\n\n\nBut the ACLU had long disagreed, pointing out that earlier precedent leaned on by the state applied largely to physical items found in vehicles, and not the myriad of data now collected by modern vehicles. Opening the door to warrantless vehicle searches, the ACLU warned, also opened the door to widespread abuse of this data by law enforcement and the government.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn an age when our cars are operated via increasingly complex computer systems, it is vital that courts establish strong protections against police accessing sensitive data without a warrant,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Nathan Wessler told Motherboard.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout these protections, police could easily access data about how we drive, where we\u2019ve been, who we talk to, and even who rides in our cars, all without judicial oversight,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an important protection for Americans\u2019 privacy in the digital age.\u201d\n\nOther digital rights groups were quick to applaud the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cRulings like these are important in reaffirming that our Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to the always-on location tracking devices that are part of modern life,\u201d Gaurav Laroia, a privacy expert at consumer advocacy firm Free Press told Motherboard.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because you've carried your phone on your person or traveled in your car doesn't give the government the right to automatically access that information about you,\u201d he added. \u201cThe court was right and put law enforcement on notice\u2014get a warrant.\u201d", "description": "Georgia Supreme Court declares that warrantless access to your vehicle data constitutes an unconstitutional intrusion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dae1b5a5c8441000a240cee/lede/1571691801739-GettyImages-86463808.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8465931181959565xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
