Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in appointed the new minister, Cho Kuk, on Sept. 9, after weeks of public protests, parliamentary debate and media speculation about allegations his daughter had unfairly received favourable treatment from her university.\n\n\u201cIt has become clear that Cho Kuk cannot be the leader of reform,\u201d the deputy speaker, Lee Ju-young, told reporters as he sat outside the gate of the presidential Blue House to have his head shaved, a gesture of protest in South Korea.\n\nLee called for Cho to step down.\n\n\u201cThe people\u2019s stern order is for him to resign immediately and be investigated,\u201d said Lee, who was joined by an opposition member of parliament getting his head shaved. Eight members of parliament have had their heads shaved.\n\nThe controversy centres on media reports of scholarships and other academic perks granted to Cho\u2019s daughter, benefits that allegedly did not reflect her academic performance.\n\nThe prosecutors\u2019 office has been investigating the family. The office has declined to comment.\n\nThe scandal has struck a chord in South Korea where young people, who compete fiercely through school and university, are increasingly scrambling for positions in a slack job market, in a system they see as plagued by unfairness and bias in favour of the elite.\n\nCho, in a parliamentary confirmation hearing on Friday, did not deny his daughter\u2019s academic perks. He expressed his \u201cdeepest apologies to the younger generation\u201d for the disappointment that he caused them.\n\nHis 28-year-old daughter has not been identified in South Korean media and she has made no public comment on the controversy.\n\nREFORM\n\nCho is a legal scholar with a reputation as a progressive, who was previously Moon\u2019s top aide for legal affairs.\n\nMoon has called him the ideal person to carry out reforms of the justice ministry and the prosecution system. Critics have long accused the judiciary of being susceptible to political pressure.\n\nCho, who as justice minister supervises the prosecutors\u2019 office, has vowed not to get involved in the investigation of his family, saying he would not receive reports on it.\n\nThe liberal Moon took office in 2017 after the impeachment for corruption of his conservative predecessor, who came from one of South Korea\u2019s most prominent political families.\n\nDeputy Speaker of the National Assembly Lee Ju-Young, gets his head shaved as Hwang Kyo-ahn, the main opposition Liberty Korea Party chairman, looks on to protest the recent appointment of Justice Minister Cho Kuk in Seoul, South Korea, September 18, 2019. Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nMoon promised change, including equal opportunities, but his ratings have been sliding recently as the economy struggles.\n\nSome 57.1% of people said Moon\u2019s appointment of Cho as justice minister was wrong, compared with 36.3% who approved, in a survey of 1,009 people on Sept. 14 and 15 by pollster Korea Research International.\n\nThe same poll found that 51.7% of those surveyed disapproved of Moon\u2019s performance, while 44.5% approved.", "description": "The deputy speaker of South Korea's parliament joined a growing band of politicians on Wednesday who have shaved their heads in a protest against a new justice minister whose family is being investigated for suspected wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431104877&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0C1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
