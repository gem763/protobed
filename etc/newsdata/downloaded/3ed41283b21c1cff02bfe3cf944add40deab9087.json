However, once liquidation sales begin at the closing stores, usage is likely to be curbed at those particular locations.\n\nStore closings 2019: An estimated 12,000 shops could close by the end of the year\n\nBed Bath & Beyond store closings: Retailer increases projected closures to 60\n\nBut you might have noticed some recent additions to the coupon exclusions list and changes to return policies.\n\nIn March, the company started requiring receipts in \"most instances,\" former CEO Steven Temares explained in April. The time period for returns also changed from a year to 180 days, with items in several categories needing to be brought back sooner.\n\nIn July, another update was made to the policy posted at www.bedbathandbeyond.com, which states returns \"may be limited or denied based on our return authorization system\" and a third-party database \"to help protect against excessive, fraudulent or otherwise not permitted returns.\"\n\nKimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert with Nerdwallet, said it's a reminder that stores can change their policies or close at any time. Walmart recently ended a car seat trade-in promotion nine days earlier than planned because of overwhelming demand.\n\n\"If you have coupons or items to return, don\u2019t hold on to them because you never know when they could lose their value,\" Palmer said. \"Use your coupons as soon as possible.\"\n\nIs my Bed Bath & Beyond closing?\n\nThat's unknown or at least not being shared publicly at this time. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. told USA TODAY in a statement that it is \"not providing any further details of these store closings at this time.\"\n\nWhen are stores expected to close?\n\nOfficials said most of the closings would take place in the company's fourth quarter, which is after the holidays in early 2020.\n\nIs anything changing with coupons?\n\nIn July, officials said additional exclusions were recently added to coupons. When closing locations are announced, it is likely that coupons will stop being accepted at those locations.\n\nShould I use my gift card?\n\nNothing is changing at this time, but experts typically suggest that you take gift cards out of your wallet and drawers and put them to use ASAP.\n\nWhat about returns?\n\nThe company, previously known for having one of the most lenient return policies, has updated its policy several times in recent years. One of the biggest overhauls was in 2015, when returns without receipts had 20% deducted, and previously a time frame was not listed for most returns. In 2018, the policy changed to one year on most items, and that changed again earlier this year to 180 days. Also today, a receipt or item lookup using a credit card is required in most instances.\n\nWill more stores close in the future?\n\nIt's possible. During Wednesday's meeting, interim CEO Mary Winston said the company is using a \"fleet optimization program for all Bed Bath & Beyond stores to create a better balance between our physical and digital presence within the markets we serve.\" Winston noted \"more than 400 leases across all concepts expiring over the next couple of years.\"\n\nContributing: Nathan Bomey\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bed Bath & Beyond 20% coupon: What shoppers need to know amid closings", "description": "Will Bed Bath & Beyond still take coupons?
