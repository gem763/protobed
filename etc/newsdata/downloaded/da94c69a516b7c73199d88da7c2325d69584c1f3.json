REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo\n\nThe buzz around the Brooklyn-born singer, whose full name is Mikaela Straus, has built since her single \u201c1950\u201d, inspired by \u201cThe Price of Salt\u201d, the Patricia Highsmith novel about a forbidden lesbian affair. The soulful ballad has more than 10 million YouTube views since it appeared in February last year.\n\nSpeaking at the Glastonbury Festival in June, Straus said she was \u201creally, really excited\u201d about the album. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fierce,\u201d she said, adding that the songs had been inspired by \u201cthe usual girl heartbreak\u201d.\n\n\u201cHoney, heartbreak, hard times, friendships, you know, that shit, all the good shit,\u201d she said.\n\nAs her stage name suggests, she plays with gender roles, appearing in the \u201c1950\u201d video in a cowboy outfit with a pencilled-in moustache. She sings of a girlfriend who rescues her \u201cwhen the dudes try to chase me... cause I\u2019m just a lady\u201d.\n\nBut she said it was important that LBGT artists aren\u2019t pigeonholed, as they might once have been.\n\n\u201cThe thing about queer people\u2019s careers in the past is that it\u2019s been focused on a narrative of sexuality and you don\u2019t get the substance,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I, before anything, want to deliver the music and then give you the gay shit, too, on top of it like an extra treat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s amazing queer people in the audience, (but) there\u2019s also people who just love music and are there to just jam out and that is just equally as important to me,\u201d she said.\n\nStraus was one of the first signings to Mark Ronson\u2019s Zelig Records, an imprint of Columbia Records, after the musician and producer known for working with Amy Winehouse and Adele heard her \u201cMake My Bed\u201d EP.\n\n\u201cWe had dinner and started hanging out a bit and talking about music,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to meetings and it feels super sterile most of the time, and it was just really nice to talk with somebody who produced some of my favorite records and is just a super fan of music in general.\u201d", "description": "Twenty-year-old singer-songwriter King Princess releases one of pop music's most hotly anticipated debut albums on Friday, \"Cheap Queen\", more than a year after she shot to stardom with a single name-checked by Harry Styles and Kourtney Kardashian.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444124629&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M16H-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
