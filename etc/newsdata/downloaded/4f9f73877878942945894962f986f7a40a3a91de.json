The party has lost substantial ground to the Greens, whose environmental message is increasingly resonating at a time of growing voter concern about climate change. The Greens, who won less than 10 percent of the vote in the last national election in 2017, are now neck-and-neck with the conservatives in most polls.\n\nWhile the CDU\u2019s decline is not all Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s doing, she didn\u2019t help matters by accusing a group of young YouTube personalities in the wake of the European election of trying to \u201cdestroy\u201d her party with an anti-CDU campaign. She also suggested it might be necessary to regulate such content during election campaigns, sparking accusations that she wanted to censor political speech.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s troubled start as party leader renewed questions about her suitability for the chancellery, reviving speculation that one of her challengers for the party\u2019s leadership, Health Minister Jens Spahn or Friedrich Merz, a CDU veteran with strong backing in conservative circles, could end up succeeding Merkel instead.\n\nWithin the CDU, party strategists argued that Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has never served in the Cabinet, should take on a major ministry to prove she has what it takes to lead Germany.\n\nWhether by chance or design, von der Leyen\u2019s nomination to become Commission president handed Kramp-Karrenbauer the break she needed.\n\nIt was von der Leyen\u2019s failure to effectively reform the troubled [defense] ministry during her six-year tenure that took her out of consideration as Merkel\u2019s successor.\n\nIn what now looks like a clever diversionary tactic meant to draw attention away from the broader implications of von der Leyen\u2019s nomination, Kramp-Karrenbauer insisted that she had no intention of becoming defense minister or accepting any other Cabinet position.\n\n\u201cI made a clear decision to leave a government position for a party position,\u201d Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was premier of the Saarland region before becoming CDU chief, told the Bild daily earlier this month. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do in the CDU.\u201d\n\nGiven Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s apparent decision to pass on the job, attention shifted to other possible candidates, in particular Spahn, a rising CDU star who has received high marks across the aisle for his management of the health ministry.\n\nFor Spahn, who has made no secret of his ambition to become chancellor, the defense ministry would have been a perfect stepping stone to the chancellery. With a budget of more than \u20ac40 billion and oversight of Germany\u2019s 180,000 soldiers, the defense ministry is the perfect proving ground for would-be chancellors.\n\nIndeed, it was von der Leyen\u2019s failure to effectively reform the troubled ministry during her six-year tenure that took her out of consideration as Merkel\u2019s successor.\n\nWhile some see the defense minister position as a poisoned chalice, there may have never been a more propitious moment to take on the job.\n\nVon der Leyen is widely blamed for the military\u2019s woes, and no one believes fixing the problems will be easy. With just over two years left in the government\u2019s current term, the bar for success is low. The low expectations should make it easier for the new minister to shine in parliament and on the international stage.\n\n\u201cMany servicemen and women want a minister who is interested in the job itself and not looking to use it as a springboard to the next-higher position\u201d \u2014Tobias Lindner, a Green member of the German parliament\u2019s defense committee\n\nThat dynamic explains both Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s interest in the position and her decision with Merkel to keep the plan under wraps until after von der Leyen was approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nTheir success in keeping the move a secret is a testament to the power of Merkel\u2019s inner circle. As late as Tuesday evening, many in the party were convinced Spahn would get the nod. Some German media even reported that Spahn would be sworn in on Wednesday.\n\nThen, late Tuesday, Merkel\u2019s spokesman shocked political Berlin with the announcement that it would be Kramp-Karrenbauer instead.\n\nIn addition to giving Kramp-Karrenbauer a more prominent platform, the defense ministry should help her step out of Merkel\u2019s shadow. As party leader, Kramp-Karrenbauer didn\u2019t even hold a seat in parliament, making it difficult for her to shed her reputation as nothing more than a \u201cmini-Merkel,\u201d as her critics suggest.\n\nNonetheless, the political calculation behind Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s move could end up backfiring if she fails to win the confidence of rank-and-file members of the military.\n\nMerkel is keen to avoid handing power to either Spahn or Merz, men with whom she has a long history of clashes.\n\n\u201cMany servicemen and women want a minister who is interested in the job itself and not looking to use it as a springboard to the next-higher position,\u201d said Tobias Lindner, a Green member of the German parliament\u2019s defense committee.\n\nFor Merkel, there\u2019s a more compelling reason to elevate her chosen successor. Though the chancellor has insisted she intends to remain in office until the end of the current legislative term in 2021, she always qualified that pledge with the caveat that she would only do so if her health enabled her to.\n\nA series of recent shaking spells, the cause of which Merkel hasn\u2019t divulged, has raised questions about whether her health is sound enough for her to serve the full term.\n\nWhile persistent tensions with the Social Democrats, Merkel\u2019s coalition partner, have led many to predict the government\u2019s collapse before year\u2019s end, the governing parties\u2019 poor poll numbers suggest they will hold on for as long as they can.\n\nThat\u2019s why Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s new position could prove to be more significant than may appear at first glance. Merkel is keen to avoid handing power to either Spahn or Merz, men with whom she has a long history of clashes.\n\nBolstered by her new status as minister, Kamp-Karrenbauer would be in pole position to take over as chancellor without a new election for the rest of the term \u2014 if the Bundestag approves her.\n\nIn other words, Merkel has all but guaranteed her ability to determine not just the timing of her exit, but her preferred successor as well.\n\nThe chancellor, who turned 65 on Wednesday, could hardly have hoped for a better birthday gift.\n\nCORRECTED: This article has been amended to clarify the circumstances under which Kramp-Karrenbauer could take over as chancellor.", "description": "First they took Brussels, then they took Berlin: German Frauenpower leaves the political class gobsmacked.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Joshua Posaner", "David M.
