(Photo: Robyn Beck, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nGone are the days when Jennifer Garner could pick out her kids' Halloween costumes.\n\nThe actress' little ones are not so little anymore, and the mom of three says as the years go by, the costume decision for each kid becomes tougher to manage.\n\n\"It definitely gets harder,\" Garner told Entertainment Tonight. \"I remember one year when I talked my girls into both dressing up as pigs and they were so cute. And now they would be like, 'No, mom, oh my gosh, no!' ... But they're gonna be cute, whatever they are.\"\n\nGarner, 47, shares kids Violet, 13, Seraphina, 10, and Samuel, 7, with ex-husband Ben Affleck. She also gushed to ET about all the things she loves about parenting.\n\n\"I think I have a lot more fun because I have kids and I think they're funny and smart and awesome,\" she said. \"Other than that, you have to maintain a sense of humor about yourself. You have to reach out and be a part of a community. You can't raise them by yourself. They change you wholly and completely and not at all. I'm lucky to have them.\"\n\nFans of Garner's shouldn't expect to see her kids' costumes posted on her Instagram account. The actress explained to InStyle in August she is dedicated to keeping her kids off her social media pages.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are times my kids would really love to see themselves reflected on my social media in a fun way and to have the attention they would get from that. But I\u2019ve fought too hard against it. It would feel hypocritical,\u201d she said.\n\nGarner has long advocated for paparazzi to leave celebrities' children alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so gnarly to be a kid now,\u201d Garner said. \u201cI guard my kids\u2019 privacy as much as I possibly can, and I\u2019ve never posted pictures of them on Instagram. I used to refuse to say their names during interviews \u2013 but everyone knows their names! I would just say \u2018my eldest,\u2019 which I still do out of habit a lot.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/03/halloween-jennifer-garners-kids-dont-want-her-costume-input-anymore/3849930002/", "description": "They grow up so fast.
