This is not in dispute. But now cities are pushing back and trying to get organized, banding together to form a new coalition to figure out what the hell to do with all these electric doohickeys littered across their streets.\n\nThe Open Mobility Foundation, which is what the coalition is called, already has a long list of goals: improving safety; making sure dockless vehicles are equitably distributed across cities; ensuring scooters aren\u2019t blocking the sidewalks or generally effecting the quality of life in cities; analyzing terabytes of data produced by scooters; and guaranteeing the privacy of scooter riders is protected. That last one is going to be a bit sticky, given the agency spearheading this new foundation is the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.\n\nIn case you don\u2019t remember, LADOT created a digital tool called the Mobility Data Specification (MDS), to help cities manage all the scooter and bike-share companies hitting their streets. It uses location data from scooters and bikes to inform transportation policy, such as where to place bike lanes, as well as enforcement actions, like which company\u2019s customers aren\u2019t following the rules of the road. Reportedly, the data would not be shared with police without a warrant, would not contain personal identifiers, and would not be subject to public records requests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a scooter, it\u2019s going to be a pod, it\u2019s going to be a jetpack\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, cities love MDS \u2014 it has since spread to 50 cities across the US and a dozen around the globe \u2014 but the scooter and bike companies weren\u2019t thrilled. Uber, which owns the dockless scooter and bike company Jump, said it would lead to \u201can unprecedented level of surveillance\u201d and vowed to stop it. (A state bill that would preempt cities from regulating micromobility companies, blocking the use of MDS, is currently being debated in the California state legislature.)\n\nMDS is the brainchild of Seleta Reynolds, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation\u2019s general manager. As more cities adopt MDS as a crucial tool in managing micromobility companies, the foundation can help create some consistency around its use \u2014 because today\u2019s scooters can quickly turn into tomorrow\u2019s something-else-entirely.\n\n\u201cThat business model, where on-demand mobility is available through your smartphone, the form factor is going to keep changing,\u201d Reynolds told The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a scooter, it\u2019s going to be a pod, it\u2019s going to be a jetpack, it\u2019s going to be whatever it\u2019s going to be... one of the core pieces of MDS is how do you build something that can work for whatever the next device is, whether it\u2019s something that moves on the ground or in the sky?\u201d\n\nAnd with huge tech companies lobbying governments to prevent cities from collecting these data points, she realized that \u201cformalizing the governance structure was important to protect it, because it is the seed right now. And we have a vision for where we think it could go.\u201d\n\nThe Open Mobility Foundation counts among its founding members Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami-Dade County, Minneapolis, New York City (both the Department of Transportation and the Taxi and Limousine Commission), Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Monica, Seattle, and Washington, DC. It is being co-founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, and will be advised by the NewCities Foundation.\n\nReynolds acknowledged that data collection and privacy will be a \u201cday-one work\u201d\n\nReynolds acknowledged that data collection and privacy will be a \u201cday-one work of the foundation and probably a forever work of the foundation.\u201d LADOT published its own privacy principles as it relates to its collection of scooter location data, and Reynolds says part of the foundation\u2019s efforts will be to hold scooter companies to those same principles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to collect the bare minimum amount of data that we need, we\u2019re going to apply aggregation and minimization techniques to it, we\u2019re not going to store it for longer than we need it,\u201d she said.\n\nCurrently, there are a patchwork of rules across the country related to management and operation of dockless scooter companies \u2014 and they seem to be changing every week. Nashville just announced that it was banning electric scooters after a man with twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system was killed while riding a scooter. Uber pulled its Jump bikes and scooters from San Antonio, Texas, recently after the city proposed changes that would cut its fleet in half. One of the last major holdouts, New York state, recently legalized electric scooters, but will allow cities to write their own rules for scooter companies to follow.\n\nAs cities get organized, the scooter companies may find themselves subject to more rules and more enforcement. That might be a drag, especially for those who believe that scooters can get more people out of cars and help solve the last mile challenge.\n\nReynolds sees MDS and the Open Mobility Foundation as an opportunity for cities to share best practices, but also hear from the micromobility companies about their concerns. It\u2019s important to get talking, she says, before the scooters all turn into jetpacks.", "description": "Scooter sharing caught cities flat-footed. This is not in dispute.
