European glass eels use their magnetic sense to 'imprint' a memory of the direction of water currents\n\nThe European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a migratory species that crosses the Atlantic Ocean twice during its life.\n\nAfter hatching in the Sargasso Sea near North America, eel larvae move more than 3,000 miles with the Gulf Stream until they reach the continental slope of Europe.\n\nThere, they turn into the post-larval transparent glass eel and continue the migration across the continental shelf to the coast.\n\nAfter reaching the coast, glass eels enter estuaries, where some of them continue their migration upstream into freshwater until later in life (up to 50 years) when, as silver eels, they navigate back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn and die.\n\n'Surprisingly, fish early life behaviour can be goal oriented.' said Claire Paris, professor of ocean sciences at the UM Rosenstiel School.\n\n'This study complements previous findings showing innate magnetic sense in glass eels and highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of larval behaviour. There is a lot we need to learn'.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Communications Biology.", "description": "Young glass eels use the Earth's magnetic field as a sixth sense to guide their migration course to and from the estuary where they were born and return to die, according to scientists in Norway.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent", "Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19890278-0-image-a-45_1571414658932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
