Top Democrats have said Trump violated his oath of office and abused his power to extort a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 presidential election on his behalf, and the allegations recently convinced Speaker Nancy Pelosi to formalize an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSchiff, Engel and Cummings cited Giuliani\u2019s recent acknowledgment that he asked the Ukrainian government to probe Biden and his son Hunter, demanding that Giuliani produce \u201ctext messages, phone records, and other communications\u201d that could reveal the involvement of senior Trump administration officials.\n\nThe three committees and their chairmen have been thrust to the forefront of the House\u2019s investigation into a whistleblower complaint centering on Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky. The issue has united the House Democratic Caucus in outrage, prompting nearly every Democrat to support the resulting impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe complaint, which was initially withheld from Congress at the Justice Department\u2019s behest, alleges that White House officials sought to \u201clock down\u201d information relating to Trump\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders on a highly classified server. It also states that officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d about Trump\u2019s conduct, which they believed could constitute evidence that he abused his power and his office.\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, deemed the complaint \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d Atkinson will brief members of the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors on Friday.\n\nLawmakers are also examining Trump\u2019s decision to freeze critical military aid to Ukraine around the same time as his phone call with Zelensky. Last week, the chairs of the House Budget and Appropriations committees demanded information from the White House as it seeks to establish a timeline for \u201cwhen, why, and how the president and [the Office of Management and Budget] withheld this funding.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s refusal to comply with the subpoena would \u201cconstitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,\u201d the three committee chairmen wrote in a letter to the former New York City mayor.\n\nHouse Democrats have narrowed the focus of their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal and the White House\u2019s longstanding resistance to congressional investigations.\n\nThe three committees are demanding that Giuliani turn over the information by Oct. 15. The panels also scheduled depositions with three of Giuliani\u2019s business associates: Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin.\n\nGiuliani, who has appeared on national television in recent days to defend himself and Trump, has represented the president throughout former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and its aftermath.\n\nA White House spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena to Giuliani.\n\nThe committees have been looking into the Ukraine allegations since June, but their probe has intensified after Giuliani suggested that he was in contact with senior Trump administration officials about an effort to probe Biden\u2019s role in the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor widely viewed as corrupt.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who came under fire from Giuliani and later returned to Washington, will sit for a deposition before the committees on Wednesday. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday. Volker, who resigned last week, is said to have facilitated some of Giuliani\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Committee subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week for documents related to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky and other records related to Giuliani\u2019s involvement. Those records are due by Friday.\n\nIn a statement to POLITICO, Giuliani said: \u201cI have received a Committee subpoena from three Committees of the House. It raises substantial constitutional and legal issues as well as attorney-client and other privileges. These and other issues must all be considered before a proper decision can be made.\u201d\n\nTrump has maintained that he did nothing wrong in his interactions with Zelensky. He and his allies have gone after Schiff in recent days as the longtime Trump antagonist takes on a prominent role in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said Schiff should be arrested for treason.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Schiff\u2019s exaggerated paraphrase of the president\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\nTrump told reporters later Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re trying to find out\u201d the identity of the whistleblower, even though he or she is entitled to anonymity under federal law. That suggestion has opened Trump up to allegations of witness intimidation.\n\nSenate Democrats on Monday called on Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to hold hearings with Attorney General William Barr and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, among others, to more fully investigate the whistleblower complaint.\n\nDarren Samuelsohn contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/80/d175eb53439881eed6808dd14be1/190930-rudy-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
