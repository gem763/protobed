The former Wales open-side and captain succeeded Mark Anscombe, father of New Zealand-born Wales fly-half Gareth, as head coach of the national side in 2017.

The 27-year-old captained Canada at the 2015 edition and will be once again looking to lead by example in Japan. Ardron signed for the Chiefs in 2018 to become Canada\u2019s first Super Rugby player to represent a New Zealand team, so will know what to expect when he goes up against his All Black teammates. He\u2019s arguably Canada\u2019s most talented and versatile forward, capable of covering the second and back row positions.\n\nPast record\n\nCanada\u2019s best finish at the Rugby World Cup came in 1991 when they reached the quarter-finals.\n\nFixtures\n\nThursday 26 September \u2013 Italy vs Canada (8:45am BST), Fukuoka\n\nWednesday 2 October \u2013 New Zealand vs Canada (11:15am), Oita\n\nTuesday 8 October \u2013 South Africa vs Canada (11:15am), Kobe\n\nSunday 13 October \u2013 Namibia vs Canada (4:15am), Kamaishi\n\nOdds\n\nCanada to win the World Cup: 5000/1", "description": "Canada\u00a0qualified as the 20th and final team for the Rugby World Cup after beating Hong Kong 27-10 in the last match of the repechage tournament in Marseille.
