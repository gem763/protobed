Love Cesar Romero in the \u201cBatman\u201d TV show? We give you Jack Nicholson. No one can top Jack? Here comes Heath Ledger. Heath wins an Oscar? Let\u2019s see Jared Leto. (That\u2019s when the streak stopped.)\n\nThis week, along comes yet another Joker, Joaquin Phoenix, in the bat-villain\u2019s self-titled movie, which earned the top prize at the Venice Film Festival and generally positive reviews, although there were a handful of harsh ones. In the era of ever-expanding superhero entertainment, it appears we\u2019ll have a new Joker for every generation. There will never be a last laugh.\n\nBehind the cruel jokes and creepy smiles, the Joker is and always will be pure evil, which makes it all the more fascinating that we sometimes cheer him on \u2014 or laugh ourselves. Perhaps the Joker\u2019s wildness helps balance out Batman\u2019s dark whispers.\n\nHere\u2019s where we rank each on-screen Joker. Send in the clowns.\n\n\n\nJared Leto in \"Suicide Squad.\" (AF Archive/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n8. Jared Leto, \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d (2016)\n\nWhatever memorable Joker performance Leto could have given was probably left on the cutting room floor. \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d went through extensive reshoots to lighten up its tone after the bad buzz of \u201cBatman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201d The result? Hardly any Joker at all. The Joker wasn\u2019t even the main villain in the final act.\n\nThe Joker should never be just a side character, which is why this version never clicked. Other than a few flashback scenes with Margot Robbie\u2019s Harley Quinn that felt like \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d and some Instagram-gangsta moments in the club (check out the chrome on that whip, and also the chrome in his grill), this Joker performance was as pointless as the \u201cDamaged\u201d tattoo they put on his face.\n\n\n\nZach Galifianakis voices the Joker in \"The Lego Batman Movie.\" (Warner Bros. Animation)\n\n7. Zach Galifianakis, \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie\u201d (2017)\n\nGalifianakis\u2019s gleeful, kid-friendly Joker was just as adorable as he was crazy \u2014 probably the least intimidating version you\u2019ll ever see on screen. His major hang-up? That he isn\u2019t the No. 1 villain in Batman\u2019s life, as evidenced by the movie \u201cBatman v Superman.\u201d As he hollered to Will Arnett\u2019s Lego Batman, \u201cSuperman\u2019s not a bad guy!\u201d\n\nThis Joker didn\u2019t make it to No. 1 on this list either, in part because he\u2019s the only one to be outshined by his on-screen Batman, who\u2019s much funnier.\n\nProbably the least intimidating and downright friendliest Joker you\u2019ll ever see on the screen (after all, his main hang-up is he just wants he and Batman to be bros, and this is a kids movie after all, there are toys to sell), Galifianakis\u2019s Joker didn\u2019t bask in the darkness so much as he brightened up Gotham City with explosions and glee.\n\n\n\nCameron Monaghan in \"Gotham\" Season 5. (PictureLux/Hollywood Archive/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n6. Cameron Monoghan, \u201cGotham\u201d (2014-2019)\n\nYou can say this about Cameron Monoghan: He sure had the grin down.\n\nIn Fox\u2019s \u201cGotham,\u201d the Joker in his purist form can\u2019t exist yet because it focuses on Bruce Wayne\u2019s adolescence. But Gotham treats us to \u201cJerome.\u201d He\u2019s got the face full of mischievous giddiness. The laugh is on point.\n\nStill, \u201cGotham\u201d gives us too many moments of is-he-the-Joker-or-isn\u2019t-he. Jerome has a twin brother, Jeremiah. And maybe he ends up being the Joker instead. Or maybe not. It\u2019s a worthy attempt at a fresh origin story, but it\u2019s frustrating to try to figure out.\n\n\n\nCesar Romero as the Joker in a surfing contest against Batman, played by Adam West. (Warner Bros.)\n\n5. Cesar Romero, \u201cBatman\u201d TV series (1966-1968)\n\nThe first live-action Joker arrived in this campy Adam West series, which allowed him to be one of the silliest on this list. He could escape a prison baseball match with an exploding baseball or challenge Batman to a surfing contest. (He put his swims trunks on over his full-length suit.)\n\n\u201cThis life at best is one long practical joke\u201d were the words of advice Romero\u2019s Joker gave someone before handing them an exploding cigar.\n\nBut nothing was funnier than Romero\u2019s refusal to shave off his mustache when applying his Joker makeup on set. All the powder in the world couldn\u2019t make Romero\u2019s lip look hairless (though it still looked better than the CGI mustache job done on Henry Cavill\u2019s Superman half a century later). He probably figured his smile-a-minute performances and devilish laugh were distraction enough from his disdain of shaving.\n\n\n\nJack Nicholson in \"Batman.\" (United Archives GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n4. Jack Nicholson, \u201cBatman\u201d (1989)\n\nTypically, so much of a Joker performance is the actor\u2019s transformation, but what makes Nicholson\u2019s turn so iconic is that it appeared he was just being himself. You almost got the feeling his Joker was still celebrating the Los Angeles Lakers back-to-back championships of the late \u201980s (his jacket was purple, after all).\n\nIt worked to perfection. Deadly gags were his game, from acid-spewing boutonnieres to buzzers that turned handshakes into a murder scene. Even during Michael Keaton\u2019s pop-culture moment as Batman, with a superhero suit ahead of its time and a monster of a Batmobile, Nicholson\u2019s Joker could look at all that and declare he just wasn\u2019t that impressed. His Joker refused to accept Gotham\u2019s fascination with Batman.\n\nNo Joker had better one-liners. (\u201cWait till they get a load of me.\u201d \u201cWhere does he get those wonderful toys?\u201d) Have you ever \u201cdanced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\u201d Neither has this Joker. But he sure loved saying that.\n\nWhen Bruce Wayne described the villain\u2019s alter ego, Jack Napier, as a \u201cmean kid\u201d and \u201cbad seed\u201d who \u201churt people,\u201d Nicholson\u2019s Joker responded with one of the film\u2019s funniest lines: \u201cI like him already.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoaquin Phoenix in \"Joker.\" (Warner Bros./DC Entertainment)\n\n3. Joaquin Phoenix, \u201cJoker\u201d (2019)\n\nNo movie featuring the Joker has ever given such an in-depth look at the man he was before he became a monster. It asks: Would anyone else go just as mad under the same circumstances Arthur Fleck had to endure?\n\nFleck is a failed professional clown and an even worse stand-up comedian, living a life beset by cruelty and misunderstanding. This Joker\u2019s uncontrollable laugh is attributed to an illness but also seems to be a reaction to the lack of love and human decency he\u2019s experienced his entire life. He knows he needs help. And he knows none is coming.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the Joker be lethal before, but never so gruesomely, thanks to an R rating. Phoenix\u2019s version is the hero and the villain, in a battle with himself, seeking a sick type of justice. His face always seems to be carrying the burden of mental and physical pain, even when he forces a smile. His slow-motion dances are the briefest moments of bliss, but they always precede carnage. Who knew a movie with a Joker and no Batman could work?\n\n[Review: Joaquin Phoenix is a vivid, operatic Joker, but the movie is way too full of itself]\n\n\n\nHeath Ledger in \"The Dark Knight.\" (AF Archive/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n2. Heath Ledger, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d (2008)\n\nNever had the Joker been more horrifying on screen. \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d was Ledger\u2019s playground from the opening bank-robbing scene. Gone was the chemically whitened face from the comics, replaced with raccoon black eyes and melting war paint. The big smile? Signified by the long, self-inflicted scars on his cheeks. Fans cried foul when the first online images arrived, but little did they know a legendary performance awaited.\n\nLedger\u2019s Joker basked in the psychological breakdown of his opponents, using questions as verbal jabs. \u201cWhy so serious?\u201d \u201cDo you wanna know how I got these scars?\u201d \u201cDo you want to know why I use a knife?\u201d The answer was never pleasant.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan kept his Joker alive at the end of \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d But Ledger\u2019s untimely death shortly before the film\u2019s release meant we\u2019d never get the rematch with Batman everyone wanted.\n\n\n\nMark Hamill voices the Joker in \"Batman: The Animated Series.\" (Warner Bros. Animation)\n\n1. Mark Hamill, \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d (1992-1995)\n\nFor all of Batman\u2019s live-action achievements, there is no greater love letter to his comic book mythos than this \u201990s classic TV show. And where were you when you learned that its Joker voice is none other than Luke Skywalker? If you think Bart Simpson sang \u201cjingle bells, Batman smells\u201d best, wait until you see Hamill\u2019s Joker do it, while climbing on top of a Christmas tree that turns into a rocket that propels him out of prison.\n\nHamill once said the Joker\u2019s laugh should be a musical instrument that illustrated his mood, which is probably why no one else could giggle better. Most on-screen Jokers are set on one emotion. Hamill\u2019s Joker had them all: angry, sad, scary and funny. (When a terrified onlooker says \u201cGreat Scott!\u201d he responds, \u201cActually, I\u2019m Irish.\u201d)\n\nHamill managed to create a villain who kept adults compelled even within the confines of a kids\u2019 series. And when he brought his character to the R-rated straight-to-home-video adaptation of the classic comic tale \u201cThe Killing Joke,\u201d he proved it could stand alongside Jokers with darker material.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget: Without this Joker, there\u2019s no Harley Quinn, who just happens to be one of the most exciting things DC\u2019s live-action movies have going for them at the moment.\n\nThe best Joker ever? As Quinn would put it, it\u2019s Mr. J.\n\nRead more:\n\nAll eight Spider-Man movies, ranked from worst to best\n\nIn the \u2018Birds of Prey\u2019 trailer, Harley Quinn is done with the Joker and assembles a whole new squad", "description": "As the new \"Joker\" movie comes out this week, here's how Phoenix compares to Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and the rest.", "authors": ["David Betancourt", "Reporter Focusing On Comic Book Culture", "October At Am", "David Betancourt Writes About All Aspects Of Comic Book Culture For The Washington Post'S Comic Riffs Blog."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3m2hpswwOb8iNB6Hcpku40wfO5U=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-02-2019/t_d481be529b364c8bb118e3b91f17ee99_name_Film_Review___Joker_62698_fafe9_scaled.jpg"}
