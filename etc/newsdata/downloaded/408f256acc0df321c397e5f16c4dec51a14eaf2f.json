It\u2019s not. Floral patterns on a dark background is not so much a fashion trend as a fashion takeover. It is a look that is absolutely everywhere \u2013 so much so, that you have probably stopped noticing it. It is in my wardrobe and \u2013 as a glance around the Guardian office confirms \u2013 in a whole lot of other wardrobes too. The formula is simple: flowers of any variety bloom against a dark-coloured background. Perhaps on a blouse, possibly a trousersuit or an evening gown, but most likely on a dress or a skirt.\n\nWithout much fuss or fanfare, dark floral has lodged itself into modern life. Like the Breton stripe a decade before it, it has become style shorthand for looking current. And for looking good, but not looking as if you thought about it too much. Alessandro Michele\u2019s super-maximalist aesthetic at Gucci has amped up the resting pulse rate of fashion, so you need a bit of print and colour for an outfit to feel really contemporary. On the other hand, the mood music of the #MeToo era doesn\u2019t lend itself to a bunting-and-cupcakes vibe, so viewing the traditional femininity of the floral print through a darker lens feels right. And as fashion moves towards a more sustainable, less fast-moving model, a print that is a bit summery (because, flowers) and at the same time autumnal in its colours also feels right for now.\n\nErdem Moralioglu has been making winter florals look super-chic for most of his career. For his autumn 2009 collection, he embroidered tiny, intensely coloured chrysanthemums and violets on to black dresses. Explaining how his colour scheme had taken a moody turn that season, he said at the time that the muse he had previously imagined \u201crunning free and romantic in the meadows\u201d had now \u201cvisited nightclubs and gone home on the bus\u201d. Ten years later, he is still into a moody bloom: this season\u2019s Reese dress, \u00a3520, has tightly furled peonies and sprigs of cherry blossom against a black background.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by women and all things that imply femininity,\u201d he says. \u201cFlowers are an extension of that \u2013 beautiful, complex, sometimes dangerous. I like the contrast of a delicate floral print on a dark base, with little secrets hidden in the artwork. There is something wonderful about things that can be both pretty and dark at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlasual\u201d \u2013 glamorous and casual \u2013 is the new smart-casual. Smart-casual looks a bit meh these days, while glasual fits the dressier, look-at-me vibe of the Instagram era. The winter floral is instantly, effortlessly glasual. It is ideal for day-to-night wear; where animal print can feel a bit too much of a stretch first thing in the morning, florals have a long history as daywear. Fast-forward to cocktail hour and the moody, jewels-on-black-velvet colour combination brings just enough edge.\n\nYou can wear a winter floral dress with tights and heels, or bare legs and trainers, or \u2013 this season\u2019s update \u2013 with knee-high boots. The high street is getting better and better at the winter floral dress, each season. If you want a steer, I\u2019d suggest the Francesca midi-length semi-wrap dress by Boden, \u00a398, with spriggy florals on either black or burgundy or Marks & Spencer\u2019s shirt-dress, \u00a355, with golden lilies and white daisies on navy. But winter florals wear well and don\u2019t date easily, so the one you bought three winters ago may well still be going strong.\n\nWhile summer florals exude pretty femininity, there is something more edgy and dramatic about winter florals Natasha Rusus Issacs\n\nThe dark floral dress is fashion with a little \u201cf\u201d rather than a big one, but it is also A Bit French. It started with London-based designers \u2013 Alexander McQueen, as well as Erdem \u2013 but is now all over Paris, too. It is on the catwalk at Christian Dior and Dries Van Noten, and all over the streets of Paris. Every chic Parisienne\u2019s current favourite haute high-street label, S\u00e9zane \u2013 tagline \u201cFrench everybody can speak\u201d \u2013 is selling a Penelope dress, \u00a3135, with tiny bright flowers on black.\n\n\u201cSmall flowers on a dark pattern is a timeless pattern,\u201d says brand founder Morgane S\u00e9zalory. \u201cIt is not a specific trend but something that really goes through the time. During fall and winter, it is always a staple to have in your wardrobe. The print works really well on a midi or long dress with a pair of boots.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michelle Obama, Janelle Monae and Anna Wintour.

Every Beulah sale \u2013 the Yahvi painterly forest rose dress, with digitally printed pink and green florals on dark silk, \u00a3550, for instance \u2013 creates employment opportunities for vulnerable and trafficked women around the world. Floral prints, Rufus Isaacs says, are just as popular in the winter months as they have traditionally been in the summer.\n\n\u201cWhile summer florals exude pretty femininity, there is something more edgy and dramatic about winter florals,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are also incredibly versatile \u2013 great to style with dark separates and knitwear and more subtle than a flirty summer print. I smarten mine up with an oversized coat and boots, or dress down with some trainers and wear in the office every day.\u201d\n\nThe dark floral is Anna Wintour at Wimbledon. It is Michelle Obama at a state dinner. It is Janelle Mon\u00e1e on the red carpet. It is the beauty of flowers as painted in oil by the Dutch masters, rather than in postcard watercolours. It is smart but not stuffy, womanly rather than girlish. Dark florals are not just a trend, because they show no sign of wilting. These are the flowers that never die.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
