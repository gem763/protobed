But we cannot afford to have a 'them or us' mentality. Humans and animals and their habitats fundamentally need to co-exist or within the next 10 years our problems across the globe will become even more unmanageable.\"\n\nImage copyright DOMINIC LIPINSKI / POOL Image caption The Duke of Sussex met with Malawi's President Peter Mutharika on Sunday\n\nPrince Harry added that \"Nature teaches us the importance of a circular system, one where nothing goes to waste and everything has a role to play.\n\n\"If we interfere with it, rather than work with it, the system will break down.\"\n\nIt is not the prince's first championing of the subject of conservation. In the September's edition of Vogue - edited by Meghan - the prince spoke about environmental issues and his love for nature.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Prince Harry was forced to defend his use of private jets after newspapers claimed he and the duchess flew privately four times in 11 days this summer.\n\nThe duke said \"no one is perfect\" when it comes to their environmental impact, but stressed he \"occasionally\" uses private jets to keep his family safe.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex calls on humanity to overcome \"greed, apathy and selfishness\" and protect nature.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F99E/production/_109020936_hi056820638.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
