Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, over his handling of the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a greater fraud on Congress. Shifty Schiff is Corrupt,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president\u2019s remark was made in response to a tweet from Rep. Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, who said that his motion to censure Mr. Schiff is slated to be considered Monday night.\n\n\u201cGo Andy!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201c#StopTheCoup,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a separate tweet Saturday morning. It was shared by other users, or retweeted, more than 20,000 times within five hours of being first posted by the president.\n\nDemocrats launched impeachment proceedings last month after the Trump administration tried to block Congress from seeing a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community. The White House later released a rough transcript of a July 25 telephone call that sparked the complaint, and it showed that Mr. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joseph R. Biden, Mr. Trump\u2019s potential challenger in the 2020 presidential race, while the U.S. withheld critical military aid from Kyiv.\n\nMr. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the inquiry, has come under fire from Mr. Trump and his defenders over how he characterized the phone call during a congressional hearing last month. Mr. Schiff had said that the transcript \u201creads like a classic organized crime shakedown\u201d prior to proceeding to paraphrase its contents.\n\nRepublicans led by Mr. Harris allege Mr. Schiff should be censured for his comments about the phone call, as well as for not disclosing that the whistleblower had contacted his committee\u2019s staff prior to filing the complaint with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.\n\nMr. Trump has attacked Mr. Schiff regularly over his interpretation of the phone call and has demanded his resignation and arrest for \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment. T\n\nhe California Democrat previously said that his reading of the transcript was meant to be a parody and that it \u201cwould be funny if it wasn\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s oath of office.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
