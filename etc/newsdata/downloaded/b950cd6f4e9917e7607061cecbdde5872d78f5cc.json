Francois was assigned to read the book in May, when he was in Grade 6. (CBC)\n\nAuthor Robert Souli\u00e8res says he's willing to change a passage in one of his books that led to a human rights complaint from a Gatineau, Que., father.\n\nGioberti Francois said his 12-year-old son was assigned Souli\u00e8res's mystery novel Un Cadavre de Classe, but wasn't given the right context to interpret a passage with a racial slur.\n\nFrancois has written to Quebec's human rights commission, saying the language in the book is racist and outdated.\n\nSouli\u00e8res told Radio-Canada Thursday it's the first complaint he's heard of since the book was published in 1997, but he understands the reaction.\n\nIn a French-language interview, the author said the tone of the book is humorous, and he didn't include the term to offend anyone.\n\n\"I don't see why this word should be banned from the dictionary and everyday speech, but I understand that it shocked someone,\" he said. \"I'm ready to apologize and change [that part].\"\n\nHe said that could happen within the next six to 12 months when the book is reprinted.\n\nCriticism remains\n\nFrancois said it's still a problem that the book is endorsed by the province's education ministry, however.\n\nMeanwhile, the president of Ottawa cultural organization Mosa\u00efque interculturelle said it's risky to introduce such complex themes in books that are set in the recent past because that could confuse young people.\n\nNicole Baptiste said books set in historical times are easier for children to understand in their proper context.\n\nBaptists said it's time the book to be removed from schools.", "description": "Author Robert Souli\u00e8res says he's willing to change a passage in one of his books that led to\u00a0a human rights complaint from a Gatineau, Que., father.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332581.1571861444!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/quincy-francois.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
