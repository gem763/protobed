Granted, it wasn\u2019t hard to do when the event was sponsored by gun control groups Giffords and March for Our Lives and the table dealer was a left wing cable news network that didn\u2019t even gamble their own ratings by putting it on their network. They live-streamed on the web instead.\n\nIf you missed it, I don\u2019t blame you. Still, there\u2019s some big election-year ideas they\u2019re betting on.\n\nBans\n\nThe field split on outright confiscation. They must have noticed that U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) isn\u2019t at the table anymore after he championed the idea. Former Congressman Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke continued to double down, offering up a poll that says the majority of Americans support a \u201cmandatory buyback\u201d (read: confiscation). I\u2019ll take action on the bet they didn\u2019t ask the more than 16 million modern sporting rifles owned by law-abiding Americans. Those are the semiautomatic AR-15 rifles they vilify, different from the rifle employed by the military. O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t the only one betting on this. U.S. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) want in too.\n\nEvery Democratic candidate believes banning an entire class of firearms \u2013 the modern sporting rifle \u2013 is a winning hand. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D-Ind.) told reporters following the event that labeling the semiautomatic rifle as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d \u2013 which is different from the military M-16 and M-4 \u2013 isn\u2019t misleading. Buttigieg said he supports banning the sale of \u201cassault weapons, like what I carried in Afghanistan.\u201d Don\u2019t bet on black on this one, Mayor Pete. They\u2019re different firearms.\n\nRegister\n\nCandidates offered differing plans to regulate ownership. Former Vice President Joe Biden let it roll on his recently released gun control plan that forces AR-15 owners to sell their rifles to the government or register them under the National Firearms Act, which would require registration, tax stamps, fingerprints and a government tracking for every modern sporting rifle. But wait, there\u2019s more. Biden wants to include magazines too.\n\nOther candidates support a licensing ploy. Call it pay-to-play. Sen. Booker said licenses for guns should be required, just as licenses are for cars, without clarifying bearing arms is a right. Vice President Biden liked the odds, but played the spread on that, saying states should require licenses. Mayor Pete said hunters buy hunting licenses. Gun licenses, then, should follow. Andrew Yang wants to license the \u201cdestructive capability,\u201d meaning you should pay more and qualify more based on how he\u2019d classify the lethality of a firearm.\n\nLimit\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) suggests the way to stop crime (she\u2019s betting she can do that by 80 percent) is by limiting firearms sales to just one per month. It\u2019s an idea that she said would keep \u201cpeople from bulking up in the middle of a crisis.\u201d By that notion buying one gun would be a warning flag. Just like putting a bet down on the table marks someone as a gambling addict.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wants to limit magazine sizes instead. \u201cI think the public is very open to this,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s one of the measures that passes her \u201cUncle Dick\u201d test: \u201cDoes this hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand?\u201d Of course\u2026 deer-stand Dick certainly thinks limiting the ability to defend yourself is a great idea.\n\nBust\n\nA popular wild card of the night was betting big on making the firearms industry pay. Former Congressman Julian Castro (D-Texas) threw down on raising the excise tax for ammunition manufacturers to 20 percent. But that\u2019s not all. He\u2019d also require the technologically-impossible microstamping. \u201cWe talk a lot about guns, but what we do with ammunition, just physically and also the way we tax it, is also part of the solution.\u201d Sen. Warren liked that idea, but anted up to 30 percent.\n\nBiden thought the smart money was on so-called \u201csmart guns.\u201d He said he\u2019d require user-authorized technology on all firearms, but didn\u2019t explain if that included those used by law enforcement and the military. He believes repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is a lock. Yang liked that line and got in on it too. But he took some side action on fining manufacturers up to $10 million for the crimes committed by individuals. \u201cIdeally, you\u2019d have the gun companies themselves pay a fine any time their product is used to kill an American,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that when it comes to gambling, a weak player is called \u201ca donkey.\u201d\n\nLawrence Keane is the Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs and General Counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association.", "description": "Democratic candidates gathered in Sin City and went all in .10/04/2019 3:40:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Lawrence Keane", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/0abc00fc-5bc4-4015-b085-24cbbc95f75f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
