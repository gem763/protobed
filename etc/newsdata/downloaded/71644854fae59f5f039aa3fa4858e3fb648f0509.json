The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the \u201ccriminal\u201d part.\"\n\nInstead of attending the forum, Harris said Friday she would \u201chost students from all campuses, as well as the broader Columbia community to come and discuss this critical issue that I\u2019ve worked on for my entire career.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the only candidate who attended an HBCU, I know the importance that these spaces hold for young Black Americans,\u201d Harris said in a statement Friday. \u201cToday, when it became clear Donald Trump would receive an award after decades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people\u2019s lives at risk, and then learned all but ten Benedict students are excluded from participating, I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record.\u201d\n\nTAMMY BRUCE SLAMS HILLARY CLINTON FOR HER COMMENTS AT ELIJAH CUMMINGS' FUNERAL\n\nHarris was among 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls expected to attend the forum.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a lawless President,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cNot only does he circumvent the laws of our country and the principles of our Constitution, but there is nothing in his career that is about justice, for justice, or in celebration of justice.\u201d\n\nHarris, though, supported the First Step legislation, which received bipartisan support.\n\nLater Saturday, Harris hit back on Twitter: \"My whole life I've fought for justice and for the people \u2014 something you'd know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the \u201ccriminal\u201d part.\"\n\nThe senator has come under fire for her own record on criminal justice reform. Her campaign has consistently touted the progressive aspects of her career as district attorney and later attorney general of California, which include introducing a proposal for nationwide bail reform, as well as legalizing marijuana, which is a part of her comprehensive criminal justice reform agenda if she is elected president in 2020.\n\nAs of mid-week, polls showed Harris behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, by nearly 22 points, drawing only 5.3 percent support, according to RealClear Politics.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA recent Fox News poll also showed Harris with 5 percent support in the race.\n\nFox News\u2019 Vandana Rambaran contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump took a rare swipe at 2020 Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris on Saturday, criticizing the California senator for boycotting a South Carolina criminal justice forum in protest of the group giving an award to him.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
