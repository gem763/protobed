Similarly, the Trudeau government helped to fund up to 1000 green energy projects across Canada, many of which will not be operational before 2022 or 2023 but will contribute to emissions reductions.\n\nAs things stand, however, even the most optimistic outlook relies on what the government calls \"emerging and future\" reductions \u2014 in other words, policies and technologies that don't yet exist.\n\nKathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that until more details emerge on the policies a re-elected Liberal government might pursue, Trudeau's claim that we are on track to meet our 2030 goal is \"misleading.\"\n\n\"The Liberals haven't put meat on the bones yet. They haven't told us, specifically, what are those measures and what are the reductions that will be accomplished by them,\" said Harrison, who is also a chemical engineer.\n\nNet-zero pledge\n\nHarrison said she was somewhat surprised when, on Tuesday, the Liberal campaign said that it would commit Canada to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The announcement came a day after the United Nations climate summit, where more than 65 other countries made the same pledge.\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the net-zero commitment is needed to reach the aspirational goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent catastrophic environmental consequences.\n\nIt is an ambitious target and it's not yet clear how any country could get there \u2014 because it has never been done before.\n\nWhen pressed for specifics on what a re-elected Liberal government would do, Liberal candidate and Trudeau environment minister Catherine McKenna punted.\n\n\"Do we have all the details? No,\" McKenna said at the announcement. \"We're going to figure this out, but the first thing we need to do is we need to get through this election.\"\n\nShe also listed off a host of policies the Trudeau government implemented during its mandate, including the pan-Canadian framework on climate change that includes a price on carbon \u2014 considered by many economists to be the most effective way to curb emissions.\n\nHarrison said that a commitment to net-zero emissions is laudable but it's \"a bit cynical\" for the pledge to come in the middle of an election campaign.\n\n\"Especially for a government that doesn't have a concrete plan in place to meet its 10-year target,\" she said.\n\nVerdict: Misleading\n\nSources: Canada's Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollutants Emissions Projections, 2018, Environment and Climate Change Canada; Canada sets carbon emissions reduction target of 30% by 2030, CBC News; Progress towards Canada's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, Environment and Climate Change Canada; Summary for Policymakers of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C approved by governments, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Closing the gap: carbon pricing for the Paris target (Revised June 20, 2019), Parlimentary Budget Officer; Climate Action Tracker; UN report on global warming carries life-or-death warning, CBC News", "description": "There is still time for Canada to meet its Paris Agreement commitment, but it would require ramped-up climate change policies.", "authors": ["Senior Writer", "Lucas Powers Is A Toronto-Based Reporter", "Writer.
