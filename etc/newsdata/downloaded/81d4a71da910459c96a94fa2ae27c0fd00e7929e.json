Grewal was appointed in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy (D).\n\nThe letter gives few details about the alleged misconduct by Trump\u2019s course. The man who the club is accused of overserving \u2014 Andrew G. Halder \u2014 caused a wreck that killed his own father and last year pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s company was given 30 days to challenge the planned revocation. If the state\u2019s Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control does decide to revoke the license, Trump can challenge that decision in court or try to get it reinstated in two years.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nIf the club\u2019s liquor license is revoked, that would be a blow for the Colts Neck course, near the Jersey Shore. The club could lose significant revenue from the two restaurants and a bar it operates for members, and find it hard to attract banquets or golf tournaments from outsiders.\n\nBut for Trump, the potential damage is greater than that.\n\nAD\n\nUnder New Jersey law, anyone who has one liquor license revoked must also give up all their other liquor licenses for two years. Trump has two other New Jersey golf clubs, including one in Bedminster that he uses as a summer White House.\n\nAD\n\nNow, he could be faced with losing a key source of revenue at those clubs, too.\n\nThe letter sent to the Trump course says this punishment is related to the club\u2019s actions on Aug. 30, 2015.\n\nOn that day, the letter says, the Trump club violated the terms of its license by serving Halder when he already appeared intoxicated. It also says the club violated its license by selling alcoholic drinks other than beer on carts roaming the golf course itself.\n\nAD\n\nThe state\u2019s letter does not give more details about that day. But it says that the Trump club\u2019s actions included \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d that justified more than the usual punishment.\n\nFor these violations , the state said, normal punishment would be a 25-day suspension of the liquor license. But \u201cin this case, the [state] will seek revocation of the license based upon the total circumstances,\u201d says the letter, which was signed by a deputy state attorney general, Andrew R. Sapolnick.\n\nAD\n\nThe ability to sell alcohol is crucial for any golf course, because it allows owners to draw extra revenue from members and to book banquets for outside guests, said Jay Karen, CEO of the National Golf Course Owners Association. Karen said golf courses typically have low profit margins, and alcohol sales present a rare chance for high markups.\n\nAD\n\nKaren said it would be difficult for most courses to survive financially if they could not sell alcohol.\n\n\u201cCould it be done? Sure. In theory, yes. But it would be really, really hard,\u201d Karen said. If a license was revoked, he said, \u201cI think the word would get out, and people would look elsewhere to play.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey prosecutors said Halder flipped his car about 3 p.m. that day, on a highway ramp about four miles from the Trump course.\n\nThe car rolled, and Halder\u2019s father, Gary \u2014 a passenger in the car \u2014 was thrown from the wreck. Gary Halder later died at a hospital, according to news reports.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, police said Andrew Halder had come from playing a round of golf, and that his blood alcohol was above the legal limit. Online court records show that Halder, now 39, pleaded guilty in early 2018 to vehicular homicide. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation.\n\nHalder\u2019s attorney, Robert Honecker, declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nTrump bought the Colts Neck golf club in August 2008 for $28 million, taking out an $18 million loan from New Jersey-based Amboy Bank that he is still paying off. In 2018, the club saw its revenue decline about 5 percent, according to Trump\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosures.\n\nAD", "description": "The Colts Neck course could lose revenue, and Trump\u2019s company could lose liquor licenses at its other N.J. courses.", "authors": ["David A.
