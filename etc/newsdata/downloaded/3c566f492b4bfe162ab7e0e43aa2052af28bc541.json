The men-- who come from a community which largely shuns alcohol and modern technology-- bailed out of the buggy so fast that the horse continued pulling the empty coach down the road.\n\nWILD 411-POUND FERAL HOG WRANGLED ON TEXAS GOLF COURSE, PICTURES SHOW\n\n\"I`ve never operated an Amish buggy with a horse, but I`m told that the horse will know the way home regardless of [whether] the operator is awake or even in the buggy, and that horse went a little further down the road and onto an oil/gas well road and stopped,\" Trumbull County Chief Deputy Joe Dragovich told Fox 8.\n\nDeputies then towed the buggy and found someone to take care of the horse until the owners come forward.\n\nUTAH INTRUDER ALLEGEDLY BROKE INTO WOMAN'S HOME, STARED AT HER WHILE SHE SLEPT: REPORT\n\nIn a rite of passage known as Rumspringa, young members of the Amish community are allowed to experiment with the influences of the outside world, but DUI laws still apply. \"Unfortunately, they`re not licensed as far as the buggy goes, but it is a vehicle, it`s on the roadway and the OVI laws do apply. You`re not allowed to drink and drive or operate a buggy,\" Dragovich said.\n\nOnce authorities identify the two men, they could be charged with failure to comply with the deputy's commands.\n\n\u201cMaybe there`s just that fear of the consequences and that would be a reality check for them, that there are consequences, but I encourage them to come forward and get their buggy and horse,\" said Dragovich.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Amish are a Christian community known for simple living and plain dress.
