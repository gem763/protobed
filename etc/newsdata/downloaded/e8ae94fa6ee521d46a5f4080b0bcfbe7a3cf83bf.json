REUTERS/Luc Gnago\n\nHarvesting started early for the October-to-March main crop, and farmers expect it to be larger than last year\u2019s.\n\nBut a lack of sunshine and rainfall up to four times higher than average could cause high moisture content in the first beans, increasing the risk of mould. Diseases have started spreading but not yet reaching worrying levels, farmers said.\n\nAs a result, farmers in the western region of Duekoue say they might not be able to wait until the market season opens in October to sell their beans at higher prices.\n\n\u201cWe have a few beans. With this weather, it will be hard ... to store them and keep them in good shape until the marketing season starts,\u201d said Ali Diomande, who farms near Duekoue.\n\n\u201cIf the sun comes out a lot, we will suffer fewer losses and the main crop will be abundant,\u201d he added, echoing a sentiment expressed by farmers across the country.\n\nData collected by Reuters showed rainfall in the western region of Man, was 76 millimetres (mm) last week, 37.1 mm above the five-year average.\n\nIn the southern region of Divo, rainfall was at 62.8 mm last week, 46.7 mm above the average. Rains were also above average in the southern region of Agboville and in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro.\n\nIn the centre-western region of Daloa, which produces a quarter of national output, farmers said black pod disease was spreading.\n\n\u201cThe rains happened too close to one another. There are risks of flooding because the water in the rivers is rising,\u201d said Albert N\u2019Zue, who farms near Daloa.\n\n\u201cBlack pod disease is not disastrous yet. There was a lot of sun yesterday and this morning. This could help,\u201d he added.\n\nData collected by Reuters showed 71.9 mm of rainfall last week in Daloa, 43.4 mm above the five-year average.\n\nIn the western region of Soubre, at the heart of the cocoa belt, farmers said they had noticed no serious damage in plantations.\n\nData collected by Reuters showed rainfall in Soubre, which includes the regions of San Pedro and Sassandra, was 61.4 mm last week, 46.1 mm above the five-year average.\n\nAverage temperatures ranged from 23.8 to 25.7 degrees Celsius, data showed.", "description": "Heavy rain in Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions threatens to compromise bean quality, raising fears of flooding and crop disease, farmers said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425440266&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811AS-OZATP"}
