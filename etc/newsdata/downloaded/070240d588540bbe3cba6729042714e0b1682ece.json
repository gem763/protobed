Get Me Out of Here! (2002-)\n\nCrocodile penis eating in the outback with Ant and Dec didn\u2019t exactly sound appealing, but this long-running reality series pushed the genre to entertaining new heights.\n\n99\n\nLife on Mars (2006-07)\n\nThe Beeb\u2019s Bowie-referencing, time-travelling cop show invigorated the genre \u2013 and introduced one of the great British TV characters in the form of the swaggering, sweary Gene Hunt.\n\n98\n\nThe Mighty Boosh (2004-07)\n\nSome loathed its quirky outlook, but there was no disputing the imagination of Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt\u2019s sticky-back-plastic comedy, full of memorable grotesques and endlessly quotable skits.\n\n97\n\nThe Shadow Line (2011)\n\nContaining next-to-no hand-holding, Hugo Blick\u2019s sprawling drama plunged you into a world of crime and corruption as Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Eccleston investigated the same murder from different sides of the detective/criminal divide.\n\n96\n\nBroad City (2014-19)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yassss kweens ... Broad City.

Yass kweens!\n\n95\n\nThe Trip (2010-)\n\nSteve Coogan and Rob Brydon somehow convinced first the BBC, then Sky, to let them dine in Europe\u2019s best restaurants while doing Michael Caine impressions. Even more amazingly, that vanity project became one of the funniest shows of this decade.\n\n94\n\nSkins (2007-13)\n\nEuphoria may be the teen show of the moment, but a decade before it this drama was pushing boundaries for adolescent behaviour on TV. Yet crucially \u2013 and unlike so many shows of its ilk \u2013 it never talked down to the audience it depicted.\n\n93\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race (2009-)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Serving realness ...

Blood. Blood! And bits of sick.\u201d The dictionary definition of cult viewing, Matthew Holness\u2019s spoof of shonky British horror barely made a dent when it aired, but has since become regarded as a modern classic.\n\n91\n\nSilicon Valley (2014-)\n\nMike Judge\u2019s genius comedy about the travails of a motley gang of developers mercilessly sends up the world of tech bros \u2026 and yet everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to Google founder Sergey Brin are superfans.\n\n90\n\n24 (2001-10)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In thrilling real-time ... 24.

Fresh Meat.

The answer soon became clear with this brilliantly executed reality show, which introduced viewers to a host of hilarious, not to mention surprisingly TV-literate, families.\n\n84\n\nLooking (2014-16)\n\nAndrew Haigh\u2019s cruise through the San Francisco gay scene skipped the LGBT lesson-learning in favour of a thrillingly human relationship drama.\n\n83\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)\n\nA ropey B-movie was reimagined as a brilliant subversion of fantasy tropes in Joss Whedon\u2019s beloved series, which introduced the world to a feminist pop icon in Sarah Michelle Gellar\u2019s teen slayer.\n\n82\n\nStrictly Come Dancing (2004-)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Glitterati ... Strictly Come Dancing. Photograph: BBC/Guy Levy\n\nThe celebrity ballroom dance competition that quickstepped on to our screens in 2004 and has made our lives more fab-u-lous by the year. Glitterati, assemble!\n\n81\n\nGavin and Stacey (2007-10)\n\nThe well lush Anglo-Welsh sitcom about Gav\u2019n\u2019Stace, Nessa and Smithy that became a BBC phenomenon then propelled James Corden to global stardom. Catch up with them again in a special this Christmas. Bang tidy.\n\n80\n\nVeep (2012-19)\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus served as perfectly shambolic fictional foil to the real-life disaster that is US politics, in a Stateside companion piece to The Thick of It.\n\n79\n\nHalt and Catch Fire (2014-17)\n\nThe thrilling 80s computer-whiz drama that landed in the Mad Men slot on AMC, but never got the fanbase it deserved.\n\n78\n\nFreaks and Geeks (1999-2000)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Impeccable ...

As Thorpe would say, \u201ca very heaven\u201d.\n\n75\n\nIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005-)\n\nInarguably the most gleefully offensive show on this list, the sitcom about the despicable owners of a Philly dive bar is also one of the most consistent: each of its 13 seasons features a truckload of laugh-out-loud moments.\n\n74\n\nThe Inbetweeners (2008-10)\n\nThe show that launched a thousand cries of \u201cooh friends\u201d remains one of the most enjoyable sitcoms of the past decade, with its relatable tale of four suburban normies negotiating sixth form.\n\n73\n\nSpiral (2005-)\n\nFrequently compared to The Wire, this French crime saga offered a forensic view of France\u2019s justice system, albeit with enough twists and turns to keep fans totally hooked.\n\n72\n\nPlanet Earth (2006 and 2016)\n\nGroundbreaking doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this globe-straddling documentary epic, which for the first time showed the world\u2019s wildlife in gleaming HD. A decade later, with death-defying iguanas, its sequel wowed us all over again.\n\n71\n\nLost (2004-10)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bonkers ... Lost.

Paul Abbott\u2019s drama might have dragged on a little too long but at its best it provided a refreshing burst of authentically working-class TV comedy-drama.\n\n69\n\nThe Good Place (2016-)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A heavenly sitcom ... The Good Place. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nAnother heavenly sitcom from Mike Schur (The US Office, Parks and Recreation), this series about a miscreant mistakenly sent to a paradisiacal afterlife managed to combine philosophical questions, jaw-dropping twists and a deluge of gags.\n\n68\n\nBand of Brothers (2001)\n\nSteven Spielberg\u2019s supersized second world war epic expanded the horizons \u2013 and budgets \u2013 of prestige TV.\n\n67\n\nBorgen (2010-13)\n\nProof that Scandinavian drama doesn\u2019t have to be about glowering detectives, this Danish political saga followed glowering politicians instead. Still, it was never less than engrossing and boasted a fascinating figure in glass ceiling-battering prime minister Birgitte Nyborg.\n\n66\n\nInside No 9 (2014-)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fantastically inventive ... Inside No 9. Photograph: BBC/Sophie Mutevelian\n\nReece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton\u2019s anthology series continues to amaze, each episode delivering a dizzyingly inventive horror-comedy one-off. Everyone has their favourite, but the Sheridan Smith-starring 12 Days of Christine might just be the show\u2019s masterpiece.\n\n65\n\nFlight of the Conchords (2007-09)\n\nA true TV original, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement\u2019s musical comedy about a hopeless New Zealand band floundering in NYC combined stoner comedy and inescapably earwormy songs to utterly charming effect.\n\n64\n\nSix Feet Under (2001-05)\n\nAlan Ball\u2019s profound drama about the Fisher family and their funeral home was gloriously moving and unnerving, and made us tackle our own mortality head-on.\n\n63\n\nShow Me a Hero (2015)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Masterful ... Winona Ryder in Show Me a Hero. Photograph: Paul Schiraldi/HBO\n\nDavid Simon was on typically masterful form in this epic about the housing crisis in 80s Yonkers that was tragically underwatched.\n\n62\n\nSuccession (2018-)\n\nThe newest show on our list, Jesse Armstrong\u2019s comedy-drama about a dysfunctional media dynasty already feels like a modern classic, full of magnificently malignant characters and devastating one-liners.\n\n61\n\nState of Play (2003)\n\nFar better than the glossy film adaptation that followed it, Paul Abbott\u2019s taut, twisty corruption drama felt like the perfect political thriller for the New Labour age. And no, we didn\u2019t just like it because the heroes were journos!\n\n60\n\nSherlock (2010-)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pure event television ... Sherlock. Photograph: BBC/Hartswood Films/Robert Viglasky\n\nThe Baker Street reboot that made us all step inside Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s mind palace. At its best, few shows could match it in terms of pure event television.\n\n59\n\nWolf Hall (2015)\n\nMark Rylance cemented his status as one of the greatest living actors with this performance as Thomas Cromwell in a sumptuous prestige TV take on Hilary Mantel\u2019s historical doorstop.\n\n58\n\nOrange Is the New Black (2013-19)\n\nJenji Kohan revolutionised television for ever with her gripping women\u2019s prison drama about Piper, Poussey, Taystee and the Litchfield Penitentiary inmates.\n\n57\n\nSex and the City (1998-2004)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cosmos all round! ... Sex and the City. Photograph: HBO\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dating a guy with the funkiest tasting spunk.\u201d Faced so recently with the movie SATC2: Calamity in Abu Dhabi, it can be easy to forget just how hilarious and refreshingly candid Samantha, Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte were when they first graced our screens.\n\n56\n\nThe Jinx (2015)\n\nThe best of the glut of prestige true-crime programmes that have emerged in recent years, this forensic docuseries about Robert Durst, the estate heir accused of murder, featured one of the most jaw-dropping final moments of TV ever.\n\n55\n\nUtopia (2014)\n\nSix years on, we\u2019re still wincing at the thought of that eyeball scene, but Dennis Kelly\u2019s conspiracy thriller about an apocalypse-predicting graphic novel was more than just ultraviolence: gorgeously shot and endlessly beguiling, it remains like nothing else on TV.\n\n54\n\nParks and Recreation (2009-15)\n\nTwenty minutes a week of pure optimism, this Amy Poehler-starring sitcom about a fizzingly enthusiastic civil servant somehow did the miraculous: it made local government seem fun.\n\n53\n\nBlack Books (2000-04)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Delightfully silly ... Black Books. Photograph: Channel 4\n\nNo contest in the award for the most misanthropic character of the century: Dylan Moran wins hands down for his bile-flecked bookshop owner Bernard Black in this delightfully silly sitcom.\n\n52\n\nThe Good Fight (2017-)\n\nLike its predecessor The Good Wife but dialled up to 11, this is the most daring legal drama of them all \u2013 with gobsmacking plots about #MeToo monsters, Donald\u2019s pee-pee tape and Melania\u2019s bid to get a stealthy divorce.\n\n51\n\nPatrick Melrose (2018)\n\nAn extraordinary self-flagellating performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as a drug-dependent aristocrat anchored this superb adaptation of Edward St Aubyn\u2019s semi-autobiographical novels. Surely the finest portrayal of addiction ever seen on TV.\n\n50\n\nDownton Abbey (2010-15)\n\nThis was TV drama as comfort blanket: at a time of austerity, Julian Fellowes\u2019s country house epic offered elegantly realised solace in the homilies of the past. If the plotting felt formulaic, the performances were entirely convincing \u2013 from Maggie Smith\u2019s dowager countess Violet Crawley to Jim Carter\u2019s impossibly decorous butler Carson, everyone knew their place.

Photograph: HBO\n\nIssa Rae started her acting career with a web series called The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl. While popular, Rae was able to have her seat at the table for real with Insecure. A show about black female friendship and relationships that isn\u2019t filtered through a white gaze and doesn\u2019t play into tired stereotypes, this HBO series refuses to compromise on authenticity, and, despite changing viewing habits, has proved one of the biggest web-to-screen hits to date. HJD\n\nRead the review.\n\n48\n\nBetter Call Saul (2015-)\n\nThe Breaking Bad prequel, centred on a ducking, diving lawyer called Jimmy McGill who will one day become Saul Goodman, is an entirely different drama \u2013 albeit exploring the same theme of what actions people are willing to take when their American dreams refuse to come true. A supremely measured character piece that has steadily improved as its central tragedy has materialised.

Photograph: Channel 4\n\nIn 2005, Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris\u2019s twatcom seemed oddly dated \u2013 a satire of a cultural moment that had already passed. But time has rendered it deeply prescient: Barley occupied a perfectly sealed echo chamber of self-conscious idiocy, and he self-branded furiously, long before social media came for our souls. Before there were hipsters, Nathan and his fellow self-facilitating media nodes were already keeping it Mencap. PH\n\nRead the review.\n\n46\n\nDoctor Who (2005-)\n\nThe revitalised Doctor Who occupies its rightful position in the TV firmament: rarely the best show in any week or year but always there, always changing, always offering fodder for analysis, arguments and lists. Jodie Whittaker\u2019s arrival as the first female Tardis-jockey maintained the show\u2019s record of refreshing itself just when its relevance threatens to wane \u2013 and with so much goodwill behind it, its standout episodes are still a celebratory shared experience. JS\n\nRead the review.\n\n45\n\nThe Bridge (2011-18)\n\nNone more noir but containing flashes of unexpected humour, this was one of the more impressive of the bleak dramas that flooded out of Scandinavia. The bridge of the title was the \u00d8resund, which connected Sweden and Denmark and led to multinational cooperation on a murder enquiry. Step forward ill-matched cops Martin Rohde and more interestingly Saga Nor\u00e9n, a brilliant but bizarre investigator unlike any maverick TV detective ever seen.

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/AP\n\nFiligree telly, with every painstakingly staged scene a plush indulgence \u2013 but Netflix\u2019s more-or-less true story of the British royal family has enough grit to make it more than just a luxury. Claire Foy\u2019s steely Elizabeth II introduced a fine study of people unsure how to live lives made extraordinary by huge privilege and indistinct power. JS\n\nRead the review.\n\n43\n\nThe Americans (2013-18)\n\nTerminally overlooked in favour of flashier, flimsier fare, Joe Weisberg\u2019s tale of suburban subterfuge rewarded the few who did tune in with six seasons of gorgeous, slow-burning drama. Real-life husband and wife Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell convinced as a pair of Russian spies playing house in picket-fence 80s America, struggling with notions of loyalty, fidelity and family. The show\u2019s finale, which shifts between toe-curling tension and devastating poignancy, should be regarded as one for the ages.

Photograph: Allstar/Comedy Central/Sportsphoto\n\nA starburst of fantastically inventive offence, Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s crude animation combined grotesque hilarity with a deceptively serious purpose. South Park was both a gleeful dismantling of the American dream and a laser-guided exploration of the tender spots where freedom of speech and liberal sensitivities collide. As such, it has proved surprisingly prescient; many of America\u2019s current cultural fault lines first became apparent here. PH\n\nRead the review.\n\n41\n\nFriday Night Lights (2006-11)\n\nA tender, truthful look at the beating heart of small-town America, shone through the prism of one of its most engrained institutions: high school football. It had us all rooting for the Dillon Panthers, for Coach Taylor and Tami Taylor, quarterback Matt Saracen, cocky running back Smash Williams, badboy fullback Tim Riggins, endlessly lovable nerd Landry Clarke and Tyra Collette, the town\u2019s only anti-football fanatic. We followed them for every triumph and every touchdown, all the while screaming at our screens: \u201cClear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose.\u201d KA\n\n40\n\nThe Power of Nightmares (2004)\n\nArriving in 2004, when US president George W Bush was becoming almost as much of a concern as Al-Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden, Adam Curtis\u2019s startling documentary series explored the shockingly congruent aims of fundamentalist Islam and American neo-conservatism. Equally striking was Curtis\u2019s trademark style, all logical provocations and uncanny juxtapositions; it\u2019s historical documentary as polemical art installation. PH\n\nRead more here.\n\n39\n\nThe Good Wife (2009-16)\n\nThe audacious legal drama took on a ripped-from-the-headlines case every week, tackling everything from fake news to election tampering, police racism and the terrors of surveillance culture. It responded so staggeringly fast to events that it sometimes felt too real. But it was also a rare drama that focused on women \u2013 rounded, complex, great, flawed, wonderful women \u2013 from the eponymous Alicia Florrick, who moved so far beyond the pained good wife of the opening episode, standing by her man through a humiliating sex scandal, to Diane Lockhart, the barnstorming firebrand in fabulous jewellery (one of the most glorious characters of the century). An exciting, exhilarating slap in the face to the very end. KA\n\nRead the review.\n\n38\n\nDetectorists (2014-17)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Profound ... Detectorists. Photograph: BBC/Channel X/Chris Harris\n\nWhat initially appeared to be a charming muse on the lives of two eccentric metal-detecting hobbyists soon revealed itself to be something more profound. Mackenzie Crook\u2019s labour of love was very funny, but it became ever more moving and thought-provoking. It was underpinned by a deep but open-minded and inclusive respect for our collective past, and animated by one of the most sweetly convincing friendships in television history. PH\n\nRead the review.\n\n37\n\nBrass Eye: Paedogeddon (2001)\n\nEven viewers familiar with Chris Morris\u2019s original 1997 current affairs satire raised a few startled eyebrows at Brass Eye\u2019s one-off return in 2001. Morris plunged into what, at the time, was one of the most emotive issues in British life \u2013 press coverage of paedophiles \u2013 and steamrollered every taboo he could get his teeth into inside half an hour. Newspapers howled, commentators pontificated, politicians blustered \u2013 and perhaps that was the point.

Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer\n\nWith reality TV shifting from catty to comforting in recent times, both the BBC and Channel 4 have enjoyed the sweet smell of success with Bake Off. Mel and Sue\u2019s exodus was a blow to its softly-softly charm and Prue Leith is a more straight-talking judge than Mary Berry. But 10 series in, the amateur baking contest is still an autumn staple. As with most long-running reality shows, there\u2019s still a sense of familiarity despite some changes; this year\u2019s series features its youngest ever set of contestants.

No wonder: they\u2019re incredibly resonant \u2013 they depict the kinds of British lives that are rarely explored at all, let alone with such tenderness and wisdom. We\u2019ve taken This is England\u2019s characters to our hearts but the series also functions as a parallel history of our country, warts and all.

Photograph: Mark Johnson/Channel 4\n\nRob Delaney and Sharon Horgan made their comedy great by never playing safe. At first it was a filthy gutbuster about a careless sexfest; then it frankly faced the grim reality of parenthood without losing its dirty grin. Finally, killing their darling just before it could flag, the pair delivered one of the best TV endings ever. A hardcore sitcom classic. JS\n\nRead the review.\n\n33\n\nBig Brother (2000-2018)\n\nThe recent 10th anniversary of Jade Goody\u2019s death sparked much conversation around the original lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key-for-a-bit reality show. Big Brother was in many ways one of the most heinous shows ever broadcast, from \u201cNasty Nick\u201d Bateman fleeing the country to escape the tabloids to Kinga\u2019s wine bottle and Shilpa-gate.

But when they evolve beyond by-the-numbers remakes and find an identity of their own, they can become excellent. A case in point: The Office US (originally subtitled \u201cAn American Workplace\u201d) found its feet once it stopped trying to be Gervais Part Two and instead established its own perpetually bored protagonists, led by Michael Scott, Steve Carell\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s best boss\u201d.

But technological developments have only increased their wonder, while the exponential destruction of the environment has lent them a polemical edge. Attenborough\u2019s two Blue Planet series have presented more mindblowing, naturally occurring psychedelia \u2013 long, strange trips into beautiful but inhospitable realms previously unexplored (and all-too-often degraded) by humanity.

The death dance between Comer\u2019s psychopath and Sandra Oh\u2019s coiled-spring MI5 nerd means each episode has a handful of outlandish payoffs that other dramas spend whole seasons working towards.

Yet for all the Star Wars homages, Spaced was, at its heart, a terrific character comedy, boasting a cracking cast that included Mark Heap\u2019s tortured artist Brian and Julia Deakin\u2019s formidable, chianti-powered landlady Marsha.

Photograph: NBC/Sportsphoto/Allstar\n\nTracking a single murder case across 20 hours of subtitled drama might have seemed a hard sell. But this Danish procedural had a secret weapon in detective Sarah Lund (Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l). Lund\u2019s knitwear became an unlikely totem of the show, but the real appeal was Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l\u2019s remarkable performance. Over three gripping seasons, Lund told us everything and nothing about herself, becoming one of the great TV enigmas. PH\n\nRead the review.\n\n27\n\nTransparent (2014-19)\n\nAmazon has struggled to get its TV originals right, but it made a perfect start with this mercurial, millennial dramedy. The plaudits for breaking new ground by centring on a transgender character were deserved, and no TV show before or since has handled diversity of gender and sexuality so assuredly. On top of all that is a seriously funny look at people failing to turn fluid modern adulthood into happiness.

Adapting them for television was always likely to prove tricky. However, this trilogy rose to the challenge superbly, drawing on the diverse but complementary visions of three different directors (Julian Jarrold, James Marsh and Anand Tucker) and a host of superb performances to bring the era unnervingly to life.

The show\u2019s patriarchal hellscape, where the chaste culture of kept women sits uneasily next to the machine guns and combat gear of the men doing the keeping, is terrifyingly well-realised, while Elisabeth Moss delivers a remarkable performance as Offred, the Handmaid who dreams of blowing it up. GM\n\nRead the review.\n\n24\n\nThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart (1999-2015)\n\nWise-ass but frequently just plain wise, Jon Stewart was a broadcasting natural with such range that he was equally convincing whether presenting a show in the aftermath of 9/11 or excoriating Chicago\u2019s fondness for deep-pan pizza. For more than a decade, he was a unique and persuasive liberal voice in American affairs; we shudder to imagine what he would have made of the current US political situation.

Now every new helping of his dystopia is event telly, drawing in A-list talent and, with one-offs such as the interactive Bandersnatch, continuing to push at the medium\u2019s limits.

Photograph: Suzanne Tenner/Showtime\n\nNo one knew what to expect from the reappearance, after nearly 30 years, of David Lynch\u2019s mystery drama. From its first frame to its soul-rending primal scream of a conclusion, The Return proved thrillingly baffling, full of indelible images (nuclear explosions, demonic cockroaches, David Bowie as a giant kettle) and dizzying dream logic. At the centre of the chaos was Kyle MacLachlan, radiating previously untapped levels of magnificence as both the valiant Agent Cooper and his breathtakingly evil doppelganger.

Such was the density of references, callbacks and gags that Arrested Development proved to be that rare thing \u2013 a show that became funnier on repeated viewings.

Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIt was the story of a US footballer, accused of murder and subsequently acquitted. But it was so much more besides. Over seven compelling hours, Ezra Edelman pulled back from his immediate subject by homing in on its minutiae. Exploring the context of OJ Simpson\u2019s rise and fall, Edelman constructed a startling treatise on race, gender, celebrity and capitalism itself. The result was an alternative history of modern America. PH\n\nRead the review.\n\n19\n\nKen Burns\u2019s The Vietnam War (2017)\n\nMore like a definitive historical document than a TV series. While Vietnam remains a scab at which America is compelled to pick, Burns\u2019s panorama feels like the last word. Beginning decades before the war and following its echoes up to the present day, the series plunged into the quagmire, illuminating the horror for all to see but concluded with threads of humanity reclaimed from the carnage.

Photograph: Sky\n\nFor all its problems (and there were many, from a lack of diversity to Lena Dunham\u2019s impressive propensity for foot-in-mouth moments), Girls changed the half-hour sitcom for the better. Originally billed as an updated Sex and the City, it grew into something more troubled and more troubling, bringing the best of mumblecore to the small screen via a spaghetti-slurping, often half-naked antihero (Dunham\u2019s Hannah Horvath), who proved as relatable as she was entirely out of control.

But it was more singular and ornery than any of its contemporaries. Milch created a universe that was simultaneously recognisable and utterly alien \u2013 then peopled it with extraordinary characters such as Ian McShane\u2019s Al Swearengen.

Jill responded to her husband\u2019s cancer diagnosis by attempting to break up the marriage next door, then staging an exceptionally excruciating mock funeral for her spouse (who had recovered but been forcibly committed to a hospice) and trying to seduce a 12-year-old. An absolute monster and an absolute masterpiece of provocation and bad taste.

Plus it gave us the most popular president in US history, Josiah \u201cJed\u201d Bartlet. Fans must watch it now and weep into their fake newspaper at the Trumpian state of things. There were certain missteps (the patronising 9/11 episode, we\u2019re looking at you), but this was TV that showed America it is possible to hope for better, even the best, from the leader of the free world.

But you could usually just about sympathise with his wrongness and understand his arrival in a variety of hideous scrapes. In a sitcom that was both deeply meta (David was playing a constructed but also deconstructed version of himself) and proudly traditional (it overflowed with sight-gags and classic setups), the comedy of excruciation reached its peak.

It\u2019s testimony to the excellence of Jed Mercurio\u2019s writing but mainly to masterful central performances from Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar who, as anti-corruption unit AC12, represent a still point around which all manner of police malfeasance swirls.

A good thing too, because the world Wainwright constructed around her \u2013 full of death, addiction and desperate poverty \u2013 was almost overwhelmingly, authentically bleak.

How wrong they were: as well as returning to the stage for a sold-out run this year, Fleabag\u2019s two-series TV run saw Waller-Bridge infuse the nascent sadcom genre with classic British awkwardness, encompassing grief, family breakdown and, of course, Obama-themed masturbation.

Even Ed Sheeran sitting by a fire singing a ditty about hands of gold can\u2019t irreparably dent its reputation. And it did come up with the goods throughout its eight-year reign: from the thrills and blood spills to the men baked in pies and the best battles ever seen on the small screen, right through to Cleganebowl.

Its creators haven\u2019t topped it either but with time, their casting decisions look as extraordinary as their scripts.

Yet as grimly engrossing as White\u2019s transformation was, what kept us returning to Vince Gilligan\u2019s low-key epic was Aaron Paul\u2019s performance as his reluctant partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, whose frayed humanity shone through the moral murk like a beacon.

But by spanning the entire 60s, showing the mammoth social shifts in an ad agency in minute detail \u2013 from the advent of the Pill and second-wave feminism to the rise of hippies and the dropping of LSD \u2013 it became more than just the tale of one mystery man and compulsive philanderer come good: it was a meditation on how modern America came to be made, one iconic advert at a time.

Photograph: E4\n\nIt is hard to fathom now, but when Tony Soprano first slumped into an armchair in his psychiatrist Dr Melfi\u2019s office, TV was still largely looked down upon. The slogan for the Sopranos\u2019 broadcaster \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s not TV, it\u2019s HBO\u2019 \u2013 felt telling in its dismissiveness, as if making a television programme was something to be ashamed about. The Sopranos changed all that.\n\nWhen it first aired, some were quick to dismiss it as just another mob drama. But David Chase took a cleaver to the conventions and cliches of the gangster epic. Its Family wasn\u2019t some pinstripe-clad crew swaggering down Brooklyn back alleys, but a tragicomic rabble reigning over the unprepossessing suburbs of New Jersey. It was a world populated by fragile and petty people, arguing over Tupperware like Paulie Walnuts or ordering a hit over rumours about their bedroom activities like Uncle Junior. And its protagonist was a hulking, ferocious don beset by panic attacks and cowed by his far more ferocious mother.\n\nAnd what a protagonist! Here was a man who would break off from his daughter\u2019s college open day to brutally murder an informant, and we were supposed to if not actively root for him, at least follow him into the abyss. Yet follow him we did, because of the qualities that moved him beyond the mobster stereotype. From the off, this was a show with bigger thoughts in mind: the downfall of the white working class, Jungian psychoanalysis, shifting sexual politics and the eternal question of whether an interior decorator could kill 16 Czechoslovakians. And it played with form with the eagerness of Tony tucking into some \u2018gabagool\u2019, staging Godot-like one-acters in the Pine Barrens and devoting entire episodes to the fever-dream musings of a comatose Tony.\n\nThe Sopranos hastened TV\u2019s transformation into a medium where intelligence, experimentation and depth were treasured. Critics still put it at the top of best of lists like this one. Fevered conversations are still had online about the show\u2019s symbolic use of eggs, ducks and teeth, and of course that rug-pull of an ending. For anyone currently making TV, the show stands as something to aspire to, perhaps even better. That is easier said than done, of course. Plenty of programmes have come at the boss, but none has managed to carry out a successful hit. GM", "description": "Where\u2019s Mad Men? How did The Sopranos do? Does The Crown triumph?
