A shambling, slouching, undead thing; a zombie that stinks of decay but won\u2019t die. We need a Van Helsing to drive a stake through its heart, and lay it to rest.\n\nLike all the best horror movies, this monster was created by human failings. The scriptwriters of this particular freak show are the Liberal Democrats, who demanded fixed term parliaments as part of their price for joining the coalition government in 2010, and the departing speaker, John Bercow, who invented new rules to strip control of parliament\u2019s agenda away from the government earlier this year.\n\nIn normal times, neither change would prove to be the lightning bolt which brings a monster to life. But in what is effectively a hung parliament, where there\u2019s no majority for very much at all, the results have been hideous.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhy? Because government is becalmed, ministers haven\u2019t got the votes to get important new Brexit preparation laws through parliament without heavy defeats or fatal changes. The result is a huge backlog of half-finished laws which are stuck: unable to move forward, yet too important to be abandoned altogether. We're suffering from constitutional constipation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Brexit culture: film posters reimagined Show all 5 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Instead, we're slow and shambling. The government is on life support, but the opposition won\u2019t turn off the machines either to let this parliament die.\n\nIn the past, resolving this situation would have been simple. Either the opposition would have toppled the government with a no confidence, giving them a chance to form a rival government themselves, and holding a general election if they couldn\u2019t. Or the prime minister, Boris Johnson, would have recognised the blindingly obvious fact that parliament is too fractured to provide any government with a stable majority and gone to ask the Queen to reset with an election himself. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening now.\n\nBecause of the introduction of fixed term parliaments, Jeremy Corbyn only needs a third of MPs to block an early general election, but half to topple the government. The rules are slanted in favour of no change, even though parliament desperately needs something to happen.\n\nAnd Bercow\u2019s changes make things worse; even though the opposition aren\u2019t strong enough to form an alternative government of their own, letting them grab control of parliament\u2019s agenda creates lots of powerful new ways for them to frustrate change and delay a reset instead.\n\nBecause the constitution isn\u2019t doing its job properly, democracy isn\u2019t working. Problems which ought to be solved through the ballot box or in parliament aren\u2019t being addressed at all \u2013 or they\u2019re being taken to court, which puts judges in an impossible, politicised position.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to kill off the monster we\u2019ve created. Our first step should be to axe fixed term parliaments: we should either repeal the act completely or, if that hands too much power back to prime ministers, make calling an election a normal vote in parliament rather than the two-thirds majority that\u2019s currently needed, so oppositions that can\u2019t form a government aren\u2019t able to block an election too. And we should stop future speakers from making up new rules whenever they feel like it, as Bercow has done. It\u2019s an unaccountable power that is easily misused.\n\nConstitutional changes are best done slowly, with cross-party support, so both the government and opposition can work out whether new rules would still be fair when they\u2019re on the other side of the fence. So let\u2019s make changes to the way parliament works subject to a two-thirds majority of MPs, whether it\u2019s the rules themselves, or changes to the speaker\u2019s interpretation of them too.\n\nDr Frankenstein died trying to kill the monster he created. We don\u2019t have to suffer his fate too.\n\nJohn Penrose is Conservative MP for Weston, Worle & the Villages, and the former constitution minister", "description": "Parliament is a horrible place at the moment.
