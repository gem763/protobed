As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nCARSON, Calif. \u2014 Devlin Hodges, a champion duck caller and emergency Pittsburgh Steelers starting quarterback, arrived and left Sunday night's game against the Los Angeles Chargers wearing a t-shirt that said it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019M THE BOSS, CALIFORNIA,\u201d it read, with the lettering circled around a determined-looking duck\n\nHodges, whose nickname is Duck, said he bought the t-shirt Saturday on the famous Venice boardwalk, and it was fitting attire Sunday night.\n\nIn his debut as a starter, the undrafted rookie threw for 132 yards and one touchdown on 15-of-20 passing with one interception. Not by coincidence, the Steelers beat the Chargers, 24-17, at Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome,\u2019\u2019 Hodges said. \u201cThat was something that I\u2019ve dreamed about. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always believed that could happen.\u2019\u2019\n\nHodges\u2019 self belief is at least as strong than his throwing arm and perhaps the reason he wore that \u201cI\u2019M THE BOSS, CALIFORNIA\u2019\u2019 t-shirt to the game.\n\n\u201cPeople seemed to love it,\u2019\u2019 he said with a grin, and Steelers fans sure loved what they saw as Pittsburgh improved to 2-4 thanks in part to their new starting quarterback.\n\nWEEK 6: 32 things we learned\n\n10 INCREDIBLE STATS: Jimmy Garoppolo keeps winning, Baker Mayfield struggling\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nDevlin Hodges threw for 132 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' win Sunday night.

It\u2019s not even certain he will replace Mason Rudolph, the Steelers\u2019 backup quarterback, who was unavailable Sunday because he suffered a concussion against the Baltimore Ravens last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting into that,\u2019\u2019 Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said when asked who will be the starter when Rudolph is healthy.\n\nTruth is, there was no reason to rush ahead instead of savoring Hodges\u2019 story. For starters, this is a guy from Alabama who might be a better duck caller than a signal caller.\n\nHe won 2009 Junior World Duck Calling Contest at 13 and won the 2018 Alabama State Duck Calling Championship.\n\nOverlooked by the top major college football programs, he headed to Samford University in Birmingham, Ala. and proved to be more than a champion duck caller. He surpassed Steve McNair as the all-time leading passer among FCS schools with 14,584 yards, and he also won the 2018 Walter Payton Award, the FCS equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.\n\nPicked up by the Steelers after the 2019 draft, Hodges played well in the preseason but was waived after the team\u2019s last exhibition game. He was signed to the practice squad 10 days later, and after Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending injury joined the 53-man roster.\n\nThen, after Rudolph\u2019s concussion, Hodges found himself in the starting lineup Sunday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bumpy ride, especially the last couple of months,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been wild to think about. But I\u2019ve always had belief in myself and I\u2019ve always had people behind.\u2019\u2019\n\nPeople like his mom and dad, who flew to Southern California to be at the game. And then on there was Devin Bush, the Steelers linebacker who staked Pittsburgh to a 7-0 lead when he returned a fumble nine yards for a touchdown. And James Conner, the Steelers running back who had 41 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries and 78 yards and another touchdown on seven receptions.\n\nHodges hooked up with Conner on a 26-yard touchdown pass that gave the Steelers a 21-0 lead in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cHe just controlled the game,\u2019\u2019 Conner said.\n\nWith retired NFL quarterback Michael Vick among those watching from the press box, Hodges completed 8-of-9 passes for 70 yards in the first half.\n\n\"He's doing enough to win,'' Vick said.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Hodges did \u2014 win.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of confidence in him,\u2019\u2019 Tomlin said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been bashful about that. He has a lot of confidence in himself. I think that\u2019s what makes people gravitate to him.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut Tomlin insisted on a dose of reality.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting overly excited,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThis is a guy that played good tonight, with very limited experience. We\u2019re thankful to get a win and hopefully it\u2019ll be a good experience for him and us, collectively, as we move forward.\u2019\u2019\n\nMoving forward, it\u2019s unsure where this daffy Duck story goes. But as Hodges moved from the locker room to the interview room and then on to an area where his parents waited, he carried a game ball. He said game balls also were awarded to Conner and cornerback Artie Burns.\n\n\u201cThe game ball is awesome\u2019\u2019 Hodges said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t have done it without the guys. The win means a lot more than the game ball.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut for a night he had it all \u2014 a win, a game ball and the adoration of Steeler Nation.\n\nDuck had answered the call.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Josh Peter on Twitter @joshlpeter11.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
