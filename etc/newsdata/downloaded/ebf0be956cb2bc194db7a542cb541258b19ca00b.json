Similarly, Mohammad Nawaz should have been selected, who is performing well and was part of the Test squad in last tour to Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaying against Australia in their home ground with this bowling attack, we have absolutely no chance to win,\u201d he added.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "\"On what basis have you selected the inexperienced bowlers who have never toured Australia before, although Musa Khan and Nasim Shah have potential, but they are only 18 year old.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ramiz-raja-cropped_1mwqvc50lkr651hemk7dzae5lp1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
