just the sort of stats that make you an appealing presence for such an occasion, at least on paper.\n\nBut his performance across three starts at RWC 2019 thus far has been desperately inconsistent \u2026 a hallmark that seriously infected his game in Sunday\u2019s comfortable but imperfect 26-3 quarter-final triumph over gallant, though eventually outgunned underdogs Japan.\n\nUnless injuries intervene in the interim, Erasmus shouldn\u2019t have too many head-scratchers for the Wales showdown; he has a settled fulcrum of a \u201cfirst team\u201d and won\u2019t wish for major deviation at this advanced stage.\n\nLe Roux, however, is undoubtedly cause for concern form-wise.\n\nAfter a bright showing in the more clear-cut, pre-tournament 41-7 disposal of the Brave Blossoms in Saitama, the No 15 has mixed the good with the rank bad, during the tournament itself, in a berth where there is a higher premium than many others on \u201ccertainty\u201d, if you like.\n\nThe player is capable of sublime moves in the blink of an eyelid, but the successive matches he\u2019s begun against New Zealand (23-13 loss), Italy (49-3 win) and now the quarter-final at RWC 2019 have also seen him make quite glaring errors with undesirable frequency.\n\nThat is no special comfort to Bok enthusiasts \u2026 and will be picked up on, you can be sure, by Warren Gatland and the other Welsh masterminds ahead of the semi.\n\nWales are a team renowned for keeping the ball in play as much as possible.\n\nOutspoken, much-travelled guru and former Springbok centre Brendan Venter raised the stakes even higher, really, in a tweet (@BrendanVenter) after the Bok quarter-final in which he warned: \u201cWales will attack our backfield with an aerial bombardment.\u201d\n\nBased on his frankly wretched first half in a broad sense against Japan, and with memories of his high-ball frailty against the All Blacks in the pool opener still fairly vivid as well, is Le Roux the right medicine for fullback retention under such circumstances?\n\nThat will be something for Erasmus to mull over in some depth over the next few days.\n\nLe Roux\u2019s bravery should not be called into question: he had two pretty violent knocks relatively early in Sunday\u2019s game, once when team-mate Pieter-Steph du Toit came clattering into a breakdown and his legs made contact accidentally with\n\nthe fullback\u2019s head at some pace, and also a painful landing after a contest with Japan loose-forward strongman Michael Leitch in the air.\n\nBut the fact remained that his catching was too often \u201chit or miss\u201d, his passing inexplicably inaccurate at times, too, and there was one spillage under no special pressure of a pass as the Boks looked to launch a rare ball-in-hand backline raid.\n\nOn the more positive side, Le Roux may yet be saved, selection-wise against Wales, by having fallen in line to some degree after halftime with the collective improvement of the Bok team, as they finally showed greater composure and turned screws clinically.\n\nStill, debate will rage early in the week around possible better options in the last line of defence against the men in scarlet jerseys, who also blew decidedly hot and cold in pipping France in their quarter-final.\n\nThe situation may be complicated by tenacious little wing Cheslin Kolbe taking further physical punishment \u2013 he had been battling with an ankle problem ahead of the Japan clash \u2013 in the match; he had looked more assured under the aerial ball and has very sound No 15 credentials of his own.\n\nWhile it is difficult to envisage Erasmus suddenly opting for the only nine-cap (including four fullback starts) Warrick Gelant for such a high-pressure encounter, versatile, broad-shouldered and enormously street-wise Frans Steyn wouldn\u2019t be the worst call for the berth \u2013 especially with his renowned ability to hoof the ball back the proverbial mile when required to do so.\n\nSteyn has largely been an impact substitute for the Boks in bigger matches at the tournament, but he sports 14 prior fullback appearances in green and gold, including some stellar showings in the spot during 2009, when South Africa won both the British and Irish Lions series and later the former Tri-Nations.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "Willie le Roux\u2019s shaky fullback form is a worry for the Springboks\u2019 semi-final \u2026 especially against a side like Wales, writes <strong>Rob Houwing. </strong>", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9369/524892f405ca4393908e9f169cd51031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
