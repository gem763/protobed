The 75-year-old designer is known for incorporating traditional Korean elements into her style. [PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nEvery fall, while local fashion brands show off their Spring/Summer collections for the upcoming year, Seoul Fashion Week simultaneously hosts an archival exhibition honoring Korean designers who were active in the industry for over 20 years.This season\u2019s star is Sul Yun Hyoung, one of the designers responsible for laying the foundation of Seoul Fashion Week along with the likes of Lie Sang Bong and Gee Choon-hee of Miss Gee Collection.Selected creations from Sul\u2019s 50-year-old fashion career are on display at \u201cHyeonghyeong-saeksaek,\u201d or \u201cThe Varicolored World of Sul Yun Hyoung,\u201d now open through Nov. 7 at the Design Pathway at Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in central Seoul.Elements of \u201cKoreanism,\u201d a term commonly used to describe Sul\u2019s designs, pervade throughout the collection, enriched with bright colors and an extensive range of unique materials and intricate techniques. Examples include silk embroidery, Korean folk paintings, entwined strips of mulberry paper and colored threads made in the form of sangmo, or hats worn by musicians from the Joseon era (1392-1910).Sul\u2019s fascination with colors dates back to her childhood, when she used to collect scraps of cloth thrown out by a hanbok (Korean traditional clothing) shop in her neighborhood.\u201cIt\u2019s what I grew up with,\u201d Sul told the Korea JoongAng Daily during an interview ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch on Monday. \u201cI felt a longing for those times. Everyone wore hanbok when I was a child.\u201dIn many ways, Sul is living history. It was thanks to the determination of Sul and a few others that Korea was able to establish its own Fashion Week.\u201cA couple of designers and I really wanted to organize fashion shows like other countries in the world,\u201d Sul explained. \u201cAround 10 of us formed the Seoul Fashion Artist Association and held our first collection at a hotel in 1990. We were almost in tears. We invited famous critics from Japan and used our personal funds to cover expenses. It was really challenging, but gradually we started attracting sponsors like Hyundai Department Store. I can\u2019t forget the excitement from that time.\u201dThe transformation of Fashion Week continues to amaze Sul, who\u2019s impressed with the \u201ctremendous role\u201d that the DDP plays and the unique styles of its attendees.Although she\u2019s happy with how the domestic fashion scene has evolved, there\u2019s one thing about the industry today that bothers Sul.\u201cI think this applies to everywhere, but there aren\u2019t master craftsmen anymore. People don\u2019t want to do anything difficult. In the past there would be hand embroiderers who stayed up all night finishing our orders, but now we can only find embroiderers from Vietnam, China or North Korea.\u201dThese days, Sul doesn\u2019t regularly launch new collections. While the designer says she wouldn\u2019t mind holding fashion shows again, she thinks it\u2019s time to \u201cgive opportunities to young designers.\u201dSul commented, \u201cIt\u2019s our job to see their shows. I try to attend all of the shows I receive tickets for.\u201dOne young designer that Sul supports is her daughter Lee Ju-young, who\u2019s dressed the likes of Lady Gaga and Marilyn Manson. Because of the hardships she faced in her own fashion career, Sul was initially against Ju-young becoming a designer.\u201cShe studied the cello and was so talented with it,\u201d Sul recalled, still with a hint of wistfulness. \u201cBut I had to let her live her own life. Now, I\u2019ll ask her opinions to get input on young people\u2019s tastes.\u201dOne project that Sul is still busy working on is the \u201cKorea Top Fashion Designer Bazaar for Mission,\u201d an annual charity event held at her church.For almost 30 years, Sul and designers like PARTsPARTs, Caruso and Demoo have joined forces to sell some of their clothing for unbelievable prices, like 5,000 or 10,000 won ($4.50 to $8.50). All profits go to underprivileged communities in Korea and abroad.\u201cSome designers have donated 1,000 pieces a time if they had enough in stock. I\u2019m really thankful,\u201d Sul said. \u201cWe\u2019re people who have succeeded, and the money needs to circulate. It is not enough if we\u2019re the only ones who are well-off.\u201dBY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/21194305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
