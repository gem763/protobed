My wife was supposed to go,\u201d Edwards tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI took over at the last minute. I just kind of jumped in there.\u201d\n\nBut clearly, Edwards didn\u2019t understand what he was getting himself into. In a now-viral post on his Facebook page, Edwards shared how caring for a group of kindergarten students on Friday pushed him to the limit, and made him respect his daughter Aspen\u2019s teacher even more than he already did.\n\n\u201cListen: I love my daughter, but other people\u2019s kids are a bit much,\u201d Edwards wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis trip left me with an incredible respect for people who who work with young children all day. I only had five in my group, and they listened about as good as goldfishes. The whole time I was afraid I\u2019d loose one in the corn field, they\u2019d never be found, and ultimately end up as the premise for a Steven King novel.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive-year-olds are crazy,\u201d Edwards tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWhen I said one was gonna run off into the cornfield, that was not an exaggeration. I was grabbing kids by the collar.\u201d\n\nThe dad was in awe watching his daughter\u2019s teacher successfully supervise the children as they changed their shoes \u2014 twice \u2014 to prevent tracking mud onto the bus. \u201c...I\u2019m pretty sure if she listed this act on her resume, she\u2019d be as respected as any military general,\u201d Edwards wrote. \u201cI mean, wow! No child lost a shoe and she smiled the WHOLE TIME!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ve said this before, but if my life ever depended on my own children finding their shoes, I\u2019d be dead, so for her to pull off this shoe swap with 20 something 5/6 year olds places her on par with Batman. If you are a teacher reading this, give yourself a huge pat on the back. You are incredible. And if you know a teacher, give them a huge thank you.\u201d\n\nEdwards, who shares his own parenting experiences in the upcoming book, Silence is a Scary Sound: And Other Stories on Living Through the Terrible Twos and Threes, says he went home from the field trip and enjoyed cookies, Tylenol, and a long soak in the bathtub. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a drink in 16 years, and I was ready,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAnd that was only after 3 or 4 hours!\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Oregon Dad Defends Choice to Put 3-Year-Old Daughter on a Leash\n\nWhat Edwards hopes people draw from his post is a strong respect for teachers, who care for dozens of students on a daily basis. And it\u2019s clear from the Facebook comments, that teachers are held in high regard. \u201cAs a middle school teacher, I appreciate grade-school teachers (I couldn't do it)!! Thank you for recognizing all that teachers do for our kiddos, and thank you for going on field trips with your kiddos!\u201d\n\nAnother teacher wrote, \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever had to help 18 four year olds put on and buckle a seat it\u2019s a grueling experience in its self. I got a similar response from my parent chaperones.\u201d Someone else commented, \u201cAs a preschool teacher, I truly appreciate this post! And I find the humor in it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most parents have a real appreciation for teachers because that\u2019s a tough job. And being there, firsthand, I couldn\u2019t help but really respect Aspen\u2019s teacher,\u201d Edwards tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI say everybody, give your kindergarten teacher a high five. Bring her a gift at the end of the year. She deserves it. These people are saints. They deserve hazard pay.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A visit to the pumpkin patch with his daughter's kindergarten class made an Oregon man respect teachers even more.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1jqN26bUBSKxZF1JyXSKzQ--~B/aD0xMDI4O3c9MTM2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3f8b6ef0-f2ac-11e9-b3ff-c16c34b4ce43", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
