She was treated for a \"localized malignant tumor\" on her pancreas in August and had malignant nodules removed from her lung in a New York hospital in December 2018.\n\nThe progressive justice, who has become a pop culture icon dubbed \"Notorious RBG\" and a hero for young activists, dismissed concerns over her health in an interview with NPR in July.\n\n\"There was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months,\" Ginsburg said. \"That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I am very much alive.\"", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been awarded the $1 million Berggruen Prize for thinkers.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ruth-bader-ginsburg-gty-jc-191023_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
