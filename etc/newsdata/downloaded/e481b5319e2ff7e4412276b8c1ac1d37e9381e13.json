Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nI am obviously not a doctor. I am, however, a very good Googler of random symptoms in search of a self-diagnosis \u2014 to the point where actual doctors are always impressed by the amount of knowledge I possess about diseases I most definitely do not have. So when I started having itchy, flaky patches of skin on my scalp last year, I didn\u2019t head straight to the dermatologist first \u2014 I cracked open my computer and consulted the \u201cDiseases and Conditions\u201d tab at MayoClinic.org that I have open at all times. Turns out, I was suffering from a bit of seborrheic dermatitis: a noncontagious skin rash \u2014 kind of a turbocharged version of regular old dandruff.\n\nEven real doctors don\u2019t actually know the root cause of seborrheic dermatitis, though winter weather, stress, fatigue, and certain neurological conditions can cause flare-ups (a nasty little guy called Malassezia in skin\u2019s oily secretions may also play a role). I successfully treated my flaky, itchy scalp with a medicated shampoo, but the thing that has really kicked my seborrheic dermatitis\u2019s butt was a $6 hard-rubber shampoo brush.\n\nAfter breaking a few fingernails in a desperate attempt to give my scalp a good scrubbing, I finally Googled \u201cscalp brush,\u201d which led to me purchasing multiple crummy, hard-plastic versions until I finally settled on this one. Its flexible vinyl bristles give just the right amount of scrubbing pressure without scraping or scratching your head. It works to break up any stubborn dandruff flakes and gets my scalp cleaner than my hands alone ever possibly could \u2014a total luxury for the cost of two lip balms.\n\nHere\u2019s how I use it: I apply shampoo directly to the brush and massage it into my scalp in the mornings (it\u2019s better for tight circles on the skin than combing through the hair). I don\u2019t think I can properly explain via the written word how blissful the experience is. The effect is much like getting a scalp massage at the hair salon (with extremely firm fingers). I even use it while rinsing my hair, to ensure I\u2019ve gotten all the shampoo and conditioner off my scalp. As a result, my dry, patchy flakes are now totally gone \u2014 and my scalp, a notorious grease pit, feels cleaner and squeakier than it has in years.\n\nAn arsenal of Strategist-approved dandruff-fighting stuff\n\nBRIOGEO Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-exfoliating Shampoo It\u2019s admittedly pricier than the above options, but this top-rated shampoo on Sephora is beloved by hundreds of reviewers, one of whom called it the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d for taking away \u201cmy horrible itchy scalp and dandruff.\u201d Plus, it doubles as an exfoliant that Sobel says is gentle enough not to irritate an already sensitive scalp. $42 at Sephora Buy\n\nDpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Sea Salt Scalp Scrub When we asked hairstylists about the best scalp scrubs, this product received top marks for its ability to soothe flaky scalps.
