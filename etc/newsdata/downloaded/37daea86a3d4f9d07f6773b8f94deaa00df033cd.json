However, you should all band together to put Hotel Encanto out of business,\" Wilson tweeted to her fans. \"Had to wait 2 hours for breakfast. Then they sent the police to kick me out in the middle of the night for no reason. I complied. Home early.\"\n\nI got off stage at 11:30pm. At 12:30pm I was only talking in my room. The hotel informed me that QUIET HOURS started at 10pm. Wrong hotel for 3rd shifters. \u2014 Gretchen Wilson (@gw27) October 16, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, she replied to her own tweet, stating: \"I got off stage at 11:30pm. At 12:30pm I was only talking in my room. The hotel informed me that QUIET HOURS started at 10pm. Wrong hotel for 3rd shifters.\"\n\nAccording to the 911 call, a hotel employee told dispatchers that Wilson had multiple noise complaints against her.\n\n\"We went up there multiple times the last half hour. So, I went up there and she said she was a celebrity but I forgot to get her name,\" the employee said. \"Gretchen something, she participated in the country music festival and her words were, 'I paid for the room, I could care less what people think.' We had her escorted off property.\"\n\nDan Trujillo, spokesman for the Las Cruces Police Department, told the USA TODAY Network that the incident occurred a little after 3 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 13.\n\n\"There were several noise complaints for a room,\" Trujillo said. \"I'm not sure who was listed in the room but Ms. Wilson was in the room. We helped security remove the guest because they had worn out their welcome.\"\n\nTrujillo said police were going to file charges but Wilson and her team voluntarily left on their own.\n\n\"(Police) were going to issue a trespass card but the occupants agreed to leave,\" he said. \"(Police) stood by as they packed up.\"\n\nGretchen Wilson performs at the 7th annual Las Cruces Country Music Festival on Saturday. Early Sunday morning, employees at the hotel where Wilson was staying asked police to escort her from the property because they said she was making too much noise.

The employee said Wilson was being \"super loud\" and no music or television was playing.\n\n\"Her level of talking is like our yelling,\" the employee said.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network made attempts to reach Wilson's management but did not receive a comment. Hotel Encanto and LCCMF organizers declined to comment on the incident.\n\nThis isn't the first time Wilson has had a run-in with the law. In August 2018, she was arrested at a Connecticut airport after what was described as a minor disturbance on an incoming flight. She was later charged with breach of peace.\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nMore: Country star Gretchen Wilson arrested at Connecticut airport, charged with breach of peace\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/16/gretchen-wilson-las-cruces-new-mexico-hotel-encanto/4005335002/", "description": "Gretchen Wilson's\u00a0hit song, \"Here for the Party,\" features\u00a0the lyrics, \"And I ain't leaving till they throw me out.\" She lived up to those lyrics.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Devine", "Published P.M.
