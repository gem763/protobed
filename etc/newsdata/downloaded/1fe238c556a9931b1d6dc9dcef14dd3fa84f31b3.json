His legal team did say, however, that their argument was \u201cbased upon her use of what appears to be suggestive psychotherapy to recover memories of the incident about which she would testify; that is, techniques that render testimony unreliable and thus inadmissible.\u201d\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s \u201cmemory recovery therapy\u201d argument is part of a more than 100-page filing in which his legal team pushes for dismissal of the two predatory-sexual-assault counts, and the exclusion of several prosecution witnesses.\n\nHis lawyers also revealed in this filing that they want to bring in an expert witness who would testify about the \u201cformation of fully false memories for events that never happened.\u201d\n\nThe expert, social psychologist Deborah Davis, would \u201cdiscuss special issues of memory specifically for sexual or potentially sexual interactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese include what is known about sexual consent communications, causes of original misunderstandings of sexual intentions, and causes of distortion in memory for sexual consent communications over time,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s legal team said. \u201cIn this context, she will specifically address the phenomenon of \u2018voluntary unwanted sex,\u2019 i.e., sex that is undesired, but that the person chooses to engage in, and why such sexual encounters are susceptible to inaccurate memories.\u201d\n\nWeinstein\u2019s new arguments come in the wake of a defeat for his defense team. While Weinstein\u2019s lawyers had asked for his trial to be moved out of Manhattan \u2014 citing extensive media coverage and concerns that potential jurors here have liberal leanings \u2014 a state appeals court rejected their request.\n\nWeinstein now faces five counts in Manhattan Supreme Court. They include two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of first-degree rape, and one count of third-degree rape. His trial is scheduled to begin on January 6, 2020. Weinstein has maintained his innocence.", "description": "According to his lawyers, a witness in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual-assault trial shouldn\u2019t be allowed to testify because she may have undergone \u201cmemory recovery therapy\u201d that makes her testimony \u201cunreliable.\u201d", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/16/16-weinstein.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
