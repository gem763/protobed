It all served as a reminder of how fast Democratic leaders want this impeachment probe to go.\n\n\n\n\"We're not fooling around here,\" Schiff told reporters. \"We don't want this to drag on for months and months, which appears to be the administration's strategy.\"\n\nThe goal, Democrats say, is to vote by the Iowa caucuses, if not before Thanksgiving. But the short timeline is yet another example of the party\u2019s anxiety around the politics of impeachment. Go too fast and force on-the-fence moderates to vote with less evidence. Go too slow and risk muddling the party's election-year messaging.\n\nWith 2020 fast approaching, the go-fast gang appears to be winning out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a desire to finish as fast as possible \u2013 there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), a member of both the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees, told reporters this week. \u201cMy sense of it is, obviously, it gets much more difficult when you get into the primary season. ... because then it would be easy for Trump and the Republicans to just say that this is a political effort.\u201d\n\nBut like everything with impeachment, it\u2019s complicated. More than 218 Democrats\u2014enough to impeach in the House\u2014have come out in favor of the probe. But moderates from purple-to-red districts remain reluctant. They\u2019re urging the party leadership to slow down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wait it out,\u201d Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.) told reporters at the Capitol last week. \u201cI\u2019m going to always encourage us to be as methodical and careful and slow as possible.\u201d\n\nVan Drew's an anomaly: He still hasn't spoken out in favor of the inquiry. But even moderates who do support the probe have said they\u2019re not ready to vote to impeach Trump, despite a steady stream of evidence\u2014and his own admission\u2014that he pressed Ukraine to investigate his political rival. That means Democrats could face a less decisive vote if they move too fast, a fear that has some dismissing the idea of pressing to finish before primary season.\n\nThe election \u201cis not a concern,\u201d Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) told VICE News at the Capitol. \u201cLook, we have a constitutional responsibility to hold a president accountable, to demonstrate no one is above the law, and we\u2019re going to work as expeditiously as possible. But I think it\u2019s something we do separate and apart from any political calendar.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that Democrats only have so much control of the timeline. They've subpoenaed the White House for records related to Ukraine, and they\u2019ve pressed State Department officials to testify. But the White House is reportedly planning to send Pelosi a letter demanding an impeachment vote before they cooperate. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has already successfully delayed those State officials\u2019 testimony. It's all in keeping with its record of stonewalling Democrats\u2019 requests.\n\nThose moderates pleading for more evidence, and more patience, might want to let those things play out before they vote. But Schiff says any slow-walking may just warrant a new article of impeachment, for impeding his investigation.\n\n\"Any action like that that forces us to litigate or have to consider litigation will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice,\" Schiff said. \"We'll have to decide whether to litigate or how to litigate.\"\n\nCover: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks during a weekly news conference held by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Wednesday.
