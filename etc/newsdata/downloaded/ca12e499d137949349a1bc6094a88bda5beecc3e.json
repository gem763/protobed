It wouldn\u2019t have shocked me if that inspired a warm reception from the crowd. Remember when Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing was announced? I was in Austin, Texas, where people were whooping and cheering in bars. President Barack Obama could have drawn applause anywhere in the United States that night.\n\nAnd the crowd at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., was applauding last night when the big screen in right-center field showed uniformed U.S. military personnel.\n\nBut when the image changed to Donald and Melania in the stands, there was a sudden shift. The crowd booed. Loudly. Then fans in some sections of the stadium began to chant \u201cLock him up,\u201d repurposing the rallying cry that Trump supporters have directed at Hillary Clinton since the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump was not pleased.", "description": "The president made a rare public appearance before a crowd he hadn\u2019t screened\u2014and was loudly booed.", "authors": ["Conor Friedersdorf", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2T5SL/facebook.jpg?1572262110", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
