But they\u2019ve been close to winning in recent weeks, failing on a two-point conversion that would have beaten the Washington Redskins and squandering a fourth-quarter lead in Buffalo, and they have a 14-10 halftime lead Monday night in Pittsburgh. It was 14-0 in the first quarter as quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick threw touchdown passes to wide receivers Albert Wilson and Allen Hurns. That was the Dolphins\u2019 biggest lead of the season. At that point, it appeared that the Dolphins might have to make more trades at halftime if they wanted to avoid winning this one. The Pittsburgh offense was off to a shaky start and was being booed by the Heinz Field crowd. Quarterback Mason Rudolph had his first pass of the night intercepted and had another interception nullified by an instant replay review. The Steelers failed on a fourth-down try and recovered a fumble by Rudolph on a sack. But the game turned in the second quarter and the Steelers scored 10 straight points. Kicker Chris Boswell connected on a 42-yard field goal and the Steelers got a 45-yard touchdown pass from Rudolph to wide receiver Diontae Johnson on a third-and-20 play 17 seconds before halftime. The Dolphins brought a blitz that didn\u2019t get to Rudolph and left Johnson wide open in the middle of the field. That long touchdown might have prevented another NFL officiating controversy because just before that, the Steelers had a 34-yard completion to Johnson nullified by a bad call of offensive pass interference against Johnson. He was flagged for a very light pushoff and the call was allowed to stand on an instant replay review. Minkah Fitzpatrick had an interception of a Ryan Fitzpatrick pass to set up the touchdown.

The Dolphins brought a blitz, didn\u2019t get to Rudolph and left Johnson wide open in the middle of the field on a slant pattern. He caught Rudolph\u2019s on-target throw and sprinted to the end zone. That came soon after the Steelers had a 34-yard completion from Rudolph to Johnson to the Miami 1-yard line negated by a bad call made on Johnson for offensive pass interference. Johnson was penalized for the lightest of pushoffs and the call was allowed to stand after a replay review.

The Steelers have a chance to get a closer before halftime. (Dolphins 14, Steelers 3 with 1:13 left in the 2nd Quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteelers get on the board: The Pittsburgh offense, after being booed by the Heinz Field crowd during this ugly first half, finally got moving. Mason Rudolph managed some completions, pushing his passer rating for the night up from 0.0 to 29.8, and the Steelers moved 70 yards before stalling and settling for a 42-yard field goal by kicker Chris Boswell. He has connected on all 12 of his field goal attempts this season. (Dolphins 14, Steelers 3 with 2:45 left in the 2nd Quarter)\n\nBoos for Pittsburgh offense: The offense of the Steelers is hearing some boos at Heinz Field. The Steelers just punted after recovering a fumble by quarterback Mason Rudolph on a third-down sack. Rudolph has thrown one interception, had another interception negated by an instant replay review and fumbled on a sack. The Steelers have one turnover, failed on a fourth-down attempt and trail the winless Dolphins by two touchdowns in the second quarter. (Dolphins 14, Steelers 0 with 12:11 left in the 2nd Quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBig lead (relatively speaking) for the Dolphins: The Dolphins have their biggest lead of the season. They\u2019re ahead of the Steelers, 14-0, in the opening quarter after the second touchdown pass of the night thrown by quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. This one was a 12-yarder to wide receiver Allen Hurns to cap a 63-yard drive following the Steelers\u2019 failed fourth-down attempt. (Dolphins 14, Steelers 0 with 1:34 left in the 1st Quarter)\n\nShaky start for Rudolph: It has been a shaky start to the game for Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph. He nearly threw his second interception of the night but was spared when Dolphins cornerback Ryan Lewis was ruled on an instant replay review to have had one foot out of bounds, with a toe on the line, while grabbing a deflected pass. Given that reprieve, Rudolph and the Steelers failed to take advantage. Coach Mike Tomlin left his offense on the field for a fourth-and-six try from the Miami 37-yard line. But Rudolph made an off-target throw behind wide receiver James Washington for an incompletion and a turnover on downs. (Dolphins 7, Steelers 0 with 7:34 left in the 1st Quarter)\n\nEarly lead for Miami: The winless Dolphins have an early lead in Pittsburgh, converting an interception thrown by Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph into a touchdown. The Dolphins had to move only 26 yards after the turnover, scoring on a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to wide receiver Albert Wilson. Rudolph, back in the Steelers\u2019 lineup after missing a game because a concussion, had his first pass of the night intercepted by Miami cornerback Xavien Howard. Rudolph had pass-rush pressure in his face and didn\u2019t get enough on his sideline throw toward wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. (Dolphins 7, Steelers 0 with 10:55 left in the 1st Quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPreview\n\nNot much has gone the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 way so far this season. The Steelers lost quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to season-ending elbow surgery. Their addition-by-subtraction plan following the offseason exits of running back Le\u2019Veon Bell and wide receiver Antonio Brown has been a bust. There has been speculation \u2014 without corroboration, to this point \u2014 that Coach Mike Tomlin could be a target of the Washington Redskins\u2019 head coaching search.\n\nBut if the Steelers simply take care of business Monday night and prevail at home against the winless Miami Dolphins, things actually will be looking up for them for a change in 2019. That would give them a two-game winning streak and a not-completely-dismal record of 3-4 as their season nears its midway point.\n\nAD\n\nThe Steelers are coming off their bye week. That followed a home-away-from-home triumph over the Chargers, with many Steelers fans on hand in Los Angeles. The victory over the Chargers was orchestrated by third-string quarterback Devlin Hodges, with fill-in starter Mason Rudolph sidelined after suffering a concussion on a hit by Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas. Rudolph returns to the lineup Monday.\n\nAD\n\nDolphins at Steelers\n\nWhen: Monday at 8:15 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Heinz Field in Pittsburgh\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nStreaming: fuboTV\n\nThe Steelers have had a conservative offensive approach while either Rudolph or Hodges has been at quarterback. Rudolph has played in four games this season, making three starts, and has reached 200 passing yards in a game only once. But it has worked relatively well. He has seven touchdown passes, two interceptions and a passer rating of 102.5. The Steelers are 1-2 in his starts, with losses to the San Francisco 49ers and the Ravens and a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. It will be interesting to see if the Steelers stick to the short passing game with Rudolph or allow him to throw the ball down the field a bit more.\n\nAD\n\nThe Dolphins just traded running back Kenyan Drake to the Arizona Cardinals as they continue to dismantle their roster and stockpile draft picks, an approach that has led to an 0-6 record and allegations that they are tanking. Drake joins left tackle Laremy Tunsil, wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Minkah Fitzpatrick among the prominent Dolphins players to have been traded. Fitzpatrick, dealt to the Steelers for a first-round choice, faces his former team in this game.\n\nAD\n\nThe Dolphins have been relatively close in recent weeks to breaking into the win column. Coach Brian Flores, after switching back to veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback, called for a two-point conversion that would have beaten the Redskins, but it failed in a 17-16 loss. The Dolphins had a fourth-quarter lead at Buffalo in their previous game but couldn\u2019t hold on and lost, 31-21. Could this be the game in which Flores and his players finally break through and scuttle the organization\u2019s chances to have the top overall selection in next year\u2019s NFL draft?\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Mason Rudolph returns to the lineup at QB for Pittsburgh, as safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, traded as part of Miami\u2019s dismantling, faces his former team.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wcC1cfwbgLJ-6cZXIeM0e_mZKRg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4YETF4HZ5EI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
