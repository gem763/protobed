Ahn Young-joon/Pool via REUTERS/File photo\n\nKim Myong Gil praised Trump\u2019s \u201cwise political decision\u201d to seek a new approach to the stalled talks without a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d in the U.S. administration - an apparent reference to John Bolton, Trump\u2019s hawkish former national security adviser, who was fired last week.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday Bolton\u2019s suggestion for a Libyan model of denuclearization for North Korea \u201cset us back very badly,\u201d while his own diplomacy had resulted in the country freezing nuclear tests and returning remains of U.S. soldiers missing from the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\n\u201cSo I think John really should take a look at how badly they\u2019ve done in the past and maybe a new method would be very good,\u201d Trump said, when asked about news reports saying that Bolton thought talks with North Korea were doomed to failure.\n\nKim Myong Gil said he wanted to be \u201coptimistic\u201d that the United States would present the \u201cright calculation method at the upcoming talks,\u201d an apparent reference to a call by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for Washington to show more flexibility.\n\n\u201cAt the moment I am not quite sure what he (Trump) implied in his suggestion of \u2018new method\u2019 but to me it seems he wanted to imply that a step-by-step solution starting with the things feasible first while building trust in each other would be the best option,\u201d Kim added in a statement carried by North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency.\n\nThe White House did not respond when asked to elaborate on Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe State Department repeated a past statement, saying: \u201cWe welcome the North Korean commitment to resume negotiations in late September. We are prepared to have those discussions at a time and place to be agreed.\u201d\n\nIt did not respond when asked if there could be any contacts with the North Koreans on the sidelines of next week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly in New York, which Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are due to attend.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations said early this month that the country\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, would not attend the annual gathering of world leaders \u201cdue to his schedule\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to engage with North Korea nearly fell apart in February after he followed Bolton\u2019s advice at a second summit in Hanoi and handed Kim Jong Un a piece of paper urging Pyongyang to transfer all of its nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States.\n\nPyongyang has denounced Bolton, who has advocated using military force to topple the leadership of the isolated country, as a \u201cwar maniac\u201d and \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\nWhile negotiations have stalled since Hanoi, North Korea said this month that it was willing to restart working-level talks in late September, but no date or location have been set.\n\nThe KCNA statement formally confirmed Kim Myong Gil as North Korea\u2019s new chief negotiator, after diplomatic sources told Reuters in July that he would act as counterpart to U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun.", "description": "North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator welcomed on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that a \"new method\" be used in talks on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431915819&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0LY", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
