Instead, though this is an ongoing negotiation, it\u2019s allowed its national trading interests to become a tool in Trump\u2019s election campaign strategy. In wheeling and dealing on trade, \"America first\" is in reality \"Trump first\".\n\nJapan very successfully stuck to its original trade negotiating parameters on agriculture \u2014 no more than offered under the TPP \u2014 but this approach weakened Japan\u2019s position rather than strengthened it. It was the equivalent of saying \"we will concede up to the same level as the TPP\".\n\nUsing this tactic, the Abe government gave certainty to its own farm voters in the lead-up to the July Upper House elections but at the same time lost its bargaining power, hobbling its ability to negotiate on the offensive. Originally, alongside the principle of no concessions on agriculture beyond the TPP, was another Japanese demand: abolition of the 2.5 per cent tariff on cars.\n\nThis was also agreed on in the TPP but was met with little response from the US side. Instead, Trump got away with not giving away anything on cars given their importance to Trump\u2019s election goals in key \u2018rust belt\u2019 states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump also demanded that Japan accept an emergency import of US corn separate from the agreement, which Abe accommodated with the highly dubious claim that Japan needed surplus US corn to cover losses in domestic production caused by a pest problem.\n\nThe result on the most critical issue for Japan \u2014 US tariffs on Japanese cars and car parts \u2014 was a negative. Bloomberg\n\nThe so-called \"balance sheet\" in the trade agreement was not balanced at all. Japan ended up making almost all the crucial concessions, not the United States.\n\nThe US \"concession\" on rice \u2014 a tariff-free rice quota of up to 70,000 tons a year\u2013 was a political if not an economic gain for Japan. It was originally agreed to in the TPP but was approved by Trump because domestic pressure on this market access issue is virtually zero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agreement enables Trump to use gains from the US\u2013Japan agreement to partially compensate for the losses of American farmers in the trade war with China. Like China, Japan could have played hardball in negotiations knowing Trump is needy for victories on agriculture. Instead, it offered its agricultural market concessions up front.\n\nIt was Trump who unilaterally left the TPP, so Japan was not required to engage in the negotiations. Trump told Japan that it did not need to negotiate, but if it didn\u2019t, the United States intended to impose substantial, additional tariffs on cars.\n\nIn short, Japan\u2019s entry into the negotiations was motivated by the threat of sanctions. This violates its basic stance in trade agreements, which is not to engage in negotiations motivated by sanctions. Japanese car executives, however, were much more concerned about the imposition of additional tariffs than the abolition of the 2.5 per cent tariff agreed in the TPP and are pleased that these have not eventuated.\n\nSection 232 will hang over Japan\u2019s head like the Sword of Damocles as long as US\u2013Japan trade negotiations continue. The current deal is the product of only round one of these negotiations.\n\nIn round two, which is expected to be a more wide-ranging trade deal, Japan will be again negotiating under the threat of sanctions. This includes additional tariffs and even the possibility of a quantitative cap on car exports.\n\nThe US\u2013Japan trade negotiations look like a never-ending story played according to Trump\u2019s rules. Not only does the current trade deal undermine Japan\u2019s much-touted claim to be the flagbearer of free trade and Abe\u2019s desire to raise the flag of free trade high, but the agreement could also be criticised as a \"dirty FTA\" that ignores the WTO.\n\nIn reaching the deal, Japan has de facto prioritised cooperation with Trump\u2019s re-election goals while ignoring multilateral trade negotiation principles.\n\nThe postponement of a deal on cars \u2014 Japan\u2019s primary export to the United States \u2014 means that the liberalisation rate of the agreement will only be around 60 to 70 per cent on a trade value basis, not the 90 per cent or \"substantially all trade\" required by WTO rules for FTAs.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the agreement\u2019s just an interim agreement that can be used in the short term for Mr Trump\u2019s own immediate electoral gains without commitment in the long term to a principled end.\n\nAurelia George Mulgan is Professor in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, Canberra.
