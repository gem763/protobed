ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State.\n\nGraham also said he believed the United States and Kurdish forces long allied with Washington could establish a venture to modernize Syrian oil fields, with the revenue flowing to the Kurds. \"President Trump is thinking outside the box,\" Graham said of Trump's thinking on oil.\n\n\"The president appreciates what the Kurds have done,\" Graham added. \"He wants to make sure ISIS does not come back. I expect we will continue to partner with the Kurds in Eastern Syria to make sure ISIS does not re-emerge.\"\n\nGraham, referring to the Kurdish fighters in the region, had previously warned that Trump's decision to pull out U.S. troops would lead to their \"destruction.\"\n\n(Reporting by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump's decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, said on Sunday he now believed \"historic solutions\" were possible.
