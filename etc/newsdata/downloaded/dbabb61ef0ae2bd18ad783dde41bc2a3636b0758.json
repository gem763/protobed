However, the price of newly built units is also sensitive to construction costs.\n\nStatistics Canada produces a quarterly construction price index that accounts for what the contractors charge for labour, materials, overhead and profit. Excluded from the index are taxes, land costs, design and real estate fees.\n\n\u201cPrices charged by contractors for residential (+2.7 per cent) and non-residential (+3.9 per cent) building construction were up over the 12-month period ending in the second quarter\u201d of 2019, the agency reported.\n\nConstruction cost increases are not uniform across the country. At 5.2 per cent, Ottawa recorded the highest increase in residential construction costs year-over-year. In Vancouver, residential construction costs were up by 4.8 per cent.\n\nResearch in the U.S. has shown that labour costs vary much more than material costs across cities. In New York City, labour costs were 31.3 per cent higher than the average for the 30 largest cities. Similarly, labour costs were 25.6 per cent higher in San Francisco and 16.8 per cent higher in Chicago. This makes construction even more expensive in large and dense cities.\n\nTwo factors contributed to the closing price gap between low- and high-rise units. First, the increase in low-rise housing prices slowed in 2017. Second, construction costs of high-rise housing increased significantly.\n\nIn addition to the increase in material costs, changes in labour costs also affect new home prices.\n\nIn times of labour scarcity, wages rise more sharply. Some trades, such as tower crane operators and elevator constructors and mechanics, are more sensitive to labour shortages because of a lack of certified workers.\n\nVince Siu is a building industry consultant whose clients include Canada\u2019s major high-rise builders. Mr. Siu estimates that construction costs have escalated by 30 per cent in the past few years in high-demand housing markets, such as Toronto and Vancouver. The \u201cexponential\u201d increase in labour costs for high-rise construction is because of the scarcity of contractors and labour for forming, excavating and other trades including electricians.\n\nResidential builders must pre-sell a large proportion of planned units to qualify for construction financing. Builders sign contracts with buyers who submit deposits against a pre-determined price to be paid in full when units are ready for occupancy. This commits builders and buyers to a fixed price.\n\nFor projects still in the planning stage, an unexpected increase in construction costs, resulting from labour, materials or delays due to regulation, forces builders to decide whether to continue or abandon the project. Because the price of the units is already fixed and is not sensitive to changes in construction costs, an increase in costs can adversely impact the feasibility of a residential project.\n\nWhen cost increases are substantial, builders may opt to cancel the project. Such cancellations could hurt a builder\u2019s reputation and also impose considerable inconvenience on buyers whose purchasing power will be eroded by rising house prices.\n\nHard construction costs come on top of land costs which also contribute to the overall cost of construction, and can be substantial.\n\nAltus Group\u2019s estimates suggest that for high-density residential developments in Vancouver, for instance, land cost (as a function of the buildable area) ranges from below $100 per square foot to over $300 per square foot.\n\nThus, to build a 100,000 square-foot high-density residential building in Vancouver, land costs could vary from under $10 to over $30 million. By comparison, land costs for a similar sized building will range from $2.5 to $4.5 million in Calgary and from $50 to $225 million in Toronto.\n\nHard construction costs \u2014 exclusive of land costs, fees, and taxes \u2014 do not differ as widely as land prices. According to Altus Group, hard construction costs for a 40 to 60 storey condominium building range between $215 and $280 per square foot in Vancouver and between $200 and $260 per square foot in Calgary and Toronto.\n\nThus, scapegoating unbridled demand, speculation, foreign buyers and money launderers for house price inflation may not be the right societal or policy response. We have argued that housing affordability could best be addressed by increasing housing supply. However, if construction costs are rising, supply alone will not be sufficient to provide immediate relief from house price escalation.\n\nConcerted efforts to moderate material and labour costs and streamlining regulations will also be needed in the mix of strategies to improve housing affordability.\n\nMurtaza Haider is a professor of Real Estate Management at Ryerson University.
