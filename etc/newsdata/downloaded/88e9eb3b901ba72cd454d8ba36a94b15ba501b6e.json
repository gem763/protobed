Heckler interrupts PM Johnson", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson was heckled by a protester in northern England on Friday over his controversial decision to suspend parliament for more than a month in the weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union.\n\nJohnson, a former London mayor who helped lead the campaign to leave the EU, has angered his critics by suspending parliament until Oct. 14.\n\nThe government has said it is a normal part of the process of launching a new legislative programme, but Johnson\u2019s opponents have accused the prime minister of trying to prevent them scrutinising his Brexit plans.\n\n\u201cWhy are you not with them in parliament sorting out the mess that you have created,\u201d a man shouted as Johnson delivered a speech in Rotherham about giving more power to northern cities.\n\nAs he tried to return to his speech, Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m very happy to get back to parliament very soon.\u201d\n\nHe later said from the stage that the heckler had been thrown out, adding the man had \u201cleft prematurely, not necessarily under his own steam\u201d.\n\nIt was the third time this month that Johnson has been heckled in the North.\n\nJohnson, who took power seven weeks ago, is a polarising figure for campaigning vigorously to leave the EU, Britain\u2019s biggest geopolitical move in almost half a century.\n\nIn a speech setting out plans to give more powers to local authorities, he said that as a former city mayor he knew how local accountability can improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nAt this point the heckler intervened with a loudly shouted question: \u201cLike our MPs, Boris? Maybe get back to parliament?\u201d\n\nAs the man was removed, Johnson said: \u201cWe want to see towns and communities able to represent that guy and sort out his needs.\u201d\n\nLast week, a man interrupted Johnson as he gave a television interview in the street, saying he should be spending more time negotiating with the EU.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEarlier on Friday, Johnson was confronted by an angry woman who criticised the Conservative government\u2019s spending cuts introduced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe government has now said austerity is over and has promised the biggest spending increases in 15 years,\n\n\u201cPeople have died because of austerity,\u201d the woman said, \u201cand you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson was heckled by a protester in northern England on Friday over his controversial decision to suspend parliament for more than a month in the weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429461434&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1EE", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
