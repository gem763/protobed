It was signed by committee chair Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \u2014 signifying that the panel is pursuing the politically explosive issue on a bipartisan basis.\n\n\u201cIn order to ascertain the appropriate path forward for your client while protecting your client\u2019s privacy, we are writing to request that you make your client available for a closed bipartisan interview with Committee counsel no later than Friday, September 27, 2019, in a mutually agreeable secure location,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nSen.

A committee spokeswoman declined comment. \u201cSince you showed me the letter, I can confirm its authenticity,\u201d wrote Bakaj\u2019s law partner Mark Zaid in an email to Yahoo News. \u201cBut I cannot comment on the substance at this time. The letter speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nAfter the letter was sent, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the whistleblower\u2019s lawyer informed him the official \u201cwould like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance\u201d from the acting Director of National Intelligence on his appearance, which could come \u201cas soon as this week.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so.\n\n\n\nWe\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019\n\n(The acting head of national intelligence, Trump appointee Joseph Maguire, has refused to hand over the complaint to Congress but is slated to appear before Schiff\u2019s committee on Thursday.)\n\nAt almost the same time, Trump announced on Twitter that he would release \u201cthe complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d tomorrow of his phone conversation with the president of Ukraine that is at the heart of the whistleblower complaint \u2014 although not the complaint itself.\n\nI am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThe committee\u2019s request for an interview increases pressure on the Trump White House over an issue that seems increasingly likely to trigger a formal impeachment inquiry in the House. The fact that Burr has joined the request for more information immediately sends a signal that even some Senate Republicans \u2014 until now, almost all loyal to Trump \u2014 acknowledge the need for more information about the explosive allegations that Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to do his bidding in an attempt to smear his potential Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The Senate Intelligence Committee has opened its own inquiry and is seeking a quick interview with the whistleblower who filed the initial complaint with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, according to a letter obtained by Yahoo News.", "authors": ["Michael Isikoff", "Chief Investigative Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IC.ddVbY.XfhiTMW9dLdkQ--~B/aD0zOTI4O3c9NTg5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f749f830-def3-11e9-aede-7c67835b02d2", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
