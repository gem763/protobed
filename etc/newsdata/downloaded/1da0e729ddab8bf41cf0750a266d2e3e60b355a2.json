Painful moment Norwegian 'death diver' bellyflops off a 89ft shipping container crane", "language": "en", "text": "Smacking the water with a deafening slap, this is the heart-skipping moment a daredevil leaps off a 89ft crane for a colossal bellyflop.\n\nIn what is believed to the highest 'death dive' ever filmed, Emil Lybekk performed the jaw-dropping jump to promote a water sports festival in Moss, Norway.\n\nBut nothing looked fun about this extreme activity, with the so-called death diver emerging from the sea wincing in agony.\n\nEmil Lybekk, who was promoting a water sports festival in Moss, Norway, winces with pain after completing the 80ft bellyflop\n\nFootage filmed by his awestruck friend on the dock below captured the bellyflop from October 16.\n\nThe short clip shows Mr Lybekk perched on top of a shipping container which is suspended below the arm of a cargo crane.\n\nThe tiny figure of the diver pushes himself off and plummets towards the sea with his body positioned horizontal.\n\nA nail-biting two seconds pass as he plunges through the air, with the people on the shore gasping.\n\nJust before he smacks the water, the death diver appears to scrunch up his arms and legs to avoid taking impact directly on his stomach.\n\nThe tiny figure of the man leaps from the top of a cargo container and begins to plummet through the air\n\nHe positions his body horizontally, as per the rules of 'death diving' which sees participants spread their arms and legs for as long as possible\n\nA powerful slapping noise erupts as water is sprayed up into the air and crashes back down.\n\nBut the noise from the impact is quickly drowned out by the cries from Mr Lybekk's friends on shore, who go into meltdown at the stunt.\n\nWhile the stunned spectators continue to whoop and cheer, the diver swims back to the jetty and hauls himself up a metal ladder.\n\nHis friend filming yells 'you're crazy bro!' and helps Mr Lybekk - who is grimacing with pain - up on to the dock.\n\nJust before he smacks the water, the death diver appears to scrunch up his arms and legs to avoid taking impact directly on his stomach (left). As he plunges down, water is sprayed up into the air (right)\n\nDeath diving - or D\u00f8dsing as it's known in Norway - is one of the country's most extreme sports.\n\nIt sees people jump horizontally from typically 30ft diving boards with their arms and legs outstretched.\n\nThe aim is to hold this position as close to the water as possible, hence the diver in Moss curling up his body inches away from impact.\n\nThe surface area of stomach smacking the water with such force inevitably results in some grisly injuries, with divers often emerging with bloodied bellies.", "description": "In what is believed to the highest 'death dive' ever filmed, the man performed the jaw-dropping jump to promote a water sports festival in Moss, Norway.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20317034-0-image-a-13_1572346519964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
