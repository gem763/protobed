But after looking deeply into the economic data, he concludes that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason\u201d for the economy to topple into recession. The usual suspects are missing. For instance, there\u2019s no inventory overhang, nor is monetary policy too tight.\n\nHowever, \u201cpolitical risks have a logic of their own,\u201d he says. He\u2019s talking about Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, of course, but also such geopolitical risks as Brexit, North Korea, Iran, and others.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll continue to take risks on trade and push us over the edge,\u201d he predicts, putting the odds of recession by the end of 2020 at slightly more than 50-50.\n\nIt\u2019s not inevitable. \u201cWe could have a solid year\u201d if businesses get some clarity about global trade rules, he says.\n\nThe trade war is so damaging to the economy, in part, because no one is really sure what Trump\u2019s ultimate goals are. What would \u201cvictory\u201d look like? Crandall says the U.S. goal ought to be forging a new relationship with China, not just reaching a \u201cdeal\u201d about how many airplanes and soybeans they\u2019ll buy from us.\n\nIt\u2019s not really the level of trade with China that\u2019s important but the terms of that trade. That\u2019s harder to negotiate, especially if the U.S. president and his negotiators are more concerned about the levels.\n\nTo say that politics is the main risk is not to say there aren\u2019t worries in the economy and financial system.\n\nSome asset prices are elevated, such as leveraged loans in the nonfinancial corporate sector. But Crandall thinks the regulatory reforms, such as Dodd-Frank, have lessened the contagion effect from these kinds of imbalances. He doesn\u2019t think leveraged loans will bring down the economy the way toxic mortgages and collateralized debt obligations brought down the economy in 2007 and \u201908.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has good reason to be somewhat confident that the regulatory reforms have been enough \u2014 that the intermediaries won\u2019t fail,\u201d he says.\n\nHis victory in the August contest was the fourth time Crandall has won our forecasting contest, which is designed to bring recognition to the economists who do the best job of forecasting the economic data that matter most.\n\nWhile a fair amount of luck is involved in winning the monthly contest, we\u2019ve found that, over time, some forecasters tend to do better than others. Crandall is one of them. Over the past year, Crandall is one of the 10 most accurate forecasters among the 44 we track in our contest.\n\nFor his forecasting, Crandall says that he\u2019s less interested in getting the point estimate right than in telling his clients where the risks are.\n\nFor instance, he \u201carbitrarily\u201d lowered his model\u2019s forecast for the August payrolls that were released on Friday by 30,000 because August payroll figures have been consistently underestimated year after year by the Bureau of Labor Statistics by 50,000 to 100,000 in the initial report, only to be revised higher later.\n\n\u201cWe compromised on a more modest initial undercount simply as a way of flagging the issue for readers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat was a good call, because his estimate of 125,000 was very close to the BLS estimate of 130,000, especially compared with the MarketWatch consensus estimate of 170,000. It\u2019s a good start for Crandall in the September contest, which covers data releases this month.\n\nCrandall\u2019s forecast Number as initially reported* ISM 50.5% 51.2% Nonfarm payrolls 150,000 164,000 Trade deficit -$54.8 billion -$55.2 billion Retail sales 0.2% 0.7% Industrial production 0.3% -0.2% Consumer price index 0.3% 0.3% Housing starts 1.205 million 1.191 million Durable goods orders 1.8% 2.1% Consumer confidence index 127.0 135.1 New-home sales 635,000 635,000 *Subject to revision\n\nIn the August contest, Crandall nailed the forecasts for three of the 10 indicators we track: the consumer price index, housing starts, and new-home sales. His forecasts on two others \u2014 the trade deficit and durable-goods orders \u2014 were among the 10 most accurate.\n\nThe runners up in the August contest were Paul Ashworth\u2019s team at Capital Economics, Ryan Sweet of Moody\u2019s Analytics, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha, and Lewis Alexander\u2019s team at Nomura Securities.\n\nThe MarketWatch median consensus published in our Economic Calendar includes the predictions of the 15 forecasters who have earned the most points in our contest over the past 12 months, plus the forecast of the most recent winner of the monthly contest.\n\nThe economists in our consensus forecast are: Christophe Barraud of Market Securities, Ryan Sweet of Moody\u2019s Analytics, Jim O\u2019Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macro, Michelle Girard\u2019s team at NatWest Markets, Richard Moody of Regions Financial, Andrew Hollenhorst of Citigroup, Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase, Lou Crandall of Wrightson ICAP, Seth Carpenter\u2019s team at UBS, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha, Stephen Stanley of Amherst Pierpont Securities, Ward McCarthy of Jefferies, Paul Ashworth\u2019s team at Capital Economics, and Lewis Alexander\u2019s team at Nomura Securities.", "description": "Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP and the winner of MarketWatch\u2019s Forecaster of the Month contest, says the economy is OK, but political risks...", "authors": ["Rex Nutting"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ959_cranda_ZG_20190909142307.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
