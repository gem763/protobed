Until this week, Marlon Anderson was a high school security guard in Madison, Wisconsin, a job he had held at various schools for 11 years. Last Wednesday, he was asked to help remove a disruptive student from the school and the situation turned ugly. Anderson summarized his experience on Facebook this way: \u201cI get called a [email protected]# @ss Ni\u20ac\u20acA by a student, I responded do \u2018not call me ni\u20ac\u20aca !\u2019 And I got fired.\u201d The NY Times provides a more detailed account of what happened:\n\nThe student, a 17-year-old senior, had finished classes for the day and had taken another student\u2019s cellphone when the assistant principal intervened, according to Mr. Anderson, who said the student then pushed the assistant principal. As Mr. Anderson was trying to escort the student out of the building, he said, the student taunted him with the racial slur about 15 times. He said he repeatedly told the student to stop using the slur, which he himself repeated several times. That\u2019s when he said the assistant principal, Jennifer Talarczyk, turned on the microphone of her walkie-talkie, so that Mr. Anderson could be overheard by school administrators and members of the security staff. He said Ms. Talarczyk told him to \u201ctap out\u201d and remove himself from the confrontation with the student. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be called that word,\u201d Mr. Anderson said in the interview. \u201cI have a right to not be called that word, I believe. I feel like she tolerated it for the entire ordeal.\u201d\n\nAnderson is right. He shouldn\u2019t have to tolerate that abuse from a 17-year-old punk. It\u2019s understandable if it got him a bit heated. So long as he didn\u2019t overreact by getting physical with the student (and no one is claiming that) this shouldn\u2019t have been an issue. So why would the school fire an 11-year employee for telling someone else not to direct the N-word at him? Because of the school\u2019s new zero-tolerance policy:\n\n\u201cSo if the class is reading \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019 and the teacher is reading the book out loud and it gets to the part where the N-word is, the teacher gets fired?\u201d Mr. Anderson asked. \u201cIt has nothing to do with context, but it has everything to do with the actual word.\u201d Gloria Reyes, the school board president for the Madison Metropolitan School District, said in a statement on Thursday that the policy would be re-examined. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a tough stance on racial slurs, and we believe that language has no place in schools,\u201d Ms. Reyes said. \u201cWe have also heard from the community about the complexity involved \u2014 and our duty to examine it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m all for discouraging staff and students from using this language in school, but punishing Anderson, in this case, makes no sense. I can certainly imagine other circumstances where this could lead to a justifiable firing. If Anderson had said it first, okay. If he used the word in retaliation against the student who was attacking him with it, probably. But all he allegedly did here was demand a little respect and tell the student not to direct that word at him. Wasn\u2019t that the point of the whole crackdown in the first place?\n\nThe district needs to give this man his job back and offer him an apology for this dumb over-reaction.\n\nHere\u2019s a local news report in which Anderson gets emotional about the incident. \u201cMy father was called this word. My grandmother. My grandfather\u2026We were all called this word and not one of them could say \u2018Don\u2019t call me that!\u2019 I can.\u201d", "description": "\"...how can a black man lose his job for telling a student to not call him the N-word.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Marlon-Anderson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
