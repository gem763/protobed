However, they have \u201cspecific areas\u201d they\u2019d like to focus on, including \u201cenvironmental, social and economical charities we want to deal with.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost likely we\u2019ll work closely with the judges in choosing which ones we want to donate to,\u201d said John.\n\nSo far, the couple has recruited Zhu to serve as one of the judges on the event, alongside former Ms. Nevada Katie Williams, who claims that she was stripped of her title and disqualified from the upcoming Ms. America Pageant after voicing her conservative values on social media. They\u2019ve also brought on Rob Smith, author of Confessions of a Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell Soldier: How a Black, Gay Man Survived the Infantry, Coming Out, and the War in Iraq.\n\nThe Carlsons are also hoping to recruit a judge with more liberal-leaning views to balance things out, but realize that may be a bit of a challenge.\n\n\u201cWe want to get someone on the judge panel that has the opposite views, because we do realize they are now all people who have conservative views,\u201d said John. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d also love to recruit contestants from across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be mostly conservatives who support it, and we\u2019re kind of standing up for conservatives whose voices have been silenced or stifled, but we do want to include everyone,\u201d John added. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have people who have liberal views enter into the pageant. No matter their race, religion, sexual orientation, we\u2019d like them to be involved.\u201d\n\nWhile the couple understood they\u2019d receive a heavy dose of criticism, they say the response has been a bit shocking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of hate mail and backlash,\u201d said the Carlsons. \u201cI think in one day we got 50 or 60 emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to start a conversation and kind of change the connotation of MAGA to, just because this person has conservative views doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s this horrible racist person, like this stereotype,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cAnd to show people, like, you know me so why do you think just because now I\u2019m saying I have conservative [views] I\u2019m this totally different person? Because I\u2019m not ... We want to close the gap politically and get people talking to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cMAGA stands for \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 and some people view it as one thing, others view it as another, and I feel like no matter whether you\u2019re conservative, liberal, whatever you believe, if you live in this country, you should want America to be great, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all about,\u201d said John.\n\nIn a video on the event\u2019s Facebook page, the couple asked interested parties to support their mission to bring the event to life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple told Yahoo they\u2019re hoping to raise between $75,000 and $100,000 in order to bring the event nationwide coverage. They have also created a GoFundMe page for the event, which has currently raised $50.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Louisiana couple is planning to host a Miss MAGA Pageant with the mission to \u201cpreserve and promote the values of hard work, family and patriotism that helped make America great.\u201d", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yUPbYc.rkRaNxN5bIR.tvA--~B/aD0xMDA4O3c9MTAzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c5aa7930-d26e-11e9-9ff7-f5e3ad33871a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
