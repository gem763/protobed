Some farmers choose to use chemical means to provide this protection; some use biopesticides; others use a mixture of both chemical and natural origin. The reality is complex and one agricultural system shouldn\u2019t be pitted against the other.\n\nEach production system comes with advantages and disadvantages, often depending on region, climatic condition and the crop being grown, among other factors.\n\nWhat is certain is that the debate around protecting crops with pesticides has never been more controversial than it is today.\n\nThe EU arguably has the most stringent system in the world when it comes to assessing pesticides before they are put on the market.\n\nNow, although my organization ECPA and I may not necessarily agree with some of the opinions being put forward questioning the use of pesticides, their role or their safety, as a sector, we must acknowledge these arguments and listen to these concerns. We can\u2019t ignore what society is telling us. Whether we like it or not. We must engage in an open, transparent and constructive dialogue in order to improve the efficiency and the acceptability of our solutions.\n\nHowever, one fact remains true: the EU arguably has the most stringent system in the world when it comes to assessing pesticides before they are put on the market. This has been acknowledged by the recent Special Committee set up by the European Parliament to evaluate the EU\u2019s authorization system for pesticides, known as the PEST committee.\n\nOur industries invest six billion euros a year to develop the products of tomorrow. Science is evolving and so are we. Our solutions are very different from the ones we offered 30 years ago. R&D and innovation are at the heart of our members\u2019 business. But they need to have confidence in the system to continue investing. Science should guide the decision-making process, not emotions or fears.\n\nUnfortunately, however, regulatory compliance does not always equal societal acceptance.\n\nGlobally, up to 40 per cent of production is lost annually as a result of pests and diseases. And what is important to note is that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that these losses could double if farmers aren\u2019t given access to crop protection measures.\n\nThe reality is that there is no silver bullet. ECPA\u2019s members provide farmers with a full toolbox of solutions: from biopesticides to chemical solutions; from substances used in conservation agriculture to herbicides for wheat production; or pheromones for viticulture. And in order to address global challenges such as fighting climate change, improving resource efficiency and feeding the world\u2019s growing population we need to acknowledge that farmers need tools to protect their crops.\n\nGlobally, up to 40 per cent of production is lost annually as a result of pests and diseases.\n\nI feel however that a true understanding of the way that food is produced is still missing, as is the comprehension of the trade-offs to be considered when looking at different production models. The reality is we need to explain the role that crop protection plays in food production.\n\nIf European farmers were to stop using any pesticides, would we be ready to face a drastic change in agricultural output? Is Europe prepared to be food insecure in some years? Are EU consumers willing to pay a much higher price for a restricted variety of products? Are our leaders happy to reduce exports of EU farmers\u2019 high-quality products?\n\nThese are all considerations that we should confront when we talk about removing the tools necessary to adequately protect crops from pests and diseases. Not to mention the additional resources, such as the increased amount of land and water that would be necessary to produce food.\n\n2019 has been a year of political change in Europe. A new EU Commission and Parliament are asking \u2014 quite rightly \u2014for more sustainable agriculture. Our sector, with the toolbox of solutions that it provides, is ready to assume increased responsibilities and play a significant role in preparing the ground for tomorrow based on scientific-evidence, transparency and respect for all views on this most polarizing \u2014 but important \u2014 of topics.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Organic and conventional farmers need innovative crop protection for healthy harvests, and to contribute to a safe, affordable and sustainable food supply", "authors": ["G\u00e9raldine Kutas", "Director General", "European Crop Protection Association", "Ecpa"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ECPA-Soil_AdobeStock_83599224-240dpi-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
