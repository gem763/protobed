The conversation, Yang added, only served to benefit the president ahead of a contentious reelection battle.\n\n\"When we're talking about Donald Trump, we are losing to Donald Trump, even if it's in the context of talking about impeaching him,\" Yang said.\n\nYang indicated support for the House's impeachment inquiry last month when he tweeted that impeachment was the \"right\" move for the Democratic-controlled House to take after news broke that Trump has asked Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump knocks Romney as 'Democrat secret asset' in new video Giuliani asked State Dept. to grant visa for ex-Ukraine official at center of Biden allegations: report Perry won't comply with subpoena in impeachment inquiry MORE, one of Yang's competitors for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cGiven the President\u2019s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward. Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency\u2019s inquiry is egregious,\u201d Yang tweeted late last month.\n\n\u201cThere have to be limits and Congress is right to act,\u201d he continued.\n\nYang has also previously warned that such a move will inflame the president's base, and would be \"impractical\" due to the low chance of success in the Senate.\n\n\u201cGiven the current composition of Congress, impeachment would almost certainly not succeed. And then you would wind up inflaming a certain proportion of the president's base with this persecution complex no matter what he does after a failed impeachment process.\u201d Yang said earlier in September. \u201cIt's impractical to champion impeachment just based upon the fact that Republicans still hold so many seats in Congress.\u201d", "description": "Businessman Andrew Yang, a 2020 Democratic candidate for president, said in a new interview that he remains skeptical that the Republican-held Senate would vote to convict President Trump if the House were to impeach him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/yangandrew_091919gn10_lead_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
