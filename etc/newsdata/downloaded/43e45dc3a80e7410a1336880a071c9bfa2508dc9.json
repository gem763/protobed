The stories also include instances of sexual harassment and racism they experienced at the search advertising company.\n\n\"I identify as a LatinX female and I experienced blatant racist and sexist things from my coworker. I reported it up to where my manager knew, my director knew, the coworker's manager knew and our HR representative knew. Nothing happened,\" one story reads. \"I was warned that 'things will get very serious if continued.' I definitely felt the theme of 'protect the man' as we so often hear about. No one protected me, the victim. I thought Google was different.\"\n\nAccording to a current Google employee who spoke to Motherboard, the stories were collected on an internal site called \"go/retaliation-stories.\" Googlers started posting their store after employee activists Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton, known as co-organizers of the Google Walkout, publically declared they had been retaliated against, per the report.\n\nEileen Naughton, Google's VP of People Operations, told Business Insider on Monday that the company aims to \"provide care and support to people who raise concerns.\"\n\n\"Reporting misconduct takes courage and we want to provide care and support to people who raise concerns. All instances of inappropriate conduct reported to us are investigated rigorously, and over the past year we have simplified how employees can raise concerns and provided more transparency into the investigations process at Google. We work to be extremely transparent about how we handle complaints and the action we take,\" said Naughton's statement in full.\n\nRead more: A Google engineering director who is black said he would be accosted less at work if he dressed like a janitor\n\nOn May 1st, around 1,000 Google employees staged a sit-in in offices around the country to protest what they said was a pattern of retaliation against workers who speak out for change at the company. It is unclear whether the stories shared at the sit-in coincide with those leaked on Monday, though the document released by Motherboard did say that it was last updated on May 8th, which would have been shortly after the protest.\n\nMore recently, former Googlers have spoken out about their time working at the tech giant, describing the racism they experienced at the company, and instances of retaliation for being pregnant.\n\nRead the full Motherboard report here.", "description": "Stories include allegations of being held back for promotions after complaining of misconduct at Google.", "authors": ["Nick Bastone"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2d9194a17d6c1328665995-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
