At least, it very much looks that way.\n\nNetflix dropped a behind-the-scenes video earlier today, confirming the remake of the beloved series has kicked off production in New Zealand.\n\nGood man John Cho will star in the lead role as bounty hunter Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir will play Jet Black, Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine, Alex Hassell as Vicious, and Elena Satine as Julia.\n\nThat\u2019s all the casting we know so far. As for the actual series, Netflix has ordered 10 episodes.\n\nChristopher Yost of Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok will write the first ep. Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, the director of the original anime, will serve as a consultant on the show.\n\nAnywho, the behind-the-scenes video is in corgi-vision and includes a solid glimpse at the human cast\u2026 and also, Ein lapping at some water.\n\nA GOOD BOY.\n\nCowboy Bebop aside, Netflix recently added all three seasons of Avatar: The Last Airbender to its service \u2013 a gentle reminder that it is also giving the beloved series the live-action treatment.\n\nNetflix announced the news a year ago and revealed the show\u2019s original creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are involved as showrunners.\n\nThis is a real sentence from the press release: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to realise Aang\u2019s world as cinematically as we always imagined it to be, and with a culturally appropriate, non-whitewashed cast.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not giving context to that quote. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, you\u2019re far better off that way.\n\nAnd, back to anime\u2026 Netflix is also working on a new Ghost in the Shell series due for release sometime in 2020.\n\nYES, A NEW GHOST IN THE SHELL ANIME IS COMING.\n\nGhost in the Shell: SAC_2045 will be directed by Appleseed\u2019s Shinji Aramaki and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\u2019s Kenji Kamiyama.
