Boston, which had won three straight AL East titles, would be eliminated from the division race with a loss in the series finale on Monday night.\n\nA veteran baseball executive who built a World Series champion in Miami and helped the Tigers win two AL pennants, Dombrowski was brought in to steady the Red Sox front office in 2015 with the team in the middle of back-to-back last-place finishes.\n\nThe Red Sox followed with three straight AL East titles - a first in franchise history, winning a club-record 108 games last season and their fourth World Series since 2004. From the start of Dombrowski\u2019s tenure on Aug. 18, 2015, through the beginning of this season, the Red Sox had posted a major-league best 320-210 (.604) record.\n\nBut this year\u2019s team - with largely the same roster as last year\u2019s - has gone 76-67, losing five of their first six games and never really getting back into contention in the division. While Dombrowski stood pat at the trade deadline, with a wild-card berth still in reach, the ballclub reeled off an eight-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cI just found out, so, surprised and shocked obviously,\u201d said Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was hired as a rookie manager by Dombrowksi before the 2018 season. \u201cRight now, not too much to say. We\u2019ll talk a little bit more tomorrow. But, he gave me a chance to come here and be a big league manager. It\u2019s one of those that they just told me so, I\u2019m not ready to talk about it.\u201d\n\nRight-hander Rick Porcello\u2019s career has been tied to Dombrowski\u2019s as much as any player. Dombrowski was the general manager of the Detroit Tigers when they drafted Porcello in the first round (27th overall pick) in 2007. Dombrowski traded Porcello to Boston in 2014, before following him in 2015.\n\nPorcello, who took the loss against the Yankees on Sunday, and his teammates learned of the move as the game ended.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still processing everything, processing myself, too,\u201d Porcello said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to reflect on it right now. I\u2019ll have potentially a better answer in a couple days but, yeah, you never like to see anybody lose their job over what we\u2019re doing on the field. And unfortunately that\u2019s the case right here.\n\n\u201cYou take lots of guilt with you as a player because you\u2019re the one that can make or break things and that\u2019s the part that hurts me.\u201d\n\nGregg said Boston\u2019s assistant general managers would share Dombrowski\u2019s duties for the final few weeks of the season. No other team officials were made available to the media. A formal announcement is expected on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Boston Red Sox parted ways Sunday with president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski less than a year after winning the World Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/red_sox_dombrowski_out_baseball_44859_c0-135-2355-1508_s1770x1032.jpg?bf15bae98cc8472b2970331a4d8415a6faa39067", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
