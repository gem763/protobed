Frizzy hair occurs as a result of dry hair soaking up moisture from the air.\n\n'The moisture penetrates into the hair strands structure, causing the strand to expose the cuticle, resulting in wild frizzy hair.'\n\nJason, who works all over the world, says that frizzy hair is when the cuticle in our hair soaks up the moisture in the air\n\nWeather its a change in weather or you're trying to avoid the frizz from the wet weather Jason says that no hair type is safe from the dreaded frizz\n\nStep by step to avoid the frizz\n\nSo how do you avoid it? Jason says it starts in the shower: 'Add as much moisture as possible when shampooing and conditioning, the key to fighting frizz is to ensure your hair has plenty of moisture - I would recommend using ones with coconut oil in - as it locks in that moisture.'\n\n'Apply a small amount of humidity proof styling lotion throughout the hair, from the roots to the ends. For this, I would recommend SheaMoisture's styling gel cream.\n\nThen you need to use the right tools: 'Using a round or flat brush, start at the ends of your hair and work towards the roots. Always hold the hairdryer about an inch away from the hair to prevent burning the hair and removing the moisture.\n\n'Always hold the hairdryer pointing downwards, as this will seal the moisture and the cuticle, which will help fight the elements.\n\nVictoria Beckham's hair always looks immaculate - and its because Jason uses the right technique to seal in the moisture\n\nJason recommends SheaMoisture Raw Shea & Cupuacu Frizz Defense Styling Gel Cream for helping seal in moisture\n\nSalon worthy hair at home\n\nMost of us come out of the salon and know that we'll never be able to recreate that look again, however Jason has give us some handy tips on how to get it right at home.\n\n'When it comes to having salon worthy hair at home, it's essential that you have the right tools and products, a good hairdryer can make all the difference.\n\n'I personally find that most people find it very easy to smooth out the hair by using the wrapping technique.\n\nThe wrapping technique is simply blow-drying the hair around the shape of the head, this preps and smooth the hair while adding volume and is a great way to achieve salon hair.\n\nMost of us come out of the salon and know that we'll never be able to recreate that look again, however Jason has give us some handy tips on how to get it right at home\n\nScalp care\n\nWe also don't think about our scalps until something's wrong with it, but we're constantly putting it under pressure - and Jason reveals that colouring our hair can even strip layers off the scalp.\n\nHe also says that hairdryers and even radiators in the house can impact it: 'It's not the cold weather that tends to affect the scalp, it's the elements around us such as heating units that tend to produce a really dry heat which can lead to the scalp becoming dry.\n\n'I would advise to watch the scalp for any dry patches and use a mask once a week to protect the scalp.'\n\nWhile he also recommends honey for the scalp: 'It is one of the world\u2019s greatest natural resources, due to its anti-flammatory and antioxidant capacities, which is why it is one of the best products to use after colour as the scalp can become inflamed due to the harsh chemicals and sometimes cause it to dry and flake.
