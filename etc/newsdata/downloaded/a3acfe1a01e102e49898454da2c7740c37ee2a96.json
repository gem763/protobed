Players slid through the puddles and the rain made it difficult to hold on to the ball.\n\nAs a result, the Redskins attempted just 12 passes \u2014 their fewest since Dec. 15, 1990, and just the 21st time in franchise history that the team threw 12 or fewer passes.\n\nAll but three of those games happened before 1965.\n\n\u201cIt definitely impacted the game plan,\u201d quarterback Case Keenum said. \u201c \u2026 We played the field position battle a few times, but it just didn\u2019t work out. Just being able to catch, snap and punt the ball in that weather was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nKeenum said the Redskins couldn\u2019t make any excuses, given the conditions were the same for San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco and Washington handled the weather differently. Like Washington, the 49ers relied heavily upon the run \u2014 rushing 39 times for 137 yards. But San Francisco also took shots down the field, something the Redskins rarely did.\n\nIn the socond half in particualr, 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was aggressively attacking deep. The 27-year-old found an open Richie James Jr. on a 40-yard completion, setting up San Francisco\u2019s first field goal.\n\nThe Redskins, meanwhile, went conservative. Even on third downs, Washington opted short throws, including targeting Sims on screens and shovel passes.\n\nDeep threats Paul Richardson and Terry McLaurin had just one and two targets, respectively.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we wanted some more (passing) attempts,\u201d Redskins interim coach Bill Callahan said, \u201cand we just didn\u2019t have that opportunity.\u201d\n\nSince taking over for Jay Gruden, Callahan has largely emphasized the run. Running back Adrian Peterson received at least 20 carries for the second straight game \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since weeks 7 and 8 last year.\n\nCallahan felt the Redskins got away from the formula that made them successful last season: Running the ball and making stops on defense.\n\nOn Sunday, the Redskins actually had success in both areas.\n\nThey kept San Francisco out of the end zone and Washington had 104 rushing yards on 26 attempts.\n\nBut Washington needed its passing game to produce, especially when the 49ers finally put points on the board.\n\nFor a moment, Keenum seemed to have found a groove. He hit tight end Jeremy Sprinkle for 13 yards and then two plays later found Trey Quinn down the sideline for 19. Quinn hauled the ball in, sliding out of bounds in the rain.\n\nOne play later, the Redskins went back to the run \u2014 and Peterson fumbled while taking a hit.\n\nIn the fourth, Keenum attempted just three passes, completing two for only two yards.\n\nSunday\u2019s loss marked the second week in a row in which Keenum struggled. He was also off in last week\u2019s win against the Miami Dolphins, completing just 52% of his passes.\n\nCallahan, however, said the Redskins won\u2019t turn to rookie Dwayne Haskins just yet. Washington has a short turnaround, having to face the Minnesota Vikings on \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d\n\n\u201cDwayne\u2019s still learning,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cHe\u2019d be the first one to tell you that. We still have faith, total faith in Case and his ability to manage this offense and run this offense and execute everything within it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving forward with Case at this juncture.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
