But I still think a Democratic LGBTQ townhall is a bad idea | Katie Herzog", "language": "en", "text": "On 10 October, nine Democratic candidates for president will do something that has never been done before: over the course of four and a half hours, they will talk about LGBTQ issues on national TV as part of the first-ever CNN homosexual and adjacent town hall.\n\nOnly four and a half hours? The climate change town hall got a full seven hours, and really, what\u2019s more important, climate change or queer rights? Sure, climate change will impact everyone on this planet, but, hello, the cast of Queer Eye deserves to have their concerns heard! I\u2019m joking of course, but the point still stands: an entire televised town hall dedicated to us seems counterproductive, for many reasons.\n\nI\u2019m a member of the LGBTQ \u201ccommunity\u201d, if you can really call a population that disagrees on basically everything except our superiority a \u201ccommunity\u201d, and as much as I appreciate potential world leaders pandering to me, I cannot think of a worse way for these people to spend their time. A Democratic LGBTQ town hall would be like Republicans holding a town hall on Ronald Reagan: they all agree! There\u2019s about as much daylight between their positions on, say, Trump\u2019s ban on trans people in the military as there is in the Mariana Trench. It would be more interesting to watch a town hall on something the candidates actually disagree about, like emotional support animals on planes or whether or not boot-cut jeans should make a comeback. We already know who the best is on LGBTQ rights: all of them! Especially compared with Donald Trump.\n\nLGBTQ people are not a monolith. We all have different values and opinions on public policy, and there are fierce debates within this population on matters ranging from trans people in sports to whether or not same-sex marriage is actually good for queer people. The candidates at this forum don\u2019t understand that \u2013 and why would they? Aside from Mayor Pete (who, according to some of the queer press, hardly counts), these are just not their issues. Attempting to wade into them on a live TV broadcast will just show actual queer people how little they get it.\n\nBy participating, the Democratic candidates will ultimately hurt their chances of beating Donald Trump, which will only, in the end, do much greater harm to queer people\n\nWe saw this at a forum on LGBTQ issues in Iowa. Joe Biden, for instance, said that prisoners should be housed based on their \u201csexual identity\u201d. What he should have said was \u201cgender identity\u201d, but instead, he made it sound like he was in favor of housing prisoners based on who they have sex with. It\u2019s a crazy idea, but if Biden wins, I can\u2019t wait to see what the gay men do with their wing at Sing Sing.\n\nBiden isn\u2019t alone in these gaffes. At an early debate, Juli\u00e1n Castro talked about the need for \u201ctrans females\u201d to access abortion, when what he should have said was \u201ctrans men\u201d, a population that generally does not like being called \u201cfemale\u201d. And Elizabeth Warren listed her pronouns on her Twitter bio, but she wrote \u201cshe/hers\u201d instead of \u201cshe/her\u201d. Such mistakes show she/her ignorance. By even trying, Warren and the others give ample ammunition to Donald Trump.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a bigger downside than getting terminology and pronouns wrong: whatever the candidates say at that forum will come back and haunt them. If Warren talks about the need for states to offer an \u201cX\u201d on driver\u2019s licenses for people who identify as nonbinary \u2013 something she\u2019s already endorsed \u2013 the attack ads will just write themselves. Nonbinary driver\u2019s licenses might play well in solidly blue cities and states, but thanks to the electoral college, Warren or Biden or Sanders or whoever wins the primary will have to appeal to a few moderate swing districts in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan to win the general election. This not how it should be, but it\u2019s the reality of the system that we have, and the Democrats need to start recognizing it.\n\nAre LGBTQ issues important? Of course. LGBTQ people still face discrimination in society and law, as well as disproportionate rates of homelessness and poverty. Some families still reject their queer children, some churches still refuse to recognize same-sex marriage, and in many states, it\u2019s still perfectly legal to fire people or deny them housing simply because of their sexuality or gender identity. All of this shows that, as much as progress has been made in recent years, there is still more to be done. But by participating in this event, the Democratic candidates will ultimately hurt their chances of beating Donald Trump, which will only, in the end, do much greater harm to queer people.\n\nAs I see it, the only possible winners here are Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang, who, citing scheduling conflicts, send their regrets. And Donald Trump, who, I imagine, will be watching.", "description": "I\u2019m a member of the LGBTQ \u2018community\u2019, and I couldn\u2019t think of a worse way to spend our time on national TV", "authors": ["Katie Herzog"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1860a57fda2d93f7a9f1b1d985b85131f0f21cda/0_273_5201_3120/master/5201.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c715f07fda199d237d8d334c006e1aa9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
