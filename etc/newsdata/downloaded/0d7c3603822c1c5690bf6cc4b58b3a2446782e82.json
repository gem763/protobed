REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d an origin story about Batman\u2019s comic-book nemesis, stars Joaquin Phoenix in what movie reviewers have called a brilliant but terrifying performance as a mentally unhinged outcast who unwittingly finds fame through an act of violence.\n\nThe DC Comics character is associated with a 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a screening of a different Batman film, \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d Families of some of the victims expressed concern about the new film and it will not be shown in the Aurora multiplex.\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and armed with assault rifles stood outside a screening of \u201cJoker\u201d at the New York Film Festival on Wednesday night, where audiences had their bags searched and K9 officers were on duty, video footage showed.\n\nPolice in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago said in statements that while they had no specific threats, they were deploying additional officers or closely monitoring movie theaters where the \u201cJoker\u201d is playing.\n\nHollywood website Deadline cited an unnamed New York law enforcement official as saying that plainclothes officers would be stationed inside some movie theaters in the city. The NYPD could not confirm the report.\n\nCharles Kiwacz, 31, said he saw the Aurora shooting as \u201can isolated incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any fear at all. I think it\u2019s the exact opposite - people wanting to go out and show that this movie can be just that - just a movie,\u201d the podcast host and producer said as he bought a ticket for \u201cJoker\u201d near New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nCostumes and face masks have been banned for moviegoers at two U.S. theater chains - AMC and Landmark - while the Alamo Drafthouse cinema group warned parents not to bring their children.\n\nThe Parents Television Council (PTC), a media watchdog, issued a similar warning on Thursday. \u201cParents may believe that this film is appropriate for kids given that is an extension of the popular Batman franchise,\u201d the PTC said in a statement.\n\nMovie studio Warner Bros. said last week that the film was not an endorsement of real-world violence.\n\n\u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero,\u201d Warner Bros. said in a statement.\n\nDespite the controversy, the movie is expected to take in a bumper $80 million or more on its opening weekend in North America, according to box-office analysts.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d director Todd Phillips criticized people who have attacked the film without seeing it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine the level of discourse that it\u2019s reached in the world, honestly,\u201d Variety reported him as saying at the New York Film Festival on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s OK that it sparks conversations and there are debates around it. The film is the statement and it\u2019s great to talk about it, but it\u2019s much more helpful if you\u2019ve seen it.\u201d", "description": "Police in major U.S. cities were on alert on Thursday as \"Joker\" opened in movie theaters after weeks of publicity surrounding its disturbing portrait of a bullied loner raised fears it might spark violence.", "authors": ["Maria Caspani", "Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436814280&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921W9-OCAEN"}
