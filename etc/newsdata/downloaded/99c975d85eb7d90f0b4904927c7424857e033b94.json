REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The risks posed by cryptocurrencies such as Facebook\u2019s Libra must be addressed before any launch, a senior Bank of France official said on Tuesday, adding to a chorus of regulatory scepticism that threatens to derail the project.\n\nSince Facebook announced its plans for Libra in June, politicians and regulators around the world have voiced concern about the project, saying it risked upsetting global financial stability, undermining users\u2019 privacy and enabling money laundering.\n\nIn the latest warning shot, Denis Beau, first deputy governor of the Bank of France, said the widespread use of such cryptocurrencies was fraught with peril.\n\n\u201cIf they were to take off, they would raise additional issues in terms of competition, policy, financial stability and monetary policy,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that this is understood and the risks are addressed before any possible rollout.\u201d\n\nThe Libra Association, a body set up by Facebook to oversee the project, said on Monday that the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch, planned for June 2020, may be delayed because of regulatory hurdles. The comments came after a quarter of Libra\u2019s initial members, including major payments firms Visa and Mastercard, abandoned the project.\n\nLibra is a so-called stablecoin, differing from most other cryptocurrencies in that it will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities.\n\nThe structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.", "description": "The risks posed by cryptocurrencies such as Facebook's Libra must be addressed before any launch, a senior Bank of France official said on Tuesday, adding to a chorus of regulatory scepticism that threatens to derail the project.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441153392&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1CT", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
