(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n\nPRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) \u2014 Voters in Kosovo were electing a new parliament Sunday amid calls for leaders to resume dialogue with Serbia over normalizing ties.\n\nSome 1.9 million eligible voters started to cast their ballots to elect 120 lawmakers in the Balkan nation that became independent from Serbia in 2008.\n\nThe vote comes after the outgoing prime minister resigned in July following a request from a Hague-based court to question him over crimes against ethnic Serbs during and after the country's 1998-99 war.\n\nNo single political party is likely to win the vote on its own and coalition governments have proven hard to form in the past. The Serb minority has 10 guaranteed seats in parliament and 10 others belong to other minorities.\n\nKey topics include resuming European Union-sponsored talks with Serbia aimed at normalizing ties between the two countries and fighting Kosovo's high unemployment, which stands at more than 25%, as well as battling organized crime and corruption.\n\nThe outgoing prime minister, Ramush Haradinaj, who was questioned in The Hague but not charged, is running for re-election with his center-right Alliance for Kosovo Future.\n\nHe faces Vjosa Osmani of the center-right Democratic League of Kosovo, the first female candidate for prime minister; Kadri Veseli of the center-right Democratic Party of Kosovo; and Albin Kurti of the center-left Self-Determination Movement Party, which has used extreme methods like throwing tear gas in parliament to protest deals with Serbia.\n\nKosovo became independent in 2008 after NATO intervened in 1999 to stop then-Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic's bloody crackdown on Albanian independence fighters' insurrection. It is recognized by more than 100 countries but not by Serbia.\n\nA few hundred international observers and thousands of local ones were monitoring the polls in some 1,000 voting stations.\n\nValdete Daka, head of the Central Election Commission, was among the first to vote, urging all Kosovars to cast a ballot.\n\n\"Whatever occurs today will be billed to Kosovo,\" she said.", "description": "Voters in Kosovo were electing a new parliament Sunday amid calls for leaders to resume dialogue with Serbia over normalizing ties.
