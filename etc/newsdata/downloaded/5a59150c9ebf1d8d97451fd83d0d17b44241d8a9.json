Megan McArdle delivers \u2018brutal takedown\u2019 of smug lefty journo who questions her methodology", "language": "en", "text": "As Twitchy told you yesterday, Megan McArdle took the Washington Post\u2019s fact check of Bernie Sanders\u2019 claim that \u201c500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they cannot pay their outrageous medical bills\u201d and ran with it, further taking Sanders\u2019 claim apart.\n\nEvidently that didn\u2019t sit well with The Week national correspondent Ryan Cooper, who basically accused McArdle of manipulating data to support her rebuttal of Sanders:\n\nI see we've got McMegan's signature move, dismissing a whole study because it doesn't cohere with her extremely vague priors https://t.co/7VfP3Ym8e3 \u2014 ryan cooper (@ryanlcooper) September 4, 2019\n\nIs Cooper\u2019s move dismissing McArdle\u2019s thorough debunking because it doesn\u2019t cohere with his priors? Because he seems to be pretty good at that. Meanwhile, McArdle\u2019s actual signature move appears to be verbally bodyslamming punks like Ryan Cooper who question her knowledge and integrity:\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware that you had any history of reporting on bankruptcy, Ryan. If you\u2019d care to point me to your methodological critiques of Dobson et al, your defenses of the methodological choices of Warren et al, or your broader work on the topic of bankruptcy, I\u2019d love to see it. https://t.co/9AZWsfAgJm \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nI mean, when I search your name and the word \"bankruptcy\", I don't really get any writing on the topic. Did you have some relevant expertise that you chose not to write about? \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nOr were you, I dunno, \"dismissing an informed argument because it doesn't cohere with your extremely vague priors\"? \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nFor the record, I've been writing about bankruptcy since 2005, when I persuaded the Economist to oppose BAPCPA, have a chapter on it in my book, and write about it in a bunch of not-particularly-political contexts, not just medical bankruptcies. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nAs you can see from googling my name, plus \"bankruptcy\". So my \"extremely vague priors\" include a fair amount of time talking to bankruptcy judges and attorneys, and getting a sense of why their clients BK. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nMy priors *also* include a passing familiarity with statistical analysis, which tells us that if we want to understand whether medical bills cause bankruptcy, we want to know the P(BK|Bills), which is what Dobkin et al studied, not P(Bills|BK), which is what Warren et al studied. \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nThere, now hopefully my priors are a little clearer to you. Would you care to enlighten me about your priors, and what relevant experience or education formed them? \u2014 Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 4, 2019\n\nOh, snap!\n\nSo, has anyone updated the Wikipedia page of @ryanlcooper to show that he is now owned by Megan McArdle? \u2014 blackford0akes (@blackford0akes) September 4, 2019\n\nBURN! Love it. \u2014 Marc Cenedella (@cenedella) September 4, 2019\n\nHello, 911, I'd like to report a murder. https://t.co/vPOvRkCyem \u2014 Scott Lincicome (@scottlincicome) September 4, 2019\n\nWe hope Ryan\u2019s learned a valuable lesson. We certainly have.\n\nGoing forward I will be making it one of my life goals not to make @asymmetricinfo angry with me. https://t.co/dojNf3nmMW \u2014 Jake Hunt (@jake_hunt) September 4, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s probably a good idea.", "description": "megan mcardle", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On September", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nuclear-bomb_new.jpg"}
