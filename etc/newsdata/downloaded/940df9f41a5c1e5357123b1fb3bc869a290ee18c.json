Would it be like 2015 again? An injury-ravaged team in red losing out to beasts in green? That would be cruel.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland insists his side can thrive off being labelled the underdogs\n\nBut even the most downbeat Welshman or woman privy to the 19-minute performance Gatland gave in front of the world\u2019s press would have been stirred into believing.\n\nFor the last 11-and-three-quarter years, it feels as if Gatland, now 56, has been trying to inject faith into a rugby land. In late 2007, when he took the job, Wales were ranked 10th in the world.\n\nNext weekend they could sit atop the lot. And knowing the next seven days will be his last with his adopted nation, Gatland picked up his wand again in order to try to cast a spell over a pessimistic nation.\n\nGatland stressed that getting to the final with Wales resources would be 'unbelievable'\n\n\u2018They are things you have to dream about,\u2019 he said in Wales\u2019 Tokyo hotel, having brought Leigh Halfpenny in for Williams, Ross Moriarty for Navidi and confirming the fitness of his centres.\n\n\u2018One of the things about me is that I\u2019m probably the greatest optimist in terms of believing something is possible. And that there is a dream.\n\n\u2018If you don\u2019t have that attitude and portray it, it will not happen. A big part of success is the belief and the desire to do something.\n\n\u2018That is what we will be building on and I can go back to New Zealand with head held high.\n\n\u2018For us to get to the final of a World Cup, it will be unbelievable given the small playing numbers we have in Wales, compared to the other three teams.\n\nGatland stressed that he is delighted with the attitude shown by his Wales players\n\n\u2018We continually punch above our weight but the greatest thing about this group since I have been involved with Wales is how much it means when they put on that red jersey.\n\n\u2018If you come off the field, whether you have won or lost, and you can look in the mirror and say, \u201cI tried really hard today\u201d, as coach that\u2019s all I can ask for. Nine times out of 10 they have given 100 per cent.\u2019\n\nThe 23 men who will try to take Wales to a place they have never been before will do that again. But this is not the squad Gatland would have wanted to have picked.\n\nTHREE KEY CONTESTS 1) Wing wizards It is 1-1 on the injury front in attack as Wales are without full back Liam Williams and South Africa are missing Cheslin Kolbe, both with ankle injuries. In come Leigh Halfpenny, rated by Warren Gatland as the best defensive full back in the world, and Sbu Nkosi for the Boks. Makazole Mapimpi and Josh Adams share the title of top try-scorer on five each, so their battle will be fascinating. Then there is George North, who needs a big game, and Nkosi, who must not be underestimated after a fine record of scoring eight tries in 10 Tests. It\u2019s a game for chance-takers. 2) The boiler room What a match-up in the second row as the old dog of war and Wales legend Alun Wyn Jones is up against \u2018Mr Muscle\u2019, Eben Etzebeth. Neither of these players takes a backward step and they could be locked in some feisty battles when the going gets tough in Japan on Sunday. Then it comes down to how their partners in crime go: Lood de Jager and Jake Ball are two massive men. In potentially very wet conditions their tight work will be so important in deciding this game. 3) Goal-kicking Dan Biggar is to be Wales\u2019 main kicker but they have Dead-eye Dick, Leigh Halfpenny, who may hit the longer ones, up their sleeve. The Welsh pair have kick percentages in the 80s and South African No 10 Handre Pollard is not far off. Whoever can hold their nerve will almost certainly win this game. France missed eight points against Wales from the tee and lost. So it\u2019s clear \u2014 take the points.\n\nSam Warburton, retired. Rhys Webb, locked out. Taulupe Faletau, Gareth Anscombe, Ellis Jenkins, Cory Hill, Navidi and Williams all injured.\n\nSo some will write off Wales. Pile it on, said Gatland.\n\n\u2018If they continue to do that over the next couple of days that would be brilliant,\u2019 he smiled. \u2018It does get us up when people write us off.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m more looking forward to this game than I was last week, and more confident about this game than against France in the quarter-final.\n\n\u2018This group of players have won 19 competitive games in a row and that gives us confidence.\u2019\n\nGatland thinks that South Africa are fortunate to have Duane Vermeulen available for the clash\n\nGatland is expecting a battle and thinks South Africa are lucky to have Duane Vermeulen available after the No 8 smashed into Japan winger Kenki Fukuoka with a straight-arm hit to the jaw off the ball in the quarter-final.\n\n\u2018I was surprised he wasn\u2019t red-carded during the game or cited afterwards,\u2019 said Gatland. \u2018Having looked at an incident, we have to match the physicality that South Africa are going to bring.\u2019\n\nBut this could be the last meaningful game of Gatland\u2019s tenure with Wales. Aside from the three Six Nations Grand Slams, the two World Cup semi-finals and a lifetime of memories he is most proud of one thing.\n\n\u2018We have earned respect from the rest of the world in terms of what we have achieved in the last 12 years,\u2019 he said. \u2018I am not sure it was there before that. I would love to beat the All Blacks and that is one I have not achieved.\u2019\n\nThat might be for next week, but as Gatland concluded with that and walked out of the room grinning the atmosphere had changed.\n\nThe question is, have Wales\u2019 chances?", "description": "Before Warren Gatland sat down to deliver his final messages before Wales' World Cup semi-final against South Africa, the mood felt dark as the skies outside.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/20/20194172-0-image-a-36_1572030288020.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
