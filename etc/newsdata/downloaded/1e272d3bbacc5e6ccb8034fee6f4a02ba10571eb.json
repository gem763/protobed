However, despite the pain, it would be many hours until Shay was to give birth\n\nPraying for the best: Matte was worried when they first got to the hospital after Shay said she hadn't felt the baby in a while\n\nMom-to-be: Shay went through 33 hours of labor before welcoming her first born, a daughter\n\n'It freaks me out, it really does. Cause this last time I felt pain like this was not a good experience.'\n\nWhile being driven, Shay messaged her doula, Andrey, who met the couple there.\n\nThe actress was quickly hooked up to the ultrasound machine by her obstetrician who found the baby's heartbeat.\n\nHowever, despite the pain, it would be many hours until Shay was to give birth.\n\n13 hours in an no sign of her daughter, the doctor ordered Pitocin - a drug that intensifies contractions but can help push labor along.\n\n'Pitocin is used to make a labor move faster,' doula Andrey explained while sharing the downsides of the drug.\n\n'The physical experience with the labor is completely different because the Pitocin labor is pretty rough.'\n\nTrying to move the baby along: 13 hours in an no sign of her daughter, the doctor ordered Pitocin - a drug that intensifies contractions but can help push labor along\n\nDeep-sleep: Matte sure listened to their doula Andry, with the father-to-be sleeping through Shay's intense contractions 17 hours in - something which she said 'she was going to kill him' about\n\nTeamwork: Both Matte and their doula tried to help Shay through her contractions\n\nWith the contractions really kicking in, Andrey coached Shay to try and relax as it was only going to get worse.\n\n'I want you to be right here, right now, where your contractions are manageable. You're going to try get some rest and just breathe.'\n\nShe added: 'So you know these are going to be much more intense. That's why I just said to Matte, \"Matte, you should probably get some sleep because when this Pitocin kicks in s***t's going to get real in here.\"'\n\nAnd Matte sure listened to Andry, with the father-to-be sleeping through Shay's intense contractions 17 hours in - something which she said 'she was going to kill him' about.\n\nAnd despite the Petocin, it didn't look like the baby would be coming anytime soon.\n\n'Shay is having a really hard time, she's struggling. I think she might feel a little helpless in some ways. She's crying a little bit, she's considering the epidural.'\n\nToo much: 'Shay is having a really hard time, she's struggling. I think she might feel a little helpless in some ways. She's crying a little bit, she's considering the epidural'\n\nFor and against: On an earlier episode of her series, Almost Ready, Shay and Matte had had a disagreement about the use of an epidural\n\nKeeping his mouth shut! When Shay opted for the epidural Matte didn't resist, showcasing his 'No Ovaries, No Opinion' T-shirt\n\nOn an earlier episode of her series, Almost Ready, Shay and Matte had had a disagreement about the use of an epidural.\n\n'You say no epidural, I say epidural,' Shay told Matte.\n\n'Am I partial to no epidural? Yes. Why? Because I'm a hypochondriac,' Matte explained. 'I'm afraid of drugs. My mom didn't use an epidural. I meet women all the time who didn't choose to use an epidural.'\n\nShay then posed the analogy: 'Would you get a root canal without any drugs?'\n\nMatte did not think that was a fair comparison, arguing her body was 'genetically engineered' to give birth.\n\nThe Canadian host didn't appear to have an issue with the epidural this time round at 23 hours in, wearing a 'No Ovaries, No Opinion' T-shirt.\n\nEncouragement: While the video didn't show the actual birth, a voice over of the delivery was heard with Andrey, Matte and the doctors encouraging her\n\nEmotions running high: And it wasn't just the baby crying when she arrived, Shay burst into tears too\n\nSeven hours later at 30 hours, the doula was worried about increased infection.\n\n'Shay's waters haven't broken for 30 hours now, which increases the risk of infection,' she explained to camera.\n\n'We're really trying to avoid a caesarean and doing everything that we can to help the labor to progress, and she's been quite the trooper, she has not complained during any parts of this.'\n\nWhile the video didn't show the actual birth, a voice over of the delivery was heard with Andrey, Matte and the doctors encouraging her.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the baby crying when she arrived, Shay burst into tears too.\n\n33 hours later! The video ended on a lighter note with Shay enjoying a large icy drink, 'I was 99% excited to meet her, and 1% excited to eat something'\n\nShe's here! Sunday saw the beauty share her first photo of her daughter's hand on Instagram\n\n'I can't. Oh it's so crazy. Oh God. Oh it's so crazy.'\n\nShe continued in a voiceover: 'This is definitely the most intense experience of my life. Matte and I are parents. I can't believe it - and we thought being pregnant was a journey, and I'm realizing we have just begun.'\n\nThe video ended on a lighter note with Shay enjoying a large icy drink, 'I was 99% excited to meet her, and 1% excited to eat something.'\n\nShay was then seen toasting a glass of champagne with Matte.\n\nSunday saw the beauty share her first photo of her daughter's hand on Instagram.\n\nShe accompanied the precious photo with the caption: 'Never letting go ...'\n\nCanadian's Shay and Matte have been dating for over two years.", "description": "Shay Mitchell shared her 33-hour labor birthday video on Monday on YouTube in which she shared her real and raw experience before giving birth to her first child.", "authors": ["Annita Katee For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/00/20012936-0-image-a-48_1571700785347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
