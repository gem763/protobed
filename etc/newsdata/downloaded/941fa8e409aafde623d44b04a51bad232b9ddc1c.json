I'm going to say that now I am identifying as a penguin and I demand to be allowed into the penguin enclosure at the aquarium and live with the penguins.\n\n\"This is the way the world is going, when I talk about this people go, 'You are so intolerant' and if you dare challenge these people they want you fired, expunged, sacked.\"\n\nSo far more than 6,000 have signed the petition which is on change.org.\n\nHowever Piers has gained the support of hundreds of people on Twitter .\n\n@NaijaArsenal tweeted: \"There's a petition to have Piers removed??? Some people have wayyyyyyy too much time in their hands it's unreal.\"", "description": "Controversial Good Morning Britain TV host made the claimed he identified as a 'penguin' following BBC film which says there are more than 100 genders", "authors": ["Lorraine King"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569187.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-003202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
