If Parliament adopts the recommendations of a hard-hitting new report released last Tuesday, the days of canned lion hunting and the trade in lion bones are numbered.\n\nThe report, produced by Parliament\u2019s Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs (PCEA), summarises the outcomes of a two-day colloquium held in August, at which a broad range of supporters and critics of the business of breeding lions in captivity were given the opportunity to present their case.\n\nREAD: SA calls for all-out ban on canned lion breeding\n\nThere was universal condemnation from local and international conservation organisations, including the Born Free Foundation and the Endangered Wildlife Trust, as well as Brand South Africa and even from within the hunting industry itself. The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), however, attempted to justify the practice as a supposedly well-regulated, legal and beneficial example of the sustainable utilisation of natural resources. This stance was supported by the Professional Hunter\u2019s Association of South Africa and the Confederation of Hunting Associations of South Africa, both of which have been defenestrated by a number of major international hunting organisations for the practice, as well as the South African Predator Association. Importantly the Parliamentary Committee argues that Captive Lion Breeding for hunting and lion bone trade:\n\n\n\nMust be reviewed urgently with a view to being stopped\n\nHas no conservation value\n\nIs unethical\n\nBreaks moral and ecological boundaries\n\nInvolves serious animal welfare violations\n\nIs poorly regulated and governed\n\nInflicts massive damage to the country\u2019s international image and tourism\n\nIs associated with criminal wildlife trafficking\n\nAn increasingly bloody business\n\nSouth African lion breeders initially catered almost exclusively to wealthy trophy hunters willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars for the right to shoot the \u201cKing of the Jungle\u201d in what were widely decried as unethical and cruel \u201ccanned\u201d hunts. Enabled by a more than sympathetic DEA under the late Minister Edna Molewa, enterprising lion farmers soon expanded their commercial offerings by charging unwitting tourists and volunteers for the opportunity to cuddle and raise cubs and go on bush walks accompanied by juvenile lions, all of which were ultimately destined for the bullet.\n\nRoger Cook, the investigative journalist who brought the industry to the attention of global audiences via his 1997 television programme \u201cMaking a Killing\u201d, described it as \u201cfounded on cruelty and fuelled by money\u201d.\n\nFollowing an international outcry over canned lion hunting, local breeders have recently shifted their focus and are now making millions of rands through the legal export of lion bones to Southeast Asia, where they are increasingly used as a substitute for tiger bone in jewellery, virility treatments and traditional medical cures the efficacy of which is entirely without scientific proof.\n\nThe suggestion that this has become a significant revenue stream is confirmed by the fact that the DEA raised the quota for the export of lion skeletons from 800 in 2017 to 1500 this year, by evidence that the vast majority of exported skeletons now include skulls, which indicates that the animals were bred specifically for their bones and not for trophy hunting, and by reports of industrial-scale slaughterhouses at breeding facilities.\n\nToday, South Africa is home to some 8000 lions bred in captivity for purely commercial purposes. The population of wild lions is estimated at around 3500.\n\nDamning observations\n\nHaving heard, debated and assessed presentations from all stakeholders, the members of the PCEA didn\u2019t mince words in their report, describing the industry as \u201cunethical\u201d, \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201chideous\u201d, and suggesting that \u201cother than greed and ego, there are no reasons to be breeding lions in captivity to be killed in captivity\u201d.\n\nThis may come as somewhat of a surprise, given the composition of the PCEA, which is numerically dominated by ANC MPs. But according to the DA\u2019s Ross Purdon, who is a committee member, \u201cthe committee has been able to rise above party politics on a number of occasions, enabling us to focus on national issues\u201d.\n\nPurdon agrees that among the most serious conclusions drawn in the report are \u201cthat the captive lion breeding industry has little to no conservation value, raises serious animal welfare and ethical issues, and [\u2026] is doing serious damage to Brand South Africa\u201d to the tune of as much as R54 billion in lost tourism revenue over the next decade if allowed to continue.\n\nCommittee members found that instead of scientific evidence, \u201cthe economic principle of supply and demand was a key aspect\u201d in the decision to increase the export quota for lion skeletons. They note that the industry is tainted by numerous direct and indirect links with criminal wildlife trafficking syndicates and that it \u201chas long been a blemish on South Africa\u2019s wildlife and tourism landscape\u201d.\n\nThe ultimate consequence of all of this, according to the PCEA, is that \u201cthis tragic story needs to be arrested forthwith to avoid inflicting further and irreparable damage to the South African conservation image\u201d, that there was an \u201coverwhelming consensus for the need to bring an end to the controversial aspects of [the] captive lion breeding industry\u201d which \u201cmust be stopped immediately by enacting relevant legislation\u201d.\n\nIn its final resolutions, the report proposes that the DEA should urgently review the \u201cCaptive Breeding of Lions for hunting and Lion bone trade with a view to putting an end to this practice\u201d, as well as initiating a formal audit of lion breeding facilities to ensure that they operate within exiting regulations and laws. The DEA, together with the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, is also tasked with presenting a programme that will address the many animal welfare and health concerns raised during the colloquium. The report states that the DEA should reconsider the controversial increase in the export quota for lion skeletons, which, as the colloquium heard, was based on \u201ccommercial considerations, as opposed to science\u201d.\n\nNot just another talk shop\n\nConservationists may be surprised by the exceedingly frank language used in the report, but given the DEA\u2019s decades-long staunch support for the so-called \u201csustainable utilisation\u201d of and commercial trade in wildlife \u201cproducts\u201d, including lion bones and rhino horn, they may be excused for viewing this radical rhetoric with considerable caution.\n\nWhat are the chances that Parliament will enact the recommendations of the committee and bring the practice of breeding lions for profit to an end in South Africa?\n\n\u201cI honestly believe we will see a significant shift in government policy,\u201d says Purdon. \u201cIt is important that the Acting Minister (Derek Hanekom) be well briefed. I sincerely believe, that with the correct motivation, government will adopt the recommendations\u201d.\n\nThe PCEA\u2019s chairperson, Mohlopi Mapulane, gave the assurance that the colloquium would result in action instead of being just another talk shop. He promised that the committee would follow up its outcomes with the tenacity of a hungry lion chasing after its prey.\n\nThe end of a hated industry?\n\nFor too long, the South African government\u2019s controversial policies with regards to some of Africa\u2019s most iconic and most vulnerable species \u2013 rhinos, elephants and lions \u2013 have positioned the country on the wrong side of global consensus. By commodifying wild animals and by putting profits before true conservation imperatives, it has sided with a greedy, unethical and often downright criminal minority.\n\nBy taking the conclusions and recommendations of the PCEA\u2019s report seriously and by enacting legislation that will bring the practice of breeding lions for commercial gain to a speedy end \u2013 perhaps under the leadership of a new, visionary Minister of Environmental Affairs \u2013 government has the opportunity to rescue the country\u2019s proud and important conservation history, and to fulfil its moral obligations as the custodian, not only of lions, but of all wild species.\n\nIn a later development the Acting Minister of Environmental Affairs, Derek Hanekom tweeted \u201cI intend appointing a high level panel review policies and legislation on a number of matters related to animal breeding, hunting and handling\u201d\n\n(Source: Conservation Action Trust)", "description": "If Parliament adopts the recommendations of a hard-hitting new report released last Tuesday, the days of canned lion hunting and the trade in lion bones are numbered.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7610/32257923897548c881b0ec523b893a22.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-24"}
