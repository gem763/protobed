We rely on that.'\n\nShe went on: 'Cath and Johannes [Radebe] are two of my closest friends in this competition. So sad to see them go, and I love them so much.\n\nShock! Strictly Come Dancing star Michelle Visage's 'jaw dropped' when Catherine Tyldesley was axed from the show on Sunday and Mike Bushell got through to next week\n\n'Cath is a sweetheart and she is just on top of the world that she made it to Halloween week.'\n\nSpeaking about her amazing score following her Addams\u2019 family-inspired dance at the weekend, she said: 'It was a foxtrot\u2026 he [Giovanni Pernice] is basically driving me like a car, because you see how far back my posture is and my neck\u2026 you can\u2019t see where you are going. So much trust is involved.'\n\nMichelle added: 'It was an amazing high. It was \"Oh my goodness our first ten of the series\". The highest score of the series\u2026 but you can\u2019t relish it for too long as you are then on to a new dance.'\n\nShe added she would be straight off to dance rehearsals following her Lorraine appearance, saying: 'You think we have a week, we really have three and a half days when all is said and done\u2026 there is pressure every time.\n\nMichelle said: 'Cath and Johannes [Radebe] are two of my closest friends in this competition. So sad to see them go, and I love them so much'\n\nAppearing on Monday's Lorraine, Michelle said: 'My jaw was on the ground\u2026 It just shows you, you have to vote for your favourite people. We rely on that'\n\n'I don\u2019t want to let my partner down, who is a champ, he\u2019s incredible and he\u2019s so good at what he does. But, at the same time I want to learn, I want to be a dancer by the end of this.\n\n'I don\u2019t ever want to stop, I\u2019m having the best time of my life. I never thought I would love doing ballroom dancing. And look at it!'\n\nShe also told Lorraine how having her breast implants removed and taking to the dance floor has given her a new lease of life.\n\n'I am having the time of my life. Coming into this competition representing the women of a certain age, being 51. I don\u2019t want to keep harping on that but I knew I was going to be asking my body to do things it has never done before\u2026 being out there and doing what I\u2019m asking it to do for eight hours a day.\n\nShe went on: 'Cath and Johannes [Radebe] are two of my closest friends in this competition. So sad to see them go, and I love them so much'\n\nCandid: She also told Lorraine how having her breast implants removed and taking to the dance floor has given her a new lease of life\n\n'I\u2019m most proud of my body listening to me. Giovanni is the best partner for me, the best teacher for me, is my rock through all of this and I rely on him.'\n\nAsked if it was a \u2018rebirth of sorts\u2019, she agreed: '100 percent for me because I had so many health issues for the last 20 year on and off struggling with auto-immune issues. It was a long litany of things that were going on.\n\n'So when I took control of my health by removing my breast implants and I started to feel better I thought what better way to have a second chance of life than Strictly.'\n\nShe added being ill over the years had not been easy, explaining: 'I am the sole bread-winner for a family of four. My husband is a stay at home dad. We don\u2019t eat, we don\u2019t pay the bills, the rent unless, I work.'\n\nAsked if it was a \u2018rebirth of sorts\u2019, she agreed: '100 percent for me because I had so many health issues for the last 20 year on and off struggling with auto-immune issues.

I never thought I would love doing ballroom dancing. And look at it'\n\nOn whether she felt immediately better once her breast implants were taken out, she continued: 'I actually had a really bad recovery. It was very, very difficult. I went in [to hospital] impaired. The brain fog\u2026 I felt like I wasn\u2019t in my own body. It was so bizarre. Heart rate issues, all sort of things were going on because of them. Not knowing that this was the cause of it.\n\n'So, when I took it out it took a good six weeks to get me on my feet. To the point where I thought, \u2018How am I going to be able to dance? I can\u2019t even go to the ladies\u2019 room by myself.\u2019 My husband had to walk me to the ladies\u2019 room, it was crazy.\n\n'It started to get better and better and better and now I\u2019m able to detoxify. Each time I sweat or I\u2019m pushing through an eight hour rehearsal I think, \"I\u2019m healing, I\u2019m healing, I\u2019m healing\". That\u2019s what pushes it through. I think, \"Oh my goodness this is a new woman, a chance at life again\".'", "description": "Strictly Come Dancing star Michelle Visage's 'jaw dropped' when\u00a0Catherine Tyldesley was axed from the show on Sunday and Mike Bushell got through to next week.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20278576-0-image-a-10_1572266461692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
