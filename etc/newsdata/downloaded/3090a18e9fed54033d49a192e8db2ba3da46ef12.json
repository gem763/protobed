Stafford is already the QB12 on the season, even with a bye week, and he could climb higher with the help of WRs Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay.\n\nAD\n\nRyan Tannehill, Titans (15): Just a hunch that Tennessee isn\u2019t regretting its decision to bench Marcus Mariota. Under Tannehill, the Titans actually appeared to have a functional passing attack, and now he gets the QB-friendly Bucs.\n\nAD\n\nSam Darnold, Jets (22): Even before picking apart the Cowboys in Week 6, Darnold was a waiver-wire darling because it was presumed he would thrive on his post-Week 7 schedule, but the thing about Week 7 was that he had to face the Patriots. Now, after dropping an epic stink bomb on Monday night, the jury is out on what version of Darnold we\u2019ll see against a so-so Jacksonville defense, and on how badly damaged his psyche might be.\n\nMatt Moore, Chiefs (23): No pressure, dude, just step in for Patrick Mahomes and keep K.C.'s offense humming. Owners of Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill will be particularly keen to see Moore at least play with poise and competence.\n\nAD\n\n4 RB names of interest\n\nChristian McCaffrey, (3): Coming out of Carolina\u2019s bye, McCaffrey squares off on the road with a San Francisco defense that has been the second-toughest versus RBs. That\u2019s only enough to knock him down to third this week, given the ludicrously huge gap between McCaffrey\u2019s per-game fantasy scoring average (27.3) and that of the second-place RB (21.3, Dalvin Cook).\n\nAD\n\nMelvin Gordon, Chargers (22): He\u2019s been terrible, and is only ranked this high because the Chargers seem to have no intention of letting his terribleness get in the way of tons of touches, including at the goal line.\n\nTy Johnson, Lions (25): Did I mention that Kerryon Johnson landed on the IR? Ty Johnson is the obvious beneficiary, although it remains to be seen if Detroit adds an RB via free agency or the trade market.\n\nAD\n\nRonald Jones, Buccaneers (35): Did Tampa Bay use its bye week to finally decide to commit to its most talented back? Stay tuned!\n\n4 WR names of interest\n\nJulio Jones, Falcons (2): As Atlanta\u2019s season has circled the drain, Jones\u2019s individual numbers have suffered, as well. He\u2019s averaging just under 74 yards per game, which isn\u2019t awful, but has reverted to an inability to find the end zone, and now QB Matt Ryan\u2019s status is iffy as he nurses an injured ankle.\n\nAD\n\nAllen Robinson, Bears (20): With Mitchell Trubisky dragging Chicago\u2019s offense to the bottom of Lake Michigan, Robinson has been just about the only bright spot. The WR15 on the season, Robinson has quietly been having an impressive campaign.\n\nAD\n\nBrandin Cooks, Rams (21): A date with the lousy Bengals could be an elixir for Cooks, who has eight catches for 106 yards over his past three games and hasn\u2019t scored since Week 2. Los Angeles has a bye next week, so owners will be tempted to drop him if he doesn\u2019t show a pulse Sunday.\n\nEmmanuel Sanders, 49ers (34): Traded Tuesday from the Broncos, Sanders is expected to suit up right away for San Francisco and give George Kittle some much-needed help in the pass-catching department.\n\n3 TE names of interest\n\nJimmy Graham, Packers (10): Graham will never again be the athlete he once was, but with Aaron Rodgers beginning to look more like the lethal QB we remember, his veteran TE might start to show some consistency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDallas Goedert, Eagles (15): The second-year second-rounder is starting to come on for Philly, and he can really make a statement by making things happen against Buffalo\u2019s stingy defense. Of course, the statement Zach Ertz owners would prefer to see from Goedert is, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll stop cutting into your guy\u2019s workload.\u201d\n\nJosh Hill, Saints (22): Keep an eye on Jared Cook\u2019s health this week. If he sits out another game with an injured ankle, Hill, who posted a 3-43-1 line last week at Chicago, could do even better against Arizona\u2019s exceedingly TE-friendly crew.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "See how players stack up against each other in Week 8.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yo2K2Rays9a3_REMjHPnFBW2zvI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DNL35RHOVAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
