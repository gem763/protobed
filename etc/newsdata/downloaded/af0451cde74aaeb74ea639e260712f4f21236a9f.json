The president wants an off-ramp for electoral reasons, and I think the Chinese want an off-ramp primarily for economic reasons.\u201d\n\nTrump and his advisers have denied that the trade war has caused any economic damage in the United States, instead blaming a strong dollar as well as the Federal Reserve, which has already begun cutting interest rates. But the evidence is becoming harder to ignore. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned that the trade war with China could cost the global economy around $US700 billion ($1 billion) by 2020 \u2014 a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\n\nTop Fed officials have also warned of economic risks from Trump\u2019s trade war and cautioned that while the Fed will do what it can to keep the expansion going, its powers are limited. And stock markets, whose performance Trump has pointed to in the past as a barometer of his success as president, have been whipsawed by every escalation.\n\nThe truce will help calm a trade fight that has taken a significant toll on the world\u2019s two largest economies and threatened to further slow global growth at a precarious moment. AP\n\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a little bad news, the market would go down incredibly,\u201d Trump said on Friday as he announced the deal. \u201cEvery time there was a little bit of good news, the market would go up incredibly.\u201d\n\nWith Trump\u2019s reelection campaign approaching, he and his advisers are increasingly conscious of the need to limit any economic damage, particularly among key political constituencies like farmers, who have suffered the most.\n\n\u201cThe deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday morning. \u201cIn fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d\n\nThe compromise is even more timely for Xi. Sharply rising food prices have become a national issue in China. A lethal epidemic among the country\u2019s pigs, with mortality as high as what people in Europe faced during the Black Death of the mid-14th century, has sent prices skyward for pork as well as for alternatives like beef and lamb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Chinese public has begun asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d, China\u2019s trade negotiators suddenly have an answer: It can come from the United States, along with a lot of pork, soybeans and other food.\n\nBut while the agreement will benefit certain industries, it will likely not reverse a trend toward greater economic divisions between the two countries.\n\nIf the most recent understanding holds together, it would allow the United States to retain tariffs imposed over the past 16 months on a wide array of Chinese industries. That could prompt many companies to continue efforts to shift production away from China, possibly to the United States but more likely to US allies in South-east Asia.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is fair trade,\u201d Robert Lighthizer, Trump\u2019s top negotiator, told Congress in February. \u201cThat requires structural change.\u201d\n\nAmerican negotiators have talked about curbing various Chinese industrial policies that they view as harmful to US businesses, including China\u2019s generous subsidies to its state-owned companies, policies that coerce technology away from multinational firms and a pernicious history of cybertheft.\n\nBut while the agreement includes some new protections on intellectual property, greater access for financial services companies and guidelines as to how China manages its currency, it does not appear to address several of these deeper concerns.\n\nWhile Xi Jinping's political dominance seems secure, he appears to be facing renewed pressure to share some of that power. Getty\n\nIn a statement, the US-China Business Council, which represents US companies that do business in China, said it hoped the tentative agreement would restore sufficient confidence to allow negotiators to tackle other issues, including \u201cmarket-distorting subsidies for state-owned enterprises and equal treatment for US and other foreign companies\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether China will agree to deeper concessions is not guaranteed, particularly given Xi\u2019s political sensitivities at home. Those crises have come at a bad time for Xi in terms of China\u2019s political calendar.\n\nIn the next three weeks, Xi will face a long-awaited session of the 204-member Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The committee, which has not gathered since February of last year, holds enormous power in China and has authority to change the country\u2019s leaders.\n\nWhile Xi\u2019s political dominance seems secure, he appears to be facing renewed pressure to share some of that power. His colleagues, particularly Premier Li Keqiang, who oversees government ministries while Xi oversees the Communist Party, have become slightly more visible lately, although still in Xi\u2019s shadow.\n\nThe possibility that the deal announced on Saturday falls apart after the Central Committee meets remains a real one. The Chinese appear to be hedging their bets. Chinese state media did not describe the arrangement at the weekend as an actual deal. Trump himself was quick to say on Friday that legal details of the deal had not yet been worked out and committed to paper.\n\nChina and the United States have reached two previous truces in their trade war \u2014 the first in December in Buenos Aires and the second in June in Osaka, Japan. The Buenos Aires accord lasted five months. The Osaka accord crumbled in a month.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen,\u201d Trump said when asked if the deal could fall apart before the two sides plan to sign it, at a summit of global leaders in Chile next month. \u201cThat can happen. I don\u2019t think it will. I think we know each other very well.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The weekend's partial deal will help both Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, secure a win in the midst of domestic tumult.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3549%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_235%2C$y_76/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c6d8dff976bdf8d80a65c7319564712f79ddd591", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
