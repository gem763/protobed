She would roll back Trump-era restrictions on the power of unions representing federal workers and work to restore public employee bargaining rights that have been reduced in several states.\n\nWarren would end exemptions limiting the rights of domestic and farm workers and make it harder for companies to classify people as independent contractors instead of employees.\n\nShe promised to appoint judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who have records of supporting labor and would broaden employees' ability to sue their employers.\n\nUnder her plan, companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue would have to allow employees to elect 40% of the members of their boards of directors.\n\nBecause several Democratic contenders are strong supporters of labor, some already have plans that are similar to Warren's.\n\nLike Warren, for example, Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders would allow workers to unionize when a majority of a company's employees sign cards saying they want to do that, rather than requiring them to also participate in an election.\n\nBoth senators also support eliminating so-called \"right to work\" laws at the state level, which allow employees to benefit from a union contract without paying union dues or being union members, among other reforms.\n\nThey also support rules to classify fast food chains and other franchisors as employers for the purposes of wages, benefits and collective bargaining, rather than considering workers to merely be the employees of the owners of individual franchise locations.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has promised to guarantee gig economy workers rights as employees, including the right to organize, and offer preference in federal contracts to union employers. California Senator Kamala Harris, who has benefited from labor support in the past and is also actively courting unions, has pledged to increase pay for teachers, among other pro-labor policies. Biden condemns what he calls a \"war on organizing, collective bargaining, unions and workers,\" and has opposed \"right to work\" laws. However, his past support for free-trade policies opposed by unions has rankled some in the labor movement.\n\nWarren was due to appear on Friday at a presidential forum by the Service Employees International Union in Los Angeles.
