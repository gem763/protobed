Now I know it is real whale vomit I will sell it.\"\n\nThe 14lbs whale vomit mass is estimated to worth as much as $320,000 (\u00a3247,603), based on previous sale prices.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\nSurat Thani provincial governor Witchawuth Jinto arrived with specialists and they confirmed that the chunk contained more than 80 percent of Ambergris.\n\nWitchawuth said they are now advising Jumrus on what he should do next to get the best price for his lucky find.\n\nAmbergris is produced by sperm whales when their bile ducts in the gastrointestinal tract make secretions to ease the passage of large or sharp objects.\n\nThe whale them vomits the mucilage which solidifies and has a foul smell.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\nHowever, after it dries out the chunk will smell more pleasant, which makes it a sought-after ingredient in the perfume fragrance industry, because of its good long-lasting smell.\n\nIn April 2016, a 1.57 kilogram ambergris ball found in Lancashire sold for \u00a350,000 while in November of the same year, three Omani fishermen found 80kg of ambergris and sold it for $3 million.", "description": "Jumurus Thiachot found the waxy lump when he was walking along a beach earlier this year", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Viralpress"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714969.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-NEWSLINK9855778_103382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
