(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nSports columnist\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t when Case Keenum lofted the first-quarter pass that landed in the arms of a waiting Chicago Bears defender for the first layup of a score, then it was certainly by the time Keenum was stripped by Bears menace Khalil Mack later in the first half. This was Monday night, sweltering by September standards. The people who hauled themselves to FedEx Field, some of them bold enough to wear Washington Redskins jerseys, had to be asking themselves, \u201cWhat are we doing? What are we even doing?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Week 3 of this NFL season, and that\u2019s where we are with this outfit. All the existential questions are legitimate before October even arrives. That Washington lost to the Bears isn\u2019t overly surprising, because Washington could lose to anyone, anywhere. That it was 28-0 in the second quarter \u2014 en route to a worse-than-it-sounds 31-15 loss \u2014 is unacceptable, even as it fits right in with how this team generally performs on a national stage.\n\nSo here we are, with Washington as the only 0-3 team in the NFC, and it\u2019s already not a normal NFL season here. In other cities, the endless days between games are devoted to dissection. With Washington, there\u2019s no bit of minutia \u2014 a particular play-call, a specific personnel choice \u2014 worth discussing.\n\nWhat is this season even about? It feels over before it has even really ramped up, and the direction of the franchise \u2014 perpetually in question \u2014 presents itself with hot coffee and a warm muffin, a fresh topic for a Tuesday morning around the water cooler.\n\n[The Redskins fall into four-TD hole versus Bears, lose 31-15 to drop to 0-3]\n\nThat scene, in Washington: Hey, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen actually held onto a lead! Looks around. Takes sip. So, what time did you turn off the Redskins game?\n\nHow does this keep from unraveling?\n\n\u201cKeep doing what we do,\u201d Keenum said.\n\nUhhhhhhh, no. Wrong answer, Case. The fans of this franchise are perilously close to tuning out the remainder of the 2019 season, which is remarkable given there are 13 games left. So only things that matter for the future \u2014 meaning not next week at the New York Giants, but next year and beyond \u2014 should be discussed in depth this week:\n\nWhat are they doing with Trent Williams, the holdout left tackle?\n\nWho is the quarterback?\n\nWho is the coach?\n\nThe first one is easy: Trade Williams. It should have been done already, because if he wanted to play here, he would be here. He\u2019s 31. His injury history isn\u2019t great. You\u2019re essentially playing chicken with the guy who had been your best player solely to prove you can \u201cwin,\u201d whatever that means? Please. There are teams that need left tackles. Get a draft pick and move on.\n\nThe second one: At some point, the quarterback has to be rookie Dwayne Haskins. What is this season even about? It\u2019s not about keeping Keenum for any future with this team. He is a caretaker who hasn\u2019t won a game and, on Monday, didn\u2019t take care of the ball. On his scoresheet are five \u2014 count \u2019em, five \u2014 turnovers: three picks and two fumbles.\n\n[The key moments from Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019]\n\nThe only reason not to turn to Haskins would be in the interest of his health and safety, given the state of Washington\u2019s line. The Bears, with a fearsome defensive front, treated Keenum like a pinball, sacking him four times. Exposing Haskins to such manhandling could scar him for life.\n\nYet the job is his.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is we have to have some continuity,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cI can\u2019t be changing people every five minutes here. I\u2019ve got to give Case an ample opportunity to play with these new guys.\u201d\n\nAt 0-3, why? You drafted Haskins for a reason, and it wasn\u2019t to hold a clipboard so Keenum could oversee losses. Think about the energy the Giants got from inserting rookie Daniel Jones as their starter Sunday. This franchise needs reasons for what\u2019s left of its fan base to trudge out to Landover or, at minimum, turn on the television. Those who chanted \u201cLet\u2019s go, Haskins!\u201d in the second quarter Monday night understood one way to make that happen.\n\nThat brings us to Gruden, who has, we presume, at least hours remaining on the job. This has been the predicament all season with a man who is coaching for his job: Gruden must do what is best for this week, which sometimes goes against what is best for the future.\n\nRegardless of the quarterback, Gruden\u2019s team was not prepared to compete Monday night. Keep in mind the Bears had struggled offensively in a home loss to Green Bay and a win at Denver. For 30 minutes Monday night, Gruden\u2019s troops made them look like the 1999 St. Louis Rams.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know: Gruden\u2019s an offensive guy by trade, and Greg Manusky is his defensive coordinator. Why Manusky is still here, I have no idea, but given the macro issues we\u2019re talking about, does it even matter? Either way, a head coach who leans toward one side of the ball doesn\u2019t get to completely abdicate responsibility for the other side. The defense allowed Chicago\u2019s Mitchell Trubisky \u2014 a pedestrian, troubled quarterback who hadn\u2019t thrown a touchdown pass this season \u2014 to complete 25 of 31 passes for three touchdowns. Mitchell. Trubisky.\n\nThat is all happening on Gruden\u2019s watch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a coach win a game,\u201d defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said.\n\nProfessional thing to say. But it says here that if Washington loses to New York next week, Gruden won\u2019t be around to coach the following game against New England.\n\nMaybe ol\u2019 Jay would prefer it that way. He has already lasted longer than any other head coach under Daniel Snyder\u2019s ownership. There would have to be some relief in his dismissal, because the rest of the league would understand the difficulty of the working conditions Gruden faced.\n\nThat brings up one more massive question about this franchise: Who would even want this job if and when Gruden is relieved of it? An up-and-coming coordinator such as Kansas City\u2019s Eric Bieniemy or Dallas\u2019s Kellen Moore? The coaching fraternity is a grandmother\u2019s sewing circle, and all the stories about working for Snyder and his team president, Bruce Allen, have made their way around. There\u2019s only 32 NFL head coaching jobs. They come with life-changing money. Still . . . here?\n\nMaybe removing Allen from the equation could help. Would Snyder be able to convince a star coach that he had cleaned the front office of its czar, and he was ready to build a real operation with new leadership?\n\nWhew. That\u2019s a lot for a Monday night in September. But here we are, yet again. The franchise loses, and the mind wanders.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the scarier part: Maybe Williams will be traded. Maybe Haskins will become the quarterback. Maybe there will be a new coach.\n\nWill that bring hope for the Washington Redskins? Or will it just usher in a slew of different characters to wash, rinse and repeat? The 2019 season is going to be a slog. Is there a path to make sure 2020 \u2014 or \u201921, or \u201922 or beyond \u2014 isn\u2019t, too?\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "description": "The quarterback situation needs changing, the left tackle needs trading, and the coach, well, he might soon rhyme with \u201ctired.\u201d", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LcDjZkJhA2GigaPTcQS4Wv9-Wnc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J76HZ6W6NUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
