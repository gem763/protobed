But I'm now ready to bring a whole different show to 5 Live.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBaker, whose 5 Live show included his trademark \"sausage sandwich game\", was sacked after being accused of mocking the duchess's racial heritage.\n\nThe 61-year-old claimed it was a \"stupid gag\" but the corporation said his tweet went \"against the values we as a station aim to embody\".\n\nBaker tweeted \"it was a genuine, naive and catastrophic mistake\", admitting he was \"foolish\" to later try to make light of it.\n\nHe denied that there was racist intent behind the post but admitted he is now \"paying the price... and rightly so\".\n\nNew slot for Pienaar's Politics\n\nFurther changes to the 5 Live weekend schedule will see the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar's Sunday programme move to the earlier time of 09:00. It will be followed at 10:00 by Laura Whitmore, who is \"thrilled\" to return on a permanent basis to follow him with \"big name guests from the worlds of politics, music and showbiz.\"\n\nStation controller Heidi Dawson said: \"Scott Mills is one of the best broadcasters in the business and I'm excited about the new show he and Chris Stark will be bringing to Saturday mornings.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Laura Whitmore joins the weekend line-up\n\n\"Laura Whitmore has done a fantastic job across a number of shows on 5 Live and it's brilliant that we can now offer her a show every Sunday morning. Laura is a fantastic new radio star who has already made a great impact with listeners.\"\n\nBBC sports presenter Eleanor Oldroyd gave Mills a warm welcome to the \"Saturday morning family\", while his former Radio 1 colleague, Mark Chapman, gave him a slightly frostier reception.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
