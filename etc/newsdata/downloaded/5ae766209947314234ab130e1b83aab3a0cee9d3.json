Incredibly, Harry Maguire had more touches (4) inside the opposition penalty area than any other United player at St James\u2019 Park.\n\nLawrenson has predicted a 1-0 win for Liverpool (Picture: Getty)\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Lawrenson has backed Liverpool to come away from Old Trafford with all three points against United who were \u2018like a dog\u2019s dinner\u2019 at Newcastle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Liverpool are not always playing that well, but they are winning all the time, which is a great feeling,\u2019 the ex-Liverpool defender said in his BBC Sport column.\n\n\u2018United, meanwhile, have got big problems. When they lost at Newcastle a couple of weeks ago, they were just a mess.\n\n\u2018They were like a dog\u2019s dinner.\n\n\u2018Liverpool picked up a point when they went to Old Trafford last year but I thought United were there for the taking in that game, when they suffered a lot of injuries in the first half.\n\n\u2018I just feel it is the same this time, with the amount of absentees United could have \u2013 they are talking about David de Gea being a doubt now too.\n\n\u2018So I am going for a win for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side. They can just carry on doing what they are doing \u2013 it is working, so they don\u2019t have to change.\n\n\u2018It feels like they just cannot stop winning, which is the best trick it is possible to have.\u2019\n\nUnited produced a miserable display at St James\u2019 Park before the international break (Picture: Getty)\n\nMichael Owen, who controversially played for both clubs, believes Liverpool will have too much \u2018pace and aggression\u2019 for United on Sunday.\n\n\u2018Manchester United have won just two of their last 13 league games (D5 L6) and a barometer of their performance at St James\u2019 Park last time was that central defender Harry Maguire had more touches (4) in the Magpies penalty area than any other United player,\u2019 Owen told BetVictor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Liverpool will equal Manchester City\u2019s record of 18 successive league wins if they win at Old Trafford.\n\n\u2018Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side have ridden their luck in recent weeks, but I expect them to have too much pace and aggression for this United side, although Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be hopeful that he can call on the services of at least a couple of his key players returning from injury or illness.\u2019\n\nMORE: Joel Matip declares himself available for Liverpool\u2019s clash with Manchester United after injury lay-off", "description": "Mark Lawrenson admits Liverpool 'are not always playing that well this season', but has backed his former club to come away from Old Trafford with a 1-0 victory this weekend....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11318028931_1571341758.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
