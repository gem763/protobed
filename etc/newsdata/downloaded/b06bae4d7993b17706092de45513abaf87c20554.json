She was in a happy relationship with Alan Taylor but suffered from depression, and would sometimes disappear for a few days - but would always come back to her family.\n\nBut in 1998, when she didn't come home for a longer than usual, and missed an appointment for one of her children, her partner Alan became worried.\n\nAt the same time, David had found a torso had been found in the search for another missing person.\n\nHe had released his police dog Tyler, who had began barking when he smelled the corpse. David said on the show: 'His head went up in the air and he started to sample the air, or sniff the air.'\n\nPolice searched nearby sewers and land for the head, arms and legs of Julie - that still have not been found\n\nJulie with her brother, Michael, when they were children\n\n'He them jumped up, put his paws up on the wall, started to run to and fro, like he was playing a piano, and then he started to bark; the bark being the indication that he had found something bearing human scent.\n\n'I've gone across to where he was, looked through the fence, or the hedge, and seen what looked like a derelict house, a derelict bungalow.\n\n'My initial reaction was that he's probably found a homeless person.\n\n'I called out to see if there was anybody there, no reply, put my arm through the hedge, felt what I now realise was a bin bag, pulled at it, which caused it to split open a little bit, and of course that released the smell of decomposing flesh.'\n\nJulie had been lured to the home of psychopath David Harker after meeting in a pub in the north east town. He made a good impression on Julie, and she went back to his flat with him where the pair had sex. Pictured: the police search for her body\n\nThe woman who lived there told the officers 'a group of lads' had thrown the bag over her wall a few weeks earlier.\n\nShe added they had told her it was dead dog and thought nothing more of it - but police quickly discovered it was one of Julie's body parts.\n\nBut the full story of what happened to the young mother has continued to rock the town for decades.\n\nJulie had been lured to the home of psychopath David Harker after meeting in a pub in the north east town.\n\nHe made a good impression on Julie, and she went back to his flat with him where the pair had sex.\n\nKatherine Kelly fronts Murdertown on Crime+Investigation\n\nBut Harker then strangled Julie and raped her corpse before cutting off her leg and cooking her thigh with pasta, garlic and cheese.\n\nHarker, who is still behind bars, then dragged Julie's body down to the basement of his block of flats and her in the basement for several weeks while he chopped off her arms, legs and head.\n\nEventually, he dumped her torso in a bin bag and chucked it into a garden of a house he mistakenly thought was derelict.\n\nJulie with her brother Michael when they were children. He says he still struggles with not knowing where her body is\n\nHarker, who was caught after boasting to friends he'd 'killed a girl called Julie' has never revealed the location of the rest her body.\n\nWhen officers got to the house, they described it as similar to scene from Silence of the Lambs, with the flat covered in blood, but no sign of body parts.\n\nHarker's charged were later reduced to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility rather than murder.\n\nJulie's death took a serious toll on Alan Taylor, who later murdered his friend John Morrison in 2006 after an early-morning drinking session in order to go to prison and kill Harke.\n\nJulie's brother Michael (pictured) said that 21 years on, he still feels anguish at not knowing the location of his sisters remains\n\nTaylor, then 41, denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, claiming his thinking was impaired at the time of the killing by his alcoholism, and the post-traumatic stress disorder he claimed to have suffered since his girlfriend's murder.\n\nFollowing a five-day trial he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life with a minimum tariff of 13 years, but he was found hanged in his cell three months later.\n\nJulie's brother Michael said that 21 years on, he still feels anguish at not knowing the location of his sisters remains.\n\nMichael said: 'If he was to tell us where Julie's head was, I wouldn't have a problem with him getting parole.\n\n'But he wouldn't, I know he wouldn't say nothing.
