There are few things more exhausting, stressful, embarrassing and thankless, but it will for ever inoculate you against the sound of a crying infant that isn\u2019t in your care. I haven\u2019t had to take a baby on a plane for 20 years, but when I hear a child in the seat behind me start to wail just as the plane leaves the runway, I\u2019m still so relieved it\u2019s not mine that I smile. I find it soothing.\n\nI accept that my solution is expensive - it would probably cost you less to fly first class for the rest of your life - but it is also permanent. I will never forget being belted to a bawling infant with a dirty nappy while the plane sat on the runway, feeling like the world\u2019s worst parent before we even took off. I will also never forget that it was worse for my wife, because nobody tuts at a man with a baby.\n\nAll that said, I have no real objection to JAL\u2019s new booking facility. If it helps to put a few rows between crying babies and those who are intolerant of them, that\u2019s probably better for everyone. It is even something I could find myself using, because chances are \u2013 nothing personal \u2013 I\u2019d rather sit next to a crying baby than you.", "description": "When I hear a child start to wail just as the plane takes off, I\u2019m still so relieved it\u2019s not mine that I smile", "authors": ["Tim Dowling"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e881f2d249bda827256de7af0c29c1a6f4db4e/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16d4750b1cd9fbdcc3495a1af4e211e9", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
