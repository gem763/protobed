China's offshore yuan hit its strongest levels in more than two weeks.\n\nThe risk-on environment weighed on the greenback, and even harder on Japan's yen.\n\n\"There is growing optimism that we could get some partial agreement on trade between the U.S. and China. I think both sides are needing to have a win,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at OANDA in New York.\n\n\"So there is less safe-haven demand for the dollar. If we get some type of trade deal or mini-agreement or mandate, you're going to see that being supportive of European assets. We're seeing the euro now back above $1.10, which has been the resistance,\" he added.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.28%, with the euro up 0.32% to $1.1004.\n\nSterling was last trading at $1.2299, up 0.78% on the day and the safe-haven yen suffered through a risk-on session, recently down 0.44% versus the greenback at 107.97 per dollar.\n\nThe Turkish lira, under pressure this week after Ankara began air attacks over northern Syria, gained 0.35% versus the U.S. dollar at 5.85. It is still on track for its largest weekly drop in eight.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRADE THE TWEETS\n\nTrump's tweet announcing his Friday meeting with Liu \"is giving market participants a reason to believe that perhaps a trade deal or at least a partial trade deal might be announced as early as tomorrow,\" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n\nSeparately, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported Liu said Beijing was willing to reach an agreement with Washington to prevent any further escalation in the trade war.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 240.79 points, or 0.91%, to 26,586.8, the S&P 500 gained 27.86 points, or 0.95%, to 2,947.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 76.91 points, or 0.97%, to 7,980.66.\n\nStock futures were down over 1% overnight on contradicting reports of the state of talks between China and the United States.\n\nChina is unlikely to be willing to make an easy compromise with a U.S. president who seems increasingly vulnerable to domestic political pressure as opposition Democrats seek to impeach him, analysts said.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.83% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.79%.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.56%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.35% higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.45%.\n\nTreasury yields rose, also on hopes of a trade resolution between the United States and China. However, some investors highlighted the difficulty of using the rapidly shifting headlines on trade to direct investment strategy.\n\n\"A choppy overnight session driven by conflicting signals regarding trade negotiations highlights the difficulty in chasing every 5 basis point move in yields, in that the proximate justification can unwind just as quickly,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 19/32 in price to yield 1.6525%, from 1.587% late on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2-year note last fell 3/32 in price to yield 1.5161%, from 1.474% late on Wednesday.\n\nAmong the widely followed emerging markets, Turkey's government bonds saw another day of falls as investors fretted about the negative international reaction to Ankara's military operation in northeast Syria.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Stocks were near session highs on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with China's top trade negotiator on Friday, while oil rose as OPEC pledged a decision on supply at its December meeting.
