Each week we nose around a different person\u2019s rented property in London or outside the city, to get a proper picture of the state of renting right now \u2013 from the tiny studio flats to the astoundingly cheap homes up north.\n\nLast week we looked around a flat rented by Leia and Evan, who pay \u00a31,600 a month between them for a one-bedroom flat in Kennington.\n\nThis time we\u2019re going a touch east, to Clapton, in Hackney, to hang out with Michael, a 25-year-old account manager for a brewery, and Zo\u00eb, 28, a front of house supervisor for a print company.\n\nThe couple pay \u00a31,100 a month between them (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHey, Michael and Zo\u00eb. How much do you pay to live here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRent is \u00a31,100 a month. For bills we pay \u00a3113 in Council Tax, \u00a350 electric and gas. We haven\u2019t had a water bill yet.\n\nDo you think you have a good deal?\n\nFor the area? Definitely.\n\nHow did you find the flat?\n\nWe\u2019ve lived here since the end of January.\n\nWe\u2019d come to the end of a sublet and after viewing some appalling places we settled almost out of desperation on this flat \u2013 which has turned out fortunate for us.\n\nYou\u2019re going to spot a lot of plants in this place (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAre you happy with the area?\n\nVery happy! There\u2019s a massive sense of community in the area and a lot of our friends live and work very close to us. It\u2019s central enough to cycle to work and transport is good too.\n\nWe can go on walks to the marshes and the Lea Valley or we can sit on Hackney Downs closer to home. There\u2019s always something going on in the area.\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nZo\u00eb will never have enough wardrobe space, and we can dream of a garden\u2026 but otherwise, it is perfect for now.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like living together?\n\nGreat! We lived in a few dodgy sublets before finding this place \u2013 if there was ever going to be any strain in the relationship it would have been then.\n\nWe\u2019d been together for over two years when we moved in together and we find it easy to work around each other\u2019s schedules while also making time to see each other properly.\n\nThis is just on your way into the flat (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve put up paintings, moved in some of our own furniture, put a cover on to hide the cream sofa leather, Michael has his record player and collection set up (Zo\u00eb\u2019s collection is tiny in comparison). And we have filled the living room and outside the front door with plants.\n\nAre there any issues with the house you have to put up with?\n\nThe lack of natural light in the back part of the house. The only windows are in the living room and the front door, flooding light through to the bedroom. It would be lovely to have windows in the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nThe pair have lived here since January (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you have plans to move again?\n\nNot anytime soon, but we\u2019d be looking for more windows and ideally a garden.\n\nAnd have you thought about buying a place?\n\nNo. There\u2019s a lot of the world left for us to see before that.\n\nFair enough. Let\u2019s have a look around.\n\nHere\u2019s the living room, complete with a jazzy poster on the door (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThose blankets and pillows look cosy, don\u2019t they? (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of stuff in this flat (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBut the couple say they have enough space (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nMichael has a significant record collection (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s the kitchen (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nUPDATE: In an earlier version of this post I mistakenly greeted the hoover as Henry. I was wrong. It is quite clearly Charles.

Yes, we\u2019re impressed. (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBehold their kitchen books (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere\u2019s space for a dining table (Picture: Joe Newman/Metro.co.uk)\n\nComplete with candles in wine bottles. Fancy.
