(NFLX) is scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings results Wednesday after the market close. Let's see if traders and or investors are positioning themselves bullishly or bearishly.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of NFLX, below, we can see that prices plunged to the downside from June into September, but have recovered a bit from their September low. NFLX is testing the underside of the declining 50-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has improved with the price action so that is supportive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has turned to the upside generating a cover shorts buy signal. The oscillator is just short of crossing the zero line for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of NFLX, below, we can see a large potential top formation. I used the word \"potential\" because the top is not a top until it breaks down below the lows of December. Meanwhile, prices could rally and the pattern could morph into something else.\n\nPrices are below the 40-week moving average line but the weekly OBV line has begun to improve and the weekly MACD oscillator has been narrowing toward a possible bullish crossover. Theses are not hard and fast buy signals but they do show some improvement in the technical condition of NFLX.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NFLX, below, we can see an upside price projection of $307.\n\nBottom-line strategy: NFLX is showing a little improvement in the technical position of the stock ahead of earnings Wednesday night. Prices could continue their recent improvement but a sustained rally is likely to need a big and developed base pattern. Things could change but for now only experienced short-term traders should be involved with NFLX.", "description": "How Does Netflix Stock Look Ahead of Earnings?...NFLX", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "How Does Netflix Stock Look Ahead Of Earnings", "Prices Plunged To The Downside June Into September", "But Have Recovered A Bit Their September Low.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Mark Sebastian", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/8ea5f75d-f01d-11e9-805f-83459d7233aa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
