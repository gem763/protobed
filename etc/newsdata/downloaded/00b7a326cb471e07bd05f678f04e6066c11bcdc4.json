Whether it's soaring tuition, $100 textbooks, or pricey dorm rooms, the cost of going to college has forced some students to get creative. On the last point, one thrifty student at Pomona College has come up with an ingenious solution involving a converted school bus.\n\nLibby George is a Pomona College senior and musician studying cognitive science. Originally from Cumberland, Maine, George moved to California three years ago to attend school.\n\nIn an interview with Insider, George said she had become interested in \"van life\" last year, but it took stumbling across a Craigslist listing of a white mini school bus for $3,000 that got her to finally pull the trigger (she eventually got the price down to $2,000).\n\n\"Once I realized how much money I'd save in the next semester, let alone in the next few years post-grad, I decided it was probably worth it,\" George said.\n\nAfter she acquired the bus, George spent the next summer retrofitting it into a permanent dwelling. The current bus, which George and her friends affectionately call \"Christine,\" has a kitchen, a bed, a piano, and space for George and her friends to call home. George parks Christine on Pomona's campus and no longer pays for student housing, which can come out to around $10,000 a year.\n\nMaybe most impressive of all is the fact that Christine still runs and functions like a normal bus. When she's not jamming on her guitar or playing the piano \u2014which George refers to as Christine's \"voice,\" \u2014 George drives her metal companion to many of the same places as an ordinary student.\n\nContinue scrolling below to see how George navigates life on Pomona's campus in her bus.", "description": "George told Insider she became obsessed with the idea of \"van life,\" last year and wondered what it would be like to live full time on the road.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db84034695b581f5c245366?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
