In the first one, he confused a hyphen with an apostrophe in accusing CNN of misquoting his favored insult for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nTrump and his surrogates have tried to prove Trump did nothing wrong by arguing the complaint is based on secondhand information and discrediting the whistleblower themselves.\n\nWhile the whistleblower did acknowledge that the substance of the complaint was based on conversations with White House officials and not firsthand information, the White House's memo of the July 25 call confirms the substance of the complaint \u2014 that Trump pressured a foreign government to pursue investigations that would politically benefit him.\n\nRead more: Around 300 former national security officials and ex-White House staff sign open letter accusing Trump of 'unconscionable abuse of power' over Ukraine call\n\nFurthermore, the Intelligence Community's Inspector General Michael Atkinson \u2014 who Trump appointed \u2014 agreed that the complaint was \"credible\" and rose to the level of \"urgent concern.\"\n\nAnd in Thursday morning testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the acting Director of National Intelligence \u2014 another Trump nominee \u2014 confirmed under oath that he too believed the whistleblower was acting in \"good faith,\" and substance of the complaint was \"in alignment\" with the White House's own recounting of the call.", "description": "In the past 24 hours after the explosive whistleblower complaint was released to the publicy, Trump has used social media to defend himself.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e188d2e22af17e06dba23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
