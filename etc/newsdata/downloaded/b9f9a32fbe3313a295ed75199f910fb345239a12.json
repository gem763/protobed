Farm bankruptcies, collateral damage from Trump\u2019s trade war with China, have been rising for a year.\n\nTrump has taken to blaming the Federal Reserve and the expanding impeachment probe for the bad manufacturing numbers and recent stock market declines, even though most businesses and investors have made clear the problem is Trump\u2019s own economic policies.\n\nBut the malaise isn\u2019t limited to the US. Almost every developed economy and many emerging economies are feeling the pain. The eurozone manufacturing index reached its own seven-year low\u2014with Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, hit hardest\u2014leading to falling manufacturing employment. Economists fear the manufacturing slump will bleed into larger sectors of the economy, namely services.\n\nThe latest data for big Asian economies such as Japan and India also shows contracting manufacturing sectors\u2014both victims of gnawing uncertainty thanks to trade tensions.\n\nAnd China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, posted its slowest growth in almost three decades in the second quarter, and it is watching exports decline despite a cheap currency. The World Trade Organisation just downgraded its growth expectations for this year and next due to the wave of protectionism sweeping the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cManufacturing in the global economy, and especially in advanced economies, is less important to overall GDP and employment than it used to be, and so the potential spillover to the rest of the economy and consumer spending is not as serious as it was,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cBut the slowdown in manufacturing is for real, and it is hitting all the main manufacturing countries\u2014the US, Germany, Japan, and China.\u201d\n\nBut the global economic turmoil isn\u2019t just found on the factory floor. Consumer confidence across developed economies is falling, though it\u2019s still far above the levels seen during the last recession. The sluggish economy means less demand for oil\u2014the International Energy Agency may further cut its expectations for growth in oil demand\u2014which in turn is putting the hurt on producers from Saudi Arabia to Iran to Texas.\n\nAnd there are still other warning signs of trouble. US corporate debt is at its highest levels relative to GDP in history, even as earnings are weakening, making it harder to pay off loans and stay solvent; hard-hit retailers are increasingly going broke in what Bloomberg calls a \u201cretail apocalypse.\u201d\n\nExceptional uncertainty\n\nWhy is everything apparently going south? On the one hand, it\u2019s been a decade since the trough of the last recession, with the economic expansion in the US particularly long-lived. Cyclically, what goes up must come down at some point, and that explains some of the weakening in global output and demand.\n\nAt the same time, there are some exceptional causes of uncertainty that are weighing on business and consumer sentiment. Britain and Europe have been convulsed for three years by Brexit, and with just weeks to go before the nominal deadline for the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union, it\u2019s still not at all clear what will happen or when.\n\nThat uncertainty has hastened the decline of the British pound, which has lost almost half its value against the US dollar since the Great Recession, but also makes it hard for European companies that do business with Britain to plan investments or hire new staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut by far the biggest reason for the slump, experts say, is the global trade war unleashed by Trump\u2019s desire to roll back decades of globalisation and break up cross-border supply chains that nearly every industry relies on. That\u2019s especially acute with China, where Trump has announced tariffs on practically everything it exports to the US. And with the China tariffs, the real pain hasn\u2019t even hit yet: Trump deferred steeper tariffs on Chinese consumer goods until later this year.\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent willingness to sunder the country\u2019s economic relationship with China\u2014rather than pursue some sort of trade deal\u2014is perhaps the biggest dose of uncertainty US and global business faces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more severe than just a trade war\u2014the entire US security apparatus is talking about disentangling from China,\u201d said Adam Tooze, an economic historian at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s not the specifics of tariffs, it\u2019s whether we are looking at a more fundamental shift.\u201d\n\nThreatening friends and allies\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more trade mayhem than just China. Trump pulled out of a huge Asian trade pact, threatened to destroy NAFTA before giving it a fresh coat of paint, and has paralysed the World Trade Organisation\u2019s ability to settle disputes. Most importantly, he\u2019s dusted off old legislation to slap tariffs on friends and allies with abandon.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty are Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on a host of additional items, including cars and car parts, Mexican imports, and European wine and cheese. On Wednesday, the trade war between the US and Europe ramped up yet another notch as the WTO gave the US the legal go-ahead\u2014a first for the Trump administration\u2014to levy tariffs on up to $7.5 billion in European goods over Europe\u2019s state support for Airbus, the plane manufacturer.\n\nIf the signs of a global slowdown do turn into a full-blown recession\u2014and some sectors in some countries are already contracting\u2014that would clearly be bad news just a decade after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In many parts of the US and Europe, despite a slow and steady recovery from the depths of the 2008 to 2009 recession, many families never regained economic security. Even in parts of Europe that have shown decent growth lately\u2014such as Spain\u2014the recovery is fragile, and consumer confidence is now falling sharply.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real worry about the political stability of the eurozone,\u201d Tooze said. \u201cThe damage is still there from the last recession, the political fallout is still there, and the last thing the eurozone needs is another economic crisis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Trump, already grappling with a rapidly expanding impeachment probe, an economic slowdown or an outright recession hitting in 2020 would be an additional hammer blow.\n\nThe self-inflicted damage to manufacturing brought about by the administration\u2019s policies is hitting hardest in states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014swing states that Trump needs to win again in 2020. Farmers across the country have been economically devastated by the loss of overseas markets\u2014especially China, but also Japan\u2014because of the president\u2019s trade policies. Additional trade tensions and job losses threaten red states such as Alabama and South Carolina, home to big European manufacturers threatened by Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\u201cThere is a bit of the world economy which is without question in recession,\u201d Tooze said. \u201cThe question is whether it generalises, whether it\u2019s a harbinger of a general slowdown, or, like in 2015-16, it remains more localised.\u201d\n\nKeith Johnson is a senior staff writer at Foreign Policy.", "description": "With US manufacturing taking its worst hit since the Great Recession, signs of a global economic downturn are mounting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.8533%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_71%2C$y_76/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ee203d1d55e514317baae3139bf6d07d97742578", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
