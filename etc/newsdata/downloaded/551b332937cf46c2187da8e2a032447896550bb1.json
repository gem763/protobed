He\u2019s the first to do it in a home game since Brendan Shanahan pulled off the feat in 2001. The last player in franchise history to score all of the team\u2019s goals in a victory with at least four goals was Sergei Fedorov, who had five in a 1996 game.\n\nMantha isn\u2019t flourishing by himself.\n\nHe is taking full advantage of playing on Detroit\u2019s top line with center Dylan Larkin and wing Tyler Bertuzzi, who has five points in two games.\n\n\u201cThat line was dominant,\u201d Dallas coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cOne of our keys to success was shutting down that line. We didn\u2019t do the job.\u201d\n\nThe Stars are expected to contend for the Stanley Cup this season, but they\u2019re off to a historically bad start. They\u2019re 0-3 for the first time since 1988 since the franchise was located in Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe just have to be better than this,\u201d said Jamie Benn, who doesn\u2019t have a point in three games. \u201cWe can\u2019t take that many penalties against a good young team, especially with that kind of speed.\u201d\n\nDallas was called for eight penalties, but Detroit scored only once with an extra skater. The Red Wings had a 5-on-3 power play for 40 seconds midway through the third and failed to take advantage.\n\nMantha\u2019s final goal was set up by Filip Hronek\u2019s centering pass after Larkin won a faceoff. Mantha also scored early in the third to put Detroit ahead and Roope Hintz pulled Dallas into a 3-all tie 33 seconds later with his second goal.\n\nDetroit\u2019s Jonathan Bernier stopped 19 shots.\n\nDallas, shooting for its first win in three games, led 2-0 after the first period after Hintz and Tyler Seguin scored.\n\nThe cushion didn\u2019t last long.\n\nMantha scored in the opening minute of the second period on a power play and pulled Detroit into a 2-all tie midway through the second period.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s exponentially better when he\u2019s playing with confidence and that\u2019s what you are seeing right now,\u201d Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s moving feet, you\u2019ve got a guy who\u2019s 6 foot 5 with speed and great hands. He\u2019s showing that whole package right now.\u201d\n\nAnton Khudobin made 29 saves for the Stars, who pulled their goaltender to add an extra skater in the final minute and put pressure on Bernier to hold on for the victory. Video review was used with 1.6 seconds left to determine Alexander Radulov didn\u2019t score when he tried to stuff the puck past Bernier.\n\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to throw everything they had at us,\u201d Bernier said. \u201cWe found a way to win.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Red Wings D Trevor Daley left the game with a lower-body injury and F Frans Nielsen went off the ice late in the game after being hit in the head by a puck. \u2026 Stars D Roman Polak was scratched with an upper body injury. \u2026 Red Wings C Andreas Athanasiou was scratched with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Dallas lost its first two games by a goal to the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues and the Eastern Conference champion Boston Bruins.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nStars: At Washington on Tuesday night.\n\nRed Wings: Host Anaheim on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anthony Mantha is picking up where he left off last season, giving the Detroit Red Wings hope the power forward can help them avoid enduring another rebuilding season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/stars_red_wings_hockey_80758_c0-125-2972-1857_s1770x1032.jpg?81f95119961502c381bd349cd9604a0f354a252b", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
