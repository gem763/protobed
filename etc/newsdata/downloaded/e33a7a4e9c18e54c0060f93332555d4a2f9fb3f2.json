(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen the July 24 congressional testimony of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III deflated the impeachment hopes of Democrats, President Trump crowed \u201cno collusion\u201d and claimed vindication from accusations that he had conspired with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nThen, the very next day, Trump allegedly sought to collude with another foreign country in the coming election \u2014 pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up what he believed would be damaging information about one of his leading Democratic challengers, former vice president Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe push by Trump and his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to influence the newly elected Ukrainian leader reveals a president convinced of his own invincibility \u2014 apparently willing and even eager to wield the vast powers of the United States to taint a political foe and confident that no one could hold him back.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this in my lifetime,\u201d said William A. Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution who graduated from college just before Watergate. \u201cHe appears to be daring the rest of the political system to stop him \u2014 and if it doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll go further.\u201d\n\nThe effort \u2014 which came as the Trump administration was withholding financial and military support from Ukraine to help the small democracy protect itself against Russian aggression \u2014 illustrates Trump\u2019s expansive view of executive power and what appears to be a cavalier attitude about legal limits on his conduct.\n\nWhile Mueller\u2019s investigation did not place Trump directly in the Russian conspiracy to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and boost Trump\u2019s candidacy, the president was an active participant in the Ukrainian episode, which was brought to light by an intelligence official\u2019s whistleblower complaint.\n\nTrump has said he did nothing improper in his calls with Zelensky or any other foreign leader, and on Saturday he derided Democrats and the media for what he dubbed \u201cthe Ukraine Witch Hunt.\u201d\n\nBut the scrutiny surrounding the phone call has brought fresh peril to Trump\u2019s presidency and could turbocharge the drive by some House Democrats to open impeachment proceedings.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and first lady Melania Trump greet Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jenny Morrison, during a state visit at the White House on Friday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDemocrats\u2019 frustration with their inability to check Trump and hold him accountable for his conduct after nine months in the majority is starting to boil over. Lawmakers for the first time are saying publicly that their caucus looks feckless, and some are fretting that their flimsy oversight and reliance on the courts to eventually rescue them have proved fruitless.\n\n\u201cWe back off everything,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). \u201cWe\u2019ve been very weak.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats already are probing whether Trump and Giuliani withheld U.S. assistance to the Ukrainian government until it agreed to investigate possible corruption involving Biden and his son Hunter. But asked whether he or Trump were worried about congressional investigations, Giuliani laughed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of headhunters and have lost any credibility,\u201d the president\u2019s lawyer said.\n\nGiuliani said new scrutiny of Trump\u2019s communications with Zelensky is welcome because it draws attention to Biden and his family\u2019s involvement in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, the more the Democrats press for an investigation of what I did in the Ukraine, I invite it,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my job as a poor, simple, little defense lawyer who\u2019s defending his client.\u201d\n\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said the president has calculated that there is a political upside to spotlighting Ukraine and a story he believes \u201cwould crush Biden if people came to believe it was true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be Andrew Jackson, there will be consequences, but he will be called \u2018the great disrupter,\u2019 \u201d Gingrich said, drawing parallels between the seventh president and 45th. \u201cHe gets up every morning and thinks, \u2018What can I disrupt?\u2019 He\u2019s not going to back off.\u201d\n\n\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani greets supporters before a Trump campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., on Aug. 15. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s sense of himself as above the law has been reinforced throughout his time in office. As detailed in the Mueller report, he received help from a foreign adversary in 2016 without legal consequence. He sought to thwart the Russia investigation and possibly obstruct justice without consequence. Through the government, he has earned profits for his businesses without consequence. He has blocked Congress\u2019s ability to conduct oversight without consequence.\n\nNow he is alleged to have leveraged taxpayer dollars and U.S. military might to extort a foreign government for opposition research on a political opponent, and it is unclear what consequences, if any, he may face.\n\n\u201cWe got progressively desensitized,\u201d said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in the Obama administration. \u201cWe\u2019re learning progressively about wrongs, and one part gets absorbed before the next part gets revealed, so for whatever reason the public doesn\u2019t get excited about it. It\u2019s mystifying.\u201d\n\nOne explanation is that Republicans in Congress have almost uniformly fallen in line behind Trump, reacting with instinctive nonchalance and blocking efforts to investigate his actions or hold him accountable.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re discovering is that the Constitution is not a mechanism that runs by itself,\u201d Galston said. \u201cUltimately, we are a government of men and not law. The law has no force without people who are willing to enforce it. The ball is now squarely in the court of the Republican Party, and particularly Senate Republicans. Will they ever be prepared to say enough is enough?\u201d\n\nLegal experts said it is extraordinary that Trump allegedly sought political assistance from a foreign government after a tortured, nearly three-year national conversation about the illegality of doing so. Asked what the president had learned from the Mueller investigation, former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman said, \u201cNothing. Zero.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he thinks it\u2019s perfectly okay,\u201d Akerman said. \u201cThis guy has got no scruples whatsoever. I don\u2019t think he would stop for a second.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer special counsel Robert S. Mueller III during a House hearing on July 24. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump said in June that he would accept help with his 2020 reelection campaign from another country, which would be against the law.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with listening,\u201d he told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. \u201cIf somebody called from a country, Norway \u2014 \u2018We have information on your opponent\u2019 \u2014 oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d\n\nThis past week, in a federal lawsuit in New York to block a subpoena issued by Manhattan prosecutors for his tax returns, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued the sweeping legal theory that the Constitution does not allow for the president to be criminally investigated while in office. While the Justice Department has concluded that a president could not be indicted while in office, it has never suggested that simply investigating one would be off limits.\n\nTrump\u2019s moves in Ukraine are not a tertiary interest. For years, it has been a priority of the United States to boost the effective power of the Ukrainian military to form a bulwark against Russia.\n\nNicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and a senior national security and diplomatic official in past Republican and Democratic administrations, said Ukraine has been \u201ca major interest of the United States \u2014 and if the stories are true, the president cavalierly thrust the national interests aside in favor of his personal political interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is clearly wrong and clearly an abuse of power,\u201d added Burns, who is informally advising Biden on foreign policy.\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Slovak counterpart, Zuzana Caputova, review the Guard of Honor during their meeting at the presidential palace in Kiev on Sept. 16. (Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nTrump has mocked the media for covering the whistleblower complaint, which he derided Friday as a \u201cpartisan\u201d attack. Right-wing media personalities have buoyed Trump amid the onslaught, disparaging the anonymous whistleblower as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy to remove the president from office.\n\n\u201cThe coup actually is ongoing; it hasn\u2019t stopped,\u201d Rush Limbaugh insisted to his listeners this past week on his radio program, claiming there were \u201cspeech police\u201d in the intelligence community.\n\nMatthew G. Whitaker, Trump\u2019s former acting attorney general, said on Fox News Channel, \u201cThis is a clear example of someone that\u2019s part of the deep state in the intelligence community taking advantage of this whistleblower procedure and then trying to create this firestorm.\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who recently met with Zelensky in Ukraine, said he and other Democrats are frustrated with the pervasive culture of inaction among congressional Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s true that the president requested that the president of Ukraine interfere in an American election, we are in really dangerous, brand-new territory,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely, completely unacceptable in a democracy.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) often declares that \u201cno one is above the law\u201d and has vowed that her party would hold Trump \u201caccountable.\u201d\n\nBut she has refused so far to green-light impeachment proceedings \u2014 creating tensions with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), among others who favor impeachment \u2014 and instead has looked to the courts to counter the White House\u2019s moves to stonewall Congress.\n\n\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) attempts to control contentious questioning during an oversight hearing on Thursday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhen are we going to get serious about enforcing our subpoenas?\u201d asked a frustrated Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who has pushed for leadership to fine Trump officials who are not compliant with their investigations. \u201cWe have to put some teeth into this.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats have gone so far as to suggest that House Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to impeach Trump has only encouraged the president\u2019s lawlessness.\n\n\u201cAfter the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate, wrote Friday evening on Twitter. \u201cBy failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 vocalization of a sense of helplessness was particularly acute at the end of an embarrassing week that underscored how the Trump administration has been able to run circles around their investigations.\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski turned in a defiant performance in front of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, dodging questions, talking over members and even promoting his own potential Senate bid and book sales.\n\nTwo days later, news broke that the administration was refusing to turn over the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump compromised national security with some sort of \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign official. Although the inspector general of the intelligence community deemed the matter credible and of \u201curgent\u201d concern, the administration blocked the complaint from being shared with Congress.\n\n\u201cAs president, he just overwhelms us,\u201d lamented Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a former 2020 presidential candidate. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got kids in cages \u2014 we\u2019re trying to deal with that. We\u2019ve got the continued mass shootings, and he won\u2019t help us with that. And then you\u2019ve got the urgency of this [oversight]. So, I mean, it\u2019s really just kind of, where do you prioritize your resources and your time?\u201d\n\nRosalind S.
