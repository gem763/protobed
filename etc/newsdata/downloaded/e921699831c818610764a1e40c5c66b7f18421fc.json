Since President Trump was elected, the directors of the 17 intelligence agencies have been under pressure to not question or contradict the president, and those who have done so, like the president\u2019s Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and his second-in-command Sue Gordon, have been forced to leave.\n\nHowever, complicated questions over who watches the watchers, and how to protect whistleblowers with access to classified information, had persisted over many years prior to Trump\u2019s election. Many believe that protecting whistleblowers and supporting their ability to go through the proper channels to raise concerns could prevent major leaks like the 2013 disclosure of classified NSA documents by former contractor Edward Snowden.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government should promote the success of this national security whistleblower action in order to deter any future Ed Snowdens,\u201d said Zaid, Bakaj\u2019s attorney.\n\nThe inspector general system within the intelligence community has several layers. Each agency has its own inspector general to investigate and audit matters ranging from fraud to the CIA\u2019s rendition and interrogation program. There is also an inspector general who coordinates community-wide reviews within the office of the director of national intelligence.\n\nWhen Bakaj started at the CIA in 2012, he was directed to ensure the agency was complying with President Barack Obama\u2019s new directive to protect whistleblowers with access to classified information who expose fraud, waste and abuse. His subsequent dismissal and attempts at redemption demonstrate the problems with protecting whistleblowers with access to classified information.\n\nAccording to four sources familiar with the matter, Bakaj\u2019s problems began in 2014 when his colleagues approached him about concerns that multiple senior employees at the CIA inspector general\u2019s office were involved in facilitating or covering up evidence mishandling in one of its investigations of a contractor. Bakaj ended up speaking with colleagues at the intelligence community inspector general\u2019s (ICIG) office about the concerns, some of which made their way to Congress.\n\nBakaj\u2019s superiors at the CIA watchdog office subsequently interfered in interviews with the ICIG, according to the sources, in order to try and find out who the whistleblowers were. Afterward, Bakaj\u2019s security clearance was suspended and he was put on administrative leave. He didn\u2019t work for over a year before he decided to retire and enter private practice \u2014 he is now a managing partner at Compass Rose Legal Group \u2014 but he has not given up on getting to the bottom of what happened.", "description": "Five years after a CIA employee was escorted out of the office for allegedly accessing information he wasn't supposed to have, external investigators showed that Andrew Bakaj's dismissal was a matter of retribution.", "authors": ["Jenna Mclaughlin", "National Security", "Investigations Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vkPdQSp3xrcutrsJgMmVuQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f13fa320-d3e2-11e9-abe5-b753b2c867b2", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
