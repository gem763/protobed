Australians still make up the bulk of the visitors to climb the rock, followed by Japanese, Parks Australia says.\n\nThe Anangu people, the traditional owners of Uluru, have called for the climb to be closed since 1985, when the park was returned to indigenous control. The Anangu say Uluru has deep spiritual significance as a route their ancestors took.\n\n\u201cThis is our home,\u201d read a sign at the base of the rock. \u201cPlease don\u2019t climb.\u201d\n\nTourists climb Uluru, formerly known as Ayers Rock, at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the Northern Territory, Australia, October 25, 2019.

Summer temperatures often top 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe closure was announced two years ago when fewer than 20 percent of visitors were making the climb.\n\nIt was an emotional day, said indigenous ranger Tijiangu Thomas.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\n\u201cHappiness is the majority feeling, knowing that people are no longer going to be disrespecting the rock and the culture - and being safe.\u201d\n\nThe Oct. 26 closure marks 34 years since the land was given back to the Anangu people, an important moment in the struggle by indigenous groups to retrieve their homelands.", "description": "Australia's Uluru officially closed to climbers for good on Friday, although the last visitors to scale the sacred rock were allowed to stay until sunset, as a permanent ban takes effect after a decades-long fight by indigenous people.", "authors": ["Stefica Nicol Bikes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444860637&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O10A", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
