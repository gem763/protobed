Well done lads- very brave.'\n\nOn Sky Sports, Roy Keane and Jamie Carragher felt that Xhaka could have done better with his attempt at blocking.\n\nKeane said: 'Maybe it does come at him very quick, I'd be quite happy to criticise him but it does go quick.'\n\nCarragher added: 'It takes a little nick. I don't know why, whether you think the ball is coming for your face or wherever it is, why you put your head down.\n\n'That thing, putting your hands behind your back and your head down isn't right.'", "description": "Arsenal supporters laid into new captain Granit Xhaka after he ducked a shot from Scott McTominay that resulted in Manchester United's opening goal.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/22/19127286-0-image-a-2_1569879210915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
