This isn\u2019t just in the UFC \u2013 I\u2019ve never really gotten the opportunity to be a main event. In my mind, it\u2019s like I almost never got the respect I deserved.\n\n\u201cBut now I worked for it, I waited my turn, and now I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve got the main event. I\u2019m excited, I can\u2019t wait, (and) I love the matchup.\u201d\n\nThat matchup sees Reyes (11-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC) take on a divisional newcomer, but former UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman is anything but a rookie, and Reyes knows and respects his credentials and says the mere act of moving up to 205 pounds immediately puts \u201cThe All-American\u201d into the upper echelon of the UFC\u2019s light heavyweights.\n\n\u201cChris is up there, man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe took out Anderson (Silva). Anderson, at the time, was the greatest of all time. Chris is, at least, top 20 somewhere.\u201d\n\nReyes also admitted Weidman\u2019s personality will make the matchup a more a pleasant experience for him from a personal standpoint, given the fact that there is no animosity between the pair heading into the contest.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Chris, he\u2019s a good guy outside of fighting, too,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s a scumbag, which wouldn\u2019t matter anyway. But it\u2019s good to be fighting a good dude. So whatever happens, the better man will win.\u201d\n\nWhile the respect is clearly there for Weidman (14-4 MMA, 9-4 UFC), Reyes is nonetheless laser-focused on the job at hand, which is scoring an impressive victory to position himself as the next man in line to face Jon Jones in 2020.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to win emphatically,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a finish. My goal is to finish every fight. If I don\u2019t finish, I feel I\u2019ve done a disservice to myself. I don\u2019t know if God has that plan for me to get an emphatic finish, or whether I have to go through another war. Whatever the case may be, I\u2019m only making my way towards the title.\u201d\n\nThat means a shot at Jones, who has looked virtually untouchable in the octagon through his MMA career. However, Reyes thinks he has the answer to the questions Jones poses, and his reason for that thinking is a simple one.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m me. We\u2019ll talk about that after this fight. But right now, I\u2019m worried about Chris.\u201d\n\nAnd when the fans react to Reyes\u2019 performance on Friday night, the native of Victorville, Calif., said he simply wants to be seen as the man to face Jones next. When asked what he wanted fans to say about his performance, he suggested: \u201cHe\u2019s the one. Get him to fight Jon.\u201d", "description": "Dominick Reyes believes he's one big win away from a shot at Jon Jones, and he plans on securing his title shot in spectacular fashion.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dominick-reyes-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
