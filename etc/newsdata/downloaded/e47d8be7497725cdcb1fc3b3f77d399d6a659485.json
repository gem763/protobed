Not since I found myself physically shaking, at about 1am on 24 June 2016, have I felt quite so stunned by any single news event as watching Lady Hale read out the Supreme Court\u2019s devastating verdict on Tuesday morning.\n\nI was one of a large number of journalists, sitting in the media centre of the Labour Party conference, when things were changed utterly. I, like many, had expected the government to lose, but not to lose so dramatically, and for a court judgement, which are traditionally highly reserved, to be quite so brutal.\n\nThe scenes that followed it, in Brighton and in New York, were utter chaos. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech moved forward, journalists rushing to Westminster from the south coast. Others waiting in their New York hotel beds, just before dawn, for the prime minister to rise to see the almighty mess he was in.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGetting the train back from a major party conference and heading direct to Westminster and a sitting House of Commons is something no Westminster journalist, however old, has ever done before.\n\nAnd instantly, the scenes were incredible. I am a political sketch writer, and yet, I could not find room even for a single sentence, over about 45 minutes of questions over the despatch box, on the subject of the prime minister\u2019s \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d in an east London flat that is said to have its own pole dancing apparatus inside it. That is not the standard run of things.\n\nSadly, there is precious little to laugh at. Much has already been said and written about the \u201ctoxic atmosphere\u201d in the commons on Wednesday night. I, personally, did not think it was significantly worse than it often is. Boris Johnson\u2019s words about Jo Cox were unforgivable. But what is more unforgivable is that he has not asked for forgiveness for them. He stands by them.\n\nAnd that, really, is the point. The government is in psychopathic mode. People imagine, or rather hope, it might be sensitive to requests to pull back from the brink. But it is the government that is driving us to the brink.\n\nOn Friday morning, the front page of The Times \u2013 The Times! \u2013 was given over to anonymous warnings from a \u201csenior cabinet minister\u201d that there will be riots if Brexit is not delivered.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a genius in interpreting political language to quite fairly and accurately call this a veiled threat. A veiled threat of violence, against the people, from its own government, if its way is not delivered.\n\nThat it as bleak as it gets. These are grim days indeed.\n\nYours,\n\nTom Peck\n\nPolitical sketch writer", "description": "Even in these rarefied days, this has been a week for the ages.
