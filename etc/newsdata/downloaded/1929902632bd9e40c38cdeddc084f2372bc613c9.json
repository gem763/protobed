I freely grant that. The issue is precisely whether the biblical judgment is correct. The Bible sanctioned slavery as well and nowhere attacked it as unjust.\n\nAfter receiving an avalanche of responses both supportive and critical, Father Martin doubled down by citing another line from the article that questions the authority of Sacred Scripture for teaching moral truth: \u201cAre we prepared to argue today that slavery is biblically justified?\u201d\n\nOne of those who responded to Father Martin was Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, who said it was his duty as pastor to oppose the priest in his assertions regarding the morality of homosexual sex.\n\n\u201cThank you for acknowledging that you question scripture,\u201d the bishop tweeted. \u201cIf we go down that road where do we stop? I know you have lots of support but you are challenging the Deposit of Faith that I promised to defend. As a bishop I\u2019ll keep defending it.\u201d\n\nBishop Strickland was not alone in thanking Father Martin for finally coming clean on where he stands personally regarding homosexuality. In the past, the priest has said he supports Catholic teaching on the morality of homosexual sex, a position at odds with his most recent revelations.\n\nMartin has been repeatedly criticized by Catholic prelates for refusing to call active homosexuals to conversion instead of merely affirming them in their behavior.\n\nOther respondents to Martin\u2019s tweet on social media took issue with the priest\u2019s assertions regarding the biblical position on slavery, linking to articles that show how the biblical treatment of slavery evolved considerably from certain sections of the Old Testament to the way it is treated in the New Testament.\n\nEarlier this month, Pope Francis received Father Martin in a 30-minute private audience in the Vatican, which the Jesuits called \u201ca highly significant public statement of support and encouragement.\u201d\n\n\u201cFather Martin is well known as a public speaker, author and for his pastoral ministry to L.G.B.T. people,\u201d Gerard O\u2019Connell Monday in the Jesuits\u2019 flagship magazine America.\n\nThe pope\u2019s \u201cpublic statement of support\u201d for the priest came just days after several U.S. bishops voiced concerns over the \u201cambiguity\u201d of the Martin\u2019s words and actions regarding homosexuality.\n\n\u201cFather Martin\u2019s public messages create confusion among the faithful and disrupt the unity of the Church by promoting a false sense that immoral sexual behavior is acceptable under God\u2019s law,\u201d wrote Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, in a statement on the diocesan website.\n\nThose who experience same-sex attraction need the Church\u2019s support \u201cin the Christian struggle for virtue, sanctification, and purity,\u201d the bishop said, while Father Martin \u201ceither encourages or fails to correct behavior that separates a person\u201d from God\u2019s love.\n\nAccording to one Jesuit priest, some 50 percent of the members of the Jesuit order are homosexuals.\n\n\u201cRoughly half of the Society under the age of fifty shuffles on the borderline between declared and undeclared gayness,\u201d wrote Father Paul Shaughnessy, S.J., in a 2002 essay in the Weekly Standard, titled, \u201cAre the Jesuits Catholic?\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "LGBT promoter Father James Martin has questioned whether the biblical condemnation of homosexual behavior may be mistaken.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
