Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNBA\u2019s initial response met with scorn\n\nThe NBA faced fire for its initial response describing Morey\u2019s tweet as \u201cregrettable\u201d and appearing to side with an oppressive Chinese regime over the human rights of Hong Kong protestors and Morey\u2019s freedom to speak his mind.\n\nSilver spoke to the backlash Tuesday morning after the league faced criticism for appearing to prioritize its significant financial stake in China, which responded to Morey\u2019s tweet with actions to cut off access of the the NBA through state-run media to its 1.4 billion citizens.\n\nPopovich praises Silver\u2019s progressive leadership\n\nPopovich\u2019s response was informed by Silver\u2019s Tuesday statement vowing not to regulate speech such as Morey\u2019s.\n\nHe started by touting Silver\u2019s and the NBA\u2019s bonafides as a progressive commissioner and league.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I guess I can go at it this way,\u201d Popovich said, per the San Antonio Express News. \u201cAdam is a very progressive leader. We all remember how he handled the situation with the former owner of the Clippers. It made everybody proud because it was the right thing to do. A couple of years ago, I was walking the streets in New York City during the gay pride parade. I turned around and here comes a float, and Adam is standing on a float with a big sign in support of LGBTQ. And I felt great again, just like I did with the Clipper deal.\u201d\n\nGregg Popovich is the latest voice to join what has been a largely united front from the NBA. (Getty)\n\nPopovich: Silver is \u2018very courageous\u2019\n\nPopovich continued, praising Silver for his free speech stance delivered Tuesday.\n\n\"He came out strongly for freedom of speech,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI felt great again. He's been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous. Then you compare it to what we've had to live through the past three years, it's a big difference. A big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise. It wasn't easy for him to say. He said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. \u201cBut he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. I'm thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\u201d\n\nUnited front from NBA\n\nThe NBA is in the midst of perhaps the most difficult controversy it\u2019s ever faced \u2014 most certainly the most tenuous of the Silver era. In a league filled with outspoken progressive voices, none have come out publicly so far against the NBA\u2019s initial controversial stance.\n\nJames Harden apologized to China. Kerr declined to comment. LeBron James has been conspicuously silent. And now Popovich is heaping praise on Silver.\n\nAs the league continues to face intense scrutiny, its key figures are closing ranks and presenting a united front.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Gregg Popovich is the latest voice to join what has been a largely united front from the NBA.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e0W.Ys8zwnlHEUO0LGNbxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1DmHcjB_Zgz1Lfy_07pBNg--~B/aD0zMDIzO3c9NDUzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/59149a10-ea26-11e9-bf5e-fcb5d498b71e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
