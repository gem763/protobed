I\u2019m really proud of my guys because last year, we were extremely young, I think fourth- or fifth-youngest team in the country.\n\n\u201cBut because of the way the season ended at the buzzer to go to the Sweet 16 and have a chance to come back home to play in D.C., it\u2019s made our guys really hungry.\u201d\n\nWith that hunger comes the hype. For the first time in four years, the Terrapins are considered one of the nation\u2019s best teams in the preseason. The official Associated Press poll isn\u2019t out yet, but everyone from college hoops expert Andy Katz to ESPN\u2019s and NBC Sports\u2019 college basketball previews believe Maryland is a top-10 team \u2014 possibly even a top-5 team.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly a topic of conversation among Terrapins players, junior guard Darryl Morsell said.\n\n\u201cWe got a group message, and our goal is to just get better every single day,\u201d Morsell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on preseason rankings, what people are talking about and stuff. We\u2019re just focused on our team \u2026 Our message is just conquering the day. We can\u2019t control what\u2019s happening tomorrow. Yesterday was yesterday. We just focused on the task at hand and just doing it to the best of our ability.\u201d\n\nMorsell, junior Joshua Tomaic and especially senior guard Anthony Cowan will be responsible for leadership roles. Cowan, who has a shot at the preseason All-American team, pulled out of the NBA draft last spring to return to College Park for his senior year. Turgeon praised Cowan, who is not the most outspoken player, for showing his leadership side so far in fall practices.\n\n\u201cIn a world where it\u2019s not great to become a senior, I\u2019m really proud of Anthony. Maybe he can make it cool again to do it,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cAnthony came back to win. Anthony\u2019s done a lot of things with scoring points and steals and assists, but he wants his legacy to be winning, and winning at a high level.\u201d\n\nCowan returned along with three other starters from last year; Bruno Fernando, now in the NBA, was the only notable departure. Last year\u2019s touted freshman class of Jalen \u201cStix\u201d Smith, Eric Ayala, Aaron Wiggins and Ricky Lindo Jr. now have a year of college experience to draw from.\n\n\u201cLast year pretty much just motivated me to be better and pretty much get stronger, work on all my weaknesses and just overall be a better teammate to my team.\u201d\n\nSmith was one of several players to put on muscle mass in the offseason \u2014 10 to 12 pounds worth, in his case. Turgeon has taken to calling the formerly lanky \u201cStix\u201d by a new nickname: \u201cLogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard that name around here,\u201d Smith said with a smile. \u201cA lot of people are going by that now, but I\u2019ll still always be Stix.\u201d\n\nThe new freshman class is headlined by twins Makhi and Makhel Mitchell from Woodrow Wilson High School in the District. Both are 6-foot-10, but Makhi was the higher-ranked prospect as a 4-star recruit. Still, they came to Maryland as a package deal.\n\nAnother freshman to watch is Chol Marial, a 7-foot-2 center from South Sudan. Marial underwent multiple surgeries to address stress fractures in both his legs. Turgeon said the program was hopeful that Marial will be cleared to play at a Nov. 25 meeting with doctors.\n\nIn the meantime, Marial has begun some lifting and shooting \u2014 he just has to keep his feet on the ground, whatever he does, to keep his legs safe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll stay that way until the swelling out of his knees is gone. But he\u2019s doing terrific,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cThe doctor couldn\u2019t have been happier with where he is, and he feels much better than he did before surgery.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Marial and the other freshmen, nobody will need to be pressed into action earlier than they\u2019re ready. After pushing their young, green roster last year, Turgeon said he\u2019s happy that the depth will allow some players to \u201clearn by sitting\u201d from time to time.\n\n\u201cI went back and watched every game when I was traveling recruiting the last month or so,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cWow, we were so young. And what the guys were able to do \u2014 now those guys are really grown men to me now as sophomores, and they\u2019ll help us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
