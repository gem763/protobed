Those camps had been guarded by Kurdish fighting groups now under attack by Turkey.\n\nFrance and Britain have special forces deployed in Syria, leaving their troops potentially exposed amid the fighting.\n\nThe developments set up another wedge between President Trump and Europe on security issues, with Europeans increasingly fearing that the sudden move from the White House to clear the way for Turkey\u2019s assault has led to an immediate security threat on their doorstep.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken both with President Trump and with [Turkish] President Erdogan, and we sent the clear message of our common will that this offensive stops,\u201d Macron said.\n\nMerkel said that she had spoken for an hour on Sunday to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cThis offensive must end, because the humanitarian consequences are grave and because the danger of the Islamic State becoming stronger is very significant,\u201d Merkel said, alongside Macron. \u201cWe cannot further accept this situation against the Kurds. Another solution must absolutely be found.\u201d\n\n[U.S.-allied Kurds strike deal to bring Assad\u2019s Syrian troops back into Kurdish areas]\n\nThe leaders stopped short of direct criticism of Trump, leveling their public anger at the Turkish leader instead.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed similar concerns to Erdogan in a Saturday evening phone call, Johnson\u2019s office said.\n\nBritain does not comment on deployments of its special forces.\n\nFrench leaders have not publicly discussed the status of their troops in Syria since the assault started last week, but they have previously said that if the United States fully pulls out of Syria, they will have to do so, as well.\n\n\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and others halted arms exports to Turkey in response to the escalating conflict, and European Union foreign ministers planned to discuss a further response Monday at a previously scheduled meeting in Luxembourg.\n\nEuropean countries have been depending on Turkey to prevent refugees from the Syrian conflict from crossing over into the European Union. Last week, Erdogan threatened to allow a wave of refugees into Europe if any European country condemned his actions in Syria.\n\nThe fighting also threatened to exacerbate rifts within the NATO military alliance, of which Turkey is a member. European countries are now at odds with Turkey for carrying out the assault and the United States for allowing it to happen after a phone call last week between Trump and Erdogan.\n\n\u201cThe Turks are a NATO partner, and NATO is an alliance based on values,\u201d German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told a party gathering Sunday. \u201cIf there are indications that Turkey is really planning to stay in northern Syria as a kind of occupying force, then there must be a clear answer from us. That will not do.\u201d\n\n[In Syria, U.S. pullout and Turkish assault sparks exodus to anywhere that feels safe]\n\nSome European policymakers said privately that Trump\u2019s decision to stand by as the assault on the Kurds progressed was causing broader worry about the value of U.S. security guarantees. Kurdish fighting groups in Syria have been the U.S. military\u2019s staunchest ally in combating the Islamic State, but Trump has done little to defend them against Erdogan.\n\n\u201cTo say this is the most comfortable situation would be lying, even according to political standards,\u201d said a senior European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of further stirring conflict with the White House.\n\n\u201cThe public is asking, \u2018If you\u2019re supposedly the allies of the U.S., like the Kurds, what\u2019s the guarantee it doesn\u2019t happen with formal allies, or legally binding allies?\u2019 \u201d\n\nEuropean policymakers have been debating since early this year about whether to repatriate E.U. citizens who joined the Islamic State and traveled to Syria and Iraq. The answer, until now, has been no \u2014 politicians feared the political consequences of taking people home, and some security policymakers thought it was safer to keep them inside the camps in Syria.\n\nNow, though, some might be starting to escape, raising the prospect of those citizens coming home on their own and posing a potential security threat to Europe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know today the people who left this camp,\u201d Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokeswoman for Macron, told the France 3 broadcaster Sunday. \u201cObviously, since the beginning of this armed operation, it was a French concern. Because we indeed have French jihadists whom we always believed must be put on trial on the ground, where they committed their acts.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about what could happen. So that\u2019s why we want Turkey to swiftly end its intervention,\u201d she said.\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nTurkish-led forces film themselves executing a Kurdish captive in Syria\n\nWho are the Kurds, and why is Turkey attacking them?\n\nTurkey\u2019s invasion of Syria puts Islamic State fight on hold at a critical time\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron convened an emergency meeting of his security advisers.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5UaydGl39TwheZ6vNxFyLKuYlJU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/66NDEPHN5YI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
