These reviews, to check for problems that might have produced false readings, sometimes cause a small fraction of the records to be discounted.\n\nEuropean heatwaves\n\nHeatwaves in Europe in June and July sent temperatures soaring, smashing a number of local and national records.\n\nFrance set an all-time high-temperature of 46C, while the UK, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands also reported new highs.\n\nThis summer was notable for the very large number of all-time temperature records set in Europe, according to Dr Robert Rohde, Lead Scientist at Berkeley Earth.\n\n\"Some places in Europe have histories of weather observations going back more than 150 years, and yet still saw new all-time record highs,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe extent of the hot spells on the continent is clearly visible when looking at a breakdown of when the most temperature records were broken. In late July, all-time temperature records were set in a number of European countries including the UK.\n\nElsewhere, more than 30 all-time records were broken in the US, according to the Berkeley Earth data. In Japan, where 11 people who died as a result of the summer heatwave, 10 all-time temperature record highs were set.\n\nThe summer saw 396 all-time high temperatures in total.\n\nMost all-time temperature records in measuring stations covered by the data were broken in 2010, followed by 2003.\n\nThe increasing number of record high temperatures are a part of the long-term trend of global warming, said Dr Rohde.\n\n\"As the Earth warms, it has become easier for weather stations to set new all-time records. In the past, we would usually only see about 2% of weather stations recording a new record high in any given year,\" he explained.\n\n\"But, recently, we sometimes see years, like 2019, with 5% or more of the weather stations recording a new all-time record high.\"\n\nIn part, the number of new records is affected by where heatwaves occur, as well as the temperatures recorded. There are more weather stations in the United States and Europe, meaning that a heatwave in those areas has the potential to break more records.\n\nBut with climate change making hot spells like those in Europe this summer more intense, Dr Rohde says that while new records won't be set every year at every location, they will be more likely.\n\nInteractive tool: How much warmer is your city?
