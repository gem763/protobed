Slow and steady wins the race. Timing the market is a loser\u2019s game. Etc.\n\nBut is that tried-and-true approach better than putting a lump sum to work all in one leap into equities? Or even fixed income?\n\nIn a deep dive hailed as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d by Reformed Broker blogger Josh Brown, Ritholtz Wealth Management analyst Nick Maggiulli found it\u2019s almost always better to invest a wad of cash right away rather than average-in over time.\n\n\u201cSitting in cash (or even in T-bills) simply doesn\u2019t pay compared to the markets because most markets have a long term positive trend,\u201d he wrote, adding that even an ultraconservative approach \u2014 loading up on bonds \u2014 is the better option.\n\n\u201cMy results show that any stock/bond portfolio combination (even a 100% bond portfolio!) would have, on average, outperformed a 24-month DCA [dollar-cost averaging] into an all-stock portfolio,\u201d Maggiulli explained. \u201cIf that statement doesn\u2019t shock you, let me make it more concrete.\u201d\n\nHe used $2.4 million as an example. If you were fortunate enough to have that much money to put to work, would you be better off investing all of it immediately or putting $100,000 a month in the market for the next two years?\n\n\u201cMy analysis shows that you would have been better off had you invested all $2.4 million into any stock/bond portfolio combination (80/20 stock/bond, 20/80 stock/bond, etc.) at the beginning instead of averaging-in over time,\u201d he said.\n\nHe used this animated graphic to capture his point:\n\nEven in the most conservative example, where the lump sum is invested completely in fixed income, it outperforms DCA by 0.9%, on average, and is the better choice in about half of all 24-month buying windows, he discovered.\n\n\u201cThink about how profound this is,\u201d Maggiulli wrote in his Of Dollars and Data blog. \u201cOver the last 60 years there has basically been a 50-50 shot that a 24-month DCA into an all-stock portfolio would underperform an initial lump sum investment into an all-bond portfolio! This is nuts.\u201d\n\nHis takeaway is that if you ever come into a windfall, you\u2019d be far better off putting the money in play rather than keeping powder dry on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cAs the phrase goes, \u2018Time in the market beats timing the market,\u2019\u201d Maggiulli wrote. \u201cWhy? Because every day your money isn\u2019t working for you, it is inflating away. With 2% annual inflation, you lose half a basis point (0.005%) on your cash holdings day in and day out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% continues to weaken this week, down slightly at last check, as oil prices CL.1, -0.84% pull back from Monday\u2019s double-digit spike.", "description": "Dollar-cost averaging has long been espoused by the likes of Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham as a savvy way to mitigate risk and build a portfolio by...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR483_lumpin_ZG_20190917174927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
