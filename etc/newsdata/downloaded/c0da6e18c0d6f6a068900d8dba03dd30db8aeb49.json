As Tate Modern tops our chart, its architect reveals his trick: avoid glamour and keep it raw\n\n\u2018It is totally unimaginable now,\u201d says Jacques Herzog, \u201cbut this was a huge chunk of the city that was completely excluded from public life, overgrown and set back behind high walls. It felt like Sleeping Beauty\u2019s castle.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss architect is referring to Bankside power station, the great brick hulk that he and Pierre de Meuron transformed into Tate Modern in the year 2000, turning it into a cathedral of art that is now officially the most popular attraction in the UK, receiving 5.9 million visitors last year. People don\u2019t just come for the art, but to experience the most powerful architectural transformation of the century, and one of the most majestic indoor public spaces in the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to deal with existing structures, not to destroy them and not to respect them too much,\u201d says Herzog, whose small, then-unknown practice was selected in the 1994 competition precisely because it proposed to do the least to Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s power station. \u201cSome critics asked why we didn\u2019t leave some turbines, but we had to reduce it some way. By removing the ground floor and digging everything out, we tried to amplify the awesome power of the existing space.\u201d\n\nTwenty years on, the project is no less powerful. In fact, it seems eerily ahead of its time. The turn of the millennium was a time when \u201ciconic\u201d architecture was in its overblown prime, every city desperate for a piece of the \u201cBilbao effect\u201d, following Frank Gehry\u2019s thrashing titanium fish for the Guggenheim Museum. To take what seemed like a gloomy 1950s brick shed and strip it out, adding a bare minimum of new elements in raw concrete, glass and steel, was a deeply strange thing to do. Tate duly received flak from the architectural establishment for its reticence, accused of lacking the confidence to commission a more flamboyant new building.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible foresight from Nick [Serota, former Tate director] to think of using this building. He had seen artists working in industrial spaces in London and New York, but to turn it into a gallery was new,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cWe knew we had to keep it raw. We didn\u2019t want to go for glamour, or add decorative elements or formal details. We learned from arte povera that poor materials and ugliness are powerful aesthetic elements.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cas found\u201d aesthetic seems so familiar now, but at the beginning of the century, this carefully judged bricolage of rough and smooth, combining the mighty mineral heft of industrial materials with precise surgical incisions into the existing fabric, was something new for London. And not without its difficulties to achieve.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Precision and care\u2019 \u2026 Jacques Herzog, left, and Pierre de Meuron. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer\n\n\u201cConstruction in England is\u2026\u201d Herzog pauses. \u201cLet\u2019s say, less careful. It would have been impossible if Nick hadn\u2019t been so insistent on the Swiss quality of building. Even though it\u2019s a rough building, it needed some precision and care, particularly with the elements you touch, like the handrails.\u201d\n\nHerzog & de Meuron has cemented its position as probably the most sought-after architecture practice in the world, consistently reinventing its approach for each new building, be it a stadium, opera house or the little roadside chapel currently keeping Herzog busy. But Tate Modern remains its defining work.\n\n\u201cIt is the key project of our company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt always returns, when I\u2019m talking about programming a space without a given programme, or involving the public, or reusing existing structures, or how to discover spaces that are somewhere between spooky, mysterious and beautiful. You can\u2019t invent that. There is a lot of beauty in the world that we have to appreciate before we transform it.\u201d", "description": "What was once a gloomy brickshed is now one of the most awe-inspiring art galleries in the world.
