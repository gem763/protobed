Second-ranked Rafael Nadal will play No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, and anybody counting the fait as accompli before Sunday at 4 p.m. is guilty of excessive napping.\n\nCertainly, Nadal would be every bit as favored as his upper arms, with his 2019 season blossoming from an early night of wreckage. At ages 32 and then 33 starting in June, he has reached the Australian Open final (where Novak Djokovic destroyed him), the French Open title podium, a Wimbledon semifinal and the U.S. Open final as of Friday night\u2019s 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 6-1 breakdown of Italian revelation Matteo Berrettini.\n\nSpeaking of revelations, the Djokovic-lessness and the Roger Federer-lessness of it all didn\u2019t leave Nadal opposite somebody scarily overmatched. It left him playing Medvedev, the 6-foot-6 definition of lankiness, whose 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3 win over longtime Bulgarian stalwart Grigor Dimitrov exhibited Medvedev\u2019s will and pluck.\n\n[For Serena Williams, Grand Slam win after childbirth could be mother of all accomplishments]\n\nNobody reaches 20-2 in a summertime hard-court season in North America without will and pluck, but there Medvedev stands. He has beaten 12 top-40 players, three top-10 players and the players ranked first (Djokovic) and fourth (Dominic Thiem) in a run through Washington (to the final), Montreal (to the final), Cincinnati (to the title) and Flushing Meadows, to his first Grand Slam final in his first passage beyond a fourth round. He will find an opponent playing in his fifth U.S. Open and 27th Grand Slam final, seeking titles No. 4 and 19 in those abundant categories, yet he will find one who said, as did Nadal, \u201cHe\u2019s the player that is playing better today on tour during the summer.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cbetter,\u201d in his charming second language, Nadal seemed to mean \u201cbest,\u201d and he said of Medvedev, \u201cHe\u2019s making steps forward every single week,\u201d those steps including the Montreal final where Nadal schooled Medvedev, 6-3, 6-0, another backdrop here.\n\n\u201cHe just fights right,\u201d Dimitrov said of Medvedev. \u201cThat\u2019s it. He puts every ball in the court. Somehow he gets to the balls. Doesn\u2019t give you enough free points. I think that\u2019s the major thing that I see right now.\u201d\n\nMedvedev\u2019s capacity for escapes that seem almost illusory turned up against Dimitrov in a first set in which everyone seemed to agree the Bulgarian who ousted Federer played better than the Russian who had pounded through Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarterfinals. In seeking clues as to why Medvedev won a set in which he got two fewer points, you might look at confidence. \u201cThe confidence means a lot in this case,\u201d Medvedev said, \u201cbecause I do think he was better player in the first set. I do think I was kind of lucky to win it. Then the momentum changed completely.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cWe had some amazing level, I think.\u201d\n\n[At U.S. Open, Althea Gibson statue has become an essential stop: \u2018It means we\u2019re no longer hidden\u2019]\n\nThey had some amazing level, all thought, but then Medvedev proved superior even in the first semifinal of a 23-year-old. And in that way tennis undresses a person and reveals some inner moxie, he apparently has that, too, having sparred a bit with New York fans along his six-match path to this pinnacle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because actually when I was like, I don\u2019t remember, 6 or 7 [in Moscow], I liked wrestling because I thought it\u2019s for real,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents were like: \u2018Why are you watching this? This is just a show.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, they\u2019re fighting for real.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think it has any \u2014 how you say? \u2014 impact on what\u2019s been happening here. As I said before, I want to be a better person than I was a few days here.\u201d\n\nHis coach, Frenchman Gilles Cervara, said he requires a different, subtle kind of coaching and called Medvedev both \u201csmart\u201d and, after rummaging around for the English word, \u201csubtle.\u201d That\u2019s right: A so-called villain who gave a subtle finger to a third-round crowd comes off as a guy unusually personable and nice. \u201cYeah, I will not say that I\u2019m a kind person or a good person,\u201d he said generously. \u201cI can only say that I\u2019m a really calm person in life. I actually have no idea why the demons go out when I play tennis.\u201d\n\nDemons are coming Sunday in Nadal\u2019s shots, which slowly wore down Berrettini, who proved far more impressive than perhaps anticipated. That first-set tiebreaker saw him arrange a 4-0 lead and two set points at 6-4 before he lost them against the all-time fighter, including an ill-advised drop shot that wobbled into the net.\n\nBerrettini, like Medvedev in a first Grand Slam semifinal at 23, also walked a rope for a good, long while, saving the first nine break points Nadal had against him. Finally, a 10th came through another dying-quail drop shot, and when a low Berrettini attempt went low into the net, Nadal pumped those fists. The match would show the stresses of the Italian\u2019s task in that he served for 117 points, while Nadal just 75. Break-point rates: Nadal 4 for 16, Berrettini 0 for 0.\n\nSuch numbers do cause inconvenience, especially against Nadal.", "description": "They both advance in straight sets, but neither came easy.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Pm", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3-wBcP6bEmgd6DqSoBg1zYmRZ7I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QDPA6MGRDUI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
