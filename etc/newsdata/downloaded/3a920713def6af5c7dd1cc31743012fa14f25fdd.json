I think it was like a promo.\n\n'You know she was standing outside a door but, no. Never met her in my life.'\n\nLast month Ovie was forced to hit back at claims that India had cheated on him with footballer Kieran Gibbs, 29, at his birthday party in Ibiza.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with MailOnline the basketball player said: 'Me and India are happy. I think that's definitely the most important thing. We're very happy.\n\n'Regardless of how many people [there are] in every one of our lives, there will be opinions. And everyone can have their own opinion.'\n\nOh no! The former lovebirds were thought to be on the rocks over the last few weeks after having rarely been seen together following heavy cheating speculation on both ends\n\nSpeaking of the cheating claims, India added to MailOnline: 'We've had a week of nightmare things. There was one [rumour] last week and then yesterday there was another. Can we have a break? Can we just live, please?\n\n'We've been absolutely fine, but obviously it's not nice. The worst thing is \u2013 something coming out in the paper is one thing, we know it's not true and we can just get over that \u2013 but it's all the people on Instagram that start sending you horrible messages.'\n\nClarifying the situation, she explained: \u2018I\u2019ve known Kieran and his brother for years and it was their 30th birthday so I was there with loads of friends and family. There\u2019s nothing about it! It got blown into a ridiculous thing.\u2019\n\nOvie\u2019s trustworthiness was also under the microscope after it was alleged he had \u2018cheated\u2019 by kissing Stormzy\u2019s ex Maya Jama \u2013 a report all parties have denied.\n\n'Never met her in my life': Just days ago, rumours surfaced claiming Ovie had got close to Maya Jama (pictured) however he hit back at the claims\n\n'Me and India are happy': Last month Ovie was forced to hit back at claims that India had cheated on him with footballer Kieran Gibbs, 29, (pictured) at his birthday party in Ibiza\n\nLaughing off the drama, India insisted to MailOnline: \u2018You just have to take the positives from it. We\u2019re both happy together so that\u2019s the main thing. You\u2019re going to get tested in a relationship.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day we\u2019ve only known each other about seven weeks, even though it feels so much longer. It\u2019s so intense. If we can get through something like this, I think we\u2019re going to be fine.\u2019\n\nFollowing the sad news of winners Amber Gill and Irishman Greg O\u2019Shea\u2019s split, India previously revealed that the geographical proximity to Ovie has helped them keep the momentum going.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so sad! Ovie and I do live quite close, so I guess it is easier for us than it has been for others maybe \u2013 they were in different countries. For us it\u2019s an hour so you can just pop in. long-distance is always hard in any relationship\u2019, she mused.\n\nOvie is currently busy with his role as an ASOS ambassador and fledgling presenting career while India is serving as a Boohoo ambassador.\n\nMaura Higgins and Curtis Pritchard, as well as Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, are the only remaining couples from this year's Love Island.", "description": "Love Island's Ovie Soko and India Reynolds have officially split.", "authors": ["Jabeen Waheed", "Sarah Packer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/12/20214648-0-image-a-116_1572090302627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
