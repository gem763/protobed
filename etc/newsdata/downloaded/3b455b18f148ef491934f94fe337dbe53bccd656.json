You can form your own view.

How could the leader of a proud and respected nation threaten a campaign of disruption in an attempt to get his way?\n\nWe could understand it if what the prime minister in public calls \u201cour European friends\u201d decided they had had enough of the troublesome British. But fortunately the ideal of European unity is strong, and there is no sign that other EU leaders want to take a decision about our EU membership that we are not prepared to take for ourselves.\n\nThe prime minister has already stretched the British constitution as far as it will go in an attempt to curtail debate in parliament \u2013 an unsuccessful one, as it turned out. These are the tactics of someone who has lost the argument; of someone who has to resort to procedural tricks in an attempt to get his way against the majority in our democratically elected House of Commons.\n\nWe realise, of course, that Boris Johnson is frustrated to discover that, when a majority of MPs said they opposed a no-deal Brexit, they meant it. He is entitled to claim to be acting on the instruction of the British people in the referendum of 2016, but he knows as well as anyone that this instruction was ambiguous, and that the passage of time has muffled it further rather than clarified it.\n\nWe understand, therefore, the prime minister\u2019s desire to go back to the people in a general election in order to seek clarity. But there is no guarantee that a general election would be decisive. The last time a prime minister fought an election to try to win a mandate for her Brexit policy, it resulted in further confusion and delay.\n\nIf Mr Johnson wants to clarify the mandate of the people from the 2016 referendum, the best way to do that would be not a general election but a new referendum. That is the right and democratic way out of the prime minister\u2019s entirely self-inflicted difficulty: put a simple choice between defined options to the British people in a Final Say referendum.", "description": "The latest cunning plan from the strategic geniuses of Downing Street is for the British government to make life so difficult for the other members of the European Union that they decide to expel the United Kingdom.\u00a0 \u201cWe will turn the pressure on to the EU to show how difficult it will be for them if the UK is still hanging around,\u201d we report a No 10 official as saying.\u00a0\u201cIf", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/16/boris-cows.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
