Prudential lost 10%.\n\nAmong midcaps, Capital & Counties Properties jumped 8.2% after luxury property developer Nicholas Candy's investment arm said it was in early talks for a possible cash offer for the property manager.\n\nIndustrial fastener maker Trifast plunged 15% on the UK small-cap index after forecasting lower earnings for the year, while peer-to-peer lending platform Funding Circle advanced 7% after reporting strong loan growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Muvija M and Shashwat Awasthi in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "UK midcaps recovered from early losses to edge higher on Monday on hopes that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided even though uncertainties persisted as lawmakers forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek another extension from the European Union.
