Devin Nunes realized the purpose of Obama\u2019s dossier. 'Devin figured out in December what was going on,' says Langer. 'It was an operation to bring down Trump.'\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Lee Smith\u2019s book out October 29, \u201cThe Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History.\u201d\n\nAFTER DONALD TRUMP was elected forty-fifth president of the United States, the operation designed to undermine his campaign transformed. It became an instrument to bring down the commander in chief. The coup started almost immediately after the polls closed.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s communications team decided within twenty-four hours of her concession speech to message that the election was illegitimate, that Russia had interfered to help Trump.\n\nObama was working against Trump until the hour he left office. His national security advisor, Susan Rice, commemorated it with an email to herself on January 20, moments before Trump\u2019s inauguration. She wrote to memorialize a meeting in the White House two weeks before.\n\nOn January 5, following a briefing by IC leadership on Russian hacking during the 2016 Presidential election, President Obama had a brief follow-on conversation with FBI Director Jim Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in the Oval Office. Vice President Biden and I were also present. President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities \u201cby the book.\u201d The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book. From a national security perspective, however, President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia. . . . The President asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team. Comey said he would.\n\nThe repetition of \u201cby the book\u201d gave away the game\u2014for there was nothing normal about any of it.\n\nRice wrote an email to herself. It commemorated a conversation from two weeks before. The conversation was about the FBI\u2019s investigation of the man who was about to move into the White House\u2014an investigation from which Obama was careful to distance himself. During the conversation, the outgoing president instructed his top aides to collect information (\u201cascertain\u201d) regarding the incoming administration\u2019s relationship with Russia.\n\n\u201cTo any rational person,\u201d says Nunes, \u201cit looks like they were scheming to produce a get-out-of-jail-free card\u2014for the president and anyone else in the White House. They were playing Monopoly while the others were playing with fire. Now the Obama White House was in the clear\u2014sure, they had no idea what Comey and Brennan and McCabe and Strzok and the rest were up to.\u201d\n\nBoxing Trump in on Russia\n\nMeanwhile, Obama added his voice to the Trump-Russia echo chamber as news stories alleging Trump\u2019s illicit relationship with the Kremlin multiplied in the transition period. He said he hoped \u201cthat the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia.\u201d\n\nThe outgoing president was in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss everything from NATO to Vladimir Putin. Obama said that he\u2019d \u201cdelivered a clear and forceful message\u201d to the Russian president about \u201cmeddling with elections . . . and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening.\u201d\n\nAfter refusing to act while the Russian election meddling was actually occurring, Obama responded in December. He ordered the closing of Russian diplomatic facilities and the expulsion of thirty- five Russian diplomats. The response was tepid. The Russians had hacked the State Department in 2014 and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2015. And now Obama was responding only on his way out.\n\nEven Obama partisans thought it was weak. \u201cThe punishment did not fit the crime,\u201d said Michael McFaul, Obama\u2019s former ambassador to Russia. \u201cThe Kremlin should have paid a much higher price for that attack.\u201d\n\nBut the administration wasn\u2019t retaliating against Russia for interfering in a US election; the action was directed at Trump. Obama was leaving the president-elect with a minor foreign policy crisis in order to box him in. Any criticism of Obama\u2019s response, never mind an attempt to reverse it, would only further fuel press reports that Trump was collaborating with the Russians.\n\nSpreading Intelligence to Spring Leaks\n\nIn the administration\u2019s last days, it disseminated intelligence throughout the government, including the White House, Capitol Hill, and the intelligence community (IC). Intelligence was classified at the lowest possible levels to ensure a wide readership. The White House was paving the way for a campaign of leaks to disorient the incoming Trump team.\n\nThe effort, including the intended result of leaks, was publicly acknowledged in March 2017 by Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration.\n\nObama\u2019s biggest move against Trump was to order CIA director John Brennan to conduct a full review of all intelligence relating to Russia and the 2016 elections. He requested it on December 6 and wanted it ready by the time he left office on January 20. But the sitting president already knew what the intelligence community assessment (ICA) was going to say, because Brennan had told him months before.\n\nBrennan\u2019s handpicked team of CIA, FBI, and NSA analysts had started analyzing Russian election interference in late July. In August, Brennan had briefed Harry Reid on the dossier and may have briefed Obama on it, too. Earlier in August, Brennan sent a \u201cbombshell\u201d report to Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nWhen Brennan reassembled his select team in December, it was to have them reproduce their August findings: Putin, according to Brennan, was boosting the GOP candidate. And that\u2019s why only three days after Obama ordered the assessment in December, the Washington Post could already reveal what the intelligence community had found.\n\n\u201cThe CIA,\u201d reported the December 9 edition of the Post, \u201chas concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system.\u201d\n\nThe story was the first of many apparently sourced to leaks of classified information that were given to the Post team of Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller. The reporters\u2019 sources weren\u2019t whistle-blowers shedding light on government corruption\u2014 rather, they were senior US officials abusing government resources to prosecute a campaign against the newly elected commander in chief. The article was the earliest public evidence that the coup was under way. The floodgates were open, as the IC pushed more stories through the press to delegitimize the president-elect.\n\nA Wave of Leak-Sourced Stories All Saying the Same Thing\n\nThe same day, a New York Times article by David E. Sanger and Scott Shane echoed the Post\u2019s piece. According to senior administration officials, \u201cAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded with \u2018high confidence\u2019 that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances and promote Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nA December 14 NBC News story by William M. Arkin, Ken Dilanian, and Cynthia McFadden reported that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, senior U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News.\u201d\n\nThe ICA that Obama ordered gave political operatives, the press, and his intelligence chiefs a second shot at Trump. They\u2019d used the Steele Dossier to feed the echo chamber and obtain surveillance powers to spy on the Trump campaign. The dossier, however, had come up short. Trump had won.\n\nBut now, on his way out of the White House, Obama instructed Brennan to stamp the CIA\u2019s imprimatur on the anti-Trump operation. As Fusion GPS\u2019s smear campaign had been the source of the preelection press campaign, the ICA was the basis of the postelection media frenzy. It was tailored to disrupt the peaceful transition of power and throw the United States into chaos.\n\nBecause Trump hadn\u2019t been elected by the US public, according to the ICA, but had been tapped by Putin, he was illegitimate. Therefore, the extraconstitutional and illegal tactics employed by anti-Trump officials were legitimate. The ultimate goal was to remove Trump from office.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for President Obama,\u201d said James Clapper, \u201cwe might not have done the intelligence community assessment . . . that set off a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today.\u201d\n\nNunes agrees. \u201cThe ICA,\u201d he says, \u201cwas Obama\u2019s dossier.\u201d\n\nChanging the Intelligence Assessment\n\nNunes is sitting in his office in the Longworth House Office Building along with his communications director, Jack Langer, a forty-six-year-old former book editor and historian with a PhD from Duke University.\n\n\u201cThe social media attacks on Devin began shortly after the election,\u201d Langer remembers. \u201cThey\u2019re all hinting at some vast conspiracy involving Russia that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee is part of. And we have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nNunes points out that his warnings about Russia fell on deaf ears for years. \u201cAnd all of a sudden I\u2019m a Russian agent,\u201d says the congressman.\n\nNow Langer and Nunes see that the attacks were first launched because the congressman had been named to Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cI put forward [Mike] Pompeo for CIA director,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cHe came from our committee.\u201d\n\nThe attacks on Nunes picked up after the December 9 Washington Post article. The assessment provided there was not what the HPSCI chairman had been told. The assessment had been altered, and Nunes asked for an explanation. \u201cWe got briefed about the election around Thanksgiving,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just the usual stuff, nothing abnormal. They told us what everyone already knew: \u2018Hey, the Russians are bad actors, and they\u2019re always playing games, and here\u2019s what they did.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy providing that briefing, the IC had made a mistake. When it later changed the assessment, the November briefing was evidence that Obama\u2019s spy chiefs were up to no good. \u201cI bet they\u2019d like to have that back,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cThey briefed us before they could get their new story straight.\u201d\n\n\u2018They Kept Everyone Else Away from It\u2019\n\nNunes acknowledges that he was caught off guard by many things back then. \u201cWe still thought these guys were on the up and up,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if we knew, we\u2019d have nailed them by mid-December, when they changed their assessment. \u2018Wait, you guys are saying this now, but you said something else just a few weeks ago. What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the Post story, Nunes wanted an explanation. \u201cWe expressed deep concern, both publicly and privately,\u201d says Langer. \u201cWe demanded our own briefing to try to determine whether that Post story was true or false. They refused to brief us. They said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to be doing that until we finish the ICA.\u2019\u201d\n\nNunes says the fact that the IC conducted an assessment like that was itself unusual. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times they\u2019d done that in the past, if ever,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if the IC is operating properly, when someone says what can you tell me on X or Y or Z, they have it ready to pull up quickly. The tradecraft is reliable, and the intelligence products are reliable.\u201d That was not the case with the ICA. There were problems with how the assessment had been put together.\n\n\u201cIf you really were going to do something like an assessment from the intelligence community, then you\u2019d get input from all our seventeen agencies,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cThey did the opposite. It was only FBI, CIA, NSA, and DNI. They siloed it, just like they had with Crossfire Hurricane. They kept everyone else away from it so they didn\u2019t have to read them in.\u201d\n\n\u2018Manipulation of Intelligence for Political Purposes\u2019\n\nNunes released several statements in the middle of December. The HPSCI majority, read a December 14 statement, wanted senior Obama intelligence officials \u201cto clarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us. The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.\u201d\n\nAfter the statements warned of political foul play in the IC\u2019s assessments, the social media attacks on Nunes became more regular. \u201cThey were constant,\u201d says Langer.\n\nAnti-Trump operatives recognized that Nunes was going to be a problem. The HPSCI chair had previously called out the IC for politicizing intelligence. \u201cThey said that we had defeated Al Qaeda in Iraq and Syria,\u201d says Nunes, \u201cand I knew that wasn\u2019t true. Then they withheld the Osama bin Laden documents to conceal that Al Qaeda worked with Iran, because the administration was protecting the Iran deal. So when I saw them changing this assessment of the 2016 election in midstream, I knew it was the same old trick: they were politicizing intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe speed with which Brennan\u2019s handpicked analysts produced the ICA and then got a version of it declassified for public consumption was another sign that something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cAll throughout Obama\u2019s two terms, his IC chiefs aren\u2019t paying attention to Russian actions,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cWe give them more money for Russia, which they don\u2019t use. But now they know so much about Putin that they manage to produce a comprehensive assessment of Russian intentions and actions regarding election interference in a month\u2014at Christmastime, when everything slows down. And then they produce a declassified version in a manner of weeks. None of this is believable.\u201d\n\nThree different versions of the ICA were produced: an unclassified version, a top secret one, and another highly compartmentalized version. According to a January 11, 2017, Washington Post story by Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima, and Karen DeYoung, an annex summarizing the dossier was attached to the versions that were not declassified.\n\n\u2018Designed to Have a Political Effect\u2019\n\nThe FBI had been working from Steele\u2019s reports for more than half a year. Including the dossier along with the ICA would provide Comey with ammunition to take on the president-elect. Both he and Brennan were manipulating intelligence for political purposes.\n\n\u201cA lot of the ICA is reasonable,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cBut those parts become irrelevant due to the problematic parts, which undermine the entire document. It was designed to have a political effect; that was the ICA\u2019s sole purpose.\u201d\n\nThe assessment\u2019s methodological flaws are not difficult to spot. Manufacturing the politicized findings that Obama sought meant not only abandoning protocol but also subverting basic logic. Two of the ICA\u2019s central findings are that:\n\nPutin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\n\nPutin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\n\nTo know preferences and intentions would require sources targeting Putin\u2019s inner circles\u2014either human sources or electronic surveillance. As Nunes had previously noted, however, US intelligence on Putin\u2019s decision-making process was inadequate.\n\nBut even if there had been extensive collection on precisely that issue, it would be difficult to know what was true. For instance, the closest you can get to Putin\u2019s inner circle is Putin himself. But even capturing him on an intercept saying he wanted to elect Trump might prove inconclusive. It is difficult to judge intentions because it is not possible to see into the minds of other people. How would you know that Putin was speaking truthfully? How would you know that the Russian president didn\u2019t know his communications were under US surveillance and wasn\u2019t trying to deceive his audience?\n\nQuality control of information is one of the tasks of counterintelligence\u2014to discern how you know what you know and whether that information is trustworthy. There was no quality control for the Trump-Russia intelligence. For instance, Crossfire Hurricane lead agent Peter Strzok was the FBI\u2019s deputy assistant director of counterintelligence. Instead of weeding out flawed intelligence on Russia, the Crossfire Hurricane team was feeding Steele\u2019s reports into intelligence products. Yet the ICA claimed to have \u201chigh confidence\u201d in its assessment that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President- elect Trump.\u201d What was the basis of that judgment?\n\nAccording to the ICA:\n\nPutin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.\n\n\u201cMost likely\u201d and \u201calmost certainly\u201d are rhetorical hedges that show the assessment could not have been made in \u201chigh confidence.\u201d Putin may have held a grudge against Clinton, but there is no way of knowing it.\n\nThe supporting evidence deteriorates more the farther the ICA purports to reach into Putin\u2019s mind.\n\nBeginning in June, Putin\u2019s public comments about the US presidential race avoided directly praising President-elect Trump, probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States.\n\nThis is absurd. Part of the evidence that Putin supported Trump is that he avoided praising Trump. It is difficult enough to determine intentions by what someone says. Yet the ICA claims to have discerned Putin\u2019s intentions by what he did not say.\n\nThere is no introductory philosophy class in logic where reasoning like that would pass muster. Yet Brennan\u2019s handpicked group used it as the basis of its assessment that Putin had helped Trump.\n\nMoscow also saw the election of President-elect Trump as a way to achieve an international counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\n\nThis may be an accurate description of how Putin saw Trump. But Trump\u2019s predecessor also wanted to coordinate anti- ISIS operations with Moscow. On this view, Trump would have represented a continuation of Obama\u2019s ISIS policy. Why would this make Trump\u2019s victory suspicious to Obama\u2019s intelligence chiefs?\n\nCurious Inaccuracies about Russia\u2019s RT Network\n\nThe ICA also pointed to documentary evidence of Putin\u2019s intentions: English-language media owned by the Russian government, the news site Sputnik, and the RT network, were critical of Clinton.\n\nState-owned Russian media made increasingly favorable comments about President-elect Trump as the 2016 US general and primary election campaigns progressed while consistently offering negative coverage of Secretary Clinton.\n\nCuriously, just days before the election, the informant the US government sent after the Trump campaign praised the Democratic candidate in an interview with Sputnik. \u201cClinton would be best for US-UK relations and for relations with the European Union,\u201d Stefan Halper told the Kremlin-directed media outlet. \u201cClinton is well-known, deeply experienced, and predictable. US-UK relations will remain steady regardless of the winner although Clinton will be less disruptive over time.\u201d\n\nThe ICA includes a seven-page appendix devoted to RT, the central node, according to the document, of the Kremlin\u2019s effort to \u201cinfluence politics, fuel discontent in [sic] US.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff appeared on RT in July 2013. He argued for \u201cmaking the FISA court much more transparent, so the American people can understand what\u2019s being done in their name in the name of national security, so that we can have a more informed debate over the balance between privacy and security.\u201d\n\nRT\u2019s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, is a master propagandist, according to the ICA. The document fails to mention that Simonyan heads another Moscow-owned media initiative, Russia Beyond the Headlines, a news supplement inserted into dozens of the West\u2019s leading newspapers, including the New York Times. Russia Beyond the Headlines has been delivered to millions of American homes over the last decade. By contrast, RT\u2019s US market share is so small that it doesn\u2019t qualify for the Nielsen ratings. Virtually no one in the United States watches it.\n\nTaking the logic of Brennan\u2019s handpicked team seriously would mean that the publishers of the New York Times played a major role in a coordinated Russian effort to elect Donald Trump.\n\n\u2018It Was an Operation to Bring Down Trump\u2019\n\nNunes realized even then the purpose of Obama\u2019s dossier. \u201cDevin figured out in December what was going on,\u201d says Langer. \u201cIt was an operation to bring down Trump.\u201d\n\nThere was no evidence that any Trump associate had done anything improper regarding the Russians, and Nunes was losing patience. \u201cWe had serious things the committee wanted to do,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Trump elected, we could do some big stuff, like with China.\u201d\n\nStill, it was important for HPSCI to maintain control of the Russia investigation. Otherwise, Democrats and Never Trump Republicans were likely to get their wish to convene a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference\u2014with the purpose of turning it on Trump.\n\n\u201cBefore they started floating the idea of a special counsel, the big idea was a special commission like the 9/11 Commission,\u201d says Langer. It was outgoing secretary of state John Kerry who first came forward with the proposal.\n\nThe point was to change the power dynamic. \u201cIn a normal committee,\u201d says Langer, \u201cthe majority has the power, and that happened to be us. They wanted to strip our power and make it fifty-fifty.\u201d\n\n\u201cBipartisan\u201d was a euphemism for \u201canti-Trump.\u201d \u201cIt would have been a complete joke,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cA combination of partisan hacks from the left and people who hated Trump on the right.\u201d\n\nDemocrats led by Schiff and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer were joined by the late John McCain, the most active of the Never Trump Republicans. After the election, the Arizona senator had instructed his aide David Kramer to deliver a copy of the Steele Dossier to Comey.\n\n\u201cGod only knows who they\u2019d have populated that committee with,\u201d says Nunes. \u201cAnyone they could control. It would have been a freak show.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan defended HPSCI\u2019s independence. On the Senate side, Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr had only one move. To deflect demands for an independent commission, he effectively ceded control of the Senate investigation to his vice chair, Democrat Mark Warner.\n\nNo Evidence of Collusion Years Later\n\nStill, Nunes believed that all the talk of Trump and Russia was a waste of time. \u201cThey kept promising us evidence of collusion, week after week, and they came up with nothing.\u201d\n\nNunes\u2019s disdain for the ICA forced the Crossfire Hurricane team\u2019s hand. \u201cRight around the time that they came out with the ICA, they kept saying that we were waiting on something to show us, something important that was coming in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said it was some significant figure who they couldn\u2019t quite track down yet.\u201d\n\nBut the FBI knew exactly where its missing link was, the piece of evidence that they thought would convince hardened skeptics like Nunes that collusion was real. They didn\u2019t have to chase him down, because he was sitting at home in Chicago. He submitted to a voluntary interview January 27 and without a lawyer because he had no idea what the FBI had in store for him.\n\nThe Crossfire Hurricane team was figuring how they were going to set up the Trump adviser they\u2019d used to open up the investigation in July 2016: George Papadopoulos.", "description": "Nunes realized the purpose of Obama\u2019s dossier.
