We\u2019re celebrating, we\u2019re going to enjoy it, but it\u2019s also like we\u2019re not done. So I\u2019m loving it.\u201d\n\nWashington will play Game 1 at home on Sunday. The Mystics lost two of the three regular-season meetings with Connecticut, but the teams haven\u2019t played since late June.\n\nThis Mystics team is very different than the one that got swept by Seattle last season. Delle Donne is healthy after dealing with a bone bruise in her knee last year. The Mystics also have Emma Meesseman back. She missed the 2018 season while preparing for the Women\u2019s World Cup with Belgium.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have Emma. We\u2019re a different team when she\u2019s on it,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cWe got a really good Connecticut team coming in. They are playing really great basketball. We\u2019ll focus on them and figure some things out.\u201d\n\nWhile the Mystics have been in this position before, only guard Kristi Toliver has won a title, doing so with Los Angeles in 2016. She had been sidelined with her own bone bruise before returning for the playoffs. She started in Game 4 of the series against Las Vegas - the first time she had done so in the playoffs.\n\nAfter an unremarkable first half, Toliver shed the knee brace that she was wearing to start the second half and scored 10 of her 20 points in the third quarter to help the Mystics prevail.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on track towards the goal that we wanted to achieve, and everybody worked really hard in the offseason and came into this season really focused,\u201d Toliver said after the win over Las Vegas. \u201cSo to be back where we wanted to be is special. But we want to make that next step. It just gets more exciting from here.\u201d\n\nWinning the best-of-five series would also give coach Mike Thibault his first championship. It would come against his former team, which he led from 2003-12. Thibault guided the Sun to the WNBA Finals in 2004 and 2005 before they fell short each time.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After getting swept in the WNBA Finals last year, the Washington Mystics are back and ready to win the franchise's first title.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/mystics_aces_basketball_50181_c0-168-3055-1949_s1770x1032.jpg?eba2f5663976c415add0fb2b53f1388481018847", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
