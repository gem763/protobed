So that\u2019s just where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s not going away. So we\u2019ll come back to it.\u201d\n\nSteph Curry: \u201cThis situation, there\u2019s a huge weight and gravity to it. There\u2019s going to need to be some things to be sorted out. But I just don\u2019t know enough about Chinese history and how that\u2019s influenced modern society\u2026This is not going away. So we\u2019ll come back to it.\u201d pic.twitter.com/6h6ZGWHQtq \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 9, 2019\n\nIt might be hard to believe that Curry is wholly ignorant about China\u2019s dismal human rights record or otherwise knows nothing about the communist nation. The star point guard has been to China at least five times. Curry toured China multiple times as part of a big-dollar promotional tour with sportswear giant Under Armour.\n\nBut Curry also considers himself a woke progressive and is a constant commentator against the imagined ills of human rights abuses right here in the U.S., so it is a bit precious of him to claim he has no idea of the far worse and real human rights abuses in China.\n\nCurry is not the only NBA personality to suddenly feign ignorance of China\u2019s oppression. Warriors coach Steve Kerr also feigned ignorance of China\u2019s human rights abuses.\n\nOn Monday, Kerr claimed that he could not speak cogently about China because he just doesn\u2019t know enough about this \u201creally bizarre international story.\u201d\n\nA day later, outspoken leftist NBA coach Gregg Popovich joined Kerr in avoiding any woke proclamations against China\u2019s horrendous abuse record by praising NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for his response to the controversy.\n\nStill, despite his feigning of ignorance about China\u2019s voluminous record of human rights abuses, Steph Curry is quite outspoken against the real or imagined abuses of human rights in the U.S.A.\n\nAmong his many progressive public proclamations, Curry spoke out against North Carolina\u2019s bathroom bill in 2017 saying that he was against the state\u2019s \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against transgenderism.\n\nIn 2016, Curry was heard speaking out in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement and urging America to stop the \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against blacks as well as speaking against \u201cgun violence.\u201d\n\nCurry has also been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump. The player even considered making a show of visiting with Barack Obama instead of President Trump after the team\u2019s winning season in 2018.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "NBA star Steph Curry is up to his neck in China deals and has visited the communist nation at least five times, yet this week he is", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Jeff-Chiu1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
