Armstrong Roberts/Retrofile/Getty Images\n\nWelcome to the Strategist, a site for helping you shop the internet. It is edited by people (not robots), and is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape. Most online shopping advice comes in the form of not particularly helpful roundups and slideshows. Our hope is to find the stuff out there that is actually worth buying \u2014 products that are really good and that we fully believe in.\n\nThe Strategist takes its name from a section of New York Magazine dedicated to helping you navigate shopping (and life) intelligently. For over a decade, it has offered practical, urban-minded guides on subjects ranging from cheese to light bulbs, and now Strategist editors are translating this savvy to shopping online, an activity that has never been more overwhelmingly difficult nor shockingly easy. Our team roams the streets (and Japanese airports) looking for the latest finds, but we\u2019re also not above poking around in obscure Reddit threads for the best foot exfoliator, while harnessing all the experts in our stable: We know whom to ask when we want to find out who makes the best sheets, or jeans for women, or even books on North Korea. Think of us as your shopaholic friend who cares equally about function, value, innovation, and good taste.\n\nOur guiding principles are to be trustworthy and persuasive about what is worth spending your money on. If you purchase something through our links, we often earn an affiliate commission, but we never recommend anything we don\u2019t fully stand behind. Everything we feature is something we\u2019ve chosen ourselves. We hope we will answer your most basic questions \u2014 like, say, what is the best white T-shirt \u2014 and turn you on to some weird but delightful things (like a head of Napa cabbage that\u2019s actually a pencil case) you never knew you wanted. We also love a deal \u2014 and will be dutifully monitoring online sales to find the ones that you should pay attention to. Are you looking for a new water bottle? Wireless headphones? A really great pair of climbing shoes? Send us an email. We\u2019ll be hunting.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
