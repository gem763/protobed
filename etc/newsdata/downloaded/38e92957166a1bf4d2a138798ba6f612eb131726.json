Like the first cuckoo of spring it is simply a matter of who and when and the Argentinian hooker Agust\u00edn Creevy\u2019s pre-match comments about the \u201cdull\u201d English must have amused, among others, the former Wallaby winger David Campese.\n\nNever mind that Eddie Jones\u2019s side have so far scored 11 tries in two games and are less reliant on their rolling maul as a strike weapon than the Pumas. While parts of Creevy\u2019s thesis seem to have been lost in translation, his remarks have not impressed England\u2019s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, who suggests this particular \u201ccliche\u201d and the truth are two different things.\n\nWisemantel knows from personal experience how easy it is to make casual assumptions, having joined the red rose camp expecting the squad to be \u201cpredominantly public-school based\u201d and far less diverse than is actually the case. While England do favour a structured game, he points out that a third of their tries at this World Cup have come from unstructured situations.\n\n\u201cI know we have good players and multiple threats so maybe it is a way for other people to pigeonhole us,\u201d said the Australian. \u201cI think it is a cliche. Look at the chances we probably let slip in the Tonga game. If we had taken those everyone would say: \u2018Wow, that is exciting.\u2019 Against the US I thought there were some brilliant bits of open-field rugby but it\u2019s always a balance. Look at every team in this competition that is going OK and their set piece is solid.\u201d\n\nCreevy does have some first-hand experience of English preferences having spent two seasons at Worcester, where Wisemantel \u2013 \u201cHe might just have been at a boring club\u201d \u2013 may now have to buy all his own drinks for the foreseeable future. Wisemantel, though, reckons Creevy\u2019s unflattering opinion is based on evidence which is now past its use-by date. \u201cHe obviously hasn\u2019t been watching much of the Premiership. There are some excellent teams with so many different styles.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:06 England hit back at 'boring' jibe ahead of World Cup game with Argentina \u2013 video\n\nEngland\u2019s first-choice hooker, Jamie George, also feels there is more to this current side than some of their critics give them credit for. \u201cI don\u2019t think we do play boring rugby,\u201d said George. \u201cI\u2019m not overly surprised he\u2019s tried to say that but he\u2019s entitled to his opinion and hopefully we will prove him wrong on Saturday. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just trying to rattle us a bit. He\u2019s more than welcome to try.\u201d\n\nIt all helps to stoke the fire in the buildup to Saturday\u2019s game, to which England are eagerly looking forward. Beat Argentina and they will be guaranteed a place in the last eight, which Wisemantel says would be fair reward for their months of training-ground graft this year. \u201cThese guys, to a man, are the hardest-working group I have ever worked with,\u201d said Wisemantel, who has coached all over the world. \u201cJeez, they come in and work hard.\u201d\n\nEngland are boring and this will be like a war, says Argentina hooker Creevy Read more\n\nAmong those keen to help his side do their talking on the field is Maro Itoje, who has so far come up against every major nation in the world bar Argentina. \u201cThey are very passionate, a very proud nation, they have a strong forward pack, a strong lineout, a strong scrum, and very dynamic backs. It is the type of game I love playing.\u201d\n\nThis will also be the first time England have played outdoors at this tournament, having previously operated under a closed roof in both Sapporo and Kobe. While the ball is still likely to be slippery, George has taken good-humoured issue with his scrum-half Willi Heinz for claiming England\u2019s big sweaty forwards are making the situation worse. \u201cJust look at how shiny his head gets,\u201d countered George.\u201dHe sweats as well, it\u2019s not just us.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s Scott Wisemantel and Jamie George have played down Agust\u00edn Creevy\u2019s pre-match comments", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55398479dcb2134f7d016a70eb229608fae50be8/132_127_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d4d79749854b5751ad18b3490788857"}
