One woman saw Mr Barker's blood running under a door as she cowered behind it\n\nThe gym is run by Kieran Keddle, who trained Luther star Elba ahead of a professional bout in Thailand a month before the killing.\n\nRiddington, who claimed to be a friend of ex England star Jamie Redknapp, fled the country on a false passport and went on the run in South Africa, jetting into Cyprus twice to see his wife and two children.\n\nBut he was caught there and extradited to Britain in 2018.\n\nThe court heard Riddington was involved in the importation and supply of cocaine in southeast London and was in dispute with Mr Barker over the \u00a320,000 debt.\n\nHe turned up at the gym 14 November 2016 with three other men who told gym users to stay where they were as the ambush took place.\n\nRiddington had been asking at the gym what time the victim turned up and one witness told how he lay in wait for him behind a door.\n\nJonathan Rees, prosecuting, said Riddington 'took the knife out to teach him a lesson' and 'butchered that young boy'.\n\nRiddington claimed he acted in self-defence but was convicted by murder by an Old Bailey jury but cleared of possessing an offensive weapon following a two-week trial.\n\nHe has many previous convictions for offences of dishonesty and had served 30 months in a young offenders centre for conspiracy to steal.\n\nWhen police searched his home they found a CS canister and stun gun and Riddington admitted possessing them.\n\nHis wife sobbed in the public gallery as he was jailed for life with a minimum of 19 years and said: 'He didn't even have the knife' as she watched Riddington be led away to the cells.\n\nJudge Nigel Lickley QC told him: 'The wounds suffered by George Barker were horrific and you aimed the knife at his face and body, cutting and slashing him, causing deep and severe wounds\n\n'George Barker knew he had been injured because he asked for an ambulance. He was able to walk to the end of the gym where he collapsed.\n\n'You then began planing your getaway, disposing of clothes and the knife.'\n\nThe court heard Riddington was involved in the importation and supply of cocaine in southeast London and was in dispute with Mr Barker (pictured) over the \u00a320,000 debt\n\nCharles Riddington pictured at Manchester Airport. Riddington, who claimed to be a friend of ex England star Jamie Redknapp, fled the country on a false passport and went on the run in South Africa, jetting into Cyprus twice to see his wife and two children\n\nThe judge added: 'The distress and damage you have caused will continue to affect people for many years to come, if not for throughout their entire lives.'\n\nHe said Riddington had planned the murder and was clearly associated with the three other men at the gym.\n\n'He was killed in a vicious attack and suffered dreadful injuries. You chose to use that weapon with devastating effect.\n\n'I reject any suggestion you were acting in self defence or lost control when you used that knife.'\n\nWitness Carole Cocks told the court how she had gone to the loo at the back of the gym before her scheduled training session, told police how she barricaded herself inside after hearing raised voices and banging on the door.\n\nShe described seeing 'splashes of blood coming under the toilet door' after Riddington drove Mr Barker right across the gym from the entrance, leaving a trail behind them as the attack continued.\n\nRiddington 'kept swinging at him' as Mr Barker was 'screaming at him to stop' before he pulled out the lock-knife and 'plunged it into Mr Barker's head and body'.\n\n'It appeared to Mr Whelan that George Barker didn't want to fight and had his arms out, but the defendant kept rushing at him, pushing him back over to where the toilet was,' Mr Rees said.\n\nWhen Mr Barker put his hand up to defend himself the knife went straight through his arm.\n\nEarly the following morning Riddington boarded a flight from Manchester to Dusseldorf using a false passport in the name of Barry Ryan.\n\nIt was not until November last year that he was arrested after being extradited from Northern Cyprus.\n\nRiddington told jurors he spent the day before the stabbing at Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp's house.\n\nThe pair, whose children both played for Chelsea's youth team, had been celebrating Redknapp's son's eight birthday.\n\nHe said three men had approached him outside the gym a week before saying that Barker had told them he was unable to pay a \u00a320,000 'coke and skunk' debt because Riddington owed Barker money.\n\nRiddington said the three men returned on the day of the death, intent on getting him to hand over the money and he was attacked by Mr Barker.\n\nRiddington (pictured) told jurors he spent the day before the stabbing at Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp's house\n\nHe sobbed in the witness box as he recalled how the brawl seemed to go on 'forever', telling jurors he 'just wanted to get this knife off him'.\n\nHe told jurors: 'I was fighting for my life. I was so scared.'\n\nIn an impact statement the victim's mother Julie Underwood said: 'The gruesome torture details we heard in court will be embedded in our minds forever..'\n\nMr Barker, who had two sisters, was 'cheeky, funny and always smiling,' she said.\n\nWhen his baby daughter is taken to his grave she points at her father's picture and says repeatedly: 'My daddy.'\n\nMrs Underwood said her son's cap is still in the kitchen where he always left it, his trainers are in the hall and his clothes are still in his wardrobe in a home where his family still light a candle for him every night.\n\n'The last time we saw George was on the mortuary slab. This was the worst moment of our lives,' Mrs Underwood added.\n\nMr Barker's father Tony Barker was being treated in hospital for a life threatening condition when his son died.\n\nHe last saw his son in his hospital bed and said they shook hands and put their previous difficulties behind them.\n\n'We were set for a new future, a harmonious one, if I survived and came out of hospital,' he said in his impact statement.\n\n'This I managed to do. What a terrible tragedy that he didn't.'\n\nRiddington, from Orpington, Kent, denied but was convicted of murder. He was cleared of possessing an offensive weapon.\n\nHe smiled ruefully at his friends and family in the public gallery as he was led away.", "description": "Kickboxer Charles Riddington was jailed for life on Thursday for the brutal murder of George Barker, 24, at Double K Gym in Bexley, southeast London. in November 2016.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19847930-0-image-a-12_1571330506173.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
