With the clock running down, the Argentina full-back had a chance to reclaim the lead after what had been a one-sided contest turned into what should be one of the closest encounters this tournament.\n\nTo France\u2019s enormous relief the kick faded left and after squandering a 17-point half-time lead they had snuck home 23-21 thanks to a drop goal.\n\nFrance 23-21 Argentina: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nFrance have struggled to deal with the rigours of professionalism more than any other leading country. They have had to become more disciplined since in the amateur days, as in having a greater resistance to foul play, and temper their indulgence. It has made them volcanic rather than mercurial with the eruptions occurring all too frequently this decade, certainly in the Six Nations. They give themselves more licence in the World Cup and here they were at their most swashbuckling, for the opening half at least, working space through off-loads and stepping that thwarted Argentina\u2019s narrow defence.\n\nFrance scored two tries and should have had to more as they assembled a 20-3 lead at the interval. The first, scored by Ga\u00ebl Fickou, was prompted by Maxime M\u00e9dard\u2019s short, subtle pass, the flair of Daniel Penaud and the footwork of Virimi Vakatawa. Argentina had barely recovered when the quartet were at it again for Antoine Dupont to score in the corner and Penaud should have made it three but took his eyes off Vakatawa\u2019s pass.\n\nArgentina took an early lead with a Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez penalty but other than the scrum, where they harvested penalties throughout, they were clearly inferior. As France showed at the start of this year\u2019s Six Nations, though, when they blew a 16-0 interval lead against Wales on the opening night, hot can very quickly turn cold.\n\nArgentina were in the lead with 13 minutes left after going back to basics. They were winning the penalty count and one minute after the restart they kicked to touch, drove a maul and the second-row Guido Petti Pagadiz\u00e1bal, who had sparked his side\u2019s most menacing break in the opening period, was driven over.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emiliano Boffelli misses the late penalty that could have put Argentina back ahead in the closing moments.

The ball took to the air and after another penalty and driving maul, Juli\u00e1n Montoya brought the Pumas to within five points of their opponents. On came French replacements, but Les Bleus kept conceding penalties and the replacement Benjam\u00edn Urdapilleta kicked two to give his side the lead.\n\nWhen France announced their team on Thursday, the general reaction of their media was that the selection showed the focus was on the 2023 World Cup, for which they are hosts, given the experience that had been confined to the bench. The reaction after going behind suggested otherwise and having just come on for Penaud, who needed a head injury assessment after Boffelli fell on his head, Camille Lopez dropped into the pocket after a series of drives dropped a goal from 40 metres to put his side back in front.\n\nNew Zealand v South Africa: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live!

After Romain Ntamack had missed a penalty from wide on the left, France were trying to run down the clock when Fickou took out Boffelli in the air, a needless challenge given that he was never in a position to contest for the ball and play was just inside his half.\n\nBoffelli took the kick himself. He had the distance but not the direction and, although Argentina had one more play, France forced a turnover without for once conceding a penalty. The prize is probably finishing second behind England, but with France you still never quite know.
