Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks during a town hall meeting in Queens, N.Y., April 27, 2019. (Jeenah Moon/Reuters)\n\nThe Left should help the Right boost absolute wealth across the economy.\n\nNew York \u2014 President Donald J. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics claim that the gap between the haves and have-nots is expanding on his watch.\n\n\u201cIs it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality?\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., New York) asked via Twitter earlier this year. According to AOC\u2019s House website, she contends that income inequality is \u201cbeing used by those in power to amplify fear and anger in our communities and further divide us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren concurs.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a government, when you\u2019ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn\u2019t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat says. She argues that \u201cInequality is rapidly growing, transforming rule by-the-people into rule by-wealthy-elites\u201d and \u201cmany American politicians seem to accept \u2014 even embrace \u2014 the politics of division and resentment.\u201d\n\nAOC and Warren are right, to a point: Income inequality, indeed, has grown on President Trump\u2019s watch. And the numbers back them up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key metric here is called the Gini coefficient. A 0.00 score represents perfect income equality; neither rich nor poor exist, since everyone has identical incomes. A 1.00 Gini coefficient represents perfect income inequality: The rich earn all the money, and nobody else makes a penny.\n\nUnder President Trump, America\u2019s Gini coefficient ticked up, according to the latest data, from 0.48 in 2017 to 0.49 in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Gini did not stay in its bottle under Obama. During his presidency, Gini also edged higher \u2014 from 0.47 to 0.48, in 2011. It then stalled, past Obama\u2019s departure. So, despite his blather about income gaps, the \u201cevil\u201d 1 percent, and his \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that!\u201d gut punch to America\u2019s entrepreneurial class, Obama did absolutely nothing to reduce income inequality.\n\nFor those who lose sleep over this matter, the gold medal for income inequality goes to Washington, D.C., the pounding heart of Big Government statism. Its 2018 Gini score was 0.53. Leftist New York (0.52) \u2014 \u201cthe state with the greatest gap between rich and poor,\u201d as Statista\u2019s Erin Duffin described it \u2014 wins the silver. And the bronze belongs to liberal stronghold Massachusetts (0.49).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you seek income equality, in contrast, go West! Nebraska \u2014 Forbes\u2019 fifth-best state for business \u2014 scores the Gini bronze (0.44). Right-leaning Wyoming takes the silver (0.43). And small-government, conservative, individualistic Alaska and Utah share the income-equality gold medal (0.42).\n\nSo, for the 500th time, Leftists like New York\u2019s AOC and Massachusetts\u2019 Warren should clean their own sandboxes before they bark orders at everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how you slice it, the Left\u2019s quixotic quest for income equality puts zero bread on anyone\u2019s table. What actually feeds people is larger paychecks. And, here again, Trumponomics trumps Obamanomics.\n\nTypical gains have climbed to a new record. As veteran free-marketeer Stephen Moore explained at FoxNews.com:\n\nThe latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey data now show that middle-class incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have surged by $5,003 since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. Median household income has now reached $65,976 \u2013 an all-time high and up more than 8 percent in 2019 dollars under the Trump presidency.\n\nThe 8.2 percent hike in middle-class wages during Trump\u2019s roughly two-and-a-half years in the White House leaves his predecessors gasping in the dust. As Moore wrote in the September 29 Wall Street Journal, during \u201c7\u00bd years under President Obama \u2014 starting from the end of the recession in June 2009 through January 2017 \u2014 the median household income rose by only about $1,000.\u201d That precise figure is $1,043, or a mere 1.7 percent.\n\nThis metric\u2019s performance was downright self-humiliating under uber-RINO G. W. Bush. Across all eight years of his \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d median households saw their winnings creep up a paltry $401, or 0.7 percent.\n\n\u201cThis means that in the 16 years before the Trump presidency, incomes rose by about $1,500 while in less than three years, middle incomes have risen three times faster,\u201d Moore writes. Indeed, in a bit more than half of his term, Trump\u2019s $5,003 mountain in median household income is 346 percent ahead of Bush-Obama\u2019s $1,444 molehill in middle-class earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cThese Gini figures overlook all the massive redistribution of the modern welfare state,\u201d notes economist Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute. He cites a recent study by government economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. It shows that \u2014 after taxes and government transfers \u2014 the top 1 percent share of U.S. income has been roughly flat since the 1960s. \u201cFlat!\u201d Edwards adds. \u201cThe inequality crisis that AOC and Warren scream about is a myth.\u201d\n\nBeyond Edwards\u2019 objections, and more profoundly, income inequality focuses on the wrong thing. It\u2019s like a patient who is rushed into the hospital with a heart attack and then stunned when the emergency room doctors X-ray his leg. The focus, instead, should be on what really counts: absolute, rather than relative, incomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine that you are weighing two job proposals:\n\nAcme, Inc. offers you $50,000, but your boss makes $55,000. Income inequality equals 10 percent. AOC and Warren likely could stomach this.\n\nZenith Corporation, for its part, would pay you $500,000, but your boss makes $1 million. Income inequality equals 100 percent. AOC and Warren just raced out of the room with their hands over their mouths.\n\nAnyone with two brain cells to rub together would go work for Zenith, despite the ten-fold-higher level of income inequality. This simple illustration demonstrates that income inequality is, at best, yet another bogus, Left-wing distraction. At worst, this fetish weaponizes envy into ruinous public policy.\n\nThe late, great British prime minister Margaret Thatcher explained this best. She answered a question in the House of Commons from Liberal Democrat member Simon Hughes on November 22, 1990. He quizzed her on the gap between the wealthy and the needy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThatcher ground his premise into burger:\n\n\u201cWhat the honorable member is saying is that he would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.\u201d The Iron Lady added: \u201cSo long as the gap is smaller, they would rather have the poor poorer. You do not create wealth and opportunity that way. You do not create a property-owning democracy that way.\u201d\n\nMrs. Thatcher used a simple hand gesture to indicate that the Left craves a narrower divide between rich and poor, even if both are worse off, rather than a wider gap, with both rich and poor better off \u2014 although more so for the former. Liberals love misery, if they can share it with company.\n\nThe Left should grow up, throw out their income-inequality pacifiers, and work with the Right to boost the absolute wealth of the poor, the middle class, and the rich \u2014 to heights yet unseen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBucknell University\u2019s Michael Malarkey contributed research to this opinion piece.", "description": "The Left should grow up, throw out their income-inequality pacifiers, and work with the \u00a0Right to boost the absolute wealth of the poor, the middle class, and the rich.", "authors": ["Deroy Murdock", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
