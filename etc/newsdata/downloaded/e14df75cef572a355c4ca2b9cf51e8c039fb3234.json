It showed Mr Trump suggesting Mr Zelensky investigate the Bidens for corruption while also looking into the origins of the US investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMr Trump has long alleged Ukraine was responsible for election interference rather than Russia, despite his own intelligence community detailing a sweeping and systemic influence operation on the part of the Kremlin to help elect Mr Trump.\n\nIn recent days, the president and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, have begun bringing up China on top of Ukraine, suggesting Mr Biden benefited from his son\u2019s business dealings. There is no evidence to show the former vice president engaged in any misconduct surrounding China and his son\u2019s dealings in the country.\n\nMr Biden is currently the national Democratic frontrunner in the 2020 primaries, according to most national polls, followed closely by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in several key states. He has recently announced his support for impeaching Mr Trump, whose former special envoy to Ukraine was testifying before Congress as the president spoke to reporters.\n\nHis campaign was quick to hit back at the president.\n\n\u201cAs Joe Biden forcefully said last night, the defining characteristic of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is the ongoing abuse of power. What Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election\u2019s equivalent of his infamous \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening\u2019 moment from 2016 \u2014 a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country,\u201d said Mr Biden\u2019s spokesperson, Kate Bedingfield.", "description": "Donald Trump has openly called on China and Ukraine to launch investigations into Joe Biden, one of his 2020 political rivals, just days after Congress launched an impeachment inquiry alleging he abused his power to aid his reelection campaign.As a former senior diplomat told member of Congress he had", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe", "Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aKRz4tBJseDQqZ7wJXK8bA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9386700ee41b55b418b9b1c1a07b46e8", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
