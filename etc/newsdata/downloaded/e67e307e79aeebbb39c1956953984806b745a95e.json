But, then again, it was even harder when Waititi was pitching \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d to film executives. \u201cYou don\u2019t walk into a studio and say: \u2018Nazi comedy!\u2019\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is as singular as its director, the New Zealand filmmaker of absurdist comedies (\u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows,\u201d \u201dThe Hunt for the Wilderpeople\u201d) who\u2019s coming off helming the 2017 Marvel smash \u201cThor: Ragnarok.\u201d It\u2019s a coming-of-age story about a 10-year-old boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) who lives with his mom (Scarlett Johansson) and has an imaginary friend he talks to for company and guidance.\n\nOh, and also \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is set in Nazi Germany and that imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler.\n\nBut that summary doesn\u2019t really do the job either. Hitler, as played with bug-eyed flair by Waititi, is really the young, uncertain boy\u2019s confused, half-formed idea of Hitler, the man he\u2019s been indoctrinated to idolize. The movie starts off a madcap comedy and gradually morphs into something sweetly sentimental, as Jojo begins questioning what he\u2019s been told about Jews after discovering one (Thomasin McKenzie) living in his attic.\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is about growing up in a world where the received wisdom is ridiculous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that we keep retelling these stories and doing them in inventive and interesting ways,\u201d said Waititi, alluding to more straightforwardly serious films about WWII Germany. \u201cIf that involves adding humor and absurdity, then so be it. It\u2019s still communicating the same ideas.\u201d\n\nWhether Waititi managed to pull it off was of considerable debate once his film did hit audiences Sunday night in Toronto. \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d was hailed as a masterpiece, Waititi\u2019s eccentric opus and a worthy heir to Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Dictator\u201d by some, while others deemed it a badly misjudged misfire that awkwardly melds humor with atrocity no better than Roberto Benigni\u2019s schmaltzy \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d did two decades before it.\n\nEntertainment Weekly called it \u201can audacious piece of Third Reich whimsy that almost definitely shouldn\u2019t work as well as it does.\u201d Variety called it \u201c\u2018Life Is Beautiful\u2019 made with attitude.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d which Fox Searchlight will release Oct. 18, had come into Toronto one of the festival\u2019s biggest question marks. It might leave that way, too.\n\nLast month, Variety reported that some Disney executives were concerned about \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d being too edgy for the company, which earlier this year took control of Fox Searchlight as part of its larger acquisition of 20th Century Fox. One executive reportedly worried that the film would \u201calienate Disney fans.\u201d\n\nBut Waititi said he doesn\u2019t believe that report. He has his own history with Disney. Waititi\u2019s \u201cThor\u201d movie was a Disney release and made $848 million worldwide. He\u2019s set to direct its 2021 sequel.\n\n\u201cAbout a month before that article, Iger and Horn had seen the film and they have been very complimentary. They gushed over it,\u201d said Waititi, referring to Disney chief executive Bob Iger and chief creative officer Alan Horn. \u201cThey\u2019ve continued to send me supportive notes about the film.\u201d\n\nWaititi also challenged the idea that an independent film like \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d could ever be worthy of such consternation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018Watch out for that \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d movie. It\u2019s going to bring down the corporation,\u2019\u201d said Waititi. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to worry about this movie because once you see it, it speaks for itself. It\u2019s uplifting and it\u2019s a very positive message.\u201d\n\nRegardless, \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d makes for one of the more audacious gambits by a filmmaker coming off a box-office success, with industry capital to burn. Waititi, who\u2019s Jewish and Maori, from the Te Whanau-a-Apanui tribe, originally wrote the film years ago (before his previous three features) after his mother\u2019s description of a novel (Christine Leunens\u2019 \u201cCaging Skies\u201d) piqued his interest.\n\n\u201cOver a couple years I just slowly chipped away at the script. I was never really impatient to make it. I always knew that it was going to be a good film and a really important story, and that if I had to wait, that would be fine,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Waititi was on post-production on \u201cThor,\u201d Searchlight approached him about making \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d And partially because there were likely to be few takers for the role, they suggested Waititi play Hitler, too.\n\n\u201cThey convinced me to play Adolf. That was never really my idea,\u201d said Waititi. \u201cLook at me. I\u2019m Polynesian. I\u2019m the least obvious choice. But maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good choice.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP .\n\n___\n\nFor complete coverage of the fall film season, visit: www.apnews.com/FallFilms\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's just a few hours before \"Jojo Rabbit\" will make its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, and writer-director Taika Waititi is still figuring out how to talk about it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/2019_tiff_-__jojo_rabbit__portrait_session_10195_c0-21-3761-2213_s1770x1032.jpg?060f286e357ee726351a612b4a395a95bc73fe9e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
