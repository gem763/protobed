But since then there have been elections, not perfect, but you know we have little experience ourselves with not perfect elections,\" she said.\n\nClinton was obviously referring to her loss against President Donald Trump in 2016. Since her loss, she has primarily blamed Russian interference as the reason, but she has also blamed voter suppression in states like Wisconsin as one of the reasons for her defeat.\n\nThe Washington Post gave Clinton's claims of voter suppression in Wisconsin four Pinocchios for being \"wrong on multiple levels\" and for being \"seriously misleading.\"\n\nOther factors Clinton has blamed include FBI Director James Comey, former President Barack Obama, the media, Sen. Bernie Sanders, misogyny, resentment from white people, and sexism.", "description": ".09/27/2019 20:57:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/270/564de2d2-d4ba-43f8-9b7d-3c857869766d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
