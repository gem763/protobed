USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 If Ronan Farrow is exhausted, he certainly doesn't show it.\n\nThe crusading journalist, whose investigation into Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse for The New Yorker earned him a Pulitzer Prize last year, is razor-sharp and smiling as he walks into USA TODAY's New York offices on a late weekday afternoon, primed to talk about his new book \"Catch and Kill,\" out Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not getting a lot of sleep right now,\" admits Farrow, 31, who hastily chugs a full mug of hot coffee upon arrival. \"But I'm proud of the reporting and I'm glad it's becoming public.\"\n\nPart-memoir, part-thriller, \"Catch and Kill\" details Farrow's months-long struggle to report the Weinstein story for NBC, where he started as host of MSNBC's \"Ronan Farrow Daily\" in 2014, before becoming an investigative correspondent for \"Today.\"\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow, 31, poses for a portrait in New York.

But according to him, they continually poked holes in his reporting and delayed running the piece, telling him it wasn't \"newsworthy\" and to \"give it a rest\" before killing the story altogether. (NBC News president Noah Oppenheim refuted Farrow's claims in a memo released Monday, writing that he had \"no victims or witnesses on the record,\" including McGowan, who at the time, declined to identify Weinstein by name.)\n\nMore: NBC News chief Noah Oppenheim tells staff Ronan Farrow has 'an axe to grind'\n\nDespite NBC's claims to the contrary, Farrow insists that he and his producer, Rich McHugh,\"were ordered to stop (reporting the story). We were given a hard order not to take a single call about the subject, and we were ordered to cancel interviews with rape victims. This was un-journalistic, it was a big question mark in the press why, and 'Catch and Kill' answers why, which was a company concealing a lot of secrets that had a lot of secret contacts with Harvey Weinstein.\"\n\nAccording to \"Catch,\" Weinstein allegedly knew of multiple sexual misconduct accusations against former \"Today\" anchor Matt Lauer, obtained by Weinstein's friend Dylan Howard, chief content officer of National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. (AMI). The book goes on to allege that Weinstein threatened to expose Lauer if NBC ran Farrow's investigation of him, which Oppenheim rejected Monday as a \"third-hand rumor\" with \"no corroboration.\"\n\nFarrow's meticulous reporting on Harvey Weinstein's long alleged history of sexual assault helped take down the ex-studio head in 2017.

(Oppenheim disputed those figures, saying there were only three departure agreements made before Lauer's exit that \"were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine,\" involving employees who made \"no complaint to management.\")\n\nOne of those alleged victims is Brooke Nevils, a former assistant to \"Today\" host Meredith Vieira. In \"Catch's\" most disturbing chapter, Nevils describes in graphic detail the night that Lauer allegedly raped her in his hotel room at the 2014 Sochi Olympics in Russia. \"(It) hurt to walk, hurt to sit,\" Nevils tells Farrow of the days following the alleged attack.\n\nLauer denied Nevils' account of the encounter in an open letter last week, calling her \"an enthusiastic and willing partner,\" and writing that \"at no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent.\"\n\nNevils tells Farrow that she continued a \"transactional\" sexual relationship with Lauer after returning to the U.S., primarily out of fear that she would jeopardize her career \u2013 as well as that of her boyfriend's brother, who worked for Lauer \u2013 if she didn't adhere to his wishes.\n\nSexual misconduct allegations against former \"Today\" anchor Matt Lauer are explored in Farrow's \"Catch and Kill.\" (Photo: Nathan Congleton/NBC via AP)\n\nNevil admits to initiating some encounters with Lauer (then-married to model Annette Roque), but accuses him of other non-consensual acts in the workplace: In one incident, he allegedly groped her as she reached for an electronic photo frame on his office window ledge. On another day, he reportedly forced her to perform oral sex on him at his desk in exchange for recording a \"goodbye\" video for a departing employee.\n\n\"Very often, you see a situation where a boss or someone else in a position of power has continued access to someone with an accusation,\" Farrow says. \"And after the initial assault, you see repeat contact \u2013 even sometimes consensual contact or quasi-consensual \u2013 where they say 'yes' to something in a situation where this person has tremendous power over them and they're frightened. There are all sorts of complications like that that are very common in these stories.\"\n\nIt wasn't until years later, after being hospitalized for post-traumatic stress and alcohol abuse, that Nevils eventually confided in Vieira about Lauer's alleged rape. With Vieira's encouragement, Nevils formally reported the incident to NBC in 2017, leading to his dismissal that November.\n\n\"This was a company where accusers with sexual harassment complaints were being paid out to sweep the problem under the rug,\" Farrow says of NBC's alleged cover-up. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY)\n\nFarrow refuses to speculate whether Lauer could face legal repercussions for allegedly assaulting Nevils, but maintains that Nevils has \"abided by a lot of scary legal restrictions that she is still under,\" including that she \"cannot disparage the executives of NBC,\" as a term of her contract.\n\n\"Brooke Nevils' story is important: not just because it's serious in its own right,\" Farrow says. \"It reveals, within this company, a reliance on secret settlements of the type that prevents her to this day from talking about NBC executives and what they knew.\"\n\nMore: Could Matt Lauer be prosecuted for an alleged rape in Russia in 2014? It's not likely\n\nIn the months following Lauer's exit, claims of sexual misconduct have been lodged against a slew of NBC executives and on-air talent, including Matt Zimmerman, Mark Halperin, Chris Matthews and Tom Brokaw. All have been formally reprimanded or fired, but Farrow warns of a more \"dangerous situation\" at NBC, where employees \"have talked about feeling it was fruitless to go to the H.R. department,\" convinced their allegations would be ignored or dismissed.\n\nAn unnamed NBC correspondent quoted in \"Catch\" takes it a step further: comparing NBC to the Vatican, home of the Catholic Church's top leaders, in that both \"were willing to cover up sex crimes.\"\n\n\"The Matt Lauer story is bigger than one person,\" Farrow says. Right now, \"there's a lot of white-hot focus on the allegations against (him) revealed in this book, and there are people with an active interest in ensuring that the focus stays there. Just as significant is the reporting that suggests this was much wider and bigger than Matt Lauer: This was a company that was concealing a lot of secrets, and there were allegations against multiple people in senior positions that were covered up. That affected this news organization's coverage profoundly.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/14/ronan-farrow-new-book-catch-and-kill-alleged-cover-up-harvey-weinstein-matt-lauer/3948761002/", "description": "Ronan Farrow talks to USA TODAY about new book \"Catch and Kill,\" which alleges that NBC knew of Matt Lauer's sexual misconduct allegations for years.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published P.M.
