While both PG&E and California state officials alike acknowledged that the shutoffs that began on Wednesday could have been better orchestrated (and with more communication), neither questioned their need.\n\nClimate change has made for more extreme conditions. In November 2018, a PG&E power line sparked the deadliest blaze in California history. And the year before that, a series of wildfires devastated the state\u2019s wine country. That, state and company officials said, necessitates more extreme measures.\n\nMother Nature\u2019s Call\n\nBy Friday, PG&E had restored power to 97% of those affected by the blackouts. On Sunday, 100% of customers had their lights back on. In all, roughly 738,000 homes and businesses went down in more than half of the state\u2019s 58 counties. When they\u2019ll go dark again is essentially Mother Nature\u2019s call, Johnson said: \u201cIt really is weather-dependent - where the wind is, where the conditions are.\u201d\n\nEven as the lights flickered back on, California firefighters were battling several infernos in Southern California. One that began in the hills north of the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area - now called the Saddleridge fire - had burned about 8,000 acres as of Sunday and was less than 50% contained, destroying or damaging 32 structures. Another at the edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains had scorched more than 5,500 acres.\n\n\u201cWe are actively investigating the cause of the Saddleridge fire,\u201d Nicholas Prange, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department, said by phone Sunday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t determined anything yet. We take in any eyewitness reports and any evidence during the course of the investigation.\u201d\n\nEdison Tower Sparks?\n\nSparks were seen at a transmission tower owned by Edison International\u2019s Southern California Edison utility, local media reports cited eyewitnesses as saying. Prange said in response to queries on the eyewitness accounts that it would take at least a week for anything substantial to be determined.\n\n\u201cDetermining the cause and origin of the fire is a lengthy process,\u201d Southern California Edison also said in a statement Sunday, confirming that it owns the tower identified in the reports as being near the start of the fire. \u201cSCE will fully cooperate with investigations.\u201d\n\nThe impact on Edison is expected to be minimal, according to a report by Citigroup Inc. analysts including Praful Mehta. The utility has $750 million of wildfire specific insurance for the year ending June 2020, and its valid safety certification allows for cost recovery through the wildfire fund, they said.\n\nInvestor concerns over the Saddleridge fire drove the stock 5.6% lower in the past week, the biggest weekly decline in about six months.\n\nUndervalued Stock\n\n\u201cEven with a relatively conservative approach on valuing wildfire risk, we believe EIX is undervalued,\u201d the Citigroup analysts said, reiterating their buy rating on the stock. \u201cRecent underperformance and worries related to the Saddleridge Fire are overblown.\u201d\n\nFor PG&E, in the course of inspecting lines following high winds, the utility found 50 instances of weather-related damage to its system. \u201cThere\u2019s some vindication - that\u2019s not the right word,\u201d Johnson said late Friday, but the fact that the utility discovered so many safety issues that could have ignited a wildfire made the blackout well worth it, he said.\n\nOne thing PG&E is promising going forward is better communication. For days, both ahead of the blackout and during it, the company\u2019s website was down, overwhelmed by people trying to find out whether they would be cut off and for how long. Call centres were similarly flooded. Text messages to homes and businesses affected were few and far between.\n\nThe operational act of turning off and on power actually \u201cwent really well,\u201d Johnson said. But he committed to better notifications, more phone alerts, shorter call wait times and a website \u201cthat works no matter how much traffic is on it.\u201d\n\nCalifornia officials will have their own say on what more should be done. Governor Gavin Newsom has blasted PG&E over the shutoffs, saying the company should have been more surgical - and never would\u2019ve been in this situation if it had invested in its infrastructure more heavily. He also called on state utility regulators to review PG&E\u2019s actions.\n\nA spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said the agency, as a policy, reviewed all intentional outages by California utilities. PG&E said it will file a report with the agency detailing the damages it discovered.", "description": "An unprecedented blackout that plunged millions of Californians into the darkness for days is over.", "authors": ["Lynn Doan", "Mark Chediak", "Hailey Waller"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7542/5a84963d0fda401c980894e274101e26.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
