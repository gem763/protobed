A combined million and drone attack, he said, took 5.7 barrels of oil out of production, sending global oil prices soaring. Yemen\u2019s Shiite Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, but both Saudi and American officials concluded that the drones could not have come from Yemen and Iran clearly executed the attack.\n\nThe Houthi rebels, who have waged a civil war against Yemen\u2019s legitimate government since 2015, are closely allied to the Iranian regime.\n\n\u201cI had hoped to talk today about the efforts of my country \u2026 to fulfill the purposes of the United Nations Charter,\u201dAl-Assaf said, opening his speech. \u201cI wanted to talk about the country\u2019s ongoing economic development and reforms in various fields \u2013 the vision that takes us back to our true Islamic faith that rejects all forms of extremism.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, the aggressive act of September 14 on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities violated the principles of this organization as enshrined in its Charter and threatened the security, stability, and prosperity of our region and the world. This aggression requires, from all of us, a historic position,\u201d he continued.\n\nAl-Assaf plainly blamed Iran for the attack and called it \u201ca flagrant violation of international laws and regulations\u201d and \u201cviolations of international peace and security and \u2026 a significant threat to global oil supplies.\u201d\n\nHe went on to excoriate Iran for being \u201ca vile and cowardly regime which hides behind its affiliated militias, pushing them to claim responsibility \u2026 that same regime views our states and peoples only as a battlefield to achieve its subversive agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known this regime for 40 years. It is good at nothing but masterminding explosions, destruction, and assassinations \u2013 not only in our region, but also throughout the world,\u201d Al-Assaf continued, identifying Middle Eastern nations like Bahrain, Kuwait, and Lebanon \u2013 but also European states like France and Denmark \u2013 as having been the target of Iranian terrorist attacks. Iran has also orchestrated terrorist attacks in Argentina and maintains a close relationship with Hezbollah-affiliated members of the socialist regime in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a rogue and terrorist regime,\u201d Al-Assaf asserted.\n\nThe foreign minister decried prior attempts to negotiate with Iran as \u201chalf-measures\u201d and \u201cappeasement,\u201d not naming President Barack Obama directly as the architect of pro-Iran policies but blaming \u201cpartial and interim agreements\u201d like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iranian nuclear deal, for emboldening the regime.\n\n\u201cAppeasement with the Iranian regime \u2026 has increased its terrorist and aggressive activities over the last four years,\u201d Al-Assaf said.\n\n\u201cThe recent attacks are a real test of the international community\u2019s will. This organization, as well as the entire world, is faced with a moral and historic responsibility to take a firm and unified position,\u201d he added. \u201cUtmost pressure should be applied using every tool available to end the terrorist and aggressive behavior of the Iranian regime.\u201d\n\nIran has two choices, he said in concluding his speech: \u201ceither become a normal state that respects international laws and norms or face an international unified position that chooses all instruments of pressure and deterrence.\u201d\n\nThe foreign minister ended his speech with a threat to those who wish to harm his country: Saudi Arabia \u201cwill stop at nothing to defend its holy sites and its sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq facility this month triggered global economic panic, given how much of the world depends on Saudi oil. Thanks to the oil boom in the United States, American oil prices were largely unaffected. The Trump administration nonetheless issued a stern condemnation of the attack. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to it as \u201can act of war\u201d by Iran.\n\nThe Iranians have rejected any responsibility for the attack but nonetheless praised it as successful.\n\n\u201cDespite lack of equipment, Yemen has smart people. They adopted a clever retaliatory measure in recent days and used their right to self-defense,\u201d Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an Iranian lawmaker, said of the attacks. \u201cYemen\u2019s measure was a reaction to various illegal actions and war crimes of Saudi Arabia and had nothing to do with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani admired that the missiles \u201cdid not hit a school, a hospital or a market, but attacked an industrial center to warn their enemies.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's foreign minister urged the world to unite against the \"vile and cowardly\" Iranian regime in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Abdulaziz-Al-Assaf-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
