As a staff full of gamers and game-lovers, we'll be serving up extra reviews, guides, interviews, and other stories all about gaming from August 19 to August 23.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch is one of the most inventive pieces of consumer tech in recent memory, but a few good accessories can make it more practical on a daily basis. And to prepare for Ars Gaming Week, we've spent the past couple of months researching and testing various controllers, chargers, adapters, and all sorts of additional gadgets to figure out which of those accessories are most worth buying.\n\nNote that all testing was done on an original Switch console, not the newer model with improved battery life (and a few other significant upgrades) or the forthcoming Switch Lite, which has Joy-Con controllers that are not detachable. We'll upgrade this guide in the future as more standout accessories hit the market (I\u2019m still waiting on a worthwhile Switch headset, for one), but here's how to optimize everyone's favorite handheld right now.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNintendo Switch Pro Controller\n\nThe Switch\u2019s versatility is a major part of its appeal, but in order for it to meet its portable-meets-home-console aims, Nintendo had to make very clear sacrifices with the hardware. One of the more obvious trade-offs is its \u201cJoy-Con\u201d controller, which is split in two and detaches from the base of the console itself.\n\nGiven the goals of the device, the Joy-Cons are probably as effective a compromise as Nintendo could produce. But compared to the more standard gamepads of a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, they\u2019re decidedly less comfortable\u2014the buttons are tiny and not as satisfying to press, everything\u2019s more cramped together, and some joysticks appear to have issues with long-term reliability.\n\nIf you primarily use the Switch like a supersized Game Boy, there\u2019s not much you can do about this. But if you often have it docked to a TV or propped up on a stand, Nintendo\u2019s Switch Pro Controller is a worthwhile investment. If you have any experience playing with a PlayStation or, especially, an Xbox, it should feel right at home\u2014there\u2019s more room to grasp, more give to the buttons, grippier handles, and just the right amount of space between all the controller\u2019s elements. It\u2019s immediately and significantly more comfortable. There\u2019s an actual d-pad, too, and its rechargeable battery lasts an excellent 35-40 hours per charge. Since the Pro Controller is supported on Steam, it can also double as a handy controller for PC gamers (though it requires a little extra setup to work outside of Valve\u2019s client). It doesn\u2019t sacrifice any of Nintendo\u2019s motion control of Amiibo scanning features, either.\n\nNintendo\u2019s $70 asking price for the Pro Controller is undeniably steep, and having a built-in headphone jack like Sony's and Microsoft\u2019s respective controllers would have been appreciated. But if you often keep the Switch docked and play for extended periods of time, the Pro Controller should prove to be a pleasure to use.\n\nNintendo Switch Pro Controller Buy Now Walmart $62.06 Amazon $61.99 (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)\n\n8BitDo SN30 Pro\n\nOne of the nicer perks of Nintendo\u2019s Switch Online service is the library of classic NES games that come bundled with the subscription. There are more than 40 titles available as of this writing, with more added to the pseudo virtual console each month. If you make particular use of the NES app, or you just play lots of games that take after those retro-style platformers and RPGs, 8BitDo\u2019s SN30 Pro controller is worth a shout. It\u2019s a crisp recreation of a Super Nintendo gamepad but with PlayStation-style joysticks and dual trigger buttons that allow it to work with more modern games.\n\nYou have to appreciate the SNES style for this to work\u2014the SN30 Pro\u2019s \u201cdog bone\u201d shape is virtually identical to the original SNES pad, so it\u2019s significantly smaller than modern gamepads, and its lack of handles makes it less comfortable to grip over extended periods. But if you\u2019re still bought in, 8BitDo has made this design about as polished and responsive as it could be. The trigger buttons are smaller than I\u2019d prefer, but they are defined clearly enough to make avoiding accidental presses easy. The four face buttons have just the right amount of travel, while the d-pad is neither too firm nor too mushy. The joysticks are clickable and smooth to rotate. They don\u2019t get in the way of the traditional SNES-style elements, even for those with larger hands like myself. The start and select buttons have nifty + and - symbols next to them to indicate their use on the Switch, and there are still Home and screenshot buttons onboard. Motion controls and basic rumble functionality are supported, too. It gave me no latency or input lag issues. 8BitDo rates the pad\u2019s battery life at roughly 18 hours, which is consistent with my experience. It charges quickly via a USB-C port, thankfully, though it doesn\u2019t work when wired in to a Switch dock.\n\n8BitDo sells a more faithful SNES gamepad replica called the SN30, but that pad\u2019s lack of ZL and ZR buttons makes it difficult to use with the Switch\u2019s interface, and its lack of joysticks makes it useless for most newer games. More recently the company launched the SN30 Pro+, which has a more modern design with handles to grip, but at that point you\u2019re close enough to the more comfortable Pro Controller that I\u2019d recommend most Switch owners just buy that instead. The SN30 Pro hits the sweet spot between utility and nostalgia more cleanly\u2014it provides that authentic feel for retro-style games, and while it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice for newer titles, it can still handle them. Nintendo is rumored to be working on an SNES-style Switch pad of its own, but the SN30 Pro comes with the benefit of working on Windows, Mac, Android, and Raspberry Pi in addition to the Switch.\n\n8BitDo SN30 Pro $44.99 from Amazon (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)\n\nPowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch\n\nLet\u2019s keep the nostalgia train rolling. If you\u2019re still fond of the, let\u2019s say, idiosyncratic layout of Nintendo\u2019s old GameCube controller\u2014or you\u2019re just a Super Smash Bros. fanatic who thinks the series peaked with Melee\u2014PowerA\u2019s GameCube Style Wireless Controller might make sense for longer play sessions.\n\nTo be frank, this gamepad isn\u2019t as well-made as the aforementioned Switch Pro Controller or the SN30 Pro. Its hard plastic chassis feels cheaper, it lacks vibration and Amiibo scanner support, and pressing down the ZR trigger button creates a hollow \u201cecho\u201d vibration throughout the rest of the controller. It also runs on AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable unit, though it does get a healthy 30 hours of battery life.\n\nThis controller has the Switch\u2019s usual screenshot and menu buttons, though, it\u2019s wireless, it supports motion controls, and it has no issues with latency. Most importantly, it\u2019s as close to a modern facsimile of a GameCube controller as you\u2019ll get. Personally, that\u2019s not a huge selling point: the uneven face buttons, thinner handles, tiny d-pad, and stiff \u201cC-stick\u201d haven\u2019t gotten any less awkward to me in the 18 years since the GameCube launched. But I can\u2019t deny the many people who love the feel of the original GameCube pad\u2014this controller provides that.\n\nIt\u2019s an especially apt choice if you\u2019re a heavy Smash Bros. player. The octagonal gates around the left joystick make it easier to enter precise inputs\u2014up-left, down-right, etc.\u2014than the smoother gates of the Switch Pro\u2019s joysticks. And the shorter length of that stick, along with the closeness of the face buttons, are more conducive to making inputs faster. So while I can\u2019t recommend this gamepad as universally as the Switch Pro Controller, you could do worse for $45 if you just want that classic GameCube feel.", "description": "We researched and tested dozens of gadgets to find you quality Switch gear.", "authors": ["Jeff Dunn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hori-compact-playstand-for-nintendo-switch-2-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
