(Harry) Maguire we hadn\u2019t played.\n\n\u201cSo that was three that got to the World Cup semi-final who hadn\u2019t played by this point ahead of the tournament and they all had outstanding tournaments for us, so I think we\u2019ve always got to have that open mind.\u201d\n\nSouthgate has proven to be open-minded, bold and forward-thinking in his decision-making as England manager, with experienced players moved on in his quest to evolve and improve.\n\nSaturday saw substitute Mason Mount become the latest talent to be fast-tracked into the senior side as the Chelsea man made his debut, while Jadon Sancho came off the bench as the 19-year-old won his seventh cap.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing to say is that we are not doing it for wallpaper \u2013 they\u2019re in because they deserve to be in,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cMason\u2019s performances already this season for his club and in training with us this week, then what he showed when he went into the game show that he\u2019s a threat to the starting team.\n\n\u201cSo, that is hugely encouraging for us in that you know that for a lot of these lads, their best years are probably three or four or five years away.\n\n\u201cI mean he\u2019s still filling out physically as well so that\u2019s great.\n\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019ve got to get the balance right of keeping on winning matches and blood those players at the right times but, yes, English fans should be hugely excited when they see the likes of him and Sancho coming on and the impact that they can have already is.\n\n\u201cWe love working with them because the mentality is good; it\u2019s not just that they\u2019ve got talent, they want to get better and it\u2019s up to them how far they go.\u201d\n\nJames Maddison and Tyrone Mings are the remaining uncapped players in Southgate\u2019s 23-man squad after Aaron Wan-Bissaka returned to Manchester United due to a back complaint.\n\nTeam-mate Jesse Lingard followed suit on Saturday due to illness but there are no plans to call up any reinforcements ahead of the match against Kosovo in front of a sell-out St Mary\u2019s crowd.", "description": "Gareth Southgate is relishing the headache brought by increased competition as England\u2019s players look to stake their claim ahead of Euro 2020.
