She proposed a lifetime ban on lobbying for ex-Presidents, Senators and Members of Congress; a ban on hiring corporate lobbyists on federal government staff; a ban on lobbying on behalf of foreign governments; a ban on corporate lobbyists \u201cbundling\u201d campaign donations; a ban on secret meetings between public officials and lobbyists; a ban on elected officials owning businesses or trading individual stocks.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe will take down the \u2018for sale\u2019 signs hanging outside of every federal building in Washington.\u201d\n\nIt came as no surprise that Warren, who has been railing against corruption since her time as a Harvard Law School professor, seized on the theme. But if the policy was familiar, the narrative was new. Warren used the speech to situate her campaign in a long history of women reformers and labor organizers who have taken on big corporate interests and won.\n\nThe location of the speech was symbolic. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire\u2014in which 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women, burned to death in 1911\u2014would become a turning point in both the women\u2019s and labor movements, accelerating women\u2019s suffrage and leading to labor reforms that protected workers. It was also, as Warren pointed out in her speech, a wake-up call for young Frances Perkins, who witnessed the fire and became a crusader for worker\u2019s rights before becoming the first woman to serve in a President\u2019s cabinet, as Secretary of Labor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\n\u201cThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power: A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power\u2014our power, about what\u2019s possible when we all fight together as one.\u201d\n\nThe speech doubled as a way for Warren distinguish herself from Sanders, who is similarly fighting for the progressive mantle. Supporters said they were excited to see a woman inject identity issues into an economic critique.\n\n\u201c[Sanders] boiled everything down to economic oppression, but there are other issues,\u201d says Amber Sexton, 50, a bartender who voted for Sanders in 2016 but now supports Warren. \u201cShe has an optimism and a positivity. She\u2019s not just against things; she\u2019s for things.\u201d\n\nNot everyone was convinced. Elliot Crown, a Sanders supporter who showed up to Washington Square Park wearing a paper-mache mask of the Senator from Vermont, said he was wary of Warren\u2019s pitch.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s too ready to compromise,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think she\u2019ll be just like any corporate Democrat.\u201d\n\nMerging the progressive critique of unchecked capitalism with the promise of the first woman president could be Warren\u2019s path to victory in the primary. Sanders is \u201csaying the same things as her, but from a man\u2019s point of view,\u201d says Adrian Bey, a 45-year old fashion designer who voted for Sanders in 2016. \u201cYou can get more flies with honey than with vinegar,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to say Bernie is vinegar, but she\u2019s definitely honey.\u201d\n\nThe speech also highlighted Warren\u2019s theory of change. \u201cWhile the women of the trade unions kept pushing from the outside, Frances pushed from the inside,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, what did one woman\u2014one very persistent woman\u2014backed up by millions of people across this country get done?\u201d she said. \u201cSocial Security. Unemployment insurance. Abolition of child labor. Minimum wage. The right to join a union. Even the very existence of the weekend. Big, structural change. One woman, and millions of people to back her up.\u201d\n\nSupporters say that this playbook\u2014merging external activism with practical political maneuvering\u2014makes Warren more likely to get things done. \u201cThat has been the Working Families Party theory of change,\u201d says Nelini Stamp, the Director of Strategy and Partnership for the Working Families Party. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected candidates to office and if they don\u2019t do what our people have demanded, we hold them accountable. We\u2019ve done the inside-outside game for a long time.\u201d\n\nOn this night, even Warren\u2019s podium was symbolic. It was built with wood salvaged from the Perkins homestead, crafted by a Warren grassroots donor who owns an all-woman woodworking company, and modeled after the soapboxes that organizers would speak from during the early labor movement. It was 46 inches tall, for the woman who wants to be the 46th President of the United States.\n\nWrite to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com.", "description": "If winning the Democratic nomination requires wooing the party's progressive wing and harnessing the power of activist women, then Senator Elizabeth Warren has a plan\u2026", "authors": ["Charlotte Alter"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1168719084.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
