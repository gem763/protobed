Another ruse is to approach drunk men or women leaving night clubs around the Champs Elysees.\n\n'Our advice to anyone with an expensive watch is to keep it well covered up in public, and not to show if off in bars or restaurants,' said a Paris police source.\n\nThe British are the biggest visitor group to Paris, which is the most visited tourist city in the world.\n\nBrands that the thieves particularly go for are Rolex and Cartier, which are easily recognisable and can be resold on the black market without papers.\n\nSuch watches are normally worth between \u00a35000 and \u00a335,000 but the Richard Mille Tourbillon Diamond Twister retails in France at around \u20ac780,000 (\u00a3700,000)", "description": "The loss of the Richard Mille Tourbillon Diamond Twister - a women's timepiece viewed as high end jewellery - comes during an explosion of similar crimes in the French capital.", "authors": ["Peter Allen For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/19/19456268-0-image-a-21_1570560687406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
