Why Not review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week", "language": "en", "text": "You can accuse Liam Gallagher of many things, but never of selling his music under false pretences. Not for Our Kid the public admonishment of reviewers who\u2019ve failed to grasp its fathomless depths and manifold subtleties, nor the angry social media announcement that critics have missed that his gift is the warmth he lives his life with and the self-reflection he shares so generously (as Lana Del Rey recently admonished an NPR journalist). He deals, he told the Guardian last year, in \u201cmeat and veg rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m here to give people what they want, and if that\u2019s boring, so be it.\u201d To Gallagher Jr, music is like football: \u201cI\u2019m never going to change my fucking football team.\u201d\n\nLiam Gallagher: Why Me? Why Not. album art work\n\nHe knows his audience. They are men in middle age for whom pop music has grown ever-more remote since the mid-90s, and for whom Noel Gallagher\u2019s recent attempts to broaden his musical horizons a little represents an unacceptable capitulation to the terrifying forces of progress and change. They are teenagers who\u2019ve bought into a romanticised version of the 1990s, propagated in documentaries and misty-eyed media eulogies occasioned by 25th anniversaries, and who have furthermore noted that guitar-based alt-rock has little to currently offer in that vein: you can go and see Catfish and the Bottlemen, but you\u2019re not going to hear anything with the potency of Slide Away or Rock N\u2019 Roll Star. Mock them if you want \u2013 the kind of people who get a petition up when a rapper headlines Glastonbury; confused and horrified by identity politics and intersectional feminism; desperate for things to be as they once were \u2013 but the sales figures suggest he\u2019s done his research: his 2017 solo album As You Were went platinum; he\u2019s selling out arenas and sports stadiums.\n\nIt all makes reviewing his second solo album seem like a pointless exercise. You really don\u2019t need a critic to tell you what it sounds like; you know without reading a review whether you\u2019ll like it or not. Anyone desperate to find some point of difference between Why Me? Why Not. and the music Liam Gallagher has already made might alight on Halo, a song audibly conceived in the vein of the Rolling Stones \u2013 1967\u2019s Let\u2019s Spend the Night Together, to be specific \u2013 rather than the Beatles. Both The River and Shockwave, meanwhile, make capital from the stomping, brickies-in-eyeliner glitterbeat style also aped on Oasis\u2019s Lyla: like Lyla, if either song had been released on RAK in 1974 by a flop band called something like Bumper or Thumper, a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t give either Gallagher houseroom would be proclaiming them lost junkshop glam gems.\n\nIn fact, the real difference between Why Me? Why Not. and As You Were might be a certain confidence: for all its snarling vocals, the latter album ended with a song on which Liam Gallagher ruminated that his career might be over. This time, the rock songs punch a little harder, the poppier moments are more unapologetically poppy: the melody of Now That I\u2019ve Found You evokes not John Lennon sneering his way through I Am the Walrus, but Paul McCartney shaking his moptop in crowd-pleasing style. Certainly, it\u2019s more shameless than its predecessor in appealing to its audience\u2019s penchant for 90s nostalgia, and their prurient interest in the ongoing Gallagher v Gallagher war, often at the same time. \u201cAct like you don\u2019t remember, you said we\u2019d Live Forever,\u201d protests One of Us. \u201cIt was easier to have fun back when we had nothing,\u201d opens Once, contrasting this state of affairs with the mundanities of middle age \u2013 \u201cjust \u2026 send the kids to school\u201d \u2013 before returning to the rosy glow of reminiscence: \u201cI remember how you used to shine \u2026 When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liam Gallagher: One of Us \u2013 video\n\nThe songs, it\u2019s worth noting, are uniformly well-written, at least within their self-imposed parameters: they\u2019re certainly melodically stronger than his brother\u2019s recent experiments. You get the feeling the hired hands brought in to shore up the writing have thoroughly enjoyed themselves, being paid to indulge their Beatles fantasies \u2013 to come up with a song like Once, which manages to evoke John Lennon\u2019s Jealous Guy without actually stealing the tune outright \u2013 presumably being far more fun than their usual lot, ie driving yourself round the twist trying to devise something that Sia or Pink\u2019s manager will deem worthy of passing on to their esteemed client.\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nComplaining that there\u2019s nothing different or innovative here feels beside the point, like buying an Objekt album then taking it back because his brand of super-hip off-kilter techno doesn\u2019t have a bloke in a parka making Beatles references over the top of it. It does what it sets out to do: provide Gallagher with material hooky enough that the arena crowds don\u2019t storm the bars and lavatories when he stops playing Oasis songs. As Liam Gallagher knows, for his audience at least, that\u2019s enough.\n\nThis week Alexis listened to\n\nPerfume Genius: Eye in the Wall\n\nThat moment of blissful dancefloor transcendence captured in nine minutes of pulsing synths and yearning, ethereal vocals.", "description": "Gallagher provides more crowd-pleasers for his sizable audience of 90s guitar-rock nostalgists \u2013 and with greater confidence", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/129d94ff832a828666448cccfd19af9321deb455/177_903_5362_3217/master/5362.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=40275fed13c124e9def69df22c5b5201", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
