The views expressed here are solely his. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Wealth, privilege and celebrity will not be keeping Felicity Huffman, 56, out of jail. Apologizing and accepting responsibility, however, will certainly shorten the length of time she stays there. Judge Indira Talwani made the right call in imposing a 14-day sentence based on Huffman's role in the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal. She is also required to perform 250 hours of community service, pay a $30,000 fine, and be subject to supervised release for one year.\n\nJoey Jackson\n\nThere's been a lot of speculation and debate over what kind of sentence Huffman deserved. I've found myself highly conflicted as to what the ultimate outcome should be. But I am perfectly OK with this one.\n\nOn the one hand, this scandal demonstrates how people with money and privilege have nearly unlimited opportunities to perpetuate their family's high status. The rest of society must play by the rules. Not everyone has the resources necessary to pay someone to take their child's SAT exam, or bribe a proctor to correct the test after it's taken.\n\nAs such, the less privileged are forced to implore their children to work hard, get good grades, and do their best to stand out among their peers. To earn a fair shot in life, they must rely on grit, hard work, persistence and determination. That includes doing community service and other volunteer work in their communities, aligning themselves with good teachers, and finding great mentors to guide and vouch for them.\n\nSome people look at Huffman's crimes and ask who the victims are. The answer is simple. We all are victims \u2014 each person who makes efforts to live right and do right. All who follow established procedures, rules and protocols are victims, including the parents who try to do things correctly, and who teach their children to do the same. Every child who studies hard and commits themselves to doing the right thing is a victim as well. How many heartbroken children are there who didn't get into the school of their choice, but perhaps could have \u2014 if only they'd cheated?\n\nRead More", "description": "Judge Indira Talwani made the right call in imposing a 14-day sentence based on Huffman's role in the Varsity Blues scandal, writes CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson.", "authors": ["Opinion Joey Jackson", "Cnn Legal Analyst"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190913140254-02-felicity-huffman-court-arrival-0913-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
