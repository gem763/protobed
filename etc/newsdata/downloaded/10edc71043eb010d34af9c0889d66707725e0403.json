With their movement so severely restricted, these mothers are also unable to tend to their young if there are problems and often have to helplessly watch them suffer and die around her.'\n\nFarrowing crates have been banned in Sweden, Norway and Switzerland but not in the UK and they are widely used across the world.\n\nThe activists have also criticised the farm for its overcrowding and say that pigs are being kept in small farrowing crates which limit movement\n\nFarrowing crates have been banned in Sweden, Norway and Switzerland but not in the UK. In the rest of the world they are widely used\n\nVirtue for Animals said they left the farm at 12.am after an eight-hour protest when police attended the scene.\n\nCheshire Police told MailOnline: 'Cheshire police are aware of a protest that took place in Ince.\n\n'Officers attended to the protest as a precaution and there were no reported incidents of disorder.\n\n'People have a right in law to protest and the role of the police is to impartially balance this right with the rights of those impacted by the protest such as continuing in their legitimate business activities, or commuting.'\n\nHolme Farm is owned by JH Willis and Sons who are yet to respond to MailOnline's request to comment.", "description": "Members of Virtue for Animals arrived at Holme Farm in Chester at 4am today to stage a sit-in in a pig shed which lasted for eight hours, during which they were sprayed with water in a pig shed.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/16/20218012-0-image-a-30_1572102468028.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
