Jackson, Tiffany Haddish and Whoopi Goldberg attended the opening of Tyler Perry's new studios in Atlanta. (Oct. 6) AP, AP\n\nTyler Perry isn't worried about mainstream Hollywood because that's not who his stories are for.\n\nThe mogul, who celebrated the grand opening of Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta with a star-studded gala over the weekend, sat down with Gayle King on Monday and said Hollywood ignores him.\n\n\"I clearly believe that I\u2019m ignored in Hollywood, for sure, and that's fine I get it,\" Perry told King. \"My audience and the stories that I tell are African-American stories specific to a certain audience, specific to a certain group of people that I know, that I grew up with, and we speak a language. Hollywood doesn\u2019t necessarily speak the language, a lot of critics don\u2019t speak that language, so to them it\u2019s like, \u2018What is this?\u2019\"\n\nThe \"Madea\" star made history as he became the first black person to own a studio outright.\n\nTyler Perry says he knows how important his work is.

Giunta/Getty Images)\n\nThe 50-year-old multi-hyphenate said that just because critics fail to see the importance of his work, it doesn't detract from its value.\n\n\"I know what I do is important. I know what I do touches millions of people around the world,\" Perry said. \"I know what that does for the people where I come from and the people that I\u2019m writing for.\"\n\nEven criticism from his fellow colleagues doesn't bother Perry. He says he can see the impact of his work every time he drives through the studio's gates.\n\n\"I've been on sets where I've been the only black face on, only black face, as recently as 2019 going, 'Where are the black people in this movie?' Back behind the camera?\" Perry said. \"So, when I come to work here and every black person that comes to work here they go, 'Oh my God, it's heaven. Here we are. We're represented.' Where everybody's represented. LGBTQ's represented. Black, white, gay, straight, whatever. We're all represented, working hand-in-hand, arm-in-arm.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/07/tyler-perry-tells-gayle-king-hes-ignored-hollywood-but-its-fine/3899320002/", "description": "Tyler Perry made history over the weekend by celebrating the grand opening of Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published P.M.
