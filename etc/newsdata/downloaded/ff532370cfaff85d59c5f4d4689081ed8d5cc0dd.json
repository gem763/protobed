At the moment they arrived, neither officer knew what substance the truck had been transporting.\n\n\"The cab landed in the southbound lanes of Loop 287, while the tanker landed in the northbound lanes,\" Lufkin Police and Fire said in a statement on its Facebook page.\n\nFootage from Willmon's dashboard camera, released on Friday, showed him pulling up to complete wreckage on the roadway including a lone wheel from the truck.\n\nBoth Willmon's and Ordaz's police vehicles could be seen backing up slowly from the crash site because neither knew what substance the truck was carrying, police said.\n\nLufkin Police Dept.\n\n\"When they approached the cab, they did not know what was inside the burning tanker. It could have been gasoline -- ready to explode -- or a deadly chemical,\" Lufkin police said Friday.\n\n\"Is somebody yelling?\" Ordaz could be heard asking on his body camera after the two men get out of their vehicles. \"I hear somebody yelling.\"\n\n\"Think we can hear the driver yelling. ... He's on the southbound side,\" Willmon says into his radio. \"I don't want to sit here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's yelling for help,\" Ordaz says.\n\nBoth officers could then be seen on Ordaz's body camera running toward the driver who was trapped in the truck's smashed cab, despite the fear that the truck and cab could explode at any moment.\n\n\"We can see him,\" Ordaz says.\n\nLufkin Police Dept.\n\nBoth Ordaz and Willmon pulled the driver from the cab and then carried him quickly from the wreckage. The driver could be heard crying out in pain.\n\n\"Hold on, man. We're getting you out of here,\" one of the officers can be heard saying. \"I know you hurting.\"\n\nThe driver later asked to walk, but after the officers put him on the ground they realized he was too bloodied and in too much pain so they carried him again, farther from the truck scene.\n\n\"Thankfully, the truck was only carrying orange juice, but the HAZMAT crew is offloading the truck's fuel tank. The scene smells like a mixture of orange juice and automotive fluid,\" Lufkin Police and Fire said on Thursday.\n\nLufkin Police Dept.\n\nWhile the southbound flyover stayed open, the northbound side suffered some structural damage and needed to be inspected by a state Department of Transportation crew, authorities said.\n\nThe driver, identified as Leslie Rodriguez, 60, of Edinburg, Texas, suffered broken bones, authorities said. He was taken to a hospital and expected to be OK.\n\nIt was still unclear why the driver crashed off the flyover, police said Friday.", "description": "Lufkin police in Texas said the tanker was transporting orange juice and the driver suffered broken bones but was expected to be OK.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/truck-rescue-after-ht-ps-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
