We would not be a responsible government if we didn\u2019t address them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new bill, details of which have already been made public and that will have its first reading on Sept. 24, will include the creation of a registry to monitor and track every firearm legally held in New Zealand.\n\nIt also tightens other rules for gun dealers and for individuals to get and keep a firearm license. License renewal for individuals was also reduced to five years from ten years.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s efforts on gun control have gained global praise, especially in the United States, where lawmakers in favor of gun control and activists have struggled to address gun violence despite back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio last month.\n\nAt home, Ardern has also faced resistance from the federal opposition National party and gun lobby groups, who have indicated they will not support tighter gun laws as they target law-abiding firearm owners, a claim she has rejected.\n\nThe government was also slammed recently by critics of its firearm buy-back scheme that has given gun owners until Dec. 20 to hand in weapons that have been banned.\n\nMore than 19,100 firearms and about 70,800 gun accessories have been handed in so far, which some critics say are fewer than expected.\n\nWith a population of just under 5 million and an estimated 1.5 million firearms, New Zealand is 17th in the world in terms of civilian firearm ownership, the Small Arms Survey shows.\n\nArdern, who was in Christchurch to mark six months since the March attack, also announced more funding to meet mental health needs of people affected by the shooting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that survivors, families, the Muslim community and the people of Christchurch know that we will be there to support them for the long-haul,\u201d she said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern delivers a speech entitled \"Why Does Good Government Matter?\" at Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne, Australia July 18, 2019.
