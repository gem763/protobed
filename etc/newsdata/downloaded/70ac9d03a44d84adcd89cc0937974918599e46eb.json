This back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete.\n\n\n\nThe International Staff and your elected Bargaining Committee have been working countless hours to reach an Agreement on behalf of our Members, their families and all the communities affected by this strike.\n\n\n\nWe will continue to bargain this contract until your Bargaining Committee is satisfied that we have achieved an Agreement that properly addresses our Members' concerns.\n\n\n\nThank you very much for your loyal support and the sacrifice you are making every day for what is just and right! Terry Dittes, Vice President and Director, UAW General Motors Department\n\nGM, on September 18, commented on the situation saying, \u201cour goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for everyone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDittes\u2019 letter adds some sense of optimism for the 46,000 UAW workers at GM plants and facilities who went on strike just after midnight on Sept. 16 after the union rejected the automaker\u2019s initial contract proposal which GM submitted just two hours before the previous contract expired at midnight on Sept. 14.\n\nNegotiators from both sides have met daily since then, with the strike already the union\u2019s longest since 1985, when the UAW walked out of Chrysler plants for 12 days. The strike, according to industry analysts, could cost the automaker an estimated $50 million per day at least.\n\nSeveral sticking points have been a thorn in each other\u2019s side, including GM\u2019s closure of four U.S. factories last fall, as well as the use of temporary employees, with the union pushing for a better path to make them permanent while also gaining benefits in the process.\n\nTemporary workers currently account for between 7 to 10 percent of GM\u2019s U.S. hourly workers, which translates to about 4,100 temporary employees.\n\nUAW\u2019s strike against GM is actually one of two separate strikes, with 850 union-backed Aramark janitorial employees who work at GM facilities walking off the job a day before autoworkers did the same.\n\nSources close to the UAW and GM told the Free Press that the two sides must decide upon a new contract with both Aramark and autoworkers in a timely fashion, or else union workers will be forced to cross the others\u2019 picket lines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "UAW-GM Vice President Terry Dittes provided an update to the union's negotiations with the automaker.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/UAW-GM-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
