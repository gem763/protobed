Just one year on, he's thinking about closing it down.\n\nSung's new hydrogen station is one of five in Ulsan, home to Hyundai Motor Co's <005380.KS> main plants and roughly 1,100 fuel cell cars - the most of any South Korean city.\n\nThe government paid the 3 billion won ($2.5 million) cost - six times more than fast charging equipment for battery electric cars - and the two pumps, located next to Sung's gasoline stand, see a steady flow of Hyundai Nexo SUVs daily.\n\nEven so, Sung hasn't been able to turn a profit, hamstrung as the equipment can only refuel a limited number of cars each day and by the government's decision to set retail hydrogen prices low to bring consumers on board.\n\n\"All hydrogen stations will have no choice but to shut down unless the government subsidizes operating costs,\" Sung, 32, told Reuters. \"Otherwise, this place will just become a 3 billion won chunk of steel.\"\n\nIf those impediments to commercial viability were not enough, a fatal hydrogen storage tank explosion this year has spurred protests against the government and Hyundai's ambitious campaign to promote the zero-emissions fuel.\n\nCalling hydrogen power the \"future bread and butter\" of Asia's No. 4 economy, President Moon Jae-in has declared himself an ambassador for the technology and targeted 850,000 fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) on South Korean roads by 2030.\n\nThat's no mean feat given fewer than 3,000 have been sold so far. Japan, also a big proponent of FCVs and with an auto market three times larger, plans 800,000 in the same timeframe.\n\nThe challenges of building out refueling infrastructure in South Korea underscore the long and uphill battle FCVs face to widespread adoption at a time when electric cars are stealing much of the green car limelight.\n\nAnd for the government and Hyundai, the only automaker selling a fuel cell car in the country, it is an expensive project with no guarantee of success.\n\nMoon is set to spend $1.8 billion in central government funds to subsidize car sales and to build refueling stations for the five years to 2022 at current subsidy levels, Reuters calculations show.\n\nSubsidies cut Nexo's price by half to about 35 million won ($29,300) and sales of the model, launched in March 2018, have surged this year. In contrast, Japanese subsidies fund one third of Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Mirai FCV, bringing its price to around $46,200.\n\nSome critics argue Hyundai is the main beneficiary of the government's ardent backing, but the automaker also has much at stake. With its suppliers, it plans to invest $6.5 billion by 2030 on hydrogen R&D and facilities.\n\n\"There are risks that come with the need to make large-scale investments in building (hydrogen car) production facilities, securing supply channels and establishing sales networks,\" Hyundai said in an e-mailed statement.\n\n(GRAPHIC: South Korea's push for a hydrogen economy - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AUTOS-HYDROGEN-SOUTHKOREA/0H001QX808J1/eikon.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nHIGH PRESSURE\n\nIn May, a hydrogen storage tank at a government research project in the rural city of Gangneung exploded. It destroyed a complex about half the size of a soccer field, killing two and injuring six. A preliminary investigation found the blast was caused by a spark after oxygen found its way into the tank.\n\n\"One victim was blown away by pressure and then killed after being hit by rock,\" said Kong Gikwang, a lawyer who represents the family of one of the two who died in a lawsuit against the research complex.\n\nOne month later, there was an explosion at a hydrogen refueling station in Norway. This week, a hydrogen gas leak and subsequent fire at a South Korean chemical plant caused three workers to suffer burns.\n\nSuch safety concerns have fueled protests by South Korean resident groups worried about hydrogen facilities being built in their areas.\n\nKim Jong-ho, who began a month-long hunger strike against a planned fuel cell power plant in the port city of Incheon two days before the Gangneung blast, said the explosion refocused attention from pollution risks of hydrogen production to safety. Incheon has since agreed to review the safety and environmental impact of the plant.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Aiming to cash in on a major push by South Korea to promote fuel cell vehicles, Sung Won-young opened a hydrogen refueling station in the city of Ulsan last September.
