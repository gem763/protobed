The president took to Twitter early Tuesday to deride the Iraq War veteran, who appeared for his testimony in uniform, calling him a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d and questioning his recollection of events.\n\n\u201cSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u201cconcerned\u201d today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cPlease ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet followed assertions on Fox News by a former Justice Department official, John Yoo, who claimed Monday night that Vindman might be engaging in \u201cespionage\u201d because he sometimes spoke with Ukrainian officials about strategy in his native tongue. Vindman and his family came to the United States from the Soviet Union when he was a small child.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-highest ranking Republican in the House, warned Tuesday that it was \u201cshameful\u201d for the GOP to question Vindman\u2019s patriotism \u2014 or that of other witnesses testifying in the House\u2019s impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cI think we need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cIt is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation and we should not be involved in that process.\u201d\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony, which he gave under subpoena, directly challenged that of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a Trump appointee who met with impeachment investigators earlier this month. Sondland defended the president\u2019s actions and told House investigators no one had raised concerns about them.\n\nAD\n\nSondland, in September text messages to the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., said Trump had not engaged in a quid pro quo. Those text messages were provided to impeachment investigators by Kurt Volker, the Trump administration\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nIn his meeting with lawmakers last week, Taylor laid out in meticulous detail how a shadow Ukraine policy involving Sondland and directed by Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani prioritized investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals over U.S. national security interests. Taylor\u2019s testimony has been held up by Democrats as potentially the most incriminating to date.\n\nVindman\u2019s recollections, while narrower, illuminate key episodes in Taylor\u2019s narrative with an even closer perspective: Vindman was either in the room or briefed personally after meetings by administration officials involved in the exchanges Democrats believe amounted to a quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\nVindman also went to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel with concerns about a July 10 meeting between Sondland, Volker, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, then-national security adviser John Bolton and senior Ukrainian officials. During the meeting, according to Vindman\u2019s prepared statement, Sondland demanded that Ukrainian leaders deliver \u201cspecific investigations\u201d to secure a meeting between Zelensky and Trump.\n\nAD\n\nVindman said he was told about that meeting directly by Sondland in the immediate aftermath of the event, according to his prepared remarks. During the previously scheduled debrief, \u201cSondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma,\u201d a Ukrainian energy company, Vindman\u2019s prepared testimony reads.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\u201d Vindman adds.\n\nAD\n\nSondland is already under pressure from some lawmakers to return to Capitol Hill due to discrepancies between his testimony and that of others like Taylor, who told investigators Sondland was aware Trump was leveraging a meeting and, later, the military aid for Ukraine on promises to conduct investigations.\n\nAD\n\nTim Morrison, the NSC official who told Taylor that Ukraine\u2019s military aid was being held up to secure investigations into the role former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter had on Burisma\u2019s board, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee that was hacked in 2016, is expected to testify in the impeachment inquiry on Thursday.\n\nSondland appeared to demur during his closed-door deposition earlier this month about whether believed almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine was being withheld to secure the investigations. But in recent days, Sondland\u2019s lawyer Robert Luskin has told the Wall Street Journal his client believes \u2014 and told House investigators \u2014 that Trump\u2019s refusal to meet with Zelensky until the Ukrainians promised to launch the investigations amounted to a quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\nAsked to respond to Vindman\u2019s testimony, Luskin said his client would decline to comment.\n\nAD\n\nVindman\u2019s prepared testimony does not address whether military aid was being withheld to secure U.S. elections; it just stresses that Sondland held back the promise of a phone call between the two heads of state until Ukraine pledged to conduct the investigations.\n\nSondland appeared on Capitol Hill again on Monday to review the transcript of his previous testimony in a secure facility, a courtesy afforded to all interviewees.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony also raises new questions about the role Bolton and his other senior deputies may play in the investigation as it proceeds. Bolton was infuriated by Sondland\u2019s demands of the Ukrainians during the July 10 meeting, according to Vindman\u2019s testimony and that of former NSC senior director for Russia and Europe Fiona Hill. Hill testified earlier this month that Bolton thought Giuliani was a \u201chand grenade\u201d and wanted it known that he would not participate in a Ukraine policy he likened to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d between Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who had convened the meeting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe panels have thus far not subpoenaed Bolton for his testimony, though many Democrats believe he could be a powerful and incriminating witness against the president in a public hearing. But Bolton shares a lawyer with his former top deputy, Charles Kupperman, who petitioned the courts late last week to rule on whether he must comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in the impeachment probe.\n\nDemocrats, who are committed not to slow their probe by getting into protracted legal battles, have rejected Kupperman\u2019s filing as legally baseless, with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) predicting Monday that the courts would \u201cmake short shrift\u201d of the argument and force Kupperman to go before the panel.\n\nThat may happen sooner than initially appeared. A federal judge said Monday he wanted to hear from lawyers for the House, Kupperman and the Trump administration on Thursday afternoon.\n\nAaron C.
