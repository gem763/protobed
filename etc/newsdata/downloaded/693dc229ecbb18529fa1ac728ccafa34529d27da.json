You betcha!", "language": "en", "text": "A drought proof rural property in the southern Flinders Ranges could fetch big money at its auction next month.\n\nKnown as Spring Creek, the 253.3ha property at 1131 Coonatto Rd, Melrose, comes with unrestricted water supply and reliable and versatile production capacity.\n\nIt will be auctioned at Melrose Town Hall, on Thursday, November 28, at 1pm.\n\nVendor John Knight said the property had been in his family for more than 40 years.\n\n\u201cWe lived in Alice Springs. My Dad worked in the pump business and had a plane that he would fly all over,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery Christmas we\u2019d all get in the six seater and fly down to Melrose to visit family.\u201d\n\nMORE NEWS:\n\nThe Australian Olive Company up for sale in South Australia\n\nA rare lifestyle change offers the best of both worlds to buyers\n\nTop suburbs for future capital growth revealed\n\nThe view of the land, and the waterways which include the actual Spring Creek, appealed to the man who had spent his career finding water sources.\n\n\u201cIn 1974, when this property came up, Dad bought it.\u201d Mr Knight said.\n\nThe Spring Creek \u2018floods out\u2019 into the Spring Creek property, and below the land is the rich Willochra Basin underground springs. Although at the time, there wasn\u2019t much to see by the naked eye, Mr Knight recalls.\n\n\u201cIt was a scrub block, with absolutely nothing on it,\u201d Mr Knight said.\n\nHowever in 1982 his father, with the help of a teenage John and a \u2018mate of Dad\u2019s from the Territory, a real bushie,\u201d started dropping the bores, seven in all, and the land and the lifestyle turned a corner.\n\nThe supply of water to the property is now so plentiful, that the term \u2018drought proof\u2019 is not hyperbole.\n\nRay White South Australia\u2019s Geoff Schell said the property\u2019s unique set up had resulted in widespread interest from across Australia.\n\nHe said the sale would include unrestricted underground water supply, four centre pivot circles, well planned fencing and stock management infrastructure, and a six-room stone homestead in an attractive garden setting.\n\n\u201cSpring Creek would work so well with a pastoral property, because it would be an ideal drought reserve for fodder production and to help retain valuable breeding stock,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThousands of tonnes of quality hay has gone north and into NSW from the Mid North region of SA over the last two years.\u201d\n\nMr Schell said the vendors had been more than custodians of the property.\n\n\u201cThey have developed and improved the property and livestock, while enjoying not only the success of their farming enterprise, but also the lifestyle, the community and the heritage of the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey never tire of the majestic view of Mt Remarkable on their doorstep, or of the grandeur of the massive red gums. They feel a connection to the area, and the water that feeds it.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of properties that are gems in South Australia, but Spring Creek is quite exceptional. There really are few properties like it.\u201d", "description": "A drought proof rural property in the southern Flinders Ranges, with unrestricted water supply and reliable production capacity, is expected to fetch big money at its auction next month.", "authors": ["Lydia Kellner"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29003043/capi_757faa158cd5cd3cec22bb0a0ade87de_d206bb2abbeac6c0b99cf9a166ad2266.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
