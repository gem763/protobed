I think that it was a suggestion,\" Mr Short told reporters on Tuesday. \"It's like when we went through the trip, it's like, well, he's going to Doonbeg because that's where the Pence family is from,\" Mr Short said before paraphrasing Mr Trump. \"It's like, 'Well, you should stay at my place'.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he had had \u201cno involvement\u201d in Mr Pence\u2019s travel arrangements.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
