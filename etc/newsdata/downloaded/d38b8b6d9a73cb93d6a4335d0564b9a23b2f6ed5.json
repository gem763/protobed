(Paul Sancya/Associated Press)\n\nThe man who caught Albert Pujols\u2019 2,000th career RBI \u2014 and initially drew attention for his decision to keep it \u2014 delivered the ball to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum last month, according to the Detroit News.\n\nThe story begins with Ely Hydes\u2019 last-minute trip to a Detroit Tigers game against the Los Angeles Angels in May, where he snagged a home run ball shortly after arriving. He initially had no idea the first ball he had came off Pujols\u2019s bat.\n\nHydes also didn\u2019t realize his newest possession had historic implications.\n\nWith that hit, Pujols joined an incredibly small group of players to amass 2,000 RBI, including Hank Aaron and Alex Rodriguez. Hydes, 33, was immediately inundated with proposals to buy the ball \u2014 one fan reportedly offered him $50,000 \u2014 including several aggressive offers from the Tigers\u2019 organization, the Detroit News reported at the time.\n\nHydes was perturbed by the pressure and reluctant to capitulate. In a statement to the Detroit News, the Tigers challenged his account and asserted their staff had \u201cconducted themselves in a professional manner.\u201d\n\nPujols, for his part, had no qualms about the decision, telling reporters after the game: \u201cHe can have that piece of history \u2026 He has the right to keep it. The ball went in the stands.\u201d The next day, Hydes told the newspaper that after sleeping on it, he planned to give the ball to Pujols or the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He wanted no money in return, he said.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stave off the hordes of angry baseball purists on Facebook and other social media platforms, who had already tracked Hydes down and harassed him for his decision.\n\nFinally, a resolution on that @PujolsFive 2,000th-RBI baseball.\n\n\n\nDetroiter Ely Hydes turned down lots of cash and a whole bunch of other stuff, and last month hand-delivered the baseball to the @baseballhall.\n\n\n\nHe donated it in memory of his late son, Cy.https://t.co/LBnkv0pqV7 pic.twitter.com/IP0s7orFCp \u2014 Tony Paul (@TonyPaul1984) September 24, 2019\n\nWhat his attackers likely did not know is that for Hydes, the ball carried a sentimental value that no dollar amount could match. His 21-month-old son, Cyrus Arlo Maloney, died in June 2018 after he suddenly became ill, according to the Detroit News. Named after Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, Cyrus and his father had attended more than two dozen games together before his death.\n\nIn many ways, the ball represented yet another memory Hydes could cherish. Now, that memory will be on display in Cooperstown \u2014 thanks to a hand-delivered donation from Hydes in Cyrus\u2019 name. The Baseball Hall of Fame did not return a request for comment from The Washington Post Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSpeaking with the Los Angeles Times Tuesday, Pujols said he was happy with Hydes\u2019 decision.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good \u2014 it belongs there,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThat\u2019s where it needs to be.\u201d\n\nHydes is now a father to a three-month-old daughter named Violet and took her to her first Tigers game last month. He plans to make new memories by showing her the baseball dedicated to her brother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll want to show her and tell her the story, just the whole thing,\u201d Hydes told the Detroit News \u201cThe good things that happened \u2026 and the cautionary tale of social media.\u201d\n\nRead more on MLB:\n\nPadres\u2019 managerial job will be the plum MLB opening of the offseason\n\nAgent Scott Boras again slams MLB over wet bases after another client gets injured\n\nWith Andy Green\u2019s firing, Padres\u2019 managerial job will be one of the plums of offseason", "description": "Ely Hydes initially refused to hand over Albert Pujols' historic 2,000th RBI.
