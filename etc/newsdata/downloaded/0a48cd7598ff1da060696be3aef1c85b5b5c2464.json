The analysis shows only a fifth of these companies will remain on track by 2050 and more than a quarter are likely to push temperatures up by at least 2.7C.\n\nUS companies tell Apple and Amazon to put planet before profits Read more\n\nThis trend is more pronounced in the world\u2019s 200 largest listed companies. Almost two-thirds of the G20are expected to be on track to limit global heating to 1.5C by 2030, but \u2013 without drastic steps to reduce emissions \u2013 this number will plummet to 18% by 2050.\n\nChristiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change, said the temperature score report \u201chas the potential to be a major force for change\u201d.\n\nThe scores were published for the first time on Tuesday before the publication of a report from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report is expected to say that without urgent action, humanity faces unprecedented risks from fast-rising sea levels, threatening coastal cities and causing the displacement of hundreds of millions.\n\nFigueres said: \u201cWe have a small but certain window of opportunity to make all the necessary efforts to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C, and thereby contribute to a safer, more productive, more socially inclusive and prosperous world.\u201d", "description": "Only a fifth of the companies will remain on track, according to analysis of their disclosures", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0ddcb9f21c70ff3e1de3bd4733475360eed279/0_123_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8405945a022938dd6e2331d8aac424b8", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
