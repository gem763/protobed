Desperate to know that Ruby Bergold was fine, Jardine started leaving messages with Paula Bergold, who lived down the street from her mother. Ruby Bergold never called Jardine back, according to court documents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPaula Bergold finally responded to Jardine\u2019s message when she expressed concern about the woman still being alive. She said her mother was fine and still living in the house. She denied Jardine\u2019s request to see her mother on Sept. 6, claiming that her mother didn\u2019t want to see anyone.\n\nUnconvinced, Jardine called Ruby Bergold\u2019s nephew, who requested that authorities perform a welfare check. Police had responded to two similar calls on Sept. 12 and 13, where they observed several small loose mothballs on the ground, according to the report.\n\nA woman mistook wasabi for avocado. The shock led to \u2018broken heart syndrome.\u2019\n\nMarinette County Sheriff Jerry Sauve said welfare checks involve looking at a person\u2019s mailbox and noticing what can be seen through windows.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen officers went they could see mail had been brought in. They weren\u2019t overly suspicious,\u201d he said in a telephone interview with The Washington Post, adding that groceries had even been brought in the house.\n\nAD\n\nJardine went to her neighbor\u2019s home on Sept. 12 to chop down weeds, which she regularly did for the elderly woman, and to check around the property, according to the report. Jardine had told authorities that she always knew when the woman was home because she could hear her TV or radio. But this time, she heard nothing.\n\nShe yelled into a window, hoping for Ruby Bergold to respond. She heard nothing.\n\nPaula Bergold showed up that day and told Jardine she could discontinue the yard work she had been doing for her mother. Paula Bergold seemed fine with Jardine\u2019s plan to see Ruby Bergold on Sept. 17, but when that day arrived Jardine was greeted with a note at the door that read \u201cRuby has gone out of town to visit some friends of ours,\u201d signed by Paula Bergold. Jardine called police.\n\nAD\n\nDeputies found more notes taped to a window and doors.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the responding officers caught a faint whiff of decay, an odor his years of training and experience had taught him was from a dead body. The scent was drifting outside, but officers couldn\u2019t trace its origin.\n\n\u201cAnyone that\u2019s been in law enforcement for some time, when you smell that, it stays in your brain, and you can\u2019t get that smell out,\u201d Sauve said. \u201cThat smell stays with you.\u201d\n\nThe moth balls that were previously seen had deteriorated.\n\nPolice continued to investigate the home from the outside, seeing several fresh packets of moth balls set up near each of the entry doors and newer handwritten notes on the counter tops, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nAD\n\nPaula Bergold arrived a short time later, telling deputies that her mom was out of town and declining ways that they could reach her. She gave deputies keys to enter the home but told them her mother would not be there.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of finding the woman, they found a recliner chair covered with a blanket, large amounts of Borax detergent caked on the carpeted floor and a red-colored walker in front of the recliner, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nClothes on hangers indicated that someone had not gone on a long trip. The basement had multiple containers of bleach, ammonia and bags of unopened barn lime. The faint odor of decay could be smelled in the basement, according to the report.\n\nAD\n\nSauve said the cleaning agents can be very effective in getting rid of odor.\n\nOfficers photographed the home and later told a detective of their disturbing sightings.\n\nPaula Bergold later admitted to a detective that her mother had died and that her body was in the house.\n\nShe said her disabled grandson would have no caretaker after she dies. So she killed him, police say.\n\nShe said she couldn\u2019t bring herself to call police when she discovered her mother\u2019s dead body in the same reclining chair police saw covered with a blanket.\n\nAD\n\nWhen her mother\u2019s decomposing body started smelling, she placed it in a plastic tub and dragged it down to the basement. The medical examiner later confirmed the body to be Ruby Bergold\u2019s based on the serial number of the pacemaker found inside her body, according to court documents.\n\nAD\n\nPaula Bergold, who served as her mother\u2019s power of attorney, confessed that she had been living off her mother\u2019s income of Social Security checks, stocks and dividends from her father\u2019s retirement. Her father had set up a trust for all the money and residences that were controlled by the bank. The money, she said, played a role in her decision not to report her mother\u2019s death, according to court documents.\n\nShe made her first appearance via video conference on Monday, where bail was set at $10,000. Her next court appearance will be Oct. 7, according to public records. If she\u2019s found guilty on all three counts, she faces up to 13 years in prison and $36,000 in fines.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not only a very unusual case for us, it\u2019s a sad case,\u201d Sauve said. \u201cThe dignity of the deceased was not honored.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAbortion doctor had more than 2,000 fetal remains at his home.

His parents are feared dead.\n\nAD", "description": "The elderly woman had not been seen since May.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Va0Y1EdCYbOBvndtYBNZk3xqg6M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BS5C65ERKNDFDJSOL6LLJZYEZU.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
