It will become even more important as telecoms roll out their blazing-fast 5G networks, which enable near-instantaneous communication alongside complementary wireless protocols that let companies monitor assets scattered around the world.\n\n5G and other next-generation networks can allow telecoms to become the key partner in enterprise connectivity, where they previously were one among many. But telecoms aren't uncontested in trying to take advantage of the growing opportunity in enabling enterprise transformation: Cloud, software, and technology vendors are also out for the market, setting the stage for a clash of titans between two connectivity models that will reign in different industry verticals.\n\nIn the Connectivity B2B Ecosystem Report, Business Insider Intelligence unpacks the enterprise telecommunications ecosystem at the cusp of the 5G era. First, we highlight the ways that companies employ telecommunications technology in business, both today and in the near future with 5G. Next, we look at the various types of companies involved in the wider ecosystem and explore the relationships between these company archetypes. Then, we examine the players involved in these relationships and look at specific efforts and initiatives that are driving change and transforming the companies involved. Finally, we look to some of the key trends that will define the next decade of B2B telecommunications.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nNumerous multibillion dollar opportunities exist in enterprise connectivity services, including in verticals like heavy industry and manufacturing, the connected car market, and healthcare.\n\nTelecoms and tech companies headline the two competing models \u2014 tech-centric and connectivity-centric \u2014 for the focal point of the data-based services that burgeoning connectivity will support.\n\nAcquisitions, foundries, corporate partnerships, and developer outreach are some of the key tactics companies can explore to drive new sources of revenue in enterprise connectivity.\n\nTelecoms won't attain dominance in every sector \u2014 they need to gauge their capabilities and their competition on a range of factors before deciding whether to compete in a segment.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nIdentifies the key types of companies involved in the enterprise connectivity ecosystem.\n\nHighlights some of the leading companies in the different segments of the ecosystem.\n\nBreaks down the leading models in the connectivity space and explains what conditions should dictate how the companies involved should approach it.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: Amazon, Arm, Artik, Arundo Analytics, AT&T, C3 IoT, Cisco, Dell, Ericsson, Everactive, GE, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hitachi, Honeywell, Huawei, IBM, Intel, MediaTek, Microsoft, Nokia, Nvidia, Oracle, Particle, PTC, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Samsung, SAP, Semtech, Siemens, Sierra Wireless, Sigfox, Splunk, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
