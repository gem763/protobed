You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people... The big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us,' Warren said.\n\n'But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it.'\n\nBiden responded by saying: 'I agreed with the great job she did and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight too.'\n\nWarren paused briefly before firing back and thanking President Obama.\n\n'I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,' she said.\n\nHer jab warranted a laugh from Biden before he interrupted her to say: 'You did a hell of a job in your job'.\n\nIt also prompted several hilarious responses and memes on social media from those watching at home.", "description": "Senator Elizabeth Warren has been hailed on social media for her veiled 'Obama' jab at former Vice President Joe Biden during the Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/06/19774062-0-image-a-76_1571204411918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
