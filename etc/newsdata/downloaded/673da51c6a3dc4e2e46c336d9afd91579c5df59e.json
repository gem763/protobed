And somewhere around the second flight of stairs down I slipped. I felt my foot go out from under me,\" she said.\n\n\"Honestly, it was the worst fall I've had in a while. I [tore] through both knees of my pants.... I have bruises everywhere. It was unpleasant at best. And there were people slipping all over the place.\"\n\nI have bruises everywhere. It was unpleasant at best. And there were people slipping all over the place. - Yana Brion\n\nAccording to Brion, the thin gripping material on the stair tiles isn't enough to keep people from falling.\n\n\"That's not going to help. The entire rest of the stairs is slippery. Those tiles, they're slippery enough when they're dry,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know if it's safe, really, considering that we live in Ottawa. It snows for half the year. People are going to track that snow inside.\"\n\nSlippery slopes\n\nDawn Xanklin saw the same slippery situation unfolding at Parliament station on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"I saw a middle-aged woman ... slip and hit the stairs hard. At least four of us ran forward and asked if she needed help. She was fairly insistent that she was OK even though she seemed to have hit the edge of the stairs,\" Xanklin said.\n\n\"It wasn't overcrowded, it didn't look like she was pushed, but she slipped close to where a yellow [caution] sign had been placed.\"\n\nA commuter walks down the wet steps at Parliament station Tuesday evening. (Paul Jay/CBC)\n\nMoments later, as she approached the entry gates to the trains, Xanklin said she saw a man wearing dress shoes slip and almost fall as he hurried toward the gates.\n\n\"This is not OK,\" said Xanklin, who thinks the flooring at other stations are less slippery than the tiles at Parliament and Lyon.\n\nTransit commissioner weighs in\n\nSarah Wright-Gilbert, one of the citizen commissioners on the city's transit commission, has been tweeting about her own LRT experiences since taking the volunteer position.\n\nAfter seeing Brion's tweet about the Lyon station situation, Wright-Gilbert retweeted it, writing that \"something needs to be done.\"\n\nSomething needs to be done to ensure customer safety. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OC_Transpo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OC_Transpo</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HVaWM3oqIa\">https://t.co/HVaWM3oqIa</a> \u2014@sarahmeaghang\n\nIn September, Wright-Gilbert spoke to CBC News about her concerns with how OC Transpo is handling communications.\n\n\"There's not a lot of trust left in the transit system, and as a result I think that if we continue with this lack of communication we will see a further erosion in the ridership numbers,\" Wright-Gilbert said at the time.\n\nThe city was not able to supply a response to CBC Ottawa's interview request by publication time.\n\nCapital Coun. Shawn Menard, a member of the city's transportation committee, said OC Transpo is looking into the reports.", "description": "Some commuter are expressing concern about the slick floor tiles at two Confederation Line stations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334486.1571952631!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/steps-at-lrt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
