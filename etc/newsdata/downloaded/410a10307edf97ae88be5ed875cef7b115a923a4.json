Now, I'm able to finish getting coats. He's awesome. I really love him. I really appreciate everything he did for me.\"\n\nMr Zimmermann said: \"I'm a father myself, I have three kids. I thought of my kids jumping around. What if a car hit them and they flew and got seriously hurt, if not killed?\"\n\nMs Jackson told the cop she was not able to get her car properly registered because of her financial situation.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Milwaukee Police Department praised the officer for his act of kindness.\n\nThe department said: \"The officer observed that the children in the car were not properly restrained and took it upon himself to purchase two car seats for her.\n\n\u201cThank you Officer Zimmermann for going the extra mile and going above and beyond your call of duty.\u201d", "description": "Milwaukee cop Kevin Zimmermann bought child car seats for a mum after she told him she could not afford any", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746356.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-000733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
