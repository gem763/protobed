But the full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it will hear the case again, with all the judges sitting.\n\nIt scheduled oral argument for Dec. 12.\n\nNews of the Trump Organization\u2019s interest also comes days after the White House said it planned to host the Group of Seven nations meetings at Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Florida.\n\nFacing withering criticism, Mr. Trump canceled the plan about 48 hours later.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
