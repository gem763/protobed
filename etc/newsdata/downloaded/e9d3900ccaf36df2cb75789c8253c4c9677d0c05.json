Said another way, at the end of September 2018, investors were about as enthusiastic about stocks as they\u2019d been in 30 years.\n\nAnd though investors had taken a few hits along the way \u2014 the 1,000-point declines in February 2018 that followed the implosion of short volatility strategies stand out \u2014 the post-election rally was largely intact as the fourth quarter of 2018 commenced.\n\nThe S&P 500 was up 32% from the 2016 election. The market was just over two weeks removed from record highs. Corporations were still enjoying the benefits of tax cuts. And few were warning about the risks of a global recession.\n\nAnd then on October 3, 2018, Powell said the Fed was a \"long way from neutral,\" implying that even after having raised rates three times in 2018, many more hikes were in store. This poor choice of words from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent the stock market careening into its worst fourth quarter and worst overall year since 2008. After a December 2018 interest rate hike and the market's ultimate low reached on Christmas Eve, investors witnessed a policy backtracking from the Fed that continues today.\n\nJust when investors started to believe in the market again, they got burned. And so while investors have spent all of this year bailing out of stocks, inflows to bonds and cash have been sizable. Over $430 billion has moved into cash so far this year while bonds have seen $353 billion worth of inflows over that period.\n\nAnd over the last 12 months, the picture is even worse for equity outflows and inflows to safe havens \u2014 $592 billion has gone into cash, $259 billion into bonds, and $173 billion out of stocks over the last year. Kostin notes that this is the widest gap between equity fund flows relative to cash and bonds during a 12-month window since 2008.\n\nOver the last year, money has been rushing out of stocks at the fastest pace relative to bonds and cash in over a decade, according to data from Goldman Sachs. (Source: Goldman Sachs Investment Research) More\n\nWith just two months left in the decade, the stock market and the economy appear set to enter a new decade with post-crisis bull runs and expansions intact. In Kostin's view, however, this won't be enough to see investors get more enthused about buying stocks in the year ahead.\n\n\"Positive equity market returns, rising interest rates, and stabilizing U.S. and World GDP growth should support already-elevated equity exposures,\" Kostin writes. \"However, high uncertainty, investor fears of a recession, and low starting cash allocations will likely limit a significant increase in equity allocations.\"\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
