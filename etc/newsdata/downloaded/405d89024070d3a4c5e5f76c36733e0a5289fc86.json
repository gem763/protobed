For nearly 20 years, World Wrestling Entertainment has been the be-all and end-all of the wrestling world. Enter All Elite Wrestling (AEW), a hungry new startup backed by Shad Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nKhan joined Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cAll Markets Summit: Generational Opportunities\u201d to talk about the future of sports ownership and AEW, whose CEO is Khan\u2019s son, Tony Kahn, a former NFL executive.\n\n\u201cIt all started with my son Tony. It was his idea, his passion, his drive as a lifelong wrestling fan \u2014 so I\u2019ve supported him financially. He kept talking about it, that we ought to do it, and here are the reasons why we should do it. I kept stress testing the idea, and then I struck a check to fund it because if you\u2019re going to do it, it\u2019s gotta be right. That was the most important thing. You don\u2019t get a second chance to make a first impression, but his idea, his passion, and his drive, and it\u2019s off to a great start.\u201d\n\nThe premiere episode of AEW Dynamite on Oct. 2 averaged 1,409,000 total viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. AEW even beat out rival WWE\u2019s NXT, which pulled in an average of 891,000 total viewers during the same time slot.\n\nKhan tells Yahoo Finance that AEW is focusing more on building its brand than competing against WWE. \u201cWWE is a great company, but we are not here competing with them. In the golden age of wrestling during the late \u201890s, there were 10 million fans. Now It\u2019s down to 2 million. So we\u2019re tapping into fans who were not engaged and quite frankly the younger fan who never got quite into it. Competition is good for everybody, but it\u2019s very important for AEW to do our own thing.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 04: (L-R) Cody Rhodes and Chris Jericho face off at the All Elite Wrestling panel during 2019 New York Comic Con at Jacob Javits Center on October 04, 2019 in New York City.

His point to me was that the big difference here is there\u2019s a huge amount of talent that\u2019s on the street. Whereas in football and the NFL, the top talent is already there.\u201d\n\nAEW is partnering with AT&T\u2019S (T) WarnerMedia on a multi-platform launch of its new weekly wrestling program, Dynamite, which airs on TNT Wednesdays at 8 p.m.\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
