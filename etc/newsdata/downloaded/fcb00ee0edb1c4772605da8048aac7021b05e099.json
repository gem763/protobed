In the PSA, Trebek points out that cancer still only has an abysmal single-digit, five-year survival rate (2-9%) in most countries. He\u2019s joined 80 organizations from 30 countries to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms.\n\n\u201cI wished I had known sooner that the persistent stomach pain I experienced before my diagnosis was a symptom of pancreatic cancer,\u201d Trebek says in the announcement, adding that other common symptoms include \u201cmid-back pain, unexplained weight loss and the yellowing of the skin or eyes.\u201d\n\nRamona Rosales More\n\nAccording to the organization\u2019s release, the reason it has the lowest survival rate among all major cancers is because so few people know the risks and symptoms, and are thus diagnosed at an advanced stage. Each day, more than 1,284 people worldwide die from the disease, and better progress starts with early detection \u2014 the problem is, many of the symptoms can be vague and incorrectly attributed to less serious conditions.\n\nAccording to the organization, because there is still no screening test for pancreatic cancer, if you are experiencing one or more of the above persistent symptoms that Trebek mentions, you should absolutely mention pancreatic cancer to your healthcare provider, because \u201cpatients diagnosed at an earlier stage when surgery is an option are more likely to live five years and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn World Pancreatic Cancer Day, we unite as a global movement to advocate for early detection and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients,\u201d said Julie Fleshman, JD, MBA, WPCC chair. \u201cBy raising awareness of pancreatic cancer risks and symptoms, we hope that people will be aware and alert their doctor sooner when there is more opportunity for intervention.\u201d\n\nTrebek and WPCD ask that the world join him in raising awareness by wearing purple this November 21, and sharing the hashtag #WPCD on social media, or tagging @worldpancreticcancerday that day on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. You can also ask your public health officials to support more government funding for pancreatic cancer research.\n\n\u201cTogether, we can get it done,\u201d says Trebek.\n\nGo to worldpancreaticcancerday.org for more information, useful resources and links to pancreatic cancer organizations in your country/region.", "description": "Alex Trebek Releases New PSA to Raise Pancreatic Cancer Awareness", "authors": ["Gillian Telling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JjanNuNaQklbE_YyqTghMA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/d59d65b7742ff4993dbe9c3cfa10a1e6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
