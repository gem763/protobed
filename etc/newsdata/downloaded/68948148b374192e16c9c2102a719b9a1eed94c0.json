A fitting number for the occasion. But only one can lay claim to the strangest occurrence of the evening.\n\nWhile pitching against the Oakland Athletics in the eighth inning, Texas Rangers right-hander Shawn Kelley shocked fans by launching a baseball into the second deck behind home plate at Globe Life Park.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe toss was not out of anger or frustration, which was what prompted current Cincinnati Reds pitcher Trevor Bauer to launch a baseball over the center field fence during his final start with the Cleveland Indians. It wasn\u2019t even due to lack of command on the hill.\n\nKelley didn\u2019t really mean to throw it halfway to the moon. It just sorta happened after the batter, Mark Canha, was granted timeout halfway through his pitching motion.\n\nThere was no turning back then.\n\nPitchers really don\u2019t appreciate a late timeout call. It\u2019s been at the center of spats before between pitcher and batter, as well as pitcher and umpire. It can be an added strain on the arm if they don\u2019t follow through and release the ball. On the flip side, following through and releasing the ball during a timeout can be dangerous for the hitter, catcher and umpire.\n\nSome pitchers hold the ball. Others spike it. In this instance, Kelley just let it go and got the best distance we\u2019ve ever seen on a pitch that wasn\u2019t.\n\nTexas Rangers' pitcher Shawn Kelley tossed one halfway to the moon.

He was one of only two Rangers pitchers to post a scoreless outing in Friday\u2019s game, which the Rangers lost 14-9.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt did, however, remind us of two things that are always true in baseball.\n\nThe first, you should always keep your eyes on the field. You never know when or how a baseball will come in your direction.\n\nThe other...\n\nAngel Hernandez would\u2019ve still called that a strike \u2014 SadDodgersFan\ud83e\udd7a (@innocentfernie_) September 14, 2019\n\nBaseball fans will never miss an opportunity to take jabs at umpire Angel Hernandez.\n\nNever.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Texas Rangers' pitcher Shawn Kelley tossed one halfway to the moon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/f4ogjl7gkkRnJc6iKBVXuA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fG7WwrRtexaWPwluwZj17g--~B/aD0yODAyO3c9NDk4MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/826be340-d6a4-11e9-afef-429073eb10b0", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
