No margin of error was provided as of the time of publication.\n\nThe survey reports that overall, 58% of Americans held favorable opinions of capitalism in 2019, down 3% from 2018\u2019s figure of 61%. However, only 49% of members of Generation Z (16-22) and 50% of the Millennial generation see capitalism favorably.\n\nAt the same time, socialism became less favorable overall in 2019, dropping from 42% favorability in the 2018 poll to 36% favorability this year. Moreover, Generation Z saw favorability drop from 48% to 40%, while Millennials only saw a drop of 1%, from 50% to 49%.\n\n36% of Millennials view communism favorably, up 8% from 2018; 35% of Millennials see Marxism favorably, up 6% from 2018.\n\nThe survey adds: \u201c50% of Millennials say they are \u2018somewhat likely\u2019 and 20% of Millennials say they are \u2018extremely likely\u2019 to vote for a socialist candidate, doubling from 10% in 2018, Americans overall are more hesitant about voting for a \u2018democratic socialist\u2019 than they were last year (53% \u2018never\u2019 or \u2018hesitant\u2019 in 2019 versus 47% in 2018).\u201d\n\nMany Millennials came of age during the global financial crisis \u2014 and the election of President Barack Obama.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is the most well-known \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d presidential candidates, though several of his fellow contenders for the Democratic Party presidential nomination have embraced socialist policies such as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (including those arriving in the country illegally) and the so-called \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d\n\nMore respondents (27%) named President Donald Trump the \u201cbiggest threat to world peace\u201d than any other leader.\n\nThe survey\u2019s full results will be released later on Monday; only some of the data were public as of this writing.\n\nJoel B.
