Biden, a Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter Biden. Mr. Trump denied the accusation and released the call transcript in response.\n\nMr. Wallace said the White House\u2019s transcript of the call lined up with the whistleblower\u2019s complaints and blasted the president for calling him a \u201cspy.\u201d\n\nWhen Mrs. Smith responded by pointing to \u201cmajor inconsistencies\u201d between the complaint and the transcript and knocked the fact that military spending wasn\u2019t discussed on the call, Mr. Wallace asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t think dirt on the vice president and his son\u2019s activities would be of value to a president seeking reelection?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is clear from reading the complaint is that it is a serious allegation,\u201d Mr. Wallace continued.\n\n\u201cA lot of it has proven to be borne out already. The whistleblower lays out a blueprint for talking to various officials in the White House, various officials in the State Department. And to dismiss this as a political hack seems to me to be an effort by the president\u2019s defenders to make nothing out of something. And there is something here,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr. Wallace didn\u2019t name who \u201cthe president\u2019s defenders\u201d are, many of Fox News\u2019 prime-time hosts have dismissed allegations that the president committed any wrongdoing and defended him against the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nMr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
