According to the scientists, the Garlock fault has slipped two centimetres at the surface since July.\n\nThe Garlock fault is in a precarious location that makes it capable of producing magnitude 8 quakes. If Garlock starts quaking, it could shake nearby oil and agriculture regions in California, as well as military bases, the Los Angeles Times notes.\n\nThe researchers used seismometer data and satellite observations to document the earthquake sequence and the Garlock fault\u2019s creep. The bulge in the land caused by the fault was visible from space.\n\n\u201cThis is surprising, because we\u2019ve never seen the Garlock fault do anything. Here, all of a sudden, it changed its behavior,\u201d Zachary Ross, the lead author of the study and assistant professor of geophysics at Caltech, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\n\nThe finding further destabilizes a myth that smaller earthquakes prevent the Big One from happening. In fact, it supports the opposite conclusion: that localized quakes can disrupt faults, creating more risk for bigger quakes along them.\n\nA quake that hits 8 on the Richter scale could be catastrophic. The 1985 earthquake that devastated Mexico City was an 8, and it caused widespread destruction. But gathering more information about how and why big quakes occur could help predict the next one before it happens.", "description": "The Garlock fault could produce a magnitude 8 earthquake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9e188fbf646000a37dfa8/lede/1571414411081-GettyImages-640372861.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
