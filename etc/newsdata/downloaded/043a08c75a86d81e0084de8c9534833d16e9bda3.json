The provision is meant to prevent government officials from receiving benefits and gifts from foreign interests.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue they are being financially harmed when foreign and domestic government officials go to the Trump-owned establishments instead of their own places of business. The suit is seeking to force the president to divest from the Trump Organization.\n\n\u201cThe complaint sufficiently alleges that plaintiffs compete directly with Trump establishments and that the president\u2019s allegedly illegal acts favor plaintiffs\u2019 competitors,\u201d Judge Pierre N. Leval, a Clinton appointee, wrote for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe 2-1 decision revives the lawsuit and sends it back to the district court for further review.\n\nJudge John M. Walker, a Reagan appointee, dissented, saying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims should have been dismissed. He also cautioned courts to avoid the legal conflict since it\u2019s highly political.\n\n\u201cThis case is deeply political and thus finds itself in an area where federal courts ought to tread lightly,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cPresident Trump was democratically elected by the American people \u2014 and he was elected with his business holdings and brand prominence in full view.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd Circuit\u2019s decision contrasts the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by attorneys general in a Maryland court in July.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
