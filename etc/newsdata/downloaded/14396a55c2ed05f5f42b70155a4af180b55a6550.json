The decision appears to leave US-backed Kurdish forces there in jeopardy, which Turkey has labelled as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn apparent response to that criticism, Mr Trump pledged to destroy Turkey's economy if it steps over the line, and cited what he called his \"great and unmatched wisdom\" for knowing just where that line is.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The US has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Other prominent supporters of the president, including senator Marco Rubio and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, also denounced Mr Trump's decision.\n\n\"This impulsive decision by the President has undone all the gains we've made, thrown the region into further chaos. Iran is licking their chops. And, if I'm an Isis fighter I've got a second lease on life. So to those who think Isis has been defeated you will soon see,\" Mr Graham said during an interview on \"Fox and Friends\".\n\nThe decision to allow Turkey to go ahead with its military offensive in Northern Syria marks at least the second time that Mr Trump has considered pulling back US involvement in the region even further.\n\nLate last year, Mr Trump proposed removing all US forces from Syria, citing success in the battle against Isis. But, he ultimately decided to keep military presence there, amid backlash from the American foreign policy establishment in Washington.\n\nIn addition to Mr Graham speaking out, the president's recent decision has been derided by Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who served as a Marine in the Iraq war.\n\n\"Allowing Turkey to move into northern Syria is one of the most destabilizing moves we can do in the Middle East,\" Mr Gallego wrote on Twitter Sunday evening. \"The Kurds will never trust America again. They will look for new alliances or independence to protect themselves.\"\n\nAmerican backed Kurdish forces were also surprised by the White House's announcement, with the Syrian Defence Forces \u2014 a largely Kurdish militia \u2014 releasing a statement claiming they had done their part in working to reudce tensions with Turkey, but that the United States had not held up its end of the bargain.\n\nThe statement continued, warning that Turkey's planned military action could endanger progress made in the wake of the fight against Isis.", "description": "Donald Trump has threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" Turkey's economy\u00a0if the country does anything that he does not like in Syria, amid criticism from Republicans over new US policy allowing the Turkish military to take over in the war-torn country.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/12/Donald-Trump-Turkey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
