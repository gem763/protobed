The investigation would take about a month, Ardern said, and she would make no decisions on Haworth\u2019s future until the final report was delivered.\n\nIn a statement Haworth denied the alleged victim\u2019s account, and said neither he nor the acting general secretary, Dianna Lacy, were ever told of a sexual assault allegation against the staffer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty Images\n\nArdern said on Monday the staffer in question had been working from home for the past five weeks, and that no one in parliament house should feel unsafe, a message reiterated by the speaker of the House, Trevor Mallard.\n\nThe 19-year-old told the Spinoff that inaction by senior party figures had left her feeling \u201cangry, quite fearful and desperate\u201d.\n\nShe is reportedly one of seven people to have complained about the Labour staffer. The staffer was cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal Labour investigation, and has faced no disciplinary action.\n\n\u201cWe went through this whole thing, saying over and over again the stories of what happened, his abuse of power, and we were just stuck,\u201d the victim told the Spinoff website. \u201cThere was this whole room of people that were just acting like they were all family members again and nobody wants to talk about the guy who has been accused of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the Labour party has been accused of negligence regarding accusations of sexual assault. At a young Labour summer camp in 2018, a 21-year-old attendee was charged with groping and inappropriately touching and kissing four other attendees after excessive drinking. The case is before the courts.\n\nPaula Bennett, deputy leader of the opposition National party, has criticised Labour\u2019s handling of assault allegations, and said it had let down victims and left them feeling powerless and scared.\n\nPaula Bennett (@paulabennettmp) At least today the PM admitted there may have been sexual assaults for the first time. I know it\u2019s not much but these victims just want some acknowledgement\n\nBennett said she had been contacted by a number of the staffer\u2019s alleged victims, after they felt their concerns were not being taken seriously by the party.\n\nNew Zealand Police have been contacted for comment.", "description": "PM says she found out allegation against party staffer was of a sexual nature only from reading media report", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24ea87580f00235b86ad4a6a49b033622a294b45/0_143_5545_3327/master/5545.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11a5f83fe19c6d097a98dea212dd2ac5", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
