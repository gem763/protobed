Suspending the 15-year-old from school over her actions \"sends a dangerous message to people nationwide,\" she said.\n\nBut attorney Melissa Hewey, who represents the high school a few miles outside of Portland, said administrators believe Mansmann was targeting an individual \u2014 and delivering a message that the school isn't safe.\n\nThere were far better ways to address her concerns about sexual assault, Hewey said. For starters, she should've addressed her concerns to an adult in the school instead of posting a note in student bathroom.\n\n\"If you're going to advocate, you advocate in appropriate manner. You don't post a sticky note,\" she said.\n\nMansmann was suspended for violating the high school's anti-bullying policy, but she hasn't yet served the suspension. Two other students also were suspended but haven't come forward. It's unclear if they accepted their punishments.\n\nAfter the note was posted, the rumor mill spun out of control. A male student who thought he'd been singled out missed eight days of school because he felt unsafe.\n\nIn the end, the high school conducted 47 interviews, and Principal Jeffrey Shedd said the school was safe. He said Mansmann and the two others who were suspended meant well but made \"made a really bad choice.\"", "description": "A high school activist's comment about rape posted on a bathroom mirror represents constitutionally protected free speech \u2014 and punishing her would discourage young victims from coming forward, an attorney said Monday.
