(Or did they break up at all?) Per Rolling Stone, the synth-tastic \u201cYour Capricious Soul\u201d can be downloaded on Stipe\u2019s official website for a cool 77 cents, or, if you\u2019re feeling cheap, can also be listened to in the below video. \u201cI took a long break from music, and I wanted to jump back in,\u201d Stipe said in a statement. \u201cI want to add my voice to this exciting shift in consciousness.\u201d Beards, though, are not welcome.", "description": "R.E.M.\u2019s Michael Stipe released his first solo song, called \u2018Your Capricious Soul,\u2019 after taking a few year off from music.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/28/5-michael.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
