Mark Sanford on Sunday announced he will challenge Donald Trump for the Republican Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination becoming the third member of his party to do so.\n\nSanford told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d he believes the GOP needs to have a conversation about what it means to be a Republican, adding, \u201cWe have lost our way.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe former governor, who was also a congressman from 1995 to 2001 and 2013 to 2019, highlighted a need to discuss the country\u2019s ballooning debt and deficits, as well as Trump\u2019s turn toward trade protectionism.\n\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of the Republican Party and the conservative movement has always been: How much do we spend?\u201d Sanford said, offering a nod to the famed University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman.\n\nThe candidate also said he wants to shine a light on how \u201cinstitutions and political culture are being damaged by this president.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It may be newsworthy, but it\u2019s not leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve some of the profound problems we have as Americans by tweet.\u201d\n\nSanford expressed regret for the 2009 incident in which he, then a married governor, vanished for several days. One of his aides told inquiring reporters that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, but he was in Argentina visiting his girlfriend, Maria Belen Chapur.\n\nHe said he has learned from his mistakes and cited his South Carolina apology tour, which led to his return to the House of Representatives in 2013. \u201cI profoundly apologize for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the Christian model of repentance.\u201d\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois are also running against Trump.\n\nSanford will have to pursue his battle against Trump without help from his home-state voters: South Carolina Republicans just canceled their 2020 presidential primary.\n\nThis article tagged under: Mark Sanford", "description": "He says the party needs to examine where it is going.", "authors": ["Victoria Guida"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a7/06/627670fd4de4874c187bddd78e4c/19090819-mark-sanford-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
