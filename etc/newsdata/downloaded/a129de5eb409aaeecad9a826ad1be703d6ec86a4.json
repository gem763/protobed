Where is the server? I want to see the server.\u201d\n\nThere is no DNC server. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack into DNC emails and turned its findings over to the FBI. Trump brought up CrowdStrike and the server in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the memo about the call released by the White House, Trump said, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,\u201d followed by an ellipsis, followed by \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nTrump and his fellow conspiracy theorists on the right believe that the server would contain evidence proving that Russia wasn\u2019t responsible for the hack. (CrowdStrike found that Russia was responsible, as did special counsel Robert Mueller.) The impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine into pursuing his theory about the server and investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nPresident Trump searches for a computer server.

The administration subsumes the server myth and Biden\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian government in 2016 under the rubric of \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d said Mulvaney in a press briefing last week about his conversations with Ukrainian officials. \u201cAbsolutely. No question about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo,\u201d asked a reporter, seeking clarification that Mulvaney had just admitted to the basis of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt is: Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d said Mulvaney.\n\nNeither CrowdStrike nor Ukraine has the server because the investigation was done through forensic replicas of the DNC hard drives called \u201cimaging,\u201d not looking at a physical server. CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian-based company \u2014 it was co-founded by an American citizen who emigrated from Russia \u2014 and people associated with the firm are baffled and infuriated by Trump\u2019s insinuations. Robert Johnston, a former CrowdStrike investigator who worked on the probe into the hacking of the DNC, told the Washington Post that Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is absolute babbling to the president of Ukraine,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to finger exactly which conspiracy theory he\u2019s subscribing to. But none of them have any grounding in reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve repeatedly stated, we stand by the findings and analysis of our investigation, and, as detailed in our company statement, we\u2019ve provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI as requested,\u201d said CrowdStrike in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, our findings have been supported by the U.S. intelligence community and other cybersecurity companies.\u201d\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t the only one pushing the theory on cable news this week.
