ITV 2/76 Amber\u2019s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.

Despite this, Joe\u2019s jealous moping eventually won out. ITV 5/76 Anton\u2019s unique seduction techniques The confident Scotsman\u2019s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic.

ITV 10/76 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn\u2019t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth. ITV 11/76 Tommy convinces himself he made an omelette Encouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.)

ITV 12/76 Yewande\u2019s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa \u2013 until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny.

ITV 16/76 Anton\u2019s bad chat gets worse With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful \u2018on the inside\u2019. He thought the chat went well; a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. ITV 17/76 Tommy\u2019s romantic meal Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. \u201cI\u2019ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,\u201d he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura\u2019s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. ITV 18/76 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. \u201cConfident sh*ts,\u201d fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.

ITV 22/76 Maura gets a rise out of Tommy Maura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed.

Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly\u2026 ITV 23/76 Maura\u2019s infamous kisses Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.

ITV 31/76 Maura is livid at Tom Maura\u2019s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was \u201call mouth.\u201d Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards. ITV 32/76 Yewande leaves the island Danny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton.

She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation. ITV 34/76 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate moment After declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season\u2019s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the \u00a350k?

Over in the villa, Curtis was crediting their time apart for a very different realisation: that their relationship had serious issues, and he might not be totally into her. Yikes. ITV 45/76 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor\u2026 Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her \u2013 although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work.

He doesn\u2019t!\u201d ITV 49/76 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him \u2013 again After Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she\u2019s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor.

ITV 56/76 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposal Tommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn\u2019t Tommy\u2019s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.

ITV 68/76 The Sidebar of Shame challenge rocks some couples Islanders learned that newspaper headlines called Maura and Curtis\u2019 relationship \u201cstaged,\u201d that India was accused faking her affection for Ovie, and that \u201cbored\u201d Molly-Mae was accused faking both her love for Tommy and her happiness for Maura and Curtis. Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley. ITV 69/76 Jordan goes on a kamikaze mission Despite having asked Anna to be his girlfriend only two days before, Jordan decided his emerging romantic feelings for India were too powerful to ignore. On the advice of Curtis, he pulled India aside and began to confess his feelings, before Anna stormed over ready to give him a piece of his mind. Was it worth it? Well, Jordan found out that India definitely just sees him as a \u201cmate.\u201d Ouch. ITV 70/76 Anna goes nuclear It didn\u2019t take long before Anna was giving Jordan a dressing down, joined by Maura and Amber who were equally ready to lay into the lothario. \u201cYou ask a girl to be your girlfriend and the two days later you were hitting on her?\u201d Anna yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful for her to be sitting over there like a god damned mug!\u201d Amber added. \u201cYou\u2019re a f*cking liar,\u201d shouted Maura for good measure. ITV 71/76 Curtis lands in hot water Curtis caught a lot of flak for advising Jordan to tell India how he feels without speaking to Anna first. Aside from some harsh words from Maura, Anna sat him down and told him he was a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d saying \u201cyou move like you\u2019re such a good person, but you\u2019re not\u201d.

ITV 75/76 Anton and Belle get dumped before the final Poor Anton. He didn't have much luck during Love Island, and even his relationship with Belle seemed pretty bland. But it was still a surprise \u2013 if only to him \u2013 when the couple were voted off by the public in the penultimate episode. \"We're fine,\" he'd whispered confidently to Belle before the results were announced. Reader, they were not. ITV 76/76 Amber and Greg pull of a shock victory Was it Greg's love poem in which he praised Amber's butt? Was it because he can twerk up a wall? Was it the fact that he is simply not Michael? Whatever it was, the public warmed to Amber and Greg so much that they overlooked the fact that they had known each other for two weeks and crowned them winners of Love Island 2019. Bookie favourites Molly Mae and Tommy managed second place, with Ovie and India coming third and Curtis and Maura in fourth place. ITV 1/76 Lucie trying - and failing - to make \u2018bev\u2019 happen Love Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie\u2019s firm insistence that \u2018bev\u2019 means a hot man failed to catch on.
