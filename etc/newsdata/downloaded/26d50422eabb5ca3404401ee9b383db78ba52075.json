REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nPeter Magombeyi, president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA), was one of the organisers of an ongoing strike to demand higher wages for state doctors because of soaring living costs, before he disappeared on Saturday night.\n\nZHDA represents mainly junior doctors at public hospitals.\n\nHis colleagues have alleged he was abducted by the security services in an attempt to break the strike, which has disrupted healthcare services in hospitals, but a senior information ministry official denied the government was responsible.\n\nRights groups accused the government of abducting activists in the lead-up to planned opposition protests last month, when the government also denied responsibility.\n\nMnangagwa\u2019s government has said it will not use excessive force against protesters after being criticised over its heavy-handed response to post-election violence last year and protests over fuel price hikes this year.\n\nDoctors chanted \u201cNo Peter, no work\u201d and held placards reading \u201cBring Peter back\u201d as riot police stopped them from marching beyond the High Court building.\n\nThe doctors dispersed after police allowed half a dozen of them to deliver a petition to Mnangagwa\u2019s office demanding action over Magombeyi\u2019s disappearance, but they said their strike would continue.\n\n\u201cDr Peter Magombeyi\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown, and we are seriously concerned about this. We therefore demand his unconditional return to his family,\u201d the petition read.\n\nMagombeyi\u2019s sister on Sunday filed an urgent application in the courts to compel the government to do everything to find her brother. The court was due to hear the case on Monday.\n\nPolice could not comment on the matter.\n\nTwo years after Mnangagwa and the army conspired to oust longtime ruler Robert Mugabe, people are suffering from triple-digit price rises and shortages of basic goods like fuel.\n\nMnangagwa\u2019s government has promised salary increases to public sector workers, but many say those rises are insufficient.\n\nDiplomats said they were monitoring whether authorities respect the people\u2019s right to protest peacefully.\n\nSome are sceptical since Mnangagwa was Mugabe\u2019s trusted lieutenant at times when the former president, who died this month, crushed dissent during his near-four decades in power.", "description": "Hundreds of Zimbabwean doctors protested in central Harare on Monday over the disappearance of the leader of their union, but riot police blocked them from marching to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's office.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430440273&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0TR", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
