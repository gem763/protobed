Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nInvestors might not know much about Orient Refractories's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last seven years and offers a 1.2% yield. A 1.2% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Orient Refractories!\n\nNSEI:ORIENTREF Historical Dividend Yield, October 16th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, Orient Refractories paid out 33% of its profit as dividends. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. The company paid out 80% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is adequate, but reduces the wriggle room in the event of a downturn. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nWith a strong net cash balance, Orient Refractories investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.\n\nWe update our data on Orient Refractories every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Orient Refractories has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a while now, which is great. However we'd prefer to see consistency for a few more years before giving it our full seal of approval. During the past seven-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b91.00 in 2012, compared to \u20b92.50 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time.\n\nWe're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Orient Refractories has grown its earnings per share at 11% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Orient Refractories Limited (NSE:ORIENTREF) from a dividend investor's perspective...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BrLuVSPE4zg8mQWtM.qIBg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/edd37a71471c10a5a649d25e361d9fd9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
