Whatever comes out of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria\u2014a Kurdish genocide, a resurgence of the Islamic State, an expansion of Iran\u2019s sphere of operations and influence, a renewal of the migrant crisis in Europe, and most likely all of the above and more\u2014it doesn\u2019t look pretty. It is conceivable that Esper\u2019s presence will help prevent or mitigate some of the bad outcomes\u2014indeed, it is likely that Esper deserves credit for the president\u2019s too-late attempt to walk back his Syria blunder\u2014but all that is happening will have Esper\u2019s signature on it as the secretary of defense who led the withdrawal.\n\nBut what if Esper joins the list of officials to quit the Trump administration in frustration? For a decade now, thanks to Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and congressional Republicans, the U.S. military has been bleeding as we move closer to a great power war. We hear a lot about military spending, but our civilian leaders are paying little attention to the structure and posture of U.S. forces. One should not put too much stock in wargaming, but in a recent Department of Defense-sponsored war simulation against Russia and China, the United States \u201cgot its ass handed to it.\u201d Such wargaming losses are the norm and not the exception: For a decade, America lost every single simulation against Russia in the Baltics.", "description": "", "authors": ["Shay Khatiri", "Thebulwark.Com Should-The-Secretary-Of-Defense-Quit"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
