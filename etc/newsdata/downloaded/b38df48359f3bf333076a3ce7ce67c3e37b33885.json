(AP) - Miami Hurricanes coach Jim Larranaga needs a big man, which is why he\u2019s glad Rodney Miller has lost more than 40 pounds.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Miller was in such poor shape a year ago that he redshirted as a junior. During the layoff, he cut his weight from 280 to 238, and now the Hurricanes\u2019 only healthy center is looking fit as they try to bounce back from a disappointing 2018-19 season.\n\n\u201cIf Rodney can play at the level he\u2019s capable of getting to consistently, he may be the most improved player in the ACC,\u201d Larranaga says.\n\nImprovement sounds good to the Hurricanes, who return only two starters from a team that went 14-18 a year ago. It was Larranaga\u2019s first losing season since 1997-98, when he was at George Mason, and the Hurricanes\u2019 5-13 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference was their worst since 2010.\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION\n\nMiller has always showed a good touch around the basket, but he had trouble staying on the court.\n\n\u201cHe would get tired very quickly,\u201d Larranaga says. \u201cWe scrimmaged the other day for 30 minutes, and Rodney played all 30. That never would have been possible his first couple of years.\u201d\n\nMiller says he lost weight by eating three times a day, instead of skipping breakfast and lunch and having one big meal. He also cut back on goodies baked by Larranaga\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cMrs. L makes some terrific cookies,\u201d Miller says with a grin.\n\nThe payoff came slowly, but a smaller Miller noticed a big difference when practice began.\n\n\u201cI was getting more and more excited every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to get to practice and try out my new body. All my moves got sharper. I jumped higher. I felt like a new person.\u201d\n\nThe Hurricanes need him. Their only other big man this season will be 6-10 sophomore Deng Gak, who is still rehabbing from a knee injury last December.\n\nMORE THAN HIGHLIGHTS\n\nDynamic 5-foot-7 Chris Lykes led the Hurricanes in scoring as a sophomore a year ago, and this season he hopes to become known for more than flashy moves.\n\n\u201cI want to show people I\u2019m a winner,\u201d Lykes says. \u201cI\u2019m not just an exciting player and a highlight guy. I want to show people winning is what matters most.\u201d\n\nLykes averaged 16.2 points in 2018-19 and started all 32 games. Guard Dejan Vasiljevic, who averaged 11.8 points and made 81 3-pointers, is Miami\u2019s other returning starter.\n\nNEWCOMERS\n\nThree freshmen are likely to have a role this season - 6-4 Harlond Beverly, 6-3 Isaiah Wong and 6-8 Anthony Walker. The Hurricanes also have added 6-5 Kameron McGusty, who sat out last season after transferring from Oklahoma, where he averaged 9.4 points in two seasons.\n\nKeith Stone, a 6-8 graduate transfer from Florida, is still recovering from an ACL injury in January, and there\u2019s no timetable yet regarding his return.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nLast year the Hurricanes allowed opponents to shoot 45% and score 71 points per game, the worst averages in Larranaga\u2019s eight years at Miami.\n\nHe traces the decline to star guard Bruce Brown\u2019s season-ending injury in January 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a great defensive team,\u201d Larranaga says. \u201cIt has been an area of concern actually since we lost Bruce the middle of his sophomore year. We dropped statistically from being one of the better defensive teams in the ACC to one of the worst, and we haven\u2019t been able to get back.\u201d\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nThe ACC has expanded its league schedule from 18 games to 20, and for the first time, the Hurricanes open their season with a conference game. They play host to No. 5 Louisville on Nov. 5.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be prepared,\u201d Lykes says. \u201cIf we\u2019re not, it\u2019s not going to be good for us. It\u2019s good to have something like that opening up. It shows we can\u2019t mess around in these practices.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeBasketballPoll and https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Miami Hurricanes coach Jim Larranaga needs a big man, which is why he's glad Rodney Miller has lost more than 40 pounds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
