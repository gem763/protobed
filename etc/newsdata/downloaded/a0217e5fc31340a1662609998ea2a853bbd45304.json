The Sun Herald newspaper in Biloxi reported that the book\u2019s use of the \u201cN-word\u201d unsettled some students.\n\n\u201cThere are many resources and materials that are available to teach state academic standards to our students,\u2019 said Superintendent Arthur McMillan, in a statement. \u201cThese resources may change periodically. We always strive to do what is best for our students and staff to continue to perform at the highest level.\u201d\n\nBiloxi would not be the first district to drop the book from required reading lists. Until 2018, ninth graders in public school in Duluth, Minn., were required to read Lee\u2019s novel. That district also removed Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cHuckleberry Finn\u201d from its list.
