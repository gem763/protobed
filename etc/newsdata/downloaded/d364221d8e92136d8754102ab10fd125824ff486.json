Calabria said that while it isn\u2019t his objective to wipe out or enrich shareholders, he will do what\u2019s needed to ensure taxpayers don\u2019t have to bail out the companies again.\n\nBillionaire John Paulson\u2019s firm is among a group of hedge funds that have been fighting for years to end the net-worth sweep that sends Fannie and Freddie profits to the Treasury. Shares have rallied this past year on optimism that the Trump administration will move to end that policy.\n\nFannie fell 3.1% to $3.39 as of 1:54 pm in New York Trading Tuesday, while Freddie dipped 2.9% to $3.18.\n\nRead More: Fannie and Freddie Died But Were Reborn Profitably\n\nFannie and Freddie have been under U.S. conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized as the mortgage market imploded. Treasury\u2019s proposal suggests dozens of reforms to protect against another housing crash, shrinking their dominant market shares and creating new competitors to the two companies, which backstop about $5 trillion of home loans.\n\nFoster said that he would like to see shareholders of Fannie and Freddie wiped out, though as a politician he doesn\u2019t have that power. Calabria noted that it was his view when he worked on Capitol Hill in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that the companies\u2019 investors should lose everything.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers such as Foster have insinuated that Treasury\u2019s blueprint for overhauling Fannie and Freddie could be a boon for hedge funds that undermines access to affordable housing for lower-income buyers.\n\nDemocrats are concerned because Treasury and FHFA could theoretically bypass Congress to let Fannie and Freddie build up their capital buffers and then release the companies from federal control. Such a process, known as recap and release, would likely enrich preferred shareholders including Paulson.\n\nRead More: Trump Fannie-Freddie Plan Urges Ending Decade of U.S. Control\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reiterated Tuesday that it\u2019s \u201cby far\u201d his preference to work with Congress on an overhaul of Fannie and Freddie. Mnuchin and Calabria both said during the hearing that no decision has been made on how exactly Fannie and Freddie might be released.\n\nMnuchin said that all options, including putting Fannie and Freddie through a process called receivership that is akin to bankruptcy, is still on the table. Receivership is potentially a bad outcome for shareholders because it could wipe them out.\n\nCalabria wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting recap and release, adding that he opposes releasing Fannie and Freddie if they end up operating in the same way as they did before the 2008 crisis. As part of the administration\u2019s blueprint, Treasury and the FHFA are required to come up with a plan for how the mortgage giants will raise outside capital, and whether that will entail a new share sale, for example.\n\nDemocrats are increasingly raising questions about whether Fannie and Freddie investors have undue influence on the Trump administration. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive who\u2019s a vocal critic of the financial industry, asked whether Mnuchin stands to make money if the companies are freed from federal control. Mnuchin, who was once an investor in Paulson\u2019s hedge fund, said he would not profit because he\u2019s divested assets since joining the government.\n\nPaulson has been a fundraiser for President Donald Trump and has a long history with Mnuchin. In 2008, Paulson and Mnuchin joined forces to invest in troubled mortgage lender OneWest, a deal that proved lucrative for both of them.\n\n(Adds comment from Acasio-Cortez in 13th paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Kasia Klimasinska.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Elizabeth Dexheimer in Washington at edexheimer@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory Mott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s regulator, facing scrutiny from Democrats about whether freeing the companies from U.S. control might enrich hedge funds, said he would be willing to wipe out shareholders of the mortgage giants if circumstances called for it.\u201cI work for the taxpayers,\u201d Federal", "authors": ["Elizabeth Dexheimer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UYCWZqtvljcR__9.OLhr8A--~B/aD0xNzYwO3c9MjY0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/66d884c8e9b8a4ca6ce7c5763b8c552e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
