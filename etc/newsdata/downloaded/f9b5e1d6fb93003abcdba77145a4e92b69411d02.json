But such a gambit also carries risks.\n\nThe idea of attacking Biden is especially complicated because of the allegations that have been thrown at him and his son Hunter Biden by President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE. Trump is facing possible impeachment for soliciting an investigation of the Bidens from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call.\n\nDemocratic strategists say challengers need to tread carefully for fear of appearing to abet Trump.\n\n\u201cIs anyone going to attack Biden on Ukraine? If they do, then by definition they are basically taking Trump\u2019s side,\u201d said Democratic pollster Paul Maslin.\n\nThose dynamics are part of a broader problem for other candidates outside of the top two.\n\nThe easiest way to make an impression is to tangle with Biden or Warren. But doing so runs the risk of backfiring, especially in such a large field where voters can be put off by perceived negativity \u2014 as some candidates have already discovered.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro suffered a backlash after he appeared to target Biden\u2019s age at last month\u2019s debate in Houston.\n\nHarris enjoyed a polling surge after she went after Biden\u2019s history on racial issues, including school busing, in the first clashes in Miami in late June. But her momentum has vanished since then. She is currently drawing roughly 5 percent support in the RealClearPolitics national polling average.\n\n\u201cThe question is, if you need to draw a contrast, how do you do it in a way that benefits you and doesn\u2019t hurt you? And it\u2019s a challenging question,\u201d said Democratic strategist Steve McMahon.\n\nMcMahon said such attacks can work better in a race where voters must choose between just two candidates.\n\n\u201cIf it is a binary choice, every vote that your opponent doesn\u2019t get is one you will get,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a multicandidate field, yes, you might peel one vote off of Joe Biden. But there are 11 other candidates who are just as likely as you are to get that vote.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s attacks on him and some faltering performances in early debates, Biden continues to show strength in the polls. Warren, meanwhile, has grown her support consistently for months.\n\nIn a Quinnipiac University national poll released Monday, Warren led with 30 percent support among Democrats, edging Biden\u2019s 27 percent.\n\nSanders was a long way behind with 11 percent. Buttigieg had 8 percent support, followed by Harris at 4 percent.\n\nSanders\u2019s supporters point out that he topped fundraising totals in the third quarter, with a reported haul of $25.3 million. But there has been little sign in the polls that the veteran democratic socialist is expanding his base, and his recent heart attack deepens questions about his age. Sanders, 78, would be the oldest president ever elected.\n\n\u201cI think he should address [the heart attack] head-on because even if he doesn\u2019t get a question about it, voters and viewers are going to think about it,\u201d said strategist Basil Smikle. \u201cIt is something that is not inconsequential but it is not disqualifying.\u201d\n\nSmikle, like several of the Democratic strategists who spoke to The Hill, suggested that candidates who are competing with Biden on more centrist ground might have the most potential to grow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that even if Vice President Biden and his son are not seen as having done anything improper, moderate voters might get to the point where they are worried that the negative talk around them might drag the ticket down,\u201d Smikle said.\n\nAnother strategist, Julie Roginsky, made a similar point but focused on Biden\u2019s performances on the campaign trail and in previous debates.\n\n\u201cWarren and Sanders have the liberal wing of the Democratic Party covered and there\u2019s not much room for anybody else to cut into that. But I think there are people who were seriously looking at Joe Biden and who are questioning how fleet-footed he was in response to Trump\u2019s attacks on him,\u201d said Roginsky, who added that this created an \u201copportunity\u201d for other candidates such as Harris.\n\nEven though there are still more than three months to go before the Iowa caucuses, candidates outside the top two can\u2019t risk fading into also-ran status.\n\nThat fact alone could ensure fireworks Tuesday night.\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "The battle for the Democratic presidential nomination is looking increasingly like a two-horse race \u2014 unless someone other than former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.
