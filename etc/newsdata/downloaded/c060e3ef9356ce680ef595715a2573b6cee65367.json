You haven't just impacted the Brexit debate, you have transformed British politics.\"\n\nSir Patrick added there was \"nothing democratic\" about the 2016 referendum.\n\n(Image: James Veysey/REX)\n\n\"People weren't just misled, they were lied to,\" said Sir Patrick.\n\nEffigies of the Prime Minister have been held aloft by protesters at the demonstration, with some accompanied by their pets draped in EU flags, on the People's Vote march to Westminster.\n\nA number of celebrities and politicians joined the march, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan pictured alongside Sir Patrick and actor Stephen McGann at the front of the crowd as the march set off from Park Lane on Saturday afternoon.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nTelevision chef Rick Stein shared an image of himself at the march, declaring \"We are European\", while Observer food critic Jay Rayner tweeted from the protest: \"We march because we have to.\"\n\nProtesters made their way through central London to Parliament Square, where Great British Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig and opposition MPs, including Labour's Jess Phillips and Liberal Democrat Luciana Berger, addressed the crowds.\n\nThe float depicting No10 aide Mr Cummings was being manned by Phil Jeanes, 67, who said he had driven the sculpture from Dusseldorf in Germany on Thursday night.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nMr Jeanes is part of a group called EU Flag Mafia, and has lived in Essen for the last nine years with his German wife.\n\nHe said the float had been specifically designed for the People's Vote march by the German artist Jacques Tilly.\n\nIt is the fourth model designed by the artist, who also made a sculpture of Theresa May with her nose impaling a man in a bowler hat.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"He put 14 sketches together and we chose what we thought would be the best,\" Mr Jeanes, who is retired, said.\n\n\"I suppose we were always intending to do a float for this march and you have to wait and see what is happening at the time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Brexit activists also gathered in Westminster.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJason Hurt, 48, from Sheffield, was sporting a \"I voted Leave\" T-shirt, and said he feels people who voted for Brexit are being ignored.\n\n\"I voted Leave, I want my voice heard,\" he said.\n\n\"It is always about the Remainers, never about the Leavers. There are 17.4 million of us, we never get our voices heard.\"\n\nPam Julian, from Bermondsey, south-east London, held a sign which read: \"Screw EU, we want our country back\" - but said she has nothing against Europe.\n\nThe 68-year-old said Brexit is about regaining her independence.\n\n\"It is not just about trade or what Boris is saying. The main thing is to regain our independence, to be able to self-govern,\" she said.", "description": "Britons demanding a \"final say\" vote on Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal were joined by Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart and other celebs", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Swns", "Pa", "James Veysey Rex", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654903.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_PEOPLES_VOTE_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
