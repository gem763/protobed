Capital Markets' chief economist Tom Porcelli pointed to consistently alarming headlines since the first quarter of 2018 suggesting poor Caterpillar earnings meant a recession was round the corner, though that has yet to transpire.\n\n\"We have been down this road before with CAT,\" Porcelli said in a note titled 'Still Waiting For Recession.'\n\n\"If you keep saying a recession is here, it is a mathematical certainty that at some point you will be right,\" he wrote. \"Maybe try again after CAT's next quarterly earnings report.\"\n\nSo far, results from about 125 of the S&P500 companies are out with analysts expecting earnings to have declined 2.9% year-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBREXIT BATTLE\n\nCurrency markets stuck to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the euro zone, Japan and United States due to review policy.
