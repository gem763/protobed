Trump first appeared to link the two prospects speaking to reporters Thursday. The president asserted then that he and the U.S. would have the upper hand on China when high-stakes trade talks resume in Washington next week, saying that he has \u201ca lot of options on China\u201d and that \u201cif they don't do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\nMoments later, unprompted, he issued his invitation for China to examine whether there was wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nTrump\u2019s accusations come as his administration remains mired in the impeachment inquiry launched by the House last week stemming from a July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart in which he also urged a corruption investigation into Biden. Democrats point to Trump\u2019s mysterious decision around the same time to withhold hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance, with Trump offering evolving rationales for doing so.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3257/1155968404_6091759372001_6091757354001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nBut Trump claimed Friday that there was no explicit quid pro quo in that instance, which he argued is \u201cthe whole ballgame.\u201d Democrats have roundly rejected that defense.\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with China has been hot and cold throughout his presidency. Despite routinely bashing the country and engaging in a years-long trade war that has begun to dampen the U.S. economy, Trump has also spoken warmly about Xi and congratulated him this week on the 70th anniversary of communist rule there.\n\nThe president's trade war with China has weighed on U.S. farmers and manufacturers, and spurred hundreds of billions of dollars in tit-for-tat tariffs between the two nations. While Trump often says he could easily wrestle China into making a deal to benefit the U.S, he's also suggested Xi could be trying to wait him out in the hopes that he is defeated in next year's election.\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that Trump mentioned Biden, one of the front-runners in the Democratic race for president, as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's risen steadily in the polls, in a phone call with Xi earlier this month. Trump had said earlier in the day he had not yet asked Xi to investigate the Bidens but indicated a request could come soon.\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed that Hunter Biden convinced China\u2019s national bank to invest $1.5 billion in an investment firm he sat on the board of, assertions lawyers for the former vice president's son have denied. George Mesires, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, has told multiple media outlets that he did not have a financial stake in the firm until after his father left public office.\n\nBiden critics have mainly pointed to a trip to China in 2013 that Joe Biden took while he was vice president. Hunter and one of his daughters accompanied his father on the trip, where he arranged a meeting between the vice president and a Chinese banker involved with the firm, though Hunter Biden's lawyer denied any business was conducted on the trip. Shortly after, the firm received its license to operate, but Mesires has said that was in the works long before the China trip.\n\nThe president and his allies have also suggested that Biden used his father's influence to get ahead in business \u2014 Trump accused Biden on Thursday of giving China a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d due to his son\u2019s business interests there. He also accused Hunter Biden, without evidence, of receiving a \u201cpayoff\u201d from the Chinese.\n\nMesires told The Washington Post last week that Hunter had not received \u201cany return or compensation\u201d from his investment or role with the firm, and that Trump and his defenders had engaged in a \u201cgross misrepresentation\u201d of Hunter\u2019s role there.\n\nTrump adopted a new line of defense in Friday\u2019s talks with reporters, repeatedly telling them that his main motivator was rooting out corruption, rather than damaging the electoral prospects of any singular political opponent. Asked by one reporter, however, if he could name any corruption investigations he was pursuing that did not involve a political opponent, the president responded that \u201cI\u2019d have to look.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/67/3a/2414581b4615b831d2f360b8fa8d/19104-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
