The final step is the match being abandoned.\n\nClarke said he was told 50 people had been thrown out at halftime.\n\nHe said the referee asked Southgate at the second stoppage, four minutes from the break, whether England wanted to leave the field and the manager had replied the team wanted to finish the half and see where things stood.\n\n\u201cUEFA will be carrying out a thorough investigation,\u201d added Clarke. Not just what the ref saw and the officials around him saw, but also live footage and witness statements to make sure this appalling scene of terrible racism is treated appropriately.\u201d\n\nSouthgate said there had been a long discussion about the situation during the second temporary stoppage.\n\n\u201cWe were very clear that if there was anything at the beginning of the second half we would have walked straight off and frankly I don\u2019t think we would have gone back,\u201d he added.\n\nBulgarian captain Ivelin Popov spent time talking to fans through the metal fence at the break but sporadic abuse was still heard in the second half.\n\n\u201cYou can talk about protocols, but I\u2019m sitting here feeling sick to my stomach. It\u2019s heart-breaking,\u201d said former Manchester United and Ireland midfielder Roy Keane, a pundit for ITV.\n\nFormer England striker Ian Wright said it was \u201ca terrible day for the Bulgarian people but a great one for trying to tackle racism.\u201d\n\nThe game was being played in front of a reduced crowd after UEFA ordered a partial stadium closure due to racist behaviour by Bulgarian supporters in June\u2019s qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo.\n\nRacism was a major talking point ahead of the game, with England striker Tammy Abraham indicating last week that the players could act as a group and leave the pitch if subjected to abuse.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nBulgarian supporters made monkey chants at visiting black players when England last travelled to Sofia for a European qualifier in 2011, prompting UEFA to fine the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) 40,000 euros ($44,072.00).\n\n\u201cWe have all been waiting for a stance to be made. People who have been subjected to this abuse and hearing about their protocol have been waiting for it to be happening,\u201d said Troy Townsend of campaign group Kick It Out.\n\n\u201c(UEFA) have to take the strongest possible action and that for me, is to kick Bulgaria out of the European qualifiers. It\u2019s the only way people will take note of what they are doing to our black players.\u201d", "description": "Racist abuse cast a blight over a Euro 2020 qualifier between Bulgaria and England on Monday with the match in Sofia twice halted by the referee after monkey noises and chants from the crowd were aimed at black players from the visiting team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440835099&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1OJ", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
