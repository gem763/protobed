Lifelong New Yorkers, they were in declining health and clearly could no longer live on their own. With four adults and two children in an Irvine home designed for a smaller family, it was clear the arrangements could only be temporary.\n\nBut the supply of housing had been constrained for so long in California that prices were simply out of reach. This was largely due to restrictive zoning, heavy environmental regulatory burdens and lawsuits. If we were going to take care of my in-laws, it was likely not going to be in California\u2026\n\nSo we sold our house in Southern California and moved to Texas, settling in the Hill Country about 25 miles southwest of Austin. Our new home was 70 percent larger (with 12 times the property) than our California home, and it had a swimming pool \u2014 all for $110,000 less. Most importantly, the ground floor had two extra bedrooms and a bathroom for my in-laws \u2014 not having to walk upstairs was a significant factor in our home search.\n\nWe\u2019ve found Texans to be a friendly, liberty-loving bunch. Though where we moved, it seems half the neighborhood hails from California, with the number of friends we have from the Golden State moving to the Lone Star State growing by the year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chuck Devore", "Foxbusiness.Com Real-Estate Chuck-Devore-What-Made-Me-Leave-California-Texas-No-Regrets"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
