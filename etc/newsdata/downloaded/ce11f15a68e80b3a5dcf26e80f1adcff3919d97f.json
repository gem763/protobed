Nathan Rousseau Smith has the latest. Buzz60, Buzz60\n\nWashington state investigators on Thursday fined three companies involved in a crane collapse that killed four people in Seattle in April, determining workers failed to follow manufacturer instructions.\n\nWorkers disassembling the construction crane removed pins holding together sections too quickly, officials said, and wind gust toppled the unsteady tower onto traffic below.\n\n\u201cThe incident that occurred was totally avoidable,\u201d said Department of Labor and Industries Director Joel Sacks at a news conference. \u201cIf the companies on site had followed the rules, the crane would not have fallen.\u201d\n\nThe collapse on April 27 killed two people driving in cars as well as two ironworkers on the crane that was being used in constructing a Google office building. Four others were injured.\n\nA construction crane working on a building in downtown Seattle collapsed April 27, 2019.

Murrow Equipment Co., the supplier, should have ensured the instructions were followed as the expert on site, officials said. The other two companies, GLY and Northwest Tower Crane Service Inc., were fined for inadequate training and for not having a supervisor present.\n\nSafe disassembly?: Deadly Seattle crane collapse was likely caused by human error, experts say\n\nThe daughters of Alan Justad, a 71-year-old man who died when part of the crane crashed on his car, described the findings as devastating.\n\n\u201cThere is no acceptable reason for why our beloved father is not with us today,\u201d Jade, Marika and Miro Justad said in a statement to The Seattle Times. \u201cCorners were recklessly cut and as a result, four lives were lost. We will carry this tragedy with us forever.\u201d\n\n'Failure somewhere in there': Contractor claims video shows structural flaws prior to Hard Rock Hotel collapse\n\nState officials acknowledged there is no law preventing workers from prematurely removing construction crane pins to speed up disassembly, the Times reported. The department said it is considering new regulations to prevent the practice.\n\nThe three companies have 15 days to appeal the fines.\n\nSeattle Police on Thursday confirmed they opened a criminal investigation into the incident, but gave no further details. In 2008, New York prosecutors brought manslaughter charges in two crane collapse cases. Both ended in acquittals.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/17/seattle-crane-collapse-investigation-companies-fined-avoidable-accident/4018256002/", "description": "The state of Washington fined three companies involved in a crane collapse that killed four people in Seattle, determining it was \"totally avoidable.\"", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Published A.M.
