(Griffin Pivarunas for Kaiser Health News)\n\nUVA Health System, which sues thousands of patients each year, seizing wages and home equity to collect on overdue bills, said Friday it would increase financial assistance, give bigger discounts to the uninsured and \u201creduce our reliance on the legal system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will have a huge impact on patients to the good,\u201d Doug Lischke, the health system\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. The changes will \u201cpositively, drastically reduce the legal process\u201d of lawsuits, garnishments and property liens, he added.\n\nLischke called the new policy \u201ca first step\u201d that could later include additional financial assistance. He said the state-owned health-care system also plans to ask the Virginia General Assembly to change a law requiring state agencies including health systems to \u201caggressively collect\u201d unpaid bills and charge 6 percent interest on the balance.\n\nBut independent experts said the policy change, which comes on the heels of a Kaiser Health News investigation published in The Washington Post detailing the public medical center\u2019s aggressive collection practices, still leaves numerous patients exposed to lawsuits and crippling bills. KHN found that UVA sued patients more than 36,000 times over six years ending in June 2018, sending many families into bankruptcy. It routinely billed uninsured patients for far more than what a typical insurance company would have paid.\n\nBy leaving family assets vulnerable and not fully discounting list-price charges, the new guidelines remain \u201cvery tough on the poor and near-poor who have managed to amass anything of value that will help them with the daily costs of life,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy professor at George Washington University.\n\nThe amended policy will make it easier to qualify for financial assistance, awarding aid to families with incomes of up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $103,000 for a family of four. Until now, families making more than half that were ineligible \u2014 the most restrictive financial assistance rules of any major hospital system in Virginia, the KHN analysis found.\n\nUVA also said that except in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d it will not sue patients unless balances are more than $1,000 and families make more than 400 percent of the poverty guidelines.\n\n\u201cWhile these changes represent a step in the right direction, it\u2019s unfortunate that UVA, a public institution, insists on still suing patients,\u201d said Marty Makary, a surgeon and researcher at Johns Hopkins Medicine who studies hospital debt collection. \u201cIn my conversations with UVA surgeons, they are appalled by the practice of their center in suing patients and want it to stop.\u201d\n\nThe health system has not decided what to do about patient lawsuits in the pipeline, Lischke, said. Online court records show there are hearings scheduled for hundreds of UVA Medical Center cases over the next few weeks.\n\nMary Washington Healthcare of Fredericksburg, criticized earlier this summer for a far-smaller number of lawsuits, said it would suspend suing patients and seek to eliminate garnishments. Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis, another on a growing list of hospitals called out for aggressive collections, said it would suspend all court activity for a month.\n\nThe changes at UVA are slated to take effect Jan. 1, but officials said they are \u201ccommitted to working with anyone who currently has an outstanding balance or debt that they are struggling to pay.\u201d\n\nThe health system will apply the new policies to patients treated in July 2017 or later, Lischke said. That means patients on current payment plans, or with judgments against them, could have bills eliminated or adjusted. But he said there will be no refunds of payments already made.\n\nTaken together the changes will cost UVA \u201cmillions to tens of millions,\u201d he said, declining to give a more precise figure. UVA Medical Center, the flagship hospital of UVA Health, made an $87 million operating profit on revenue of $1.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in June and held stocks, bonds and other investments worth about $1 billion.\n\nUVA began reviewing its billing and collections policies after being informed of KHN\u2019s findings in August. It examined policies of neighbor hospitals such as Mary Washington, as well as of other major academic medical centers, Lischke said.\n\nPreviously just $4,000 in a retirement account could bar UVA patients from financial help, no matter how low their income. Now patients can have at least $50,000 in savings beyond the value of their home and car and still get assistance if they meet the income test, according to the new policy.\n\nThe nonprofit health-care system also said it would grant discounts of 40 percent to uninsured patients to better reflect the lower rates negotiated and paid by insurance companies. Until now, uninsured patients got only 20 percent off the list or \u201cchargemaster\u201d price, plus another 10 percent to 15 percent if they paid promptly, which few were able to do.\n\nShaving 40 percent from list prices, which are used as a starting point for insurer negotiations, puts the bills for uninsured patients more in line with those who are covered by commercial health plans, Lischke said.\n\nBut Rosenbaum said that discount should be even greater. She recommended the uninsured be billed at Medicare payment levels, which can be as much as 75 percent or more off a hospital\u2019s list prices. The total of UVA\u2019s cash revenue from all health plans and government programs is 70 percent below its list prices, financial forms filed with the Department of Health and Human Services show.\n\n\u201cEven a 40 percent write-off of charges remains a brutal exposure\u201d for the uninsured, she said. \u201cHow could they possibly remain tied to their chargemaster and keep a straight face?\u201d\n\nLischke said UVA would consider that adjustment as part of its continuing review of billing and collections.\n\nThe new policy will not help the 20 UVA students reported by KHN to have \u201cactive holds\u201d on their enrollment this semester because they owe money to UVA Medical Center. UVA treats unpaid hospitals bills the same as unpaid tuition.\n\nUVA has not approached legislators yet about changing billing laws but hoped to have next year\u2019s General Assembly consider it, Lischke said.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that we are able to influence a change to not only the Debt Collection Act\u201d requiring aggressive collection \u201cbut also the state indigent care guidelines,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Ralph Northam, a physician who is close to L.D. Britt, a Norfolk surgeon and professor who is chairman of the health system\u2019s board, said Monday he was \u201cglad to hear the UVA Health System is in the process of changing their policies and practices.\u201d\n\nHancock is a senior correspondent and Lucas is data editor for Kaiser Health News (KHN), a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
