The outlook since then has picked up with forecasts of stronger growth. That optimism may have rubbed off on survey respondents who reported being more positive about their personal financial positions, Calgary-based MNP said.\n\nThe quarterly polls shows 27 per cent say that their debt situation is better than it was a year ago, a increase of three percentage points, and more than a third \u2014 35 per cent \u2014 say it\u2019s better than five years ago. The optimism increases looking ahead, with 39 per cent saying they expect improvements in their debt situation a year from now and half believing that it will be better five years from now.\n\n\u201cHousehold debt has eased marginally and the current holding pattern on interest rates may be giving Canadians a sense of optimism about their finances,\u201d Bazian said. \u201cInterest rates may remain stable for now but that is a cold comfort to those already having a difficult time making their debt payments at the current rate.\u201d\n\nA life-changing event such as a divorce, unexpected automobile repairs, job loss or the death of a family member will drive 70 per cent of respondents into more debt, the survey found. About half \u2014 47 per cent \u2014 said they don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be able to cover their expenses for the next 12 months without increasing their debt, it showed. It increased from 45 per cent in June, MNP said.\n\nThe percentage of Canadian who expect a debt-free retirement shrank three percentage points from June to 48 per cent, the poll showed.\n\n\u201dIt seems many have resigned themselves to owing money for life,\u201d Bazian said.\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "A survey by MNP showed 47% don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be able to cover their expenses for the next 12 months without increasing their debt", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/empty-wallet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
