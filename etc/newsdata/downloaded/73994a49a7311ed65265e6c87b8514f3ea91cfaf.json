Instead, after Trump's former deputy national security adviser defied a subpoena, he issued a warning: White House directives not to cooperate would only bolster the case that the president had abused his office and obstructed Congress.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday (AEDT) added to that sense of urgency, announcing that after weeks of private fact-finding, the full House would vote on Thursday to initiate a public phase of the inquiry. That vote would establish rules for the public presentation of evidence and outline due process rights for Mr Trump.\n\nIt will be the first time all House lawmakers will be asked to go on the record regarding the investigation since it began in September, something Democrats had so far resisted.\n\n\"We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorised subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,\" Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues. \"Nobody is above the law.\"\n\nThe announcements sent the clearest signals to date that Democrats believe their month-old inquiry is on track and will allow them to begin making an effective impeachment case before the nation by the Thanksgiving holiday.", "description": "House Democrats have moved quickly to bring their impeachment case against President Donald Trump into the open, saying they would forgo court battles with defiant witnesses and vote this week on procedures to govern nationally televised hearings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ec59d652f8136d0dbcf400a197543889f55284b4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
