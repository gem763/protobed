His mother, who also hasn\u2019t been identified, was initially able to respond to verbal commands before she entered her semi-comatose state.\n\nOlivia Kasirye, the public health officer for the Sacramento County Department of Health Services, told CBS Sacramento that the woman\u2019s cream contained methylmercury, a very toxic type of mercury. This is the first time a methylmercury poisoning from face cream has occurred in the United States, the department said in a statement.\n\nKasirye is urging the public to immediately discontinue use of similar skin creams imported from Mexico because of how dangerous methylmercury is for adults and children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an intentional change or whether there was a mistake in the person who was adding the mercury,\u201d she said, telling the station that there\u2019s an informal network of suppliers who bring the altered skin creams into the country.\n\nThe most common way that people are exposed to methylmercury is through eating fish and shellfish that contain the toxin, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSkin exposure to methylmercury can affect the central and peripheral systems, with symptoms including tremors, memory loss and cognitive and motor dysfunction, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe average amount of mercury in blood is up to about 5 micrograms per liter as a result of mercury that is likely to be in someone\u2019s diet, according to the New York State Department of Health. The woman had 2,630 micrograms per liter in her blood, according to KCRA.\n\n\u201cIt can reach high levels in the blood, and it can also cross over into the brain,\u201d Kasirye told the station. \u201cOnce it crosses into the brain, even if you go to the hospital, the medication we have cannot pull it out.\u201d\n\nThe WHO and the Pan American Health Organization reported in 2017 that mercury was used in skin-lightening products for its ability to suppress melanin, resulting in fading hyperpigmentation, acne scars and overall skin tone. The FDA stated in 2016 that mercury-containing products were also sold as anti-wrinkle creams, and warned that cosmetic exposure could cause mercury vapor inhalation and mercury contamination through skin-to-skin contact. The agency also cautioned against skin care products manufactured abroad that are then sold, often illegally, in places that cater to Latino, Asian, African and Middle Eastern communities.\n\nThe woman\u2019s son told CBS Sacramento that his mother knowingly used the altered product from Mexico twice a day for years because it worked better than the creams sold in drugstores. The woman purchased the cream from someone she knew, according to CBS Sacramento.\n\nSacramento County Public Health and the California Department of Public Health will test similar creams in the Sacramento area for methylmercury.\n\nThere have been more than 60 poisonings linked to foreign-branded, unlabeled or homemade skin creams tainted with a less-toxic form of mercury, according to a Sacramento County Department of Health Services statement. The department published a list of products that have tested positive for mercury on its website.\n\nKasirye told KCRA that her department wants people to be careful about the products they buy, especially if they\u2019re not purchased from a drugstore.\n\nIn November, 51 environmental and public health groups requested that Amazon and eBay get rid of illegal skin-care products containing high levels of mercury.\n\nIn June, a judge in Alameda County Superior Court ruled that an advocacy group couldn\u2019t sue Amazon for selling skin-whitening creams that contain very high levels of mercury without the cancer warning labels usually required by law, according to the Mercury News. The judge agreed that Amazon wasn\u2019t responsible for warning labels on products listed by vendors. A court in Pennsylvania agreed with the ruling weeks later but held that Amazon could be held accountable for harmful effects of flawed products.
