Federal and state authorities have identified vitamin E acetate as a potential clue in the unfolding mystery because it is a common element in cannabis products that have been collected from patients who have fallen ill.\n\nInvestigators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have found the oil in cannabis products in samples collected across the United States. That same chemical was also found in nearly all cannabis samples from patients who fell ill in New York in recent weeks, state health officials said. Although the FDA does not have enough data to conclude that vitamin E acetate is the cause of the lung injury, the agency said late Friday that \u201cit is prudent to avoid inhaling this substance.\u201d\n\nIt is the first common element found in samples from across the country. While health officials have said it is too early to know whether the oil is causing the injuries, New York state has said vitamin E acetate is a key focus of its investigation.\n\nVitamin E is found naturally in certain foods, such as canola oil, olive oil and almonds. The oil derived from the vitamin is commonly available as a nutritional supplement and is used in topical skin treatments. It is not known to cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin. Its name sounds harmless, experts said, but its molecular structure could make it hazardous when inhaled, and officials said it could be associated with the kinds of respiratory symptoms that many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\nThe companies being served with the subpoena are Honey Cut Labs LLC in Santa Monica, for its Honey Cut Diluting Agent; Floraplex Terpenes in Ypsilanti, Mi. for its Uber Thick agent; and Mass Terpenes in Amherst, Ma. for its Pure Diluent.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office said these three companies are the first to be subpoenaed, but more companies are likely to be ordered to provide samples as the investigation continues. Health authorities want the companies to provide additional information to aid the ongoing investigation.\n\nRead more:\n\nLung illnesses tied to vaping have killed 5 people as new cases surge\n\nContaminant found in marijuana vaping products linked to deadly lung illnesses", "description": "New York state's lab has obtained samples of thickening agents and determined they are nearly pure vitamin E acetate, an oil that has been found in marijuana products used by people who fell sick.", "authors": ["Lena H.
