(AP) - A major oil company is encountering criticism and appreciation for its pledge to donate $1 to local school math, technology and science projects for every tank of gasoline purchased.\n\nChevron said Wednesday it would make up to $75,000 available to support schools in three New Mexico cities through its \u201cFuel Your School\u201d program.\n\nThe company invests heavily in local oil production. Top state and district education officials were scheduled to visit an elementary school as new books are delivered under Chevron\u2019s education initiative.\n\nHigh school senior Jonathan Alonzo of Albuquerque says that Chevron\u2019s charitable efforts put cash-strapped communities in an awkward bind and fly in the face of recent mass student protests against oil dependency.\n\nChevron corporate affairs manager Tommy Lyles says the company strongly supports technology and science education.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A major oil company is encountering criticism and appreciation for its pledge to donate $1 to local school math, technology and science projects for every tank of gasoline purchased.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/climate_strike_new_mexico_52543_c0-150-3596-2246_s1770x1032.jpg?d1f04bf71776dd57503a17f38c8ad8860c3de411"}
