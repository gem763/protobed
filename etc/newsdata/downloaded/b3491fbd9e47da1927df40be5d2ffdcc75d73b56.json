I mean, this thing had a big d***.\n\nThe statue\u2019s penis went straight through Warren\u2019s eye (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018He moved closer to the statue, he brushed away some moss revealing the words, \u201cPhallus Impallus\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Suddenly, the d*** on the statue hit a cloud of smoke. Splat, it went through his eye, right up to the testicles. And there was blood everywhere.\u2019\n\nYep, we\u2019re completely speechless too.\n\nViewers were shook by Warren\u2019s creative death on Killer Camp\n\nJesus Christ, what a way to die \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude02 @warrenspencer_ bloody gutted man, you were my pick!! #KillerCamp \u2014 Kev \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f (@kevlaa132) October 28, 2019\n\nSOMEONE ON ITV2 JUST GOT IMPALED IN THE FACE BY A STONE PENIS AND I STOOD UP AND APPLAUDED #KillerCamp \u2014 Nick Walker (@nickw84) October 28, 2019\n\nThat was absolute gold.

All the campmates look to him for support. To me, that stinks mate.\u2019\n\nIs Warren right? Only time will tell\u2026\n\nKiller Camp continues tomorrow at 9pm on ITV2.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
