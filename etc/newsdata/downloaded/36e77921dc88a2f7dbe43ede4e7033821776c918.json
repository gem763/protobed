The government is seeking to transform the east Asian nation into a high-tech manufacturing hub in hopes of first catching up with, and then surpassing, the West.\n\nThe country\u2019s intentions to roll out its own digital currency fall in line with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s warning to Congress last week during his testimony about Libra, when he noted that the US was at risk of falling behind given China\u2018s plans.\n\nFacebook\u2019s \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 project has ruffled feathers across the world, with many regulators and governments publicly airing concerns about Libra\u2019s potential impact on the financial system. The scrutiny is such that Zuckerberg has said he\u2019s prepared to delay the project until all issues are adequately resolved. In the meantime, China is seemingly powering ahead.\n\nEarlier today, a senior official at China\u2019s foreign exchange regulator said governments in emerging markets should have a bigger say in the regulation of digital currencies, which could facilitate illegal capital flows, and disrupt foreign exchange management.\n\nThe news comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week that the country should boost the development of blockchain technology, causing a ripple of excitement across the country.\n\nSo, what next?\n\nWhile Libra\u2018s future is still uncertain, China\u2018s version could see the light of the day relatively soon.\n\nBack in March, a Hard Fork investigation revealed that China was winning the blockchain patent race, with the US trailing behind.\n\nTo date, CoinDesk says that some 506 blockchain projects have been published by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which requires every blockchain project to be registered for supervision.\n\nBitcoin has also felt the impact of Jinping\u2019s announcement, as its price increased by 22 percent over the weekend.\n\nComplacency is the biggest threat facing western governments and technology behemoths such as Facebook. While politicians, lawmakers, and entrepreneurs discuss the ins and outs of Libra, their Chinese counterparts are working tirelessly to actually launch a digital currency.\n\nBeing a democracy, the US has many advantages over China\u2018s restrictive regime, but then again, Donald Trump rules the White House and we all know how much he dislikes Bitcoin.", "description": "China has approved a law to regulate cryptography as it readies to launch its own digital currency.
