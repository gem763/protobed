That\u2019s no small thing, given how saturated and mature the smartphone market has become.\n\nAs with the previous Nex phone, Vivo has applied creative thinking and engineering to the solution of how to achieve the highest possible screen-to-body ratio. The headline feature this time around is a large second screen on the back of the phone, meaning you can use it as a selfie viewfinder for the regular rear-facing camera. It\u2019s the most elaborate method yet to get rid of the notch, and it mostly works.\n\nMostly.\n\nOur review of Vivo Nex Dual Display Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Great, notchless display\n\nClass-leading \u201cselfie camera\u201d\n\nFun light-up ring Bad Stuff Infuriating screen-switching UX\n\nExtremely fragile\n\nSecond screen is useless beyond selfies\n\nFrom the front, the Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition has a restrained design. Sure, it\u2019s still unusual to see a full-screen phone without a notch, but it doesn\u2019t have curved glass like the Oppo Find X. It\u2019s actually kind of boxy, despite the slim profile and rounded metallic corners. The 6.4-inch OLED screen looks great, but there isn\u2019t much else to make the phone stand out if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nUntil you turn it around, that is. It\u2019s not just that the Nex Dual Display has a second screen; it\u2019s that Vivo has implemented it in a truly weird and cool way. Because the 5.5-inch rear display has an until recently conventional 16:9 aspect ratio, there\u2019s a large bezel above it with room to house the cameras. The cameras are located right above the screen, and there\u2019s also a large light-up ring that starts at the top of the phone and cuts into the display.\n\nThis \u201cLunar Ring\u201d uses separate LEDs for the half that\u2019s inside the bezel and the OLED screen itself for the other half. These lights surround a raised glass disc, meaning that part of the rear screen looks like a lens has been left on top of it. It\u2019s very strange and hard to describe. I\u2019ve really never seen anything like it, particularly when the ring lights up.\n\nThe ring is largely used as a glorified notification LED, lighting up when you receive alerts or plug the phone in. It also shines in different colors for various different portrait lighting effects when you\u2019re taking a selfie, although the lights aren\u2019t bright enough to actually be visible in the photos. The ring does, however, house two bright white LEDs that can be used for fill lighting or flash.\n\nIt\u2019s like having one of those dedicated Casio selfie cameras built into your phone, and it helps that the image quality is bananas good. The vast majority of phones use lower-quality sensors for their selfie cameras, so it\u2019s no surprise that being able to use the rear-facing camera hardware leads to dramatically better results. Selfies taken with the Nex Dual Display are extremely detailed, with vastly better dynamic range than any other phone I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nAs a regular rear-facing camera, the Nex Dual Display performs pretty well \u2014 not category-leading, but not disappointing. As a selfie camera, though, it\u2019s phenomenal, particularly when compared to the pokey 5-megapixel unit that Vivo managed to cram into the pop-up mechanism in last year\u2019s Nex.\n\n\u201cDad, you\u2019re holding the phone backwards!\u201d\n\nThere is one other legitimately great camera-related use for the second screen: from the camera app, you can press a button to activate both screens at once, which is perfect for when you hand the phone to someone else to take a photo of you. The live view of the shot is right there on the back of the phone, which means you can adjust yourself in the framing to help get the best photo. This mode definitely confused some of the unsuspecting strangers I tried this out on \u2014 I heard \u201cDad, you\u2019re holding the phone backwards!\u201d more than once \u2014 but it really is a useful feature once everyone knows what\u2019s happening.\n\nThe camera array also includes a time-of-flight 3D sensor, which Vivo showed off at MWC Shanghai last year. The phone doesn\u2019t ship with the demonstrated ability to build a 3D model of your head, unfortunately, but it does seem to help produce some pretty accurate depth of field effects for portraits, and it\u2019s also used for 3D face unlock when you wake the phone while using the rear screen.\n\nAs for the main screen, it has a fingerprint sensor embedded inside, like several other Vivo phones from the past year. This one, however, is a fourth-generation sensor that marks a big improvement on previous implementations. It\u2019s far faster than the previous Nex, and I\u2019ve found it to be very reliable. The gap in performance between this and a regular capacitive sensor \u2014 particularly one with a less convenient rear-mounted location \u2014 is extremely small.\n\nIn fact, the Nex Dual Display performs very well by any conventional metric. The Snapdragon 845 processor is as effective as it has been in any flagship Android phone, the 10GB of RAM is frankly excessive, and while the 3,500mAh battery is a downgrade from the original Nex, I haven\u2019t once had a problem making it through a full day. There\u2019s even a headphone jack.\n\nI never quite got used to this phone\n\nI never quite got used to this phone, though, and the main reason why is Vivo overreached with the second screen\u2019s functionality. If you want, you can use the phone exclusively with the smaller screen, only turning it around when you want to take a non-selfie photo. That\u2019s fine in theory, and I can see it being a useful ability for times when a smaller screen might be more practical \u2014 one-handed use while hanging onto a subway handrail, for example. But third-party apps run in a shrunken-down window to match the larger screen\u2019s taller aspect ratio, making them practically unusable.\n\nRealistically, you\u2019re never going to want to use the second screen for anything other than selfies. The problem is that the entire phone has been designed around the opposite of this reality. There\u2019s a sleep / wake / switch screens button on each side of the phone; you press the one on the right to wake it, then press the one on the left if you want to switch to the other screen. It sounds simple enough, but I can\u2019t tell you how many times I pressed the wrong one while taking the phone out of my pocket \u2014 the phone\u2019s two screens are near-impossible to distinguish by feel \u2014 only to be faced with a blank display. Or the number of times I accidentally pressed the switch-display button while using the phone, then instinctively pressed it again to try to get the display back, which locked the phone altogether, which, of course, is extremely annoying.\n\nMaybe I\u2019d get used to this if I used the phone for more than a month, but I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just not an intuitive implementation of the idea, and the benefits of the idea are really minor in the first place. The dual power buttons on this phone make Samsung\u2019s Bixby button look like a functional convenience. All they do is get in the way. I think the experience of using this phone would be vastly better if the second screen only ever activated when you press the on-screen \u201cswitch camera\u201d button within the camera app. Nothing of value would be lost.\n\nI also have to mention a serious practical downside of this design: durability. For obvious reasons, you can\u2019t really use a traditional case with the Nex Dual Display. Vivo does include an iPhone 4-style rubber bumper that offers some limited protection, but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that you have a much higher chance of cracking a screen when you drop this thing than basically any other phone. Which, full disclosure, I managed to do before I even found the bumper in the box \u2014 though thankfully the damage was limited to the bottom-right corner.\n\nYou could just get a normal phone with a notch\n\nSo yes, there are trade-offs to the Nex Dual Display, and unlike the previous Nex, I\u2019m not convinced they\u2019re worth it. Unless, of course, you care about selfie image quality, in which case, this might be the greatest phone ever made. For everyone else, the original Nex\u2019s pop-up camera or a full-on sliding mechanism as seen on the motorized Oppo Find X or the magnetic Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 would probably make more sense. Or \u2014 and hear me out here \u2014 you could just get a normal phone with a notch, which is really the most sensible solution. You have to truly care about maintaining a giant list of yet-to-be-dealt-with notification icons for a notch to negatively impact the general Android experience.\n\nThe Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition is a flagship device in the purest sense of the word. It\u2019s an impressive phone for the $700 price, and it demonstrates beyond a doubt that Vivo is a world-class manufacturer capable of incredible engineering and exciting new ideas.\n\nBut, perhaps unsurprisingly, that doesn\u2019t mean that this is the particular idea we should all rally behind. Maybe the new Apex 2019 will be the one. Or the 2020 version.", "description": "Vivo\u2019s newest Nex phone shares its predecessor\u2019s goal of eliminating the notch.
