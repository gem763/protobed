Even so, Mr Trump has faced calls for stronger action than sanctions from some in his party, including senator Lindsay Graham, who said on Wednesday morning that he believed further action would be necessary.\n\nIt appears likely that Mr O'Brien's predecessor, who regularly called for military intervention overseas, would have called for tougher action as well, and it remains to be seen how the incoming national security adviser might handle the situation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Later, Mr O'Brien served as a foreign policy adviser for former Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and for former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker \u2014 who notably dropped out months before the Iowa caucuses in 2016.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Mr O'Brien was once rumoured to be under consideration to become secretary of the Navy, before being appointed as special envoy for hostage affairs. In that capacity, Mr O'Brien took on an unusual case at the behest of the president, and travelled to Sweden to oversee an assault case filed against American rapper A$AP Rocky there.\n\nMr Trump had become particularly interested in the case, tweeting out support and calls for his release. Rocky was found guilty of assault, but did not face any prison time.", "description": "Donald Trump has named Robert O'Brien as his new national security adviser to replace John Bolton, who was fired last week.
