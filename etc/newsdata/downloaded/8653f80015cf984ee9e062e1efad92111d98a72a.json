We could find Boris Johnson\u2019s deal in law, most likely with an extension beyond 31 October; there could be no agreed deal after the second reading of the withdrawal bill, and no extension to the Brexit process granted by the European Union; there could be agreement to have a confirmatory Final Say referendum; or \u2013 as most pundits now predict \u2013 we could have general election before Christmas.\n\nBut the very fact that all such options are still in play at this late stage is testimony to the total breakdown in trust and compromise in our political system. This breakdown stands in marked contrast to the flexible, yet decisive, way in which the 27 nations of the EU negotiated with Boris Johnson. True, they had the whip hand and got most of what they wanted, but the ability to triangulate between different position \u2013 the essence of doing politics \u2013 has become a continental European skill that the British now clearly lack.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They know that if they shook hands and reached a compromise (say, a Brexit which keeps the main economic features of the EU but leaves the political) they would get away with a warning and please the neutrals. But they don\u2019t trust the other side and don\u2019t want to risk accusations of \"betraying\" their own. If Prisoner A, the Brexiteer, sticks to his claim that the other side is solely to blame, and the judge believes him, then he gets off scot free (a \"clean break\" Brexit, in this case) but he runs the risk of going down for a very long time (no Brexit at all). Prisoner B has the reverse dilemma: he could stop Brexit altogether, but risks a very hard Brexit (a life sentence) in the process of trying.\n\nThe likely outcome of intransigence is that the judge will send both of them down: a bad deal which satisfies nobody.\n\nThough ideas such as retaining a Customs Union will be floated again, compromise \u2013 however desirable at this point \u2013 seems unlikely. There will be a battle of political wills demanding guile and stamina. The first battle is over timetables; the longer the process, the greater the likelihood of scrutiny throwing up problems to be addressed by amendments.\n\nThese may be sufficiently numerous and radical that the government no longer has a bill it can sell to its own uncomfortable alliance of the European Research Group, mainstream Tories and Labour Brexiteers. It could then try to trigger a general election. And if the threat of \u2018no deal\u2019 has been neutered by an extension, the Opposition is likely to agree to one \u2013even if the outcome is a lottery and may solve nothing.\n\nThe bill will also give an opportunity for (mostly) Remainers to secure agreement for a Final Say referendum. The Liberal Democrats and I will be among the supporters of it that amendment, but it will only win if there are others who can be persuaded that it is the least worst of several bad options and, as such, the best way out of the Brexit nightmare.\n\nWhat is absolutely certain is that Brexit will not \"get done\" any time soon. Even if the bill and the final deal are approved by parliament, there will be another crisis after next summer as the end of the transition period looms in December 2020. With the strong possibility that there will be no sign of a new trade agreement with the EU by then, all the arguments about \"clean breaks\" and \"crashing out\" will happen all over again. And again.\n\nThere is now a present danger that such a divided country could become split over this single issue indefinitely.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting that Brexit has been stuck on the Irish border problem, and the partition which caused it a century ago. I will not be around 100 years from now, but I fear that arguments over Brexit will still be raging.
