All production numbers are expressed on a 100 per cent basis and are based on mine production data and are therefore subject to adjustment following final assay at the refiners.\n\n\n\nApproximately 13,646 ounces of gold were produced during the Quarter, 7.3% above the 12,712 ounces produced in the second quarter of 2019. Gold produced for the 9 months to September 30, 2019 was 38,306 ounces, approximately 3.2% below the 39,559 ounces produced in the corresponding period of 2018. Caledonia maintains its 2019 full year production guidance of 50,000 to 53,0001 ounces and remains on track with progress towards its target of 80,000 ounces by 2022.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Steve Curtis, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\n\u201cProduction in the third quarter of 2019 was slightly below our target but showed steady growth in production on the previous two quarters. Production in the quarter had a difficult start due to significant interruptions in the supply of electricity in July and early August although the electricity situation improved substantially later in the quarter. Caledonia remains on track to achieve our guidance of 50,000 to 53,0001 ounces for the full year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to have completed the shaft sinking phase of the central shaft project during the quarter, a significant milestone for our business. The shaft has now entered the equipping phase of the project which we expect to be completed in mid-2020. We look forward to commencing production from the central shaft during the second half of 2020 which is expected to deliver the Company\u2019s growth plan to achieve 75,000 ounces in 2021 and 80,000 ounces by 2022.\u201d\n\nAbout Caledonia Mining\n\nCaledonia\u2019s primary asset is a 49 per cent interest in the Blanket gold mine in Zimbabwe. In November 2018, Caledonia announced that it had signed a legally binding agreement to increase its shareholding in Blanket to 64% subject to the receipt of, amongst other things, regulatory approvals. Caledonia\u2019s shares are listed on the NYSE American (symbol: CMCL) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol: CAL) and depositary interests representing the shares are traded on London\u2019s AIM (symbol: CMCL).\n\nAs at June 30, 2019, Caledonia had cash of approximately US$7.9 million.
