Consovoy did not actually argue that the president can never be investigated by anyone. First, his argument was specific to state investigations. He focused repeatedly on the problem of state \u201cproliferation\u201d and local politics, and explicitly left the door open several times for federal investigation, saying \u201cit\u2019s a harder case\u201d to argue immunity from federal investigation. (He also left the door open to argue immunity against federal investigation, but he was careful not to push this argument.)\n\nSecond, he clarified that even if states could not use \u201ccriminal process\u201d and subpoena a president or his \u201ccustodians\u201d for answers or documents, they could otherwise investigate. The source of the confusion is that many media outlets and commentators have taken one exchange taken out of context. Towards the very end of the argument, Judge Denny Chin asked about the 5th Avenue shooting hypothetical. \u201cLocal authorities couldn't investigate? They couldn\u2019t do anything about it? \u2026 While in office?\" Consovoy answered, \"That is correct.\"\n\nBut then Judge Robert Katzmann immediately jumped in for clarification: \"So even gathering documents that could be used later once the president leaves office? That can\u2019t be done either?\" Consovoy quickly reversed: \"That can be done. I apologize\u2026 This grand jury is proceeding. We have not sought to enjoin the entirety of the grand jury\u2026 We are simply saying: Criminal process [a subpoena] issued to a sitting president who has not been ruled out that he is a target of the investigation falls comfortably with the immunity that has to be accepted.\" It\u2019s clear that Consovoy is saying a state prosecutors can investigate a president and ask questions, but they cannot issue him a subpoena, and presumably, state officials could not arrest or detain him (even for a shooting).\n\nConsovoy is right to be concerned about states\u2019 abuse of investigatory powers. Judge Chin asked about this specifically: \"You're concerned that [state prosecutors] are going to act in bad faith?\" Consovoy replied with an important point: \"I think there is an incentive [to act in bad faith]...\"\n\nThis brings us to my surprise when I realized that Consovoy and his lawyers quoted a blogpost I had written on this question in their brief at page 7: \u201c...all you need is one prosecutor, one trial judge, the barest amount of probable cause, and a supportive local constituency, and you can shut down a presidency.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers actually cut off the end of that sentence without providing the required ellipsis. My sentence ended, \u201c...you can shut down a presidency with a criminal trial or two or two dozen.\u201d They misleadingly left out my distinction between indictment and trial. But even so, I was wrong 18 months ago when I also suggested a sitting president \u201cgenerally\u201d could not be indicted absent a clear and present danger. It seemed like the DOJ was functioning under pressure. I was naive. A year ago, I retracted after more research on statutes of limitations.", "description": "But it's different from the argument everyone thinks they\u2019re making.", "authors": ["Jed Shugerman", "Professor Of Law At Fordham University"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX738VZ/facebook.jpg?1572021166", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
