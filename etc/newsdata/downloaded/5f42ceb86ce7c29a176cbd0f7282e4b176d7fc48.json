She works in extreme temperatures and braves tough terrains across the globe to work on her wildlife projects. While she has spent over 25 years working for tiger conservation, she is also a passionate traveller and diver, and has been photographing tigers, leopards, lions, snow leopards, and other members of the cat family over the past few years. When she is out in the field, she works for 16 to 18 hours a day, lugging around equipment weighing close to 30 kg. She says she will soon be spending time at the North and South Pole, studying the impact of climate change. Come June, she will be going to Patagonia, Chile, where one can walk with pumas on foot and photograph them. \u201cThe only big cat I haven\u2019t seen so far is the puma,\u201d says Nath, who has done her DPhil on Tiger Conservation and Management from the University of Oxford. Excerpts from a candid chat with \u2018The Tiger Princess\u2019, which is actually the title of a National Geographic TV documentary on her life and work:\n\nWhat are the earliest memories of your interaction with wildlife?\n\nMy grandparents lived in Kashmir. So, for three to four months every year, we used to visit Srinagar. They had one of the largest farms in the Valley. Life at the farm was extraordinary and much of that helped me become what I am today. My grandmother was involved in women\u2019s rights and crewel needlework in Kashmir. She was working with cultural activists and revivalists such as Pupul Jayakar. She was a close friend of former prime minister Indira Gandhi who used to wear Kashmiri phirans made only by her. My grandmother had a profound influence on my life. I was only three weeks old when my father took me on my very first fishing trip. When I was a little girl, we made many trips to Dachigam National Park in Kashmir. In fact, when I was an infant, I was put in a basket and carried to the park (laughs). Later, my father was in Ballabhgarh, setting up a primary health centre network for Haryana. We were living in a village. I saw elephants, hedgehogs, monkeys, and other animals. During the winter holidays, we went camping on the edge of Jim Corbett National Park. Interactions with wildlife were part and parcel of my childhood. By the age of seven, I was more or less clear on what my calling in life would be.\n\nChoosing to study environmental science must have been an oddity in those days.\n\nI was born and raised at AIIMS. Almost everybody I knew was studying either medicine, engineering, or law. And here I was declaring that I wanted to study environmental science and become an ecologist. At that time, I wanted to focus on snow leopards and Himalayan black bears. But I couldn\u2019t go back to Kashmir to study them because the insurgency had begun. It was then that I was told that I could concentrate on tigers. So, here was this really pampered and protected girl from Delhi who told her mother that she would be leaving the comfort of her home and driving through Chambal in Madhya Pradesh to study the big cats for six months! While I was in Bandhavgarh, even to get to a phone, I had to drive for 35 km. So, it was quite a big step for my family and me.\n\nWere you the only woman in Madhya Pradesh researching tigers?\n\nWildlife photographer and conservationist Belinda Wright was also there. She was working on a different project, and was camped at Kanha National Park at that time. But, as a wildlife researcher, I was the only woman.\n\nHas gender been an issue in your career?\n\nGender has definitely been an issue. Even today, most conservationists are men. Even though people are showing an interest in the subject, it\u2019s difficult to explain to parents in India that your daughter is keen on becoming a conservationist and willing to live in the jungle for inordinate stretches of time. Even then, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s 200 per cent easier for women to join this field these days than what it was about 30 years ago. Yet, it\u2019s tough for people to believe that a woman in conservation can also be interested in fashion, couture, parties, and other finer things in life, and manage to do everything in the same breath. They don\u2019t understand that a woman can wear a chiffon sari and go dining with the Queen of England, and then come back, wear a khakee, and sit in a mahout\u2019s house on the floor, cook a roti, and eat it with an equal amount of happiness.\n\nSo, how did this mindset affect your career?\n\nPeople have hounded me for this\u2014the fact that I have been doing so many things across the spectrum\u2014for years. Also, due to the fact that I wasn\u2019t scared of asking questions. So, I have had guides who have told me, \u201cI am a Rajput man and my words are actually set in stone.\u201d And my retort was, \u201cI am a scientist, I am genderless, and I am questioning what you have said.\u201d The result: I was questioned by such gentlemen for almost two decades, denied jobs, and stopped from joining specialised organisations. All this, because I had the gumption to stand up to and question their authority. At the end, it all made me leave for Oxford, which was an equal-opportunity place of study and work. Oxford taught me how to engage in good scientific work and produce my best.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge that wildlife conversation is facing in India today?\n\nIndia has been on the fast track as far as development is concerned. But this development has been structured and implemented without taking long-term environmental impacts into account. For instance, if a highway is being built from the north to the south, it needs to cut across a forest. I accept that, and agree that it needs to be done. But are such development projects being executed in an appropriate manner? What India doesn\u2019t have is wisdom in our political leadership. The issue is not about development against conservation. In fact, conservation should be part and parcel of all developmental projects. That\u2019s the kind of awareness we need today.\n\nDo we need to create more wildlife habitats? How do we stop tragedies such as the killing of tigress Avani?\n\nIf we can effectively control what we have at the moment, we will be in a great place. Rather than creating new habitats, we should focus on conserving what we already have. Once what exists is in a good, stable, and protected state, then you can talk of expansion. For now, let\u2019s just talk of stopping further erosion of existing habitats, and it will lead to more immediate results.\n\nDo you think Indian wildlife laws need more teeth?\n\nWe have some of the best wildlife laws in the world. We just need to fast track legal decision-making. We need to educate our field workers on the laws, and on gathering evidence correctly. We need to assure our forest department and wildlife officials that higher authorities have their backs when they take a stance against poaching or a conservation conflict. When a case goes to court, it stays there for years.That breaks morale. When you have caught a poacher killing an elephant or a tiger, you want to put that person in jail immediately. Why wait for 10 or 15 years? We need special courts that deal with only such cases and can fast track justice. We need specially trained wildlife wing within the government as well.", "description": "Latika Nath has spent over 25 years working for tiger conservation in the country.
