Prior to this, the system had undergone successful testing at the Tokyo All-Around World Cup and the Junior World Championships in Gyor, Hungary, earlier this year.\n\nThe FIG and Fujitsu began work on this technology in 2017, with the aim of setting up a real-time judging support system that is fair and accurate.\n\n\"The people we must always have in mind are the gymnasts. They dedicate their youth to this sport, which gives them dreams and sees them flourish. We cannot accept that all those years of hard effort and all those dreams can be destroyed by a single judging error. Scoring controversies must become a thing of the past, and the technology that Fujitsu has been developing will reinforce trust in judgement,\" FIG president Morinari Watanabe said.\n\nIf the technology is well received at the World Championships, Fujitsu and FIG have said they plan to expand the tool's application to the remaining six apparatus in Artistic Gymnastics.\n\nThe FIG also sees potential for the tool to be used beyond judging and envisions use cases in education, coaching, and training. The data provided might help to enhance gymnasts' movements or correct body posture, and thus aid in lowering the risk of injuries, FIG said.\n\nThe Artistic Gymnastics World Championships starts tomorrow and will run until October 13.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKookaburra takes a swing at creating a smart cricket ball\n\nHowzat?
