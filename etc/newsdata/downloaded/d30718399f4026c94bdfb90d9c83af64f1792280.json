'Our policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They're just mad we look good doing it.'\n\nOcasio-Cortez, according to the report, received an $80 haircut and $180 low light treatment at Last Tangle Salon in Northwest Washington D.C. in September. The Times noted that with a 20 per cent tip, the total would come out to more than $300.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez pushed back after it was revealed she spent more than $300 for a haircut and dye\n\n'They're just mad we look good doing it,' Ocasio-Cortez said in reference to pushing a Democratic socialist agenda at the same time receiving a pricey hairdo\n\nThe average cost of a highlight or lowlight dye in America is $80, but can go upwards of $300 in the D.C. metro area, where Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers live while Congress is in session. The national average for a women's haircut is $43, but in D.C. it usually ranges between $70 to upwards of $125.\n\nBut the Times pointed out that if Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 nicknamed AOC \u2013 would have gone to a government-subsidized barbershop on Capitol Hill she would have spent around $100 less for the same haircut.\n\nThe Jacobin, a Democratic socialist quarterly magazine, responded to the report from its Twitter account with a bit of sarcasm.\n\n'Sad to see democratic socialists like Bernie and @AOC do things like buy winter coats and get haircuts. Don't they know that real socialists avoid purchasing goods and services?' the account posted.\n\nIn a second tweet, Ocasio-Cortez urged people to pay more attention to potential financial corruption within the White House instead of the cost of her haircut.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics and accountability watchdog organization, posted a report that shows Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Trump's resort in Ireland cost taxpayers $600,000.\n\n'Won't you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts' worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. 'I wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman's cut & color.'\n\nOften time, those on the left \u2013 and self-proclaimed Democratic socialists specifically \u2013 receive backlash from the right-wing for spending lavishly or buying luxury items. They claim this lifestyle is in contrast with the economic ideals they spout.\n\nAOC has come under fire from those on the right for living in a luxury apartment in D.C. and pushing for a raise for members of Congress\n\nInstead, Ocasio-Cortez suggested people should look into Mike Pence's $600 stay at Trump's Ireland resort this summer\n\n'AOC is the Eva Peron of American politics. She preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged,' Richard Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, said.\n\nEva Peron is the former first lady of Argentina, and was known for dressing in designer gowns and jewels at the time advocating a socialist agenda.\n\n'There is nothing wrong with spending money to make yourself look better, especially as a personality who depends upon visual mediums for her power,' Manning continued. 'But it is a bad look to spend hundreds of dollars to get your hair done to make a video decrying income inequality.'\n\nA staff member at Last Tangle told the Times that Ocasio-Cortez was very nice and took selfies with other people on the salon.\n\nOcasio-Cortez makes $174,000 a year representing the 14th district of New York, which includes parts of both New York City boroughs The Bronx and Queens. The average salary in Washington D.C. is $71,740, but the cost of living in the district is 39.3 per cent higher than the rest of the U.S.\n\nThe progressive lawmaker supports raising congressional salaries, and says higher pay would discourage corruption on the legislative branch.\n\nAlthough she has complained about the cost of living in D.C., she has come under fire for living in a luxury building in a trendy neighborhood where studio apartments start at $2,000 per month.", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended on Thursday her pricey haircut, claiming the 'right-wing' is 'mad' she looks good while promoting Democratic socialism.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19555358-0-image-a-15_1570738271255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
