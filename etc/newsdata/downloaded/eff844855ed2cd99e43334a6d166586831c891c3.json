Everyone else is taken\n\nThe new gender-neutral emojis differ slightly from the male and female ones.\n\nIn some, the style and colour of their clothes is changed. In others the haircuts are different and a \u201cgender-neutral facial structure\u201d is used, says the Emojipedia website.\n\nOther new emoji include robotic limbs, people who use wheelchairs and hearing aids, culturally-specific outfits, and some new cute animals.\n\nOTTERS AND GENDER NEUTRAL EMOJI THIS IS ONE HELL OF AN UPDATE YALL https://t.co/B2Wz49Y95h \u2014 remy green (@j_remy_green) October 29, 2019\n\nThe attempt at on-screen inclusivity has not pleased everyone however, with some suggesting the icons indicate how gender-nonconforming people should look.\n\n\u201cHow do u determine that these emojis are how gender-neutrality should be represented or that these emojis even represent most gnc people,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t just all neutral to begin with,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cRegular old smileys were neutral. I don\u2019t know why we had to go and start gendering everything in the first place.\u201d\n\nThings you never knew about the history of emoticons\n\nWhen it unveiled the designs earlier this year, Apple said they would \u201cbring even more diversity to the keyboard\u201d and \u201cfill a significant gap\u201d in the selection of emojis.\n\n\u201cUsers will now be able to select any combination of skin tone, in addition to gender,\u201d it said.\n\nBusinesses have paid increasing attention to becoming more inclusive in recent times.\n\nToy maker Mattel for example released gender-neutral dolls last month with none of the curves or large muscles of the traditional Barbie or GI Joe, while many small fashion brands and make-up companies are marketing non-binary products.", "description": "The additions to Apple\u2019s operating system aimed for inclusivity, but not everyone is impressed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/5a5dfee8-faf7-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15imagehires174932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
