As far as the Public Protector is concerned, that information can be redacted, and the report made available to the court in a redacted format.\u201d\n\nMkhwebane is also concerned that the judge she has accused of bias and judicial misconduct, Sulet Potterill, may be scheduled to hear Dlodlo\u2019s application and \u201cdoes not believe that she will be impartial when hearing the matter\u201d.\n\nLast month Mkhwebane wrote a scathing affidavit to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and the Judicial Services Commission (JSC), saying that Potterill, in granting Gordhan an interdict against the report on the rogue unit report in July, used \u201charsh language\u201d that was \u201cdisparaging, derogatory, and was actuated by personal spite\u201d.\n\nOn Friday President Cyril Ramaphosa also upped the stakes in his face-off with Mkhwebane in a separate probe over a R500 000 donation to his ANC campaign from controversial firm Bosasa.\n\nHe is challenging her to declare how she got hold of the leaked emails in the court record showing that his explanation that he was kept in the dark around the finances of his ANC presidential campaign in 2017 may not be true.\n\nBut Segalwe declined to comment, saying that Mkhwebane \u201cdoes not want to litigate through the press\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe has even written to the president for a meeting about this media-created perception that they are fighting. No response has been received yet.\u201d\n\nDlodlo\u2019s predecessor, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba, previously opened a police case against Mkhwebane, charging her with theft of information and the violation of South Africa\u2019s security laws after she allegedly laid her hands on the classified state document.\n\nMkhwebane opened a countercharge with the police against Letsatsi-Duba over her alleged interference with the functioning of the office of the Public Protector, in that Letsatsi-Duba had failed to make available a declassified copy that Mkhwebane required in connection with an investigation into the alleged violation of the executive members\u2019 ethics code by Gordhan.\n\nIn July the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) declined to prosecute either case, \u201cbased on the evidence and the nature of the contraventions of the two statutes under consideration\u201d, according to Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi.\n\nThe report contains secret information exposing the identities of members and former intelligence members, and sources and methods of the agency, which is protected from publication by law\n\nState security spokesperson Mava Scott said Dlodlo had applied to court to have the classified report of the inspector-general of intelligence \u201cremoved from the court papers of the EFF\u201d \u2013 which was party to Gordhan\u2019s interdict application.\n\n\u201cThe report contains secret information exposing the identities of members and former intelligence members, and sources and methods of the agency, which is protected from publication by law\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cunauthorised publication of such information is therefore unlawful\u201d, he said.\n\nMkhwebane hits back at \u2018rogue unit\u2019 judge\n\nContained in an affidavit made under oath on August 23 2019, Mkhwebane charged that Potterill was biased when she remarked during her ruling that some of the Public Protector\u2019s remedial action was \u201cnonsensical\u201d. Mkhwebane added that such language amounted to a gross violation of the judicial code of conduct and had the potential to erode confidence in the independence of the judiciary.\n\n\n\nPotterill\u2019s high court ruling in July prevented Mkhwebane from enforcing the remedial actions contained in her report on the SA Revenue Service\u2019s rogue unit, which implicated Gordhan and called for Ramaphosa to take disciplinary action against the minister.\n\n\n\nMkhwebane\u2019s gripe \u2013 and she would settle for a formal apology and a retraction if the JSC permitted \u2013 was that Potterill went further to describe some of the remedial action as \u201cvague, contradictory and/or nonsensical\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the use of the word \u2018nonsensical\u2019 by a judicial officer against a head of a chapter 9 institution, or anybody for that matter, is a breach of the Code of Judicial Conduct,\u201d said Mkhwebane, who last week had made a public remark that it was curious that despite the complaint, she may have to sit before the same judge for another upcoming hearing.\n\n\n\nShe said in the affidavit that her complaint warranted an investigation because Potterill violated a provision in terms of the code of conduct stating that in order to ensure a fair trial, \u201ca judge must remain manifestly impartial, act in accordance with commonly accepted decorum; and remain patient and courteous to legal practitioners, parties and the public, and requires them to act likewise\u201d.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, she said, the code stated that \u201charsh language should be avoided if possible and a judge may not, under the guise of performing judicial functions, make defamatory or derogatory statements actuated by personal spite, ill will, or improper, unlawful or ulterior motive\u201d.\n\n\n\nMoreover, she said, the code should be read in conjunction with the norms and standards for the performance of judicial functions, particularly one of the core values placing emphasis on \u201cthe independence of the judiciary and the concomitant imperatives of integrity and impartiality of all judicial officers\u201d.\n\nIt is my humble submission that the language used by the judge is not in accordance of the commonly accepted decorum; it\u2019s harsh language that is disparaging, derogatory, and was actuated by personal spite\n\nThe norms required that judicial officers at all times act in accordance with the core values stated in the norms and standards, said Mkhwebane. \u201cIt is my humble submission that the language used by the judge is not in accordance of the commonly accepted decorum; it\u2019s harsh language that is disparaging, derogatory, and was actuated by personal spite.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the manner in which the judge handled herself when dealing with the matter, and \u201cthe disparaging remarks have certainly violated my dignity, both as the incumbent and as a legal practitioner\u201d.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, she said: \u201cI have no doubt that the remarks have severely dented the image, dignity and effectiveness of my office.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe matter between Mkhwebane and Gordhan was heard on an urgent basis on July 23, during which Gordhan sought an order for the stay of implementation of the remedial action pending the determination of the review application.\n\n\n\nIn the judgment handed down six days later, Potterill commented that much of Mkhwebane\u2019s remedial orders were \u201cvague, contradictory and/or nonsensical\u201d.\n\n\n\nMkhwebane said in her affidavit that without imposing and prescribing the desired outcome and with due respect to the independent powers and functions of the JSC, it was her \u201cconsidered view that the judge should be ordered to retract and render a formal apology to the Public Protector\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe JSC\u2019s secretary, Sello Chiloane, said on Friday that the Judicial Conduct Committee, established to deal with complaints lodged against judges, had received a complaint lodged by Mkhwebane against Potterill. The committee would deal with it \u201cin due course\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\nOn Friday in Parliament the subcommittee on the review of the National Assembly rules met to consider proposed rules concerning the removal from office of the Public Protector, the Auditor-General or a member of a commission established by chapter 9 of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThe proposal to review the rules was prompted by a request for Parliament to investigate Mkhwebane\u2019s fitness to hold office, coming on the back of a series of damning court judgments against her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane\u2019s SA Revenue Service \u201crogue unit\u201d report against Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan could be weakened if State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo manages to swing the odds in his favour.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7302/1502f7611ee84eeba85042f9a1b9244a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
