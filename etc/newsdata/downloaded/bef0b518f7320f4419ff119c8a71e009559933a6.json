It took him some 30 seconds to get out of his cruiser, get to the car and pull its driver out \u2013 literally moments before it was struck by a train.\n\nCheck out the amazing life-saving work by Trp. Correa this morning! pic.twitter.com/O6du6AN9Oo \u2014 Utah Highway Patrol (@UTHighwayPatrol) October 16, 2019\n\nIt turned out that the driver fell unconscious and got himself into such daring situation due to an unspecified \u201cmedical condition.\u201d\n\nJust as the trooper and the driver got away from the vehicle, a FrontRunner commuter train smashed into the car. The train driver had apparently seen the obstacle and sounded his horn, but it was too late to bring the double-decker train to a stop.\n\nMore remarkable images from this morning's rescue. pic.twitter.com/cHSdsULahs \u2014 Utah Highway Patrol (@UTHighwayPatrol) October 16, 2019\n\nThe stricken SUV was dragged for some 30 feet (10 meters), before it was pushed into a ditch, heavily damaged. If not for Correa, it is unlikely the driver would have walked unharmed \u2013 or alive \u2013 from such a crash. Neither the as-yet-unidentified driver nor the heroic trooper suffered any injuries during the incident.\n\nLike this story?
