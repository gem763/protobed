That Auburn / Oregon game was great. The Tennessee / Georgia State was very good and entertaining as Ryan Leaf and Peyton Manning had fun towards the end with Peyton saying that Ryan wasn't going to be allowed to announce Tennessee games in the future. Ryan was point on about the lack of effort (sorry Capital) from the Tennessee players.\n\nThe trouble is that the impact of the Auburn / Oregon game is the tendency of colleges to create weak schedules so teams have better chance to go undefeated deep into their schedule. I AM tired of the same 4-5 teams in the College Playoffs and tired that Clemson weak schedule. Here's the listing for strength of schedule - (51) Kentucky, (52) Boston College, (53) Notre Dame, (54) Wake Forest, (55) Utah, (56) Cincinnati, (57) Oklahoma State, (58) Utah State, (59) Nebraska, (60) Arizona State, (61) Washington State, (62) Baylor, (63) Rice, (64) Houston, (65) Tulsa, (66) Clemson, (67) Tulane, (68) Syracuse, (69) Miami (FL), (70) Hawaii, (71) Navy, (72) SMU, (73) UTSA, (74) NC State, (75) Virginia. Why the ACC is considered a top conference is beyond me.\n\nLooking forward to more entertaining Saturdays.", "description": "Of the good match-ups the Ducks are looking solid.
