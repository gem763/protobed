It also provides a road map for Democrats to seek corroborating witnesses and evidence , which will complicate the president\u2019s efforts to characterize the findings as those of a lone partisan out to undermine him.\n\nIn response, Trump threatened \u201cthe person\u201d who he said gave information to the whistleblower as he spoke at a private event in New York with staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said in audio posted by The Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Sunday also on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d Schiff said that the president\u2019s behavior was so \u201cegregious\u201d that House lawmakers were forced to open an impeachment inquiry relating to his call with the Ukrainian leader.\n\n\"The gravamen of the offense here is the president using the power of his office to coerce a foreign nation into helping his presidential campaign to once again interfere in our election, and at the same time withholding foreign aid that country so desperately needs to fight off who? The Russians,\" Schiff said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe situation demands that we move forward with the inquiry.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump over his July 25 phone call with Zelensky. Democrats have claimed the president threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.\n\nThe probe was prompted by a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower who accused Trump of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"\n\nPelosi specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July call with Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence was blocking the release of that complaint, she said: \"This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.\"\n\nTrump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchiff on Sunday said that while he expects the White House to push back on the House\u2019s attempts to ascertain information regarding the president\u2019s actions, any attempts to thwart the investigation would be viewed as obstruction.\n\n\"The president can't have it both ways \u2014 he can't both prevent us from getting evidence on these serious underlying crimes, or potential crimes, this serious breach of his oath of office, and at the same time obstruct our investigation,\" he said. \u201cEven as he tries to weaken our ability to get facts on one, he\u2019s going to strengthen the facts on the other.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that House lawmakers have reached an agreement with the whistleblower who filed a complaint about President Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to testify before a congressional committee.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/27/694940094001_6089891043001_6089893388001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
