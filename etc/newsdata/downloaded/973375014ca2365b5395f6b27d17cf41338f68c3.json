This raises questions about the intelligence community\u2019s behavior regarding the August submission of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump. The new complaint document no longer requires potential whistleblowers who wish to have their concerns expedited to Congress to have direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing that they are reporting.\n\nThe brand new version of the whistleblower complaint form, which was not made public until after the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint addressed to Congress were made public, eliminates the first-hand knowledge requirement and allows employees to file whistleblower complaints even if they have zero direct knowledge of underlying evidence and only \u201cheard about [wrongdoing] from others.\u201d\n\nThe internal properties of the newly revised \u201cDisclosure of Urgent Concern\u201d form, which the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG) requires to be submitted under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA), show that the document was uploaded on September 24, 2019, at 4:25 p.m., just days before the anti-Trump complaint was declassified and released to the public. The markings on the document state that it was revised in August 2019, but no specific date of revision is disclosed.\n\nThe complaint alleges that President Donald Trump broke the law during a phone call with the Ukrainian president. In his complaint, which was dated August 12, 2019, the complainant acknowledged he was \u201cnot a direct witness\u201d to the wrongdoing he claims Trump committed.\n\nA previous version of the whistleblower complaint document, which the ICIG and DNI until recently provided to potential whistleblowers, declared that any complaint must contain only first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoing and that complaints that provide only hearsay, rumor, or gossip would be rejected.\n\n\u201cThe [Intelligence Community Inspector General] cannot transmit information via the ICPWA based on an employee\u2019s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing,\u201d the previous form stated under the bolded heading \u201cFIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.\u201d \u201cThis includes information received from another person, such as when an employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions, [the Intelligence Community Inspector General] will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA,\u201d the form concluded.\n\nMarkings on the previous version of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form show that it was formally approved on May 24, 2018. Here is that original Disclosure of Urgent Concern form prior to the August 2019 revision:\n\nHere is the revised Disclosure of Urgent Concern form following the August 2019 revision:\n\nThe Ukraine call complaint against Trump is riddled not with evidence directly witnessed by the complainant, but with repeated references to what anonymous officials allegedly told the complainant: \u201cI have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials,\u201d \u201cofficials have informed me,\u201d \u201cofficials with direct knowledge of the call informed me,\u201d \u201cthe White House officials who told me this information,\u201d \u201cI was told by White House officials,\u201d \u201cthe officials I spoke with,\u201d \u201cI was told that a State Department official,\u201d \u201cI learned from multiple U.S. officials,\u201d \u201cOne White House official described this act,\u201d \u201cBased on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me,\u201d \u201cI also learned from multiple U.S. officials,\u201d \u201cThe U.S. officials characterized this meeting,\u201d \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me,\u201d \u201cI learned from U.S. officials,\u201d \u201cI also learned from a U.S. official,\u201d \u201cseveral U.S. officials told me,\u201d \u201cI heard from multiple U.S. officials,\u201d and \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me.\u201d\n\nThe repeated references to information the so-called whistleblower never witnessed clearly run afoul of the original ICIG requirements for \u201curgent concern\u201d submissions. The change to the \u201curgent concern\u201d submission form was first highlighted on Twitter by researcher Stephen McIntyre.\n\nThe complainant also cites publicly available news articles as proof of many of the allegations.\n\n\u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events\u201d characterized in the document, the complainant confessed on the first page of his August 12 letter, which was addressed to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the respective chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees. Hearsay is generally inadmissible as evidence in U.S. federal and state courts since it violates the constitutional requirement that the accused be given the opportunity to question his accusers.\n\nThe anti-Trump complaint also made several false claims that have been directly refuted and debunked. While the complaint alleged that Trump demanded that Ukraine physically return multiple servers potentially related to ongoing investigations of foreign interference in the 2016 elections, the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky shows that such a request was never made.\n\nThe complainant also falsely alleged that Trump told Zelensky that he should keep the current prosecutor general at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, in his current position in the country. The transcript showed that exchange also did not happen.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint falsely alleged that T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a U.S. State Department official, was a party to the phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call,\u201d the complaint alleged. Shortly after the complaint was released, CBS News reported that Brechbuhl was not on the phone call.\n\nIn a legal opinion that was released to the public along with the phone call transcript, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) determined that the complainant\u2019s submission was statutorily deficient and therefore was not required to be submitted to Congress. The White House nonetheless declassified and released the document to Congress late Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cThe complaint does not arise in connection with the operation of any U.S. government intelligence activity, and the alleged misconduct does not involve any member of the intelligence community,\u201d the September 3 OLC opinion noted. \u201cRather, the complaint arises out of a confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received secondhand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is whether such a complaint falls within the statutory definition of \u201curgent concern\u201d that the law requires the DNI to forward to the intelligence committees,\u201d the OLC opinion continued. \u201cWe conclude that it does not.\u201d\n\nIt is not known precisely when the August 2019 revision to the whistleblower complaint form was approved, nor is it known which, if any, version of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the complainant completed prior to addressing his complaint to Congress.\n\nReached by phone on Friday afternoon, a Director of National Intelligence official refused to comment on any questions about the secret revision to the whistleblower form, including when it was revised to eliminate the requirement of first-hand knowledge and for what reason.", "description": "Federal records show the intel community secretly revised a whistleblower complaint form to eliminate the requirement of first-hand knowledge of wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Sean Davis"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CIA-Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
