These are not party islands, but friends are easy to make in bars made of driftwood.\n\nInternet, ATMs, 24-hour electricity and hot water should not be taken for granted and many resorts close for rainy season. Bring a flashlight.\n\nKoh Mak: Join the community\n\nKoh Mak sits near Koh Chang in the eastern Gulf of Thailand. Shutterstock\n\nFive Chinese-Thai families whose ancestors arrived in the 19th century still cultivate much of the land on Koh Mak, a star-shaped island near Koh Chang in the eastern Gulf of Thailand.\n\nIntimate, family-friendly resorts sit among pineapple farms, rubber groves, villages and pink-tinted sand overlooking the satellite isles. The largest of these is Koh Kradat, curiously home to a herd of deer that first arrived by order of King Chulalongkorn more than a century ago.\n\nEight miles west of Mak, Koh Rang is a brilliant undeveloped island with powdery sand and reefs in crystal water, protected by the Mu Koh Chang Marine Park.\n\nSandflies are an occasional problem on Mak and should that be the case, nearby Koh Kood is another fine alternative.\n\nGetting there: Ferries depart regularly from Laem Ngop, and high-season speedboats connect Koh Mak to Koh Chang and Koh Kut.\n\nKoh Phaluai: Slow-paced Samui escape\n\nKoh Phaluai is the biggest island in the Mu Ko Ang Thong Marine Park. David Luekens\n\nSeasoned travelers who bemoan how the Gulf of Thailand's Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao transformed from farming isles to tourism juggernauts don't always realize that there are a few nearby islands that are like throwbacks from the 1970s.\n\nSet 15 miles west of Samui, Koh Phaluai is partly overseen by the government-protected Mu Ko Ang Thong Marine Park. In the forested south, a few resorts provide bungalows and longtails for cruising to marvelous Song Phi Nong Beach, where camping is possible.\n\nAfter a couple of nights on Phaluai, consider hiring a boat and heading four miles north to the park-run campground at Koh Wua Talap, another terrific kayaking base.\n\nGetting there: One daily boat departs at 1:00 p.m. from Koh Samui's Don Sak pier.\n\nKoh Chang (Ranong): Wave to Myanmar\n\nFrom Koh Chang's Long Beach, travelers can see Myanmar's Zadetkyi island. David Luekens\n\nNot to be confused with the larger and more popular Koh Chang found near Koh Mak, this other \"Elephant Island\" stands within view of Myanmar at the northern crest of Thailand's Andaman Sea coast.\n\nSingle-lane roads become dirt tracks that narrow to hiking trails and pierce a wildlife sanctuary in the jungle-cloaked south. To the north, roughly 50 islanders tend fragrant cashew trees.\n\nWith names like Hornbill and Sunset, $10-per-night bungalow resorts dot Long Beach and several coves, some accessible only by boat or a three-hour hike over the mountains.\n\nSome visitors split their time with Chang's comfier sister, Koh Phayam, where dive boats launch for sites in Thailand and Myanmar.\n\nGetting there: Ferries for Koh Chang depart regularly from the pier near Talad Pla in Ranong town on the mainland.\n\nKoh Phra Thong: Bring a shovel?\n\nPedaling through the savannah interior of Koh Phra Thong. Shutterstock\n\nEmerging from a confusion of mangroves north of Phuket, \"Golden Buddha Island\" took its name from the solid gold image buried below either the white inland dunes or empty golden beaches -- or so the story goes.\n\nBefore cozying under a mosquito net after a day spent lounging in the sand or pedaling through the savannah interior, stroll to the beach to see if glowing bioluminescent plankton accompany the starlight.\n\nGetting there: Longtail boats launch from piers near Khuraburi, Phang Nga province.\n\nRelated content 40 Thai foods we can't live without\n\nKoh Jum/Koh Pu: Either name will do\n\nThe island is commonly known as Koh Pu in the north and Koh Jum in the south. Shutterstock\n\nAn easygoing vibe pervades the bougainvillea-draped lanes and sparsely developed beaches on this two-name island, which delights those coming from the bustle of nearby Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta.\n\nA conical 1,385-foot mountain towers over Koh Pu, a name used only for the island's northern terrain. Miles of khaki-sand beaches rim the south, known as Koh Jum and sprinkled with quality budget resorts like Woodland Lodge and Jungle Hill.\n\nOn Golden Pearl Beach, Koh Jum Beach Villas delivers a level of luxury not commonly found on alternative islands.\n\nSome prefer remote Luboa Beach for the cheap huts and mellow vibe at bars like Peace Paradise, one of a few painted red, yellow and green.\n\nGetting there: Local boats depart from Laem Kruat in Krabi. During the high season, ferries running between Krabi town and Koh Lanta stop at Jum/Pu.\n\nKoh Mook: More than an Emerald Cave\n\nJust another Koh Mook morning. Shutterstock\n\nThe \"Pearl Island\" of Trang province is a top-notch base for island hopping, with plenty of beaches and jungle trails for on-island amusement.\n\nAt Tham Morakot, or \"Emerald Cave,\" a gap in the base of a limestone cliff leads to a dark sea passage. After a few hundred feet, swimmers and kayakers emerge at an extraordinary beach encircled by vertical limestone -- so steep that only monkeys descend it.\n\nHit the cave on a boat tour that might also include the snorkeling hubs of Koh Kradan, Koh Ngai and Koh Rok.\n\nAfterward, settle into Mong Bar at sunset followed by Ting Tong Bar after dark for stories of cobras and wild-eyed Swedes.\n\nGetting there: Local boats depart from Kuan Thung Khu pier near Trang town, and regional island-hopping ferries stop at Mook in high season.\n\nKoh Libong: Meet the dugongs\n\nKoh Libong's quaint Batu Bute village at low tide. David Luekens\n\nMost of the small resorts on Koh Libong stand on Lang Kao Beach, with its many swings hung beneath the lava-red leaves of umbrella trees.\n\nWhen swimming becomes difficult because of low-tide rocks, visitors can explore a diverse topography of farmland, jungle, savannah, mangroves and karst.\n\nFrom the top of a five-story purple tower in quaint Batu Bute, gaze at the island's gold-topped mosque and look for Libong's most beloved residents: the dugongs.\n\nAmid the mangroves and sea grass of Libong Wildlife Sanctuary, kayakers might have a close encounter with some of the last of roughly 200 dugongs, gentle relatives of the manatee, alive in Thailand.\n\nFamily-run Libong Beach Resort offers dugong-spotting tours and simple yet romantic bungalows.\n\nGetting there: Hat Yao pier in Trang province services the local ferries.\n\nKoh Lao Liang: Unreal beauty away from the crowds\n\nKoh Lao Liang offers beachside camping and stunning limestone cliffs. David Luekens\n\nThose looking to avoid the masses at some of Thailand's most beautiful small islands should head for Koh Lao Liang -- two stunning islands that rise from the Andaman Sea.\n\nPart of Mu Ko Phetra Marine Park in Thailand's southwest, the little sister of the two hosts Lao Liang Island Resort , which provides large tents that unzip to an outlook of turquoise water and gnarly cliffs. Park rangers also provide kayaks, snorkels and climbing gear.\n\nSlightly larger and equally handsome, the big bro Lao Liang has no development save a few shacks used by climbers who scale the crags in search of swallows' nest, a delicacy in bird's nest soup.\n\nGetting there: Hire a private longtail at Hat Yao or Koh Sukorn, or catch a Tigerline island-hopping ferry for a transfer to Lao Liang.\n\nKoh Bulon: Serenity to the bone\n\nEnjoy delicious Thai seafood dishes at Chao Le Homestay, a family establishment on the island. David Luekens\n\nA little pink school occupies prime beachfront on this petite solar-powered island, accessed via the same pier town that clogs up with ferries bound for Koh Lipe.\n\nSnorkeling and kayaking are possible, but many visitors are happiest swinging in a hammock or wandering past the goats, butterflies and batik fabrics hung out to dry.\n\nIt's only a 15-minute stroll from the powdery sand of \"School Beach\" to the fishing village at Mango Bay, one of three languid coves.\n\nOn Panka Yai Bay, fill up on seafood caught by a member of the family behind Chao Le Homestay, named after the \"sea people\" who have inhabited Bulon and other islands in the region for generations.\n\nGetting there: A daily speedboat launches from Pakbara in high season, when regional island-hopping ferries also stop at Bulon.\n\nKoh Tarutao: Enter the jungle\n\nOn Koh Tarutao, even the piers are stunning. David Luekens\n\nWithin view of Malaysia's Langkawi Island, nearly every inch of the fourth largest island in Thailand remains covered in virgin forest.\n\nWith a name that means \"Mysterious Island\" in an old Malay dialect, Koh Tarutao served as a prison from 1937-48 and signage at fascinating Talo Wao Bay recounts how abandoned prisoners turned to piracy for survival during World War II.\n\nGetting to that point -- or the 2.5-mile beach at Ao Son -- requires pre-booking a truck or tackling a mountainous 10-mile trek or bike ride on a mossy single-lane road.\n\nCabins, tents and canteens are offered by the Mu Ko Tarutao Marine Park, which also covers Koh Khai, Koh Adang and Koh Rawi further west.\n\nEstablishing a model for the modern network of Thai marine parks, rangers narrowly escaped gunfire from illegal dynamite fishermen after the park was founded in 1974.", "description": "Been to all of Thailand's island hotspots and now crave some peace and quiet?
