Aramco is looking to float 1% to 2% of its shares on Saudi Arabia's Tadawul market before offering the remainder of a 5% stake to international investors.\n\nThe public offering process will officially kick off Sunday and trading is slated to begin December 11, according to state TV channel Al Arabiya. Saudi Aramco has not confirmed those dates.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman previously called for the company to be valued at $2 trillion, but analysts and investors have balked at the lofty valuation. If the 5% stake is offered at a $2 trillion valuation, the public offering could bring in as much as $100 billion, four times the largest IPO to date.\n\nAramco disclosed its nine-month earnings to analysts working on the offering, and comparative figures from prior periods or future projections aren't yet public. The oil company previously disclosed income of $111 billion for all of 2018.\n\nThe disclosed earnings are likely lower than the company's projections, as they cover the period when oil production was crippled by September drone attacks. The strikes led the price of oil to spike as much as 20%, and Aramco was forced to rely on reserves as it repaired damaged infrastructure.\n\nProduction will return to \"maximum sustained capacity\" by the end of November, CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC earlier in October.\n\nApple is currently the world's most profitable public company, reporting $59.35 billion in net income for 2018.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nThe ongoing move out of stocks into bonds and cash is the biggest since 2008, Goldman Sachs says\n\nBeyond Meat's shares sink as locked-in investors see 'the time to cash out'\n\nAn investor who turned $15 million of firmwide assets into $200 million explains his 3-part process for picking stocks \u2014 and breaks down a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity he sees in uranium", "description": "Saudi Aramco told bankers working on its initial public offering that it earned $68 billion in the first nine months of 2019, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. ...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5db81617dee0191bbd318314-2400/2019-10-17t180904z1lynxmpef9g1w7rtroptp4saudi-aramco-ipo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
