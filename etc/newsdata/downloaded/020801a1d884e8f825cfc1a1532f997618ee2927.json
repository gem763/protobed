Although real GDP increased 3.1% in the first quarter, second quarter GDP growth tempered to 2%.\n\nRosengren said the slowing is not necessarily a bad thing, and reflects \u201croughly what we think potential is.\u201d Pointing to a strong U.S consumer, he said positive readings on personal income, stock market levels, housing prices, and unemployment claims show a healthy economy.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren. (Yahoo Finance) More\n\nAlthough Rosengren said he does not want to prejudge the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s next policy-setting meeting taking place Oct. 29 and 30, he said incoming data on the U.S. consumer \u201cshould be strong,\u201d in which case \u201cthere\u2019s not nearly as much of a need to do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons to kind of sit back and wait and watch is to see whether we have sufficient amount of accommodation now or not,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\nReflecting on his dissents\n\nRosengren dissented from both Fed decisions this year to cut rates, saying that the data did not show a U.S. economy in need of accommodation. The federal funds rate target is now in a range of 1.75% to 2%.\n\nHe added that if anything, lower rates would encourage more corporate lending and recently flagged WeWork-like shared office space models as another risk.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that these kind of models rely on long-term leases but then provide space to people on a shorter-term basis,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of financial stability issue that we\u2019ve had at other times, where we\u2019ve had a mismatch of assets and liabilities.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues who have supported rate cuts, on the other hand, have pushed for the Fed to pre-emptively cut rates to soften the blow of an escalating trade war. Manufacturing figures have shown some effects of tariffs on the economy, as the ISM manufacturing index fell to its lowest level since mid-2009.\n\nRosengren said three dissents (a record under Fed Chairman Jay Powell) point to healthy debate within the central bank.\n\n\u201cSometimes we have contentious meetings, sometimes they\u2019re not so contentious,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cTurning points in the economy are times when people are going to disagree.\u201d\n\nOn data-dependence, Rosengren suggested that policymakers appear to agree that the data \u201chaven\u2019t been all that bad,\u201d but said the underlying debate over future policy lies in how substantial the risks are.\n\nIn the Boston Fed district, which covers New England, Rosengren says trade risks have not affected his contacts all that much. Although the yield curve has flashed concerns in financial markets, Rosengren said businesses in his district are more concerned about the tight labor market making it difficult to find workers.\n\n\u201cWe may not be as affected as other parts of the country,\u201d Rosengren said of trade concerns. \u201cSo that may account for some of the difference. But my overall expectation is the economy grows strong enough, we don\u2019t have a recession, and that labor markets remain tight.\u201d\n\nBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.
