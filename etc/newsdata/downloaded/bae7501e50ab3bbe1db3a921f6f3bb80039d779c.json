Immediately, QCOM stock shot to the moon.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, shares have settled down into their usual cadence, ebbing and flowing based on the news or interpretations of earnings reports. Still, Qualcomm stock is up 37% for the year. Outside of an extremely bearish news item, QCOM seems assured of closing out 2019 deep in the black.\n\nThat said, some of the positive momentum appears to be waning. For instance, QCOM stock recently incurred three negative sessions in a row. And yesterday, Sept. 16, was particularly interesting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn this day, Qualcomm announced that it would buy the rest of its interest in RF360 Holdings, a joint venture between QCOM and TDK (OTCMKTS:TTDKY). RF360 specializes in RF front-end filters, which are necessary components in rolling out the 5G network.\n\nAccording to a statement from Qualcomm, the acquisition enables the organization to \u201cdeliver a truly complete solution\u201d for mobile platforms. Theoretically, the news should lift Qualcomm stock. Thanks to rival Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) bungled attempt at developing 5G modems, QCOM enjoys significant breathing room.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not how the markets viewed things. Instead, QCOM stock slipped about 0.5% in the Monday session.\n\nThis is hardly a time to panic. Nevertheless, it is interesting that despite having a clear advantage in the 5G arena, Qualcomm stock has not been able to capitalize on it recently. Still, I wouldn\u2019t give up on this compelling tech opportunity.\n\nNearer-Term Concerns Conflict with Longer-Term Narrative\n\nJust as it\u2019s not surprising that QCOM stock is having an outstanding year overall, it\u2019s also no mystery why shares have recently slowed.\n\nPrimarily, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war puts a damper on most industries. More worryingly, some economic experts have voiced their concerns that the trade war could drag on for years. Such a scenario is especially problematic for Qualcomm stock. The San Diego-headquartered tech firm generates about 65% of its revenue from China.\n\nMoreover, troubles in Europe, such as Brexit and Germany teetering toward recession, weigh on global markets. Logically, if Europe\u2019s biggest economic powers hit choppy waters, it doesn\u2019t bode well for the rest of the continent. Also, such a negative development hurts broader consumer demand.\n\nAfter all, 5G-ready phones are rare. And if you really want one, you\u2019re going to have to pay a pretty penny. According to CNBC, you\u2019re looking at $1,300 for a Samsung Galaxy S10+ 5G, which runs on Qualcomm\u2019s current Snapdragon 8 platform.\n\nMoreover, the 5G rollout has only occurred in limited locations. Thus, if you\u2019re not in one of those areas, you\u2019re out of luck. In the here and now, these nearer-term concerns weigh on QCOM stock.\n\nThat said, speculators may want to advantage these lulls in the pricing dynamics for Qualcomm stock. The tech firm is hard at work in not only driving innovation, but also toward implementing cost efficiencies. Earlier this month, management announced that they\u2019re developing 5G platforms for less expensive phones.\n\nJust as importantly, this news item coincides with telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) committing to developing 5G infrastructures in dozens of major U.S. cities. Thus, the tech-based fundamentals for QCOM stock are lagging the underlying infrastructure. But by the end of next year, this situation should resolve itself.\n\nGeopolitics Favor QCOM Stock\n\nUnderstandably, many investors are leery about tech names. That sentiment would only be amplified during a recession.\n\nBut even here, I think Qualcomm stock has some safety measures. Amid the natural capitalistic drive to develop 5G technologies, a geopolitical motivation exists as well. Like it or not, we\u2019re embroiled in a tech cold war with our adversaries, primarily Russia and China.", "description": "Unsurprisingly, technology firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is enjoy a strong year in 2019.
