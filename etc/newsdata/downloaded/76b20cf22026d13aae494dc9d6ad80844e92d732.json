How retarded is that?'\n\nIt may seem bizarre to some, but Keeton has turned the condition into a full-time career, which earns him up to $1,500 a day and sometimes as much as $8,000 in a weekend - and all he is does is stick cans and bottles from brands to his head.\n\nAlthough the mysterious condition has yet to be given an official name, Keeton has a few ideas of what it could be.\n\nAs Keeton grew older and realized people would actual pay to see his bizarre talent, Keeton stopped caring about other people's opinions, he said\n\nNot only is he able to stick objects to his skin, but his wounds heal faster, he gets sick less and ages slower than the average person.
