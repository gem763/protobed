They all played a fantastic game, they hit a bunch of tough shots with defenders in their faces, won their individual battles against our guys.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere was too euphoric back home in Serbia as everyone was saying we were going to win the World Cup. I know only too well what kind of pressure that generates and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nSpain, who brushed Serbia aside 81-69 in their final second group stage match, were made to work hard by a battling Polish side but their deep roster made the difference.\n\nForward Juancho Hernangomez netted 12 of his 14 points in a frantic three-minute spell in the second quarter and his brother Willy hit some clutch shots in the last five minutes after Poland had slashed a double-figures deficit to 76-72.\n\nPlaymaker Ricky Rubio, who again pulled all the strings for Spain, led them with 19 points, Willy Hernangomez added 18 and 34-year-old guard Rudy Fernandez sank 16, having buried all his five shots from three-point range.\n\nRubio also amassed nine assists which made him the all-time World Cup leader in that department with a total of 115, surpassing former Argentina playmaker Pablo Prigioni\u2019s tally of 106.", "description": "Argentina steamrolled into the basketball World Cup semi-finals with a spectacular 97-87 win over Serbia, who were among the tournament favourites, and were joined by 2006 champions Spain who overpowered surprise package Poland 90-78 on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428378182&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891J9-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
