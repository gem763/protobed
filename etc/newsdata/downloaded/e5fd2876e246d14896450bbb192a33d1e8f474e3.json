(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nPresident Trump declined Wednesday to criticize China for pressuring the National Basketball Association to renounce a league executive\u2019s expression of support for the mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said the two sides \u201chave to work out their own situation. The NBA knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump accused NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, both of whom have criticized him in the past, of \u201cpandering to China\u201d for failing to speak out forcefully on the matter in their own right.\n\nTrump mocked Kerr for acting \u201clike a little boy,\u201d saying that the coach \u201cwas so scared to even be answering\u201d a question about the issue. The president said the two coaches \u201ctalk badly about the United States, but when it [comes to] China they don\u2019t want to say anything bad.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision not to take sides in the fast-escalating dispute that has led China to sever some ties with the NBA comes on the eve of the resumption of trade talks between Washington and Beijing. As he has sought to maintain good relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump has appeared reluctant to publicly criticize Beijing over its handling of the Hong Kong demonstrations that have lasted for weeks.\n\nAsked about the trade talks, Trump said he believes a deal remains within reach but said any agreement must be better for the United States than for China.\n\n\u201cThis has to be a better deal from our standpoint. I think they fully understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think China has a lot of respect for me, for our country, for what we are doing. I think they can\u2019t believe what they have gotten away with for so long.\u201d\n\nU.S. companies have faced increasing pressure from the Chinese Communist Party to refrain from political statements about the nation\u2019s affairs, and many have faced criticism from human rights groups for limiting their speech as a cost of doing business in the country.\n\nBeijing has moved swiftly to punish the NBA, which views China as a lucrative market for television rights and merchandise sales, after Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted last week in support of the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThough Morey quickly deleted his tweet and the NBA issued a statement calling it \u201cregrettable\u201d that his statement had \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China,\u201d Beijing was not satisfied with the response.\n\nAmid a widespread backlash in the United States that the NBA was putting financial motives ahead of more principled ones, Commissioner Adam Silver said the organization would \u201cnot put itself in position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say.\u201d\n\nChina has suspend television broadcasts of games in the country, and many of its companies have cut advertising ties with the NBA.", "description": "The president accused two NBA coaches of \u201cpandering to China\u201d while declining to take sides in a matter that has threatened the league\u2019s standing in the country.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OmjxB2UUVynCmqiTE7dsxcp2lms=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RUFNZIHK3UI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
