I asked after the game. He said he felt pretty good \u2014 just a bit clunky with a few of the plays,\u201d Wisemantel told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe have reviewed it and there are a couple of areas we need to pick up on, but he was fine. He did outstandingly well. He\u2019s a tough, competitive player who, if anything because he competes so hard, probably tries to over-rectify the situation.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of things. And it wasn\u2019t just Owen. In and around him there were a few things that were clunky.\u201d\n\nAsked what he meant by clunky, Wisemantel added: \u201cWhen I say clunky, look, I\u2019m a perfectionist. You\u2019re never going to get a perfect game. We scored six tries and five to the backs, so we\u2019re not too clunky.\n\n\u201cI probably exaggerated, because there\u2019s a story there with Owen, you are going down that route and I\u2019m trying to deflect.\n\n\u201cThere are other things I see around him that aren\u2019t perfect that we need to get right. So I don\u2019t think you can read into it too much... because in general he was good and did the role we wanted him to play.\u201d\n\nFarrell missed training on Tuesday with a stomach bug and Wisemantel suggested that he could be rested for Saturday\u2019s clash with France, which will determine who tops Pool C heading into the quarter-finals.", "description": "England are not concerned by the form of captain Owen Farrell even if his performance in Saturday's 39-10 Rugby World Cup win over Argentina was a little bit clunky, attack coach Scott Wisemantel said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438692645&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98066", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
