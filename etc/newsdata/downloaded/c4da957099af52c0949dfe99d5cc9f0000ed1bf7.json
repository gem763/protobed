For Once, It\u2019s Not About the MAX Jet.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nBoeing \u2019s stock performance has been all about the grounded 737 MAX jet for six months, but other things are going on. The aerospace company is nearing a critical decision to go ahead with a new medium-size aircraft.\n\nThe plane, referred to among aerospace people as an NMA, ranks between a 757 and a 767 in size, and is likely to be branded as a 797.\n\n\u201cWe do see a market for 4,000 to 5,000 airplanes that\u2019s between our current 737 and 787 families,\u201d said Boeing (ticker: BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg at an investor conference in February. \u201cIt\u2019s an airplane that\u2019s 220 to 270 passengers, about 5,000 nautical mile airplane. That market can\u2019t really be served efficiently by derivatives of current airplanes, ours or our competitors.\u201d\n\nBut Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland isn\u2019t sure the NMA is a good idea. \u201cThe problem with the NMA is it\u2019s almost guaranteed to be a money loser,\u201d wrote Copeland in a Friday research report. He believes, interestingly, that aircraft weight is a great predictor of long-term profitability and that given competition from other jets, Boeing will struggle to get the price required to make the relatively large NMA a winner.\n\nThe back story. A market the size of the one Muilenburg suggested is a huge opportunity in commercial aerospace terms. There are, very roughly, 25,000 commercial aircraft flying in the world, so 4,000 to 5,000 is a big number.\n\nBut there is risk along with opportunity. The cost of new aircraft design is huge, more than $10 billion, according to Copeland. If Boeing gets the specifications or market size wrong, it could hurt its margins for years.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rush to a particular time line on that decision. We\u2019re going to make a good disciplined business decision. But we\u2019re also going to continue investing in innovation,\u201d said Muilenburg at another investor conference on Sept 11. \u201cNMA is helping us create the production system of the future, and that\u2019s going to be valuable for the long run.\u201d\n\nBoeing seems to be relying on the NMA to usher in new automation technologies that will lower production costs for the entire organization.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve heard this, and we believe that big gains can be had from digitization and factory-of-the-future concepts,\u201d wrote Copeland in his research report. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t fully understand is why you have to build a new plane to have a new production system.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead. It\u2019s a fair point. Boeing wasn\u2019t immediately available to respond. The answer is likely that Boeing can do both, and that its interest in the NMA is mostly based on the market gap Muilenburg identified, between single-aisle and twin-aisle jets in terms of cost- effective range.\n\nBoeing needs to make a decision by next year, hoping to introduce the plane around 2025.\n\nOf course, the NMA is down the list of things investors are thinking about now. Boeing believes it can bring the MAX jet back into service in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe fourth quarter, of course, starts in about a week.\n\nBoeing shares are down about 9% since early March, when the second crash of a MAX jet in a matter of months prompted regulators world-wide to ground the jet. That is far worse than the return over the same span of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and other aerospace suppliers Barron\u2019s tracks.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Boeing is considering going ahead with a new medium-size aircraft.
