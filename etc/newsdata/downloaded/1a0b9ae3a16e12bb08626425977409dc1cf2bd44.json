But one street over it\u2019s just as deserted and evocative as it ever was,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cKyoto has been around for 1,300 years and I think it\u2019s wise about knowing how to take in the whole world without being completely changed, or spoiled,\u201d he adds.\n\nIyer has written on topics from globalisation and jet-lag to spirituality and rootedness. His work reflects on his journeys to more than 80 countries, as well as literature and his long friendship with the Dalai Lama.\n\nBorn in Britain to Indian parents, Iyer grew up between California, where his family moved when he was small, and boarding school in the UK.\n\nHe began his career as a writer on international affairs for Time magazine, but at 29 swapped fast-paced Manhattan for Kyoto, planning to spend a year in a Buddhist temple.\n\nWhile there, he met a Japanese woman called Hiroko and fell in love. She left her husband and the couple moved into a small suburban flat in Nara, an hour from Kyoto, known for its giant bronze Buddha and sacred deer park.\n\nAs well as seeking pleasure and new experiences, tourists should ask themselves what they are going to give to a place, \u201cnot just materially, but in the form of human contact or friendship\u201d, or attention to problems faced by people there, Iyer says.\n\nThe \u201curgent\u201d issue of climate change also means travellers must be able to justify long trips, he adds.\n\n\u2013 Tourism boom \u2013\n\nLast year a record 31.2 million tourists visited Japan, according to government figures \u2014 a massive surge from 2.8 million in 1989, when Iyer had just moved there.\n\nBehind the stats is a worldwide travel boom fuelled by cheaper flights, eased visa restrictions, and a growing middle class in China and increasingly India. Successful Japanese tourism campaigns and international events like the Rugby World Cup have also contributed to the influx.\n\nEven though more people than ever are on the move, this doesn\u2019t mean they have more in common, according to Iyer.\n\n\u201cThe world isn\u2019t small, and in some ways, the distances and differences between us are greater than ever before, partly because of the illusion of shared culture,\u201d he says.\n\nIn Iran, he visited a packed restaurant called Kansas Fried Chicken \u2014 \u201cthe closest they could get to KFC\u201d \u2014 where Steve Jobs\u2019s autobiography was on display. However, he points out, its popularity \u201cdoesn\u2019t make Iran politically or economically any closer\u201d to the US.\n\nSimilarly, Japan may have embraced baseball, but it has turned the American sport into \u201csomething deeply Japanese\u201d. And in India, \u201cthere\u2019s a bombardment of stuff from everywhere else, and yet unmistakably at every second, you\u2019re in India, for better or worse.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong, Iyer is due to give two talks: on his new books \u201cAutumn Light\u201d and \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Japan\u201d, and about the search for stillness in the hectic modern world.\n\n\u201cFor me, travel is a way of gathering lots of experiences and prompts and emotions, and stillness is how I make sense of them,\u201d he says.\n\nIyer spends several months each year with his elderly mother in California, but says when he\u2019s in Japan, unlike anywhere else, \u201cevery day lasts for about a thousand hours\u201d as he avoids using technology as much as possible, instead taking breaks to read on the terrace or play ping-pong at his local health club.\n\nGiven the angst over mass tourism, and the need for stillness, should everyone slow down and explore closer to home? Perhaps, Iyer says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a famous rock garden in Kyoto with 15 stones\u2026 people always pay homage to that place, but just around the corner is a little stone wash basin with one Japanese character on each of its four sides. They say: \u2018what you have is all you need.\u2019\n\nSometimes, you have everything you need right there, he says \u2014 \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go across the world to find it.\u201d\n\n* Pico Iyer is speaking at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival which runs November 1-10 (https://www.festival.org.hk/)", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 From crowded temples at Angkor Wat to queues to scale Everest, there\u2019s no escaping the downsides to mass tourism but", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/1f4c4c_serenity-kyoto-ancient-shrines-draws-peaceful-daily-crowds-but-pico-ayer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
