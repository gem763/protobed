When Zaid Aregawi learned that Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her first thought was of her brother Alem, who is languishing in jail across the border in Eritrea.\n\nHe crossed over five months ago carrying wood for an Eritrean businessman -- exactly the kind of trade that people in the border region hoped would flourish after Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace deal last year.\n\nBut Eritrean soldiers arrested Alem Aregawi without explanation, making him one of scores of Ethiopians who officials say have recently been taken into custody by Eritrean security forces.\n\nFor Ethiopians like Zaid Aregawi, the detentions are the most troubling sign that the peace deal -- the main reason Abiy was awarded his Nobel -- has yet to be fully realised.\n\n\"If there is no free movement from both sides, what is the point of the peace deal?\" she asked in an interview with AFP. \"They say there is peace, however we have got big problems along the border.\"\n\nAbiy's attention is currently consumed by ethnic and religious clashes that broke out last week in the capital Addis Ababa and Ethiopia's Oromia region, leaving nearly 70 dead and highlighting divisions within his ethnic Oromo support base.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of kilometres north, frustration with his Eritrea deal is mounting in cities and towns nestled among the steep escarpments of Ethiopia's northern Tigray region -- the area most affected by the 1998-2000 border war and the long, bitter stalemate that followed.\n\nResidents of Ethiopia's northernmost villages complain of a lack of progress on demarcating the two countries' shared 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) border.\n\nEritrean refugees -- who still cross into Ethiopia by the hundreds each day, according to the United Nations -- note that peace has not moderated the behaviour of Isaias, widely considered one of the world's most repressive leaders.\n\nAnd nearly everyone laments that bilateral relations hinge on meetings between Abiy and Isaias, with little input from people on the ground.\n\n- 'Peace stuck between earth and sky' -\n\n\"We can say that peace is stuck between the earth and the sky,\" said Ahmed Yahya Abdi, an Eritrean refugee who has lived in Ethiopia since the war.\n\n\"When Abiy went to Eritrea he flew to Asmara, but he didn't implement peace here, at the border between the two countries.\"\n\nThe demilitarisation of the border, especially on the Ethiopian side, is the main benefit of peace cited by most people in the region.\n\nIt has permitted some Ethiopians to cross for weddings and funerals in Eritrea with little harassment from the security forces.\n\nBut Yosef Misgina, an official in the town of Dawhan, says he receives regular reports of Ethiopians being detained, jailed and beaten in Eritrea -- often after they are caught transporting construction materials and other goods.\n\nAmong them were 13 traders who were taken into custody just days before Abiy won the Nobel, two of whom remain behind bars.\n\nOne recent detainee, Tsegay Suba Tesfay, spent two weeks in an overcrowded cell after soldiers arrested him while he was transporting rice and bottled water.\n\nHe said police officers beat him with a baton multiple times, and that he was deprived of food and allowed outside for just a few minutes each day.\n\n\"They don't give you any reason when you are detained,\" he said. \"In Eritrea, there is no freedom.\"\n\nYosef attributes the detentions to continued ambiguity about the status of the border.\n\nWhile the main crossings were opened shortly after the peace deal was signed, they have all since been closed, with no word on when they might reopen.\n\n\"Now we are asking that peace be institutionalised,\" Yosef said. \"If it is institutionalised it cannot be disrupted by individuals.\"\n\n- 'I don't accept this prize' -\n\nAn even bigger source of anxiety for the region is the border demarcation process, which so far has gone nowhere.\n\nWhen Abiy first reached out to Eritrea last year, he stunned observers by agreeing to accept a 2002 UN boundary ruling that Ethiopia had long rejected.\n\nThe ruling would transfer some villages and towns from Ethiopian to Eritrean territory, and would split the ethnic Irob community in two.\n\nIt is unclear what is holding up demarcation, but many analysts suspect Eritrea is dragging its feet.", "description": "When Zaid Aregawi learned that Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her first thought was of her brother Alem, who is languishing in jail across the border in Eritrea.
