This drives the acquisition of real estate in countries like Australia.\u201d\n\nThe bonds are backed by 719 loans to properties in the eastern Australian states, 84% of which were to Chinese residents.\n\nAustralia\u2019s four largest lenders dominate the country\u2019s home lending market, but higher capital requirements and regulatory restrictions on risky lending have caused them to halt lending to foreign investors.\n\n\u201cThe Aussie banks have shied away from this sector so this transaction is evidence that non-banks are filling that funding gap,\u201d said Calvin Leong, a director at S&P Global Ratings.\n\nLeong said higher capital requirements made it difficult for banks to lend to offshore investors, while it was also harder to verify the ability of non-residents to repay the mortgages.", "description": "Australian non-bank lender Columbus Capital has sold the first ever batch of mortgage bonds backed primarily by home loans to Chinese investors, funding operations in a segment that has been abandoned by the country's four major banks.", "authors": ["Paulina Duran", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
