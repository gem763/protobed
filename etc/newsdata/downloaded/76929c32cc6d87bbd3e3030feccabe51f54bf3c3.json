Yilek\u2019s alleged offense, after all, was merely to note that Conway\u2019s husband is one of Trump\u2019s most vociferous critics, an awkward situation that would become yet more awkward if she were elevated to chief of staff. \u201cI feel there\u2019s a part of him that thinks I chose Donald Trump over him,\u201d Kellyanne Conway told Terris. \u201cWhich is ridiculous. One is my work and one is my marriage.\u201d\n\nWhereas Trump bullies people with bluster and froth, Conway does so with precision and calm. In her discussion with reporters Friday, she said, \u201cI still didn\u2019t get an answer from her, which was the essential question, which was: Why do you call yourself a breaking news reporter if you\u2019re not writing breaking news and you\u2019re not even being a reporter?\u201d Like her boss, she can\u2019t let go.\n\nAnd when asked about what the Examiner regards as a threat to investigate reporters\u2019 personal lives, Conway goes all-in on Trumpian gaslighting and bravado: \u201cI never threatened anyone. Don\u2019t use those words \u2026 No, no, no \u2026 If I threaten somebody, you\u2019ll know it. If I threaten someone, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions If-I-Threaten-Someone-Youll-Know-It-Kellyanne-Conway-Is-Sounding-Like-Donald-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
