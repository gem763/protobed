The US-China trade dispute has eroded business confidence, hitting investment and manufacturing.\n\nDespite the continued moderate employment growth and sharp drop in the jobless rate, many economists still expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least one more time this year.", "description": "The figures come amid fears that recent weak economic data points to the US heading for recession.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16D44/production/_99480539_gettyimages-867126724.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
