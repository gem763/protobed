And that\u2019s exactly what worries Republicans.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cDo not rest! Do not sleep!\u201d McAuliffe exhorted. \u201cStop everybody you see \u2014 if they don\u2019t stop, tackle \u2019em! Explain to them why this is so important. . . . We are going to make Virginia a new state.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the Republican Party of Virginia quoted McAuliffe\u2019s words with a different spin: \u201cIt should send shivers down your spine,\u201d state party Chairman Jack Wilson wrote in a fundraising email that also invoked national Democratic donors. \u201cThis should be a grave warning to patriots like yourself. If the Soros-Bloomberg Democrats win the General Assembly this November \u2014 YOU WON\u2019T RECOGNIZE VIRGINIA ANYMORE.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Democrats win control of the state legislature Nov. 5, they will join with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to exercise their first consolidated grip on state government in a generation. All 140 seats in the General Assembly are on the ballot; Republicans are defending a 20-19 edge in the Senate and a 51-48 advantage in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nVirginia Democrats hope to build on gains they\u2019ve made in two elections since President Trump, who is unpopular in the state, won the White House. And new polling suggests some momentum.\n\nVirginia voters favor Democrats over Republicans by a slim margin, 49 percent to 42 percent, in a recent statewide Washington Post-Schar School poll, with voters who are \u201ccertain\u201d to vote giving Democrats a slightly larger edge of 52 percent to 41 percent. And by a similar margin, registered voters appear comfortable with Democrats taking majorities alongside a Democratic governor, with 48 percent calling it a \u201cgood thing\u201d and 42 percent a \u201cbad thing.\u201d\n\nThere is broad support for at least two Democratic agenda items \u2014 making Virginia the 38th state to ratify the ERA and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. When it comes to the issue of abortion, which Republicans had hoped to make into a major focus but so far are highlighting in only a few races, Virginia voters are mixed in their opinions.\n\nMore than 8 in 10 Virginians polled said they support approval of the ERA, which would mandate that state and federal laws give people the same rights regardless of their sex. Support cuts across party lines with 95 percent of Democrats, 81 percent of independents and 78 percent of Republicans in favor. A handful of Republicans joined with Democrats in voting for the ERA in this year\u2019s General Assembly session; it passed the state Senate, 26 to 14, but Republicans killed it in a House committee.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Virginians support raising the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 from $7.25 an hour, the poll found. Roughly 9 in 10 Democrats favor the increase, along with about 6 in 10 independents. Fewer than half of Republicans support it, at 44 percent, with 53 percent opposed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginians also broadly support several gun-control measures favored by Democrats, with majorities supporting statewide bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines as well as limiting handgun purchases to one a month. Decisive majorities support expanding background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws allowing authorities to seize weapons from someone deemed a danger, the poll found.\n\nBut while Virginia voters rate gun policy as the top issue in this fall\u2019s elections, with 75 percent polled calling it \u201cvery important,\u201d those who are most concerned about guns split almost evenly between support for Democrats and Republicans. That signals that both sides of the gun-control debate are energized to vote.\n\nOn abortion, Virginians largely mirror national attitudes. A majority, 63 percent, say abortion should be \u201cgenerally legal\u201d in the first three months of pregnancy, while majorities say it should be \u201cgenerally illegal\u201d in the second three months (57 percent) and last three months (73 percent), the poll found.\n\nBut most Virginians say there are some circumstances in which third-trimester abortions should be allowed, a pattern that is also found in national Gallup polling. A February Post-Schar School poll found 60 percent of Virginians said third-trimester abortions should be legal if the mother\u2019s health is at risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong Democrats, majorities say abortion should be \u201cgenerally legal\u201d for the first two trimesters, but 57 percent say it should be \u201cgenerally illegal\u201d for the last trimester. Republicans are split on first-trimester abortions \u2014 44 percent say legal, 49 percent say illegal \u2014 and resoundingly against abortions after that point, the poll found.\n\nNearly two-thirds of independents support legal abortions for the first trimester, while majorities are against abortions later than that.\n\nAbortion flared up as an issue early this year when Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) presented a bill to a House committee that would have loosened restrictions for late-term abortions. Republicans circulated video of her testifying that the bill would permit abortions up to the point of delivery. When Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, defended Tran by clumsily describing medical procedures, Republicans, including Trump, accused him of favoring infanticide. Northam, who has volunteered at a pediatric hospice, called that suggestion \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe issue subsided over the summer after several other states took actions to severely limit access to abortions, prompting abortion rights advocates to suggest that Virginia Republicans were planning similar restrictions.\n\nLess than half of Virginia voters, 46 percent, say abortion is very important in their vote for the General Assembly, ranking lowest among six issues tested in the poll, which was conducted by The Post and George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government. These abortion-focused voters are split in their vote preference for the state legislature, with 48 percent backing Republicans and 47 percent backing Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have mounted a broader strategy of warning about sweeping policy changes that could result if Democrats control the legislature as well as the executive mansion \u2014 from higher \u00adtaxes to compulsory union membership and seizing of guns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse Speaker Kirk Cox has warned that Virginians would see higher electric rates under Democrats because they favor a regional greenhouse gas initiative.\n\n\u201cOur majority in the House of Delegates is the only thing standing between Virginia consumers and high electricity bills,\u201d Cox (R-Colonial Heights) said in a conference call with reporters in September.\n\nIn a debate Wednesday night, Sen. Glen Sturtevant (R-Richmond) \u2014 whose suburban district is a key battleground \u2014 said Democratic policies favoring unions would \u201cmean jobs and business and the strong economy leaving Virginia immediately.\u201d\n\nLobbyists for business interests are wary of a Democratic takeover of the House \u2014 not for partisan reasons, they say, but because Democrats have been locked out of power so long in that chamber that lobbyists don\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the House, you\u2019ve got a situation where charitably, maybe two people [on the Democratic side] have ever chaired a committee,\u201d said one lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nBut they do not have the same concern about a Democratic takeover of the Senate, which was last in Democratic hands in 2014. \u201cThose who will be in charge have been in charge before, and the commonwealth was not torn asunder,\u201d the lobbyist said. \u201cThere\u2019s a confidence level.\u201d\n\nDemocrats argue that their agenda is popular among most Virginians. They note that several Republican candidates in swing, suburban districts have advertised positions in line with Democrats, from supporting certain gun-control measures to expanding Medicaid \u2014 both policies that Republicans long opposed in the General Assembly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese commercials are actually helping us because it\u2019s highlighting that they knew what the right thing to do is and they just didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Del. Lamont Bagby (D-Henrico), chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.\n\nBagby noted that Republicans such as Cox are holding neighborhood events for black constituents who were moved into their districts under court order this year, after federal judges ruled that the old district boundaries had been racially gerrymandered.\n\nHe thinks voters will be unimpressed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to fall for it this go-around,\u201d Bagby said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough moon bounces and hot dogs in the world\u201d to make them vote Republican, he said.\n\nAD\n\nDel. Lashrecse Aird, who has emerged as a young leader in the Democratic caucus, said she and others have begun planning how to execute priorities if they win a majority.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to make sure there\u2019s a balanced approach,\u201d said Aird (D-Petersburg). \u201cWe are very aware that if you try to do too much, too soon you risk the advantage that you have being in the majority.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no denying the buzz among Democrats about the potential for change. At an event earlier this year in his home district, Del. Alfonso Lopez \u00ad(D-Arlington) spoke excitedly about the potential for enacting priorities that have long been blocked by Republicans, such as tightening gun laws, protecting workers and the environment, and shoring up the social safety net.\n\n\u201cIf we have the majority,\u201d he said, in remarks widely circulated online, \u201cthe work of a lifetime is the work of two afternoons.\u201d\n\nDemocrats cheered, but the conservative Family Foundation promoted Lopez\u2019s remarks as a warning.\n\n\u201cHis point is essentially correct,\u201d the group said on its website, \u201cand this should motivate every freedom-loving Virginian to do anything they can to prevent it.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post-Schar School poll was conducted Sept. 25-30 among a random sample of 876 Virginia adults, 55 percent reached on cellphones and 45 percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points for the overall sample as well as for the sample of 814 registered voters.", "description": "New Post-Schar School poll finds support among Virginia voters for some Democratic priorities", "authors": ["Gregory S.
