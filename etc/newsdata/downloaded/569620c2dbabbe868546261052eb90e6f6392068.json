And if you\u2019re in the market, we\u2019re here to guide you toward the best of the best \u2014 including not-so-obvious vibrators, more-obvious dildos, and lots of surprisingly tasteful erotic accessories. Whether you want to give the gift of self-pleasure or heat things up with your partner, there\u2019s a little something for everyone on this list of Strategist-approved sex toys.\n\nBest vibrator\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Maude Maude Vibe Though initially thrown by the cone-shaped design of this vibrator that doesn\u2019t look like a vibrator at all, Strategist testers loved the Vibe from Maude for its surprising efficiency and ease of use with a partner. It\u2019s a no-frills, high-powered device that\u2019s fairly unisex in color and form, but the Vibe still comes in pretty packaging (and is subtle enough that you could leave it on your nightstand). $45 at Maude Buy\n\nBest gentle vibrator\n\nDame Fin Another high-design vibrator, this one from Dame was a favorite among more sensitive Strategist testers. They\u2019re described as soft \u2014 \u201clike expensive silk\u201d \u2014 with a relatively low-powered motor, and the loop-y design means this vibrator is easy to tether to your hand during solo or couple play. $75 at Amazon Buy $75 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest G-spot vibrator\n\nLelo Gigi 2 One of our testers described the Gigi 2 from Lelo as \u201cthe yacht rock of vibrators,\u201d meaning it\u2019s got many fans. With a flat tip and a curved shaft, this vibrator is designed to maximize contact with the G-spot, but it could easily be used for external stimulation, as well. Another tester noted, \u201cIt\u2019s very friendly \u2014 I could also imagine using it on a dude who likes butt stuff.\u201d $107 at Amazon Buy $107 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest vibrator to use with a partner\n\nWe-Vibe Sync Several experts we\u2019ve spoken with praise the We-Vibe as the ultimate couples sex toy. It\u2019s multifunctional, since it bends to fit the wearer\u2019s shape, and straightforward to use (even though it also pairs with an accompanying app so that you or your partner can easily adjust the settings without fiddling around with tiny buttons). Plus, according to Emmy Williams, manager of Narcisse NYC, \u201cthe fit of the toy and the vibration patterns can be customized for your preferences to a near limitless degree.\u201d $199 at Babeland Buy\n\nBest non-vibrating toy for any body\n\nNjoy Pure Wand Stainless Steel Dildo The weight and curve of this versatile dildo from Njoy make it ideal for G-spot stimulation, while the flared base allows easy access for anal stimulation. It can also be heated up or cooled down, thanks to the stainless-steel construction. However, if you\u2019re looking for something made of silicone or glass, not metal, we found a bunch of other non-vibrating sex toys that you can enjoy. $135 at Smitten Kitten Buy $130 at Lovehoney Buy\n\nBest dildo\n\nVixen Creations Bandit Dildo Of all the non-vibrating sex toys that were recommended to us, this Bandit model is worth the price if you\u2019re looking for a very realistic dildo. According to professional dominatrix Valerie August, \u201cVixen dildos are the best on the market, hands down.\u201d Experts love the luscious, dual-density silicone, which means it\u2019s soft and squeezable with a hard, heavy core, and very anatomically correct. From $119 at Babeland Buy\n\nBest anal plug\n\nb-Vibe Snug Plug This b-Vibe anal plug comes highly recommended by several sex shop owners and buyers for people interested in anal play. \u201cThese are pretty cool because they\u2019re weighted on the inside with one or two steel balls,\u201d says Andy Duran, educational outreach coordinator at sex-toy retailer Good Vibrations, and those steel balls are \u201ca great way to see if you\u2019re into anal stimulation.\u201d $46 at Smitten Kitten Buy $45 at Babeland Buy\n\nBest prostate massager\n\nBlush Performance Plus, Prostate Massager If you\u2019re looking for a sex toy for men, consider something that\u2019ll stimulate the \u201cP-spot.\u201d Accessed in prostate play, it offers \u201ca different kind of orgasm than regular ejaculation. It\u2019s a deeper, more filling orgasm,\u201d according to Samantha Bard, co-owner of the Williamsburg sex shop and event space Shag. Her pick for a prostate massager for beginners is this one from Blush, because it\u2019s not too big or intimidating, but it\u2019s still made of high-grade silicone. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest masturbation sleeve\n\nPink Lady Fleshlight The Fleshlight is the original male masturbation tool, and \u201cit\u2019s got a loyal following,\u201d Searah Deysach, owner of Early to Bed in Chicago, told us in our roundup of the best non-vibrating sex toys. She adds, \u201cfor people who have penises and who want the sensation of being completely enveloped in something squishy and ribbed, you kind of can\u2019t beat it.\u201d $70 at Lovehoney Buy\n\nBest toy for trans men\n\nAngel for Trans Men Toy In our search for the best toys for men, we spoke with experts who suggested this stroker, created in collaboration with adult-film star, producer, and trans advocate Buck Angel that was specifically tailored for trans men to enjoy. The strategic design gives an effect more similar to stroking or jerking off as opposed to a more clitoral-focused toy. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest cock ring\n\nScreaming O Vibrating Ring Vibrating rings are like two toys in one, benefiting both the wearer and the partner. The experts we surveyed to find the best toys for men recommend this option that\u2019s great for beginners because it\u2019s affordable and enjoyable whether it\u2019s used solo or during intercourse. $7 at Amazon Buy $8 at Babeland Buy\n\nBest silicone lube\n\nUberlube Luxury Lubricant If you\u2019re planning on getting frisky, lube is a good thing to have on hand, too. When we asked experts about the best lubes, \u00dcberlube was a favorite silicone-based option. It only has two ingredients and comes in a stylish glass bottle that looks more like body lotion than traditional lube. \u00dcberlube is also a favorite among Strategist readers, appearing on our biweekly roundups of best-selling products over 15 times. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest water-based lube\n\nUnbound Jelly While silicone-based lubes are great for endurance, water-based lubes are better if you\u2019re using silicone toys. This vegan Jelly from Unbound comes highly recommended by sex and relationship expert Shelby Sells, who uses it with toys and with partners when they\u2019re using condoms. $16 at Unbound Buy $16 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
