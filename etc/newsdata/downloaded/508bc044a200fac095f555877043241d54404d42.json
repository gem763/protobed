His whole campaign was at me. \u2018Are you a fat idiot? Yeah, dude, what\u2019re we doing?\u2019 \u201cTrump is funny,\u201d Gillis continued. \u201cHe\u2019s funnier than everyone I know. If Trump was the next comic, he\u2019d bury me. He\u2019d come out and be like, \u2018Fat. Loser. Fired.'\u201d\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m too pro-Trump,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cI will say this: Of all the presidents I\u2019ve been alive for, Trump would definitely be the funniest one to see get shot. Like, without a doubt, that\u2019d be funny. I\u2019m not asking for that; I don\u2019t want that to happen, but it would be funny to see. He\u2019d be on stage talking (expletive), the shooter would be coming at him, and he\u2019d be like, \u2018Sit down.\u2019 He\u2019d definitely make a funny noise when he got hit. \u2026 It would be funny.\u201d\n\nA little more via Variety from his stand-up set last night in NYC: \u201cI\u2019m from a sh\u2013t hole and then I moved to the city and now all my friends are woke. They\u2019re from Brooklyn. But I still have uncles. They have the internet, so I\u2019ll get online and the first status will be someone from back home like, \u2018F\u2013cking Colin Kaepernick better stand up. Like this status if you love the troops and God. Share it if you\u2019re not gay.\u2019\u201d When SNL thought he\u2019d appeal to conservatives, did they come to that conclusion because he \u2026 simply knows a few conservatives?\n\nBecause in a way I can understand that. What would the over/under be on how many right-wingers the SNL writers\u2019 room is collectively personally acquainted with? Single digits for sure. Five, maybe?\n\nGillis might have doubled the total in one fell swoop.\n\nA question for anyone out there who\u2019s familiar with his stand-up: Is the Trump assassination material new or has he done it before? I ask because it seems like something he might logically have thrown together after the Variety piece came out yesterday claiming that he was hired at SNL as a sop to right-wingers. Bad enough to lose your dream job a few weeks after landing it, but imagine then being branded as a conservative in an industry that is \u2026 not known for its regard for conservatives. He had a professional incentive to make clear in his first set since the firing that he\u2019s not on Team Red. \u201cIt\u2019d be funny if Trump got shot\u201d achieves that for him. Even if he has done that joke before, it\u2019s noteworthy that he included it in last night\u2019s material: He only spent 11 minutes onstage and knew that the press would be watching to see what he had to say about SNL. The Trump material made the cut in a big spot.\n\nHopefully for his sake he\u2019s now sufficiently redeemed that he can be cast in a \u201cKing of Queens\u201d reboot or whatever.\n\nHe had a couple of good lines last night too, in all fairness. There\u2019s an amusing bit transcribed here in which he compares racism to hunger. And he had a solid one-liner about the backlash to what got him fired, using an Asian slur in a podcast last year: \u201cI\u2019m fine with the consequences \u2013 that\u2019s it, I\u2019m not arguing. But I do want everyone to know that I have been reading every one of my death threats in an Asian accent.\u201d", "description": "\"He'd definitely make a funny noise when he got hit.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sg-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
