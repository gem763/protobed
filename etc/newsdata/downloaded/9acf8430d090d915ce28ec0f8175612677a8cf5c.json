Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as required by law, wrote a letter asking the EU to consider the possibility of rescheduling the deadline for leaving the EU again.\n\nThe \u201cMeaningful vote\u201d for the Deal is scheduled for Monday. If Johnson manages to push his agenda, the country will get a chance to leave the EU on November 1 potentially. Observers note that a slight advantage is still on the side of the prime minister, and the markets positively perceive the current version of the Deal as the least economically painful. However, there is still some uncertainty: Speaker of the House of Representatives John Bercow may refuse to vote today. Then, according to political observers, the most probable scenario is to vote \u201cin principle\u201d for or against the Brexit deal.\n\nGBPUSD fell 0.6% at the start of the trading on Monday\n\nAs the FxPro Analyst Team said, the markets still faces complete uncertainty around Brexit: all options are on the table, from a second referendum to the abandonment of Brexit. All this shifts the possible surge in volatility to a later date \u2013 the evening of Monday or Tuesday, after British lawmakers nevertheless speak out about the Deal.\n\nIf in the next two days Johnson manages to get Parliament to speak out and approve, the pound may well get some support. However, sterling has already done an impressive rally, which reduces the potential for further strengthening at this point to the 1.32 area, this year highs.\n\nIf the Parliament successfully sabotages the initiatives of the prime minister further, the pound may turn to decline on strengthening the chances of a new general election and a second referendum. The entire cycle of negotiations and approvals may begin anew, which is potentially able to return the British currency near 1.22, where it started the rally 11 days ago.\n\nThe FxPro Analyst Team", "description": "Forex Analysis by Alexander Kuptsikevich covering: GBP/USD.
