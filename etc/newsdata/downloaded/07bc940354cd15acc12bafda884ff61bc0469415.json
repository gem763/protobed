I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,' Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara on Thursday\n\nUnder the new plan, Turkey would become responsible for all of these prisoners, effectively placing the future of European security into Erdogan's hands.\n\nA senior Kurdish official warned on Thursday that Islamic State militants could break out of prisons in northeast Syria as fighting intensifies.\n\nBadran Jia Kurd told Reuters the number of security forces guarding the IS detainees would have to be reduced as the Turkish forces step up an offensive that got underway on Wednesday.\n\n'This attack will definitely reduce and weaken the guarding system for those Daesh militants in the prisons,' he said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.\n\n'This could lead to their escape or to behaviors that may get out of the control of the security forces,' added Jia Kurd, adviser to the Kurdish-led authority running much of north and east Syria.\n\n'The number of forces guarding the prisons is reduced the more the battles intensify. This poses a grave danger.'\n\nFaced with fierce international opposition to his plan, Erdogan wasted no time in threatening to release 3million Syrian refugees into Europe if leaders oppose him.\n\n'Hey EU, wake up. I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,' Erdogan said in a speech to parliament.\n\nHe bragged that 109 'terrorists' had been killed, as the defence ministry announced two border villages had been 'cleared of terror,' referring to Kurdish fighters.\n\nTurkey's operation launched Wednesday has sparked international outrage, raising fears of a new refugee crisis in northern Syria and concern that thousands of jihadists being held in Syrian Kurdish prisons could use it as an opportunity to escape.\n\nThe operation had seemed almost inevitable after US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that American troops deployed in the area were pulling back from the border.\n\nKurdish commanders said strikes on the prison were a deliberate attempt by Turkey to blow holes in the wall and free the jihadis (pictured, a damaged house in Qamishli)\n\nKurdish forces say at least four civilians, including Syriac Christians, were hurt in the Turkish bombardment - while video shows bodies lying in the streets (pictured, a damaged home)\n\nTrump has tried to justify the de facto green light he gifted his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan for an assault seen as a blatant betrayal of Washington's erstwhile Kurdish allies.\n\nNetanyahu has been careful not to be seen as criticising Trump, who has provided him with strong backing since taking office, but the US leader's perceived abandonment of the Kurds has provoked deep concern in Israel.\n\nIsraelis have questioned whether their country could be abandoned in a similar way by its most important ally in addition to longstanding concerns over whether arch-enemy Iran will move to fill any vacuum in neighbouring Syria.\n\nNetanyahu has also had tense relations with Erdogan, a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause.\n\nTrump - who ordered American troops out of the area - said Turkey's incursion was a 'bad idea' and said that Washington 'does not endorse this attack.'\n\nIn the statement, Trump added that Turkey had committed to 'ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place - and we will hold them to this commitment.'", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu 'strongly condemned' the Turkish invasion of Syria and warned of an ethnic cleansing, after Kurdish troops accused the Turks of bombing ISIS prisons to held jihadis escape.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19542210-0-image-a-93_1570716162689.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
