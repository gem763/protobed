And so this ash and debris and solution was not diluted much by other tributaries.\"\n\nNot only did many fish die, he said, but their size and distribution were also greatly affected.\n\nA bluehead sucker, a fish native to the Colorado area. Jim White says their numbers are bouncing back better than expected after wildfires in the area decimated the local fish population. (Submitted by Jim White)\n\nThere has been a 95 per cent decline in fish longer than 36 centimetres \u2014 the historical average size, he said. And fewer fish populate parts of the river that saw greater ashfall.\n\n\"These older fish did not handle the change in water quality well at all. They had a pretty devastating fish kill, with fish swimming up on the shorelines and trying to get oxygen,\" White said. \"It was just a mess.\"\n\nIn this Tuesday, June 12, 2018, photograph, hot spots glow after sunset near the Falls Creek Subdivision as the 416 Fire burns near Durango, Colo. (Jerry McBride/The Durango Herald/The Associated Press)\n\nSome fish, such as rainbow and brown trout, are usually raised in a local hatchery and restocked by Colorado Parks and Wildlife.\n\nHowever, mottled sculpin, native fish that live on the bottom of the river and are an indicator species of the river's health, were one of the most affected fish species and \"may take a little bit longer\" to repopulate, White said.\n\nFish starting to return\n\nThings are not all bad for the river. One native fish, a migratory species known as the bluehead sucker, is repopulating better than expected.\n\n\"These guys have come back and they're actually more abundant than what we've seen in the past, including young fish and juvenile fish, which is a good sign,\" White said.\n\nThere was also a record snowfall in the area last winter, which White says helped clean some of the leftover sediment.\n\nFishing in the Animas River, which has Gold Medal status, is a major part of local tourism.\n\n\"The electrofishing photos show myself guiding the raft by walking it down the channel, my temporary Pete Deren throwing an electrified \"anode\" to stun the fish, and retired Sr. Biologist Mike Japhet getting ready to net any fish that are stunned.\" - Jim White (Submitted by Jim White)\n\n\"Part of what makes Durango so special is having a river running right through the middle of town that has this quality gold medal status attached to it,\" White said.\n\n\"So that's a tough pill to swallow, to lose that angling opportunity for a couple years.\"\n\nWritten by Chelsey Gould with files from The Associated Press.
