Did any of the friends at school have anything to say?' And he was like, \u2018Well, all the boys laughed when I came in, but I don\u2019t care. I love dresses too much.'\"\n\n\"I'm trying to teach him to be confident no matter what anyone else says,\" she added.\n\nFox's husband, actor Brian Austin Green, also expressed his support for his oldest son's fashion choices back in 2017.\n\n\"I've heard from some people that they don't agree -- they don't agree with him wearing dresses,\" he said on Hollywood Pipeline's \"Straight From The Source.\"\n\n\"To them I say, 'I don't care.' He's 4 and if he wants to wear it, then he wears it. It's dresses or goggles or slippers -- whatever. It's his life,\" he added.", "description": "The actress and mother-of-three shared that her", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/megan-fox-02-as-gty-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
