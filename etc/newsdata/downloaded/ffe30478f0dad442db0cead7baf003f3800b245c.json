He had swerved in order to avoid crashing into pedestrians, he said.\n\n\"They [police] put me in jail on the spot - without any trial,\" he alleged in the interview. He added that he had been \"mistreated\" and \"tortured\" during the 10 days he spent in jail.\n\nHe also said that police went to his house and raped his wife on the day that he was released from jail.\n\n\"We didn't intend to come to Korea. We just had to flee the country,\" he is quoted as saying in the interview.\n\nMr Lulendo says he is a member of a community which has argued for several years that its members face discrimination from Angolans because of their Congolese heritage.\n\nThe South Korean high court's ruling in favour of the Angolan family overturns a lower court's decision, which sided with immigration authorities.\n\n\"It's meaningful that the court acknowledged the family's right to have their refugee application considered,\" lawyer Lee Sang-hoon, who represents the family, told Yonhap News Agency.\n\n\"We hope this ruling will also change the society's misconception of asylum seekers.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "The Angolan family, trapped in a South Korean airport for nine months, can now seek asylum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AB5D/production/_108996834_gettyimages-1163050477.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
