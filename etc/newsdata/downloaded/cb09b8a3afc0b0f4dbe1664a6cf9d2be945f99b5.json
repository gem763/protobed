Tributes are being planned for the build-up to the main Grand Prix.\n\nHamilton went on to post a heartfelt message on Instagram, in which he insisted that the dangers that the drivers face every weekend are not fully understood by those watching. \"This is devastating. God rest your soul Anthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today,\" he wrote.\n\n\"If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe you\u2019re hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough.\n\n\"Not from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport. Anthoine is a hero as far as I'm concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I'm so sad that this has happened. Let's lift him up and remember him. Rest in peace brother.\"\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Federation Internationale de l\u2019Automobile [FIA] regrets to advise that a serious incident involving cars #12 [Correa], #19 [Hubert] and #20 [Alesi] occurred at 17:07 CET on 31/08/19 as a part of the FIA Formula Two Sprint Race at Spa-Francorchamps, round 17 of the season.\n\n\u201cThe scene was immediately attended by emergency and medical crews, and all drivers were taken to the medical centre.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the incident, the FIA regrets to inform that the driver of car #19, Antoine Hubert [FRA], succumbed to his injuries, and passed away at 18:35 CET.\n\n\u201cThe driver of car #12, Juan-Manuel Correa (USA), is in a stable condition and is being treated at the CHU Liege hospital. More information on his condition will be provided when it becomes available.\n\n\u201cThe driver of car #20 Giuliano Alesi (FRA) was checked and declared fit at the medical centre.\n\n\u201cThe FIA is providing support to the event organisers and the relevant authorities, and has commenced an investigation into the incident.\u201d\n\nThe collision between Hubert and Correa caused significant damage to both cars as they hit the wall again, with Correa going airborne and coming to a rest upside down. The impact was fierce enough to expose Correa's feet as the front section of the car broke away, leaving him trapped in the cockpit, while Hubert's car broke into two as the monocoque split from the rear section of the car.\n\nHubert was born in Lyon and started karting at the age of 12, before beginning his single-seater career in 2013. He competed in the French F4 Championship, winning the title that year, and progressed through Formula Renault, Formula 3 and GP3, where he clinched last year\u2019s championship with ART that secured him a place in this year\u2019s Formula Two championship with BWT Arden.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton was speaking to the media after his qualifying performance at the Belgian Grand Prix when he saw the horrific Formula Two accident live that claimed the life of young Frenchman Anthoine Hubert.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/09/lewis-hamilton-reaction.jpg"}
