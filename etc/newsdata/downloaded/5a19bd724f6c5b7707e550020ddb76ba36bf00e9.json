Oil futures spiked to their highest since 1988, when the Iran-Iraq war was reaching its final intensity. Saudi Arabia can make up any immediate shortage of supply from its strategic stockpiles around the world and from its OPEC partners. But the prospect of more attacks, or Riyadh retaliating directly against Iran \u2013 whose output is already limited by sanctions \u2013 underscores the fragility of the world\u2019s physical supply lines. A mine tailings dam disaster in Brazil changed the dynamics of the iron ore market this year, largely in Australia\u2019s favour. Threats to oil pipelines, refineries, loading ports and tankers would be a heavy blow to a weak world economy going into a US election year. The navies of the US, Britain, and Australia are now protecting international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz after Iran began harassing passing ships out of anger with the US over sanctions. But it is all perilously close to a boil-over of the Sunni-Shia civil strife pockmarking the Middle East, and old Arab-Persian rivalries for control of the Gulf region.\n\nA satellite image shows thick black smoke rising from Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil processing facility. Riyadh reports that fires have now been extinguished. AP\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has immediately treated Iran as the culprit, yet a week ago President Donald Trump was talking of meeting with Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani to end four decades of hostility with the idiosyncratic personal diplomacy he has tried on North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un. The Saudi attack also looks like the hybrid warfare that has become a feature of international confrontations in Ukraine and even the South China Sea, where big powers use proxies and disguised special forces to strike deep but leave no return address. The unclaimed attacks on Japanese and European-owned tankers in the Strait of Hormuz in June followed a similar pattern. It is often unclear who actually controls such forces: Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps runs its own expansionist foreign policy. That also makes any response harder to target.\n\nIt is also in keeping with Iran\u2019s practice of talking peace and war at the same time. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif attended the G7 meeting in Biarritz, with French President Emmanuel Macron keen to broker a revival of the collapsed nuclear deal with the US, Europe, Russia and China. But the Iranians agreed with Britain not to deliver an oil shipment to Syria after an Iranian tanker was arrested in Gibraltar for breaching sanctions, then promptly broke the deal. And there is Iran\u2019s hostage diplomacy, with the revelation in the past week that two travel bloggers and an academic, all with Australian citizenship, are detained in the country.\n\nIf there is any logic to Iran\u2019s actions it is that widening and escalating the conflict, and cranking up the risks to global energy supplies, will pull in other countries, which will then put pressure on Iran\u2019s antagonists to ease off on sanctions or reopen talks. US allies depend on imported oil more than the US does, and with two-thirds of its oil exports lost to sanctions, Iran has nothing to lose. But Iran also runs the risk of Saudi Arabia, which has now been hit numerous times with Iranian-supplied Houthi missiles, simply acting by itself.\n\nThat would create a far bigger conflict. Three quarters of Saudi Aramco\u2019s oil exports go to Asia, with China by far the most exposed if there is a sustained oil price spike. But Australians use more energy in liquid form than they do electricity, and 40 per cent of that comes from the Middle East. Refinery closures here means that Australia holds less than the International Energy Agency requirement of 90 days' supply. But the cost-effectiveness of a national fuel reserve is still debatable. A $6.8 billion scheme, funded by levy, was proposed in 2013. Even then, it is not clear how worthwhile it might be, set against alternatives like diversification \u2013 such as the access to the huge US strategic reserve currently being negotiated \u2013 in a world oil market that, for all its shocks, is usually pretty resilient.", "description": "Iran wants to create leverage against the US and Saudi Arabia -- but it could easily miscalculate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_1030/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/018c6d8b2a3f58a08dfa6ca0af454f571ff449d1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
