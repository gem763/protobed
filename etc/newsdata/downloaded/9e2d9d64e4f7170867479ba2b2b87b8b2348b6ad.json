Because of the shared cost, prices are below what you would pay for a personal Uber ride.\n\nThe service offering comes to an saturated and Cairo market, notorious for its congestion and the trouble that brings to commuters, where minibuses are already a prominent part of the transport mix.\n\nThe immediate South African reaction to the announcement was fear that UberBus may come to South Africa \u2013 where metered taxi drivers have violently attacked Uber drivers for encroaching on what they see as their turf.\n\nTwo hours after uberbus launch pic.twitter.com/ULIQMftaz9 \u2014 isaac Matlabane (@ismatlabane) December 6, 2018\n\nDear @Uber_RSADon't even think about it, this is a death trap.
