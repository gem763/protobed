He has power, heart. It could be very interesting. Then there\u2019s AnEsonGib, he\u2019s 2-0 and fought on both [previous Youtube boxing shows] undercards against chickens. He has a strong UK fanbase.\n\n\u201cNext is FaZe Sensei, I didn\u2019t call him out but he thinks I did. It would be a really good fight, there would be a lot of talk. He doesn\u2019t scare me at all.\n\n\u201cDillon Danis. Conor McGregor\u2019s best friend... and that\u2019s it. His next credential is that he got punched in the face by Khabib. He needs something to spark his career. He is an MMA fighter but this is boxing.\n\n\u201cSoulja Boy, I\u2019ve been wanting to make this fight for a while. I think this will be the most epic, most notorious, most widely viewed.\n\n\u201cI just want to throw this name in there: Jeff Wittek. We don\u2019t really get along, don\u2019t mesh. I think you need something to lift you up from David [Dobrik\u2019s] shadow.\u201d\n\nShould Paul fight on either his own card or on the show which features his brother, his opponent will be required to turn professional.", "description": "Jake Paul has asked his fans to vote on who they want to see him fight later this year.
