After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement I won't be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Even in our currently polarized nation, it's my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will survive,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith, who was also managing editor of the network's breaking news unit, has been one of the few senior journalists on Fox News to criticize Trump.\n\nHis departure follows attacks by Trump on the network's less friendly coverage of his administration since the U.S. House of Representatives began an impeachment inquiry, which opinion polls suggest has growing support from Americans.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier on Friday that U.S. Attorney General William Barr met this week with Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox Corp owns Fox News.\n\n\"FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!,\" Trump tweeted on Thursday.\n\nIn March, Smith took issue with Trump's criticism of the late Republican Senator John McCain, and in August Smith spoke out about the \"unmistakable rise of white nationalism and white racism in America\" which Democrats say Trump has not done enough to discourage.\n\nIn September, Smith called out Trump for his mistaken insistence that the state of Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly criticized the U.S. media as \"the enemy of the people,\" has lashed out publicly against Shepard.\n\n\"Watching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews,\" Trump tweeted in August.\n\nSmith has been with Fox News since it was launched in 1996 and his departure took colleagues by surprise.\n\n\"Shepard Smith just dropped a bomb ... He was part of the glue that held Fox together. He is a supreme pro who made us all better,\" Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts tweeted on Friday.\n\nFox News President Jay Wallace in a statement called Smith \"one of the premier newscasters of his generation.\"\n\n\"While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network,\u201d Wallace said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall and Tom Brown)", "description": "In an unexpected on-air statement at the end of his daily \"Shepard Smith Reporting\" show, Smith said he had asked to leave the conservative-leaning cable news network, which is the most-watched in the United States. \"Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News.
