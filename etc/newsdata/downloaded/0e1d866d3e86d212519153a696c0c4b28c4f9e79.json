Senior shadow cabinet figures \u2013 John McDonnell, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson and Nick Brown \u2013 have all said they would want to campaign to stay in the bloc regardless of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour.\n\nHowever, Corbyn\u2019s statement is the strongest sign yet that he will resist demands to pick a side and would opt to stay out of campaigning in a second referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, allowing him to pitch himself as the neutral referee who pledges to carry out whatever the public decides.\n\nThis would help avoid the situation David Cameron found himself in as prime minister in 2016, when he resigned from No 10 after ending up on the losing side.\n\nOnly Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit Read more\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Corbyn laid down a marker of his determination to seek a better Brexit deal from the EU, which the party believes it could negotiate quickly based on conversations already undertaken with Brussels.\n\n\u201cA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU; a close single market relationship; and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d\n\nThis would form the basis of what Corbyn describes as a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d which would be offered at a referendum against the option of remaining in the EU.\n\nCorbyn also positioned Labour as \u201cthe only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision\u201d, after the Liberal Democrats changed their position to campaigning for a revocation of article 50 in a bid to attract remain voters.\n\nHe said: \u201cJohnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public \u2013 and even by the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: \u2018We didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people.\n\n\u201cLabour is the only party determined to bring people together. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let\u2019s stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and let the people decide.\u201d\n\nCorbyn\u2019s decision to set out his stall in favour of negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting that to a referendum presents a challenge to conference delegates over whether to back his stance or a more pro-remain position if it comes to a vote.\n\nAn effort to change Labour\u2019s Brexit position will start on Saturday in Brighton, where delegates will discuss 80 motions submitted by local parties in favour of campaigning to remain in a second referendum.\n\nAfter a process called \u201ccompositing\u201d, one or two motions will emerge to be voted on by the wider conference later in the week. This may end up as a battle between largely remain-supporting activists and trade unions who favour Corbyn\u2019s position, unless the two sides can agree on a compromise motion that avoids a public row.\n\nA majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible (AEP) or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour.\n\nMichael Chessum, from AEP, said: \u201cLabour has already crossed the Rubicon in promising a public vote with an option to remain. It would be utterly absurd, in those circumstances, for Labour not to campaign for remain when 90% of its members want to stay in the EU. Trying to prevent Labour from backing remain is a dead end for Corbyn \u2013 it will inevitably fail and it risks the morale of our base at at a crucial moment.\u201d\n\nLast week, Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, used a speech to argue that Labour should \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d.\n\nIn his article, Corbyn promised that he would back a general election as soon as Boris Johnson\u2019s threat of a no deal Brexit is avoided through an extension to article 50.\n\nThe issue of Brexit is likely to dominate Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton but there will also be debate over the campaign pushing for the party to adopt a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, involving a zero carbon target by 2030 and more green jobs.\n\nSeparately, the party\u2019s national executive committee met on Tuesday to agree rule changes to speed up expulsions from Labour in serious cases of wrongdoing, which will be put to a vote at conference.\n\nJon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a key Corbyn ally, won the NEC\u2019s backing to effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party. The motion said Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced, claiming it had not paid its fees. This was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair.\n\nThe NEC also agreed to consider ways to speed up selections for parliamentary candidates in key seats. Some MPs believe this will lead to candidates being parachuted in from the centre rather than letting local parties decide in all circumstances, although proposals have not yet been worked up by party officials.", "description": "Labour leader\u2019s call for \u2018sensible\u2019 deal is signal to party that he will resist call to pick sides", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be63f2dde43c1148396652730597ff0c4141b1ed/492_120_3742_2246/master/3742.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a69edfeff86a532ec2cd76b098c83e56", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
