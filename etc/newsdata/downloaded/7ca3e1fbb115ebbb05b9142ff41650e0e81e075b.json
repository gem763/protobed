I recommend that European Council endorses this deal.\"\n\nIn his own statement Mr Johnson said: \"We\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\"\n\nBut the agreement is understood to not have the support of DUP memebers of parliament, whose votes in parliament are crucial to pass it.\n\n\u201cRead our statement. It hasn\u2019t changed,\" a DUP source said.\n\nIt comes ahead of a summit in Brussels where EU leaders will meet to discuss the agreement and consider whether an extension to Article 50 is required.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in the European Commission over the road from the summit's venue, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the deal was \"the result of intensive work on the part of the two negotiating teams\".\n\n\"A point extremely important to prime minister Johnson and the UK was that Northern Ireland remains in the UK's customs territory. Discussions in the past few days have at times been difficult, but we have delivered, and we have delivered together,\" he told reporters.\n\nUnder the agreement, Northern Ireland will stay inside the UK customs territory, but UK authorities will have to collect EU tariffs for goods that are \"at risk of entering the single market\", Mr Barnier said. He added that the arrangement would allow the territory to \"benefit from the UK's future trade policy\" \u2013 a key demand of Brexiteers.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly has also been given a veto on the plans \u2013 though not to the extent demanded by the DUP.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Boris Johnson's plans to scrap commitments to a \"level playing field\" that would protect environmental, social and labour rights and keep them at the same level as the EU did not come to fruition, with the clauses remaining in the agreement.\n\nUnder the agreement, Northern Ireland will stay inside the EU's VAT regime, though UK authorities will be responsible for collection.\n\nBack in Westminster Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn describe the agreement as a \"sell out\" and indicated that his MPs would back it.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThese proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.\n\n\u201cThis sell out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "Boris Johnson has\u00a0agreed a new Brexit deal with the EU, both sides of talks have\u00a0confirmed.
