This review will begin shortly, irrespective of the IOPC\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe IOPC has informed GLA officers that they are concerned that unless the review is limited to current processes, there is a risk it could prejudice the work they are undertaking. Following completion of the IOPC\u2019s processes, the review by Kathryn Robinson and the GLA oversight committee\u2019s investigation, the mayor will consider whether any further steps are required.\u201d\n\nRobinson will review how L&P decides who goes on trade missions and how it sponsors external commercial events.\n\nAn official at the GLA formally referred the allegations to the IOPC last month because Johnson headed the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime as part of his role. The IOPC is expected to make a decision on whether to investigate by the end of October.\n\nSeparately, the IOPC has urged the London assembly\u2019s oversight committee to delay its investigation into the allegations against Johnson. A source at the assembly said: \u201cThey want us to wait until they make a decision on what they are going to do.\u201d\n\nThe committee is due to meet on Wednesday, when it is expected to discuss whether to comply with the IOPC\u2019s request to hold off. Last week a letter from Johnson\u2019s lawyers to the committee said it had no remit to investigate.\n\nThe committee has threatened to use its powers to summon the former mayor to answer questions in person, as it did over his failed garden bridge project.\n\nA fourth investigation is under way into how a \u00a3100,000 grant aimed at fostering digital talent in the UK was awarded to Arcuri\u2019s company Hacker House.\n\nOn Wednesday MPs will question the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, about why her department awarded the money to the company despite its tenuous links to the UK.\n\nQuestions have already been raised in the Commons about the due diligence carried out on the grant approval after ministers justified awarding the money \u2013 meant to be spent on improving IT skills in the UK \u2013 by saying the company had a British phone number. Calls to the number from the Guardian were answered by a receptionist in the US, where Arcuri is now based.\n\nArcuri has denied she received any favouritism from Johnson, L&P or the government. The prime minister has insisted \u201cfull propriety\u201d was followed and he has no interest to declare over Arcuri.", "description": "Police%20watchdog%20asks%20Johnson-Arcuri%20inquiries%20to%20hold%20back%20%7C%20Boris%20Johnson%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
