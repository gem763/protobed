The company said it had received conditional approvals from all but two states and that the transaction may be completed earlier in the first half of 2020.\n\nExcluding items, Centene earned 96 cents per share, narrowly beating the consensus estimate of 95 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTotal revenue rose 17% to $18.98 billion, ahead of estimates of $18.43 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Saumya Sibi Joseph and Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)", "description": "Although medical costs grew year-over-year and missed analysts' expectations, Centene said costs for its Medicaid health plans for low-income Americans remained stable.
