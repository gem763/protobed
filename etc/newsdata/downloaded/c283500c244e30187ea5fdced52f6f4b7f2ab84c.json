Today, Conte is announcing a much more individual attempt to fund creators that\u2019s not formally related to Patreon but fits squarely into its vision for how artists work today.\n\nConte\u2019s project is called Super Patron (or, technically, \u201cSuper Patron: a creator arts endowment fuck yeah!\u201d). It\u2019s an independent million-dollar endowment that funds a single $50,000-per-year grant for artists. Creators should submit an application using whatever medium they prefer, as long as the experience lasts no more than three minutes. The applications will be evaluated by a panel of judges that includes comedians Hannibal Buress and Grace Helbig, cartoonist Danielle Corsetto, YouTube star Molly Burke, and True Crime Obsessed podcast hosts Patrick Hinds and Gillian Pensavalle. Whoever wins will get a monthly stipend throughout 2020.\n\nApplications close on November 22nd\n\nApplications open today, and they\u2019ll close on November 22nd. The winner will be announced in early December, and the first funds will be distributed at the start of the year. There are no age or geographical restrictions, but applicants need at least one year of experience publicly releasing art. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for people coming out with things frequently,\u201d says Conte, not applicants who are working on a single big project. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to some partners about maybe showcasing the creator\u2019s work at the end of the year, but I expect the work to be published all along the course of the year.\u201d\n\nConte explains that the grant was inspired by author Harper Lee who wrote To Kill A Mockingbird after friends gave her a year\u2019s wages to quit her job and write full time. \u201cThe idea behind the grant is, hey, think about all the great art that could be made if people are just given the means to do it full-time,\u201d he says. \u201c[We\u2019re looking for] people who have consistent, strong creativity, a unique and clear artistic voice, and maybe have low to medium traction but have high potential. That\u2019s the point. This isn\u2019t for somebody who has a million Facebook likes, this is for someone who has high potential and we can see being able to make something that reaches a lot of people.\u201d\n\nConte imagines someday offering grants for specific categories of creators \u2014 funding business training for artists or building a database of creative pay rates \u2014 so creators can better understand how much to charge a client or pay a fellow artist. He\u2019s open to expanding the program with help from other nonprofits or partnering with creator-focused organizations like Casey Neistat\u2019s YouTuber co-working program 368. But he says he doesn\u2019t want corporate sponsorships that might make Super Patron feel like an advertising ploy, even if they could grow the endowment.\n\nSuper Patron is unrelated to Patreon but meant for Patreon-friendly art\n\nSuper Patron isn\u2019t a Patreon project. Conte says it\u2019s a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization funded with his own stock, and it\u2019s unrelated to his many future ideas for Patreon, which range from health care services to loans for artists. That said, Super Patron is definitely meant for people actively pursuing a Patreon-friendly kind of art. \u201cWe want to make sure we find a serious artist that we\u2019re giving the money to, not someone who hopes that one day they\u2019ll be an artist. We want somebody who\u2019s already started doing it.\u201d This mirrors the kind of support creators get from Patreon\u2019s subscription-style backing system, which works best for artists with an existing following.\n\nIronically, the grant wouldn\u2019t work for someone like Lee, a writer known for producing one superb novel and a much larger library of unpublished or posthumously published work. Conte acknowledges the distinction, but he argues that times are different now. \u201cThe internet wasn\u2019t around back then,\u201d he says.", "description": "Patreon co-founder and CEO Jack Conte is launching an endowment called Super Patron, which gives $50,000 per year to one creator to work on art full time.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Dta13b2DU20ZI1YM4WpvC_6J_4=/0x0:2801x1466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19309101/1161682959.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
