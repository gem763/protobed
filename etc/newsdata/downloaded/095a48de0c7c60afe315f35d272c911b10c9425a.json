Sign up here.\n\nTwo years after surviving a gunshot wound to the head, a Guatemalan asylum-seeker fled to the U.S. as part of the so-called migrant caravan, all while suffering from headaches and possible brain hemorrhaging. Once he made it to America, 27-year-old Rolando was put in immigration detention and given only ibuprofen to treat his headaches, nosebleeds, and constant dizziness, The Guardian reported.\n\nRolando fled torture and persecution in his country, he told the Guardian, only to end up stranded in Tijuana because of the Trump administration\u2019s metering policy, which limits how many people can ask for asylum at U.S. ports of entry each day. His problems didn\u2019t end when he gained admission into the U.S., where he was transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, run by the private company CoreCivic.\n\nAlthough Rolando\u2019s health reportedly worsened in detention, he told the Guardian that he was regularly put in solitary confinement and hardly had access to medical staff.\n\n\u201cI feared I was going to die,\u201d Rolando said. \u201cI thought in this country, there is really good medical care\u2026 but I wasn\u2019t getting any treatment.\u201d\n\nRolando\u2019s medical records show that the facility\u2019s staff tried to treat his bleeding eyes, ears, and nose with higher and higher doses ibuprofen, according to the Guardian.\n\n\u201cIt seems unbelievable, almost too absurd to be true, but it\u2019s not only documented, it\u2019s the government\u2019s own records,\u201d Anne Rios, an attorney with Al Otro Lado representing Rolando, told the Guardian.\n\nThere have been several allegations of medical neglect at the Otay Mesa facility. In February, more than 70 detainees signed on to a letter speaking out against conditions there, in which they alleged they had experienced racism, discrimination, and medical neglect. In 2018, a coalition of immigration advocacy groups released a report finding that substandard medical care contributed to the deaths of eight immigrants in ICE custody between December 2015 and April 2017, including one death at Otay Mesa.\n\nCover image: In this June 9, 2017, file photo, a vehicle drives into the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego.
