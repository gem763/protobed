Col. Alexander S. Vindman appears to have Donald Trump and his allies a little rattled, which makes a degree of sense under the circumstances. Vindman is the top Ukraine expert on the White House National Security Council, and according to his opening statement, he\u2019ll testify to the congressional impeachment inquiry today about his concerns over Trump\u2019s political scheme with Ukraine.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, Vindman is a White House official with direct, first-hand information about what transpired \u2013 he was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky \u2013 and his testimony appears likely to corroborate the testimony of other key witnesses.\n\nJust as importantly, Vindman, who immigrated to the United States as a small child, is a witness with tough-to-dismiss credibility: the lieutenant colonel is a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran who served in Iraq, where he was injured by an IED blast in the line of duty. He was awarded a Purple Heart.\n\nThis morning, Donald Trump nevertheless denounced Vindman as a \u201cNever Trumper witness,\u201d suggesting without evidence that the lieutenant colonel has suspect political motivations. As New York\u2019s Jon Chait added, several prominent voices in conservative media have targeted him in even uglier ways.\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national-security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interest,\u201d [Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham said] on her nightly show. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d former Bush-administration lawyer John Yoo replied. \u201cSome people might call that espionage.\u201d (Alan Dershowitz, the third member of the colloquy, smiled along.) This morning on cable news, the smear campaign continued. \u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d said former congressman Sean Duffy on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy \u2026 We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from \u2026 he has an affinity for the Ukraine.\u201d Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade added, \u201cWe also know he was born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family. Young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMy point is not that decorated American combat veterans are always right or that their conclusions must never be challenged. That\u2019s not how a responsible public discourse works in a free society.\n\nIt is nauseating, however, for Trump\u2019s allies to publicly question Vindman\u2019s loyalties because he\u2019s an American immigrant who has the audacity to tell the truth about what he saw and heard at the White House.\n\nIf this seems at all familiar, it\u2019s because the right has too often been willing to smear decorated American combat veterans who stand in conservatives\u2019 way. The Swift-Boat campaign against John Kerry in 2004 was inexcusable \u2013 I won\u2019t soon forget attendees to the Republican National Convention wearing band-aids to mock Kerry\u2019s Purple Heart \u2013 and Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness to mock John McCain\u2019s military service was just as awful.\n\nMore recently, Robert Mueller, another decorated combat veteran, was on the receiving end of far-right attacks.\n\nNo one is immune.\n\nPostscript: Trump suggested this morning that he\u2019s \u201cnever even heard of\u201d Alexander Vindman. As I noted on Twitter, that\u2019s not a great line: the president, who\u2019s been deeply and directly engaged on U.S. policy toward Ukraine, has never heard of the top Ukraine expert on the White House National Security Council?
