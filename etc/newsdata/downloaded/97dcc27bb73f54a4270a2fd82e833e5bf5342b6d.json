Hurley said she was reminded of news accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nWWL-TV aired and tweeted a viewer\u2019s dramatic video of the collapse, showing upper floors falling on top of each other before one side of the building crashed to the ground.\n\nAnother video on social media showed what looked like a metal structure \u2014 part of the building or a piece of construction equipment \u2014 tumbling to the ground and people running from the scene as clouds of dust billowed up, obscuring the view like a thick fog.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened, but they told us to get out of here,\u201d said Michael Arbeiter, 30, from Munich, Germany, a hostel guest who said he was just getting out of the shower when his room shook. \u201cThank God it was not another 9/11.\u201d\n\nOfficials said 18 people were taken to the hospital from the scene and several others went to the hospital on their own. They said none of their injuries was believed to be life threatening.\n\nUrban search and rescue teams entered a section of the building Saturday in hopes of finding the two missing people alive, said Fire Chief Tim McConnell. He said authorities believe they knew their approximate location based on talks with other survivors of the collapse. One of the two was believed to be in a relatively stable part of the wrecked building; the other, in a less stable area.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities were keeping a wary eye on an unstable construction crane looming over the building.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong possibility of further collapse of this crane right now,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nCitadel Builders LLC, the contractor on the project, said more than 100 workers were on site at the time of the collapse. An email from spokesman Brian Trascher said company officials were working with emergency workers on a plan to stabilize the building.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards was on the scene taking part in news briefings soon after the collapse. The Democrat was defending his seat in a primary election Saturday against two major Republican opponents. Edwards was hoping for an outright win to avoid a November runoff.\n\nThe new Hard Rock Hotel was under construction at the corner of Rampart Street and Canal Street, a broad boulevard just outside the Quarter, lined with restaurants hotels and retailers. Canal, which carries six lanes of traffic divided by a wide median where streetcars roll, separates the Quarter from the city\u2019s main business district.\n\nAs search and rescue efforts unfolded, police stood sentry around a group of people on the Canal Street median who were believed to be loved ones of the missing. A woman nearby said she was trying to find out the status of her brother, a worker at the site. She declined to give her name, wiping tears from her eyes as she walked away.\n\nRemoval of the damaged crane and cleanup of massive piles of debris promised to be a massive undertaking expected to tie up traffic and commerce. The site is next to two major traffic arteries where major bus and streetcar lines intersect. Among area buildings evacuated was the Saenger Theatre, where traveling companies perform Broadway Shows regularly.\n\nHard Rock International issued a statement Saturday expressing sympathy for victims and their families. The statement said the company had a licensing agreement with the building\u2019s owner, Kailas Companies, and Hard Rock had no involvement in the construction. It identified the contractor on the project as Citadel Builders LLC.\n\nCitadel issued a statement expressing its condolences for the death and injuries but did not comment on a possible cause of the collapse.\n\nKailas did not respond to messages left seeking comment Saturday night.", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A large section of a Hard Rock Hotel under construction at the edge of New Orleans' historic French Quarter collapsed Saturday amid", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/3fb4f4_hotel-collapse-23213-debris-hangs-on-building-large-portion-hotel-construction-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
