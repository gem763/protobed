Instead of working the panel Erin Molan (pictured) was interviewing players on the sidelines\n\nFrom the sidelines, Molan interviewed exhausted players as well as friends and family, including Roosters captain Boyd Cordner's dad and partner.\n\nPrior to the game she and NRL legend Darren Lockyer hosted pre-game coverage, and Molan was also tasked with hosting the State Championship Grand Final.\n\nDespite her significant involvement prior to the big game, social media users lamented the network's decision not to include her in the main game panel.\n\nThey claim it appeared the network had reverted to a 'boys club' by removing Molan from the equation.\n\nThe 2019 NRL telecast opened with NRL Immortal Andrew Johns (right) on the panel but Erin Molan was missing after reports of a feud\n\n'Where is Erin Molan during tonight's NRL coverage?,' one Twitter user asked.\n\n'Boys club... again.'\n\nAnother said he had switched stations to get fairer reporting.\n\n'Channel 9 is a boys club, and you rarely get an impartial call from them. I typically watch Fox League during the season, much better callers.'\n\nMolan split responsibilities equally with the Grand Final panel host, James Bracey, and Nine previously told Daily Mail Australia no changes were made to their hosting plans amid rumours of a feud between two of their biggest stars.\n\nVeteran journalist Molan had reportedly clashed with NRL immortal Andrew Johns (pictured) in the week leading up to the match, according to TV insiders\n\nJohns reportedly told Channel 9 sport bosses months ago he no longer wanted to share a studio with Molan and he still felt the same way leading into the finals.\n\n'He just doesn't like working with her,' a television source told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nThat source said Johns' biggest gripes were that Molan giggled and spoke over him and other Nine personalities when they were talking about football.\n\n'Joey is a stubborn bastard,' the source said. 'If somewhere along the line she's p***ed him off he'll probably carry it around for the rest of his life.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia understands Johns point-blank refused requests by the Nine publicity department to put his name to gushing statements supporting Molan.\n\nJohns reportedly told Channel 9 sport bosses months ago he no longer wanted to share a studio with Molan and he still felt the same way leading into the finals\n\nHe also told the network he would not pretend he had no problem with her.\n\nJohns has been frustrated that Nine executives were unwilling during the NRL season to address his concerns about Molan, the first source said.\n\nMolan has been commended both by colleagues and fans for her decision to continue fronting the cameras after years of trolling.\n\n'Erin Molan you were incredible. A study in resilience and bravery,' one fan said.\n\nLegendary NRL commentator Ray Warren also defended Molan. He said everybody should continue to support women in broadcasting.\n\nMolan has been commended both by colleagues and fans for her decision to continue fronting the cameras after years of trolling\n\nThe Hall of Fame broadcaster said he was disappointed with how the feud was handled.\n\n'I'm friends with both and rate them very highly. I'm surprised and a bit disappointed how it's played out all week,' he told the Daily Telegraph.\n\n'Some of the ex-players are old school and they mightn't have the discretion that they should have.\n\n'It could have been handled differently. Giving women an equal opportunity in the media, politics and everything is important, and Erin is very good at her job.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Network Nine for comment.", "description": "Network Nine have denied that Erin Molan has been relegated to the sidelines after a reported 'feud' with Andrew Johns.", "authors": ["Marta Jary", "Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/15/20218020-0-image-a-11_1572100216997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
