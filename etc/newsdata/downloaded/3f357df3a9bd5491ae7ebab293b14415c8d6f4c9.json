When deputies visited their home, they found the bombs, bomb-making materials, 23 different knives, nunchucks, hatchets, bb-type rifles, bb-type handguns, plus \u201cdozens of books and DVDs about murder, mass killing, domestic terrorism and bomb-making,\u201d said Sheriff Chad Chronister at a press conference on Friday. Each bomb contained nails, metallic pellets, or a combination of both, and \u201cwould have taken less than 60 seconds per device to add powder and fuse material she already possessed to detonate each bomb,\u201d Chronister added.\n\nHer library included \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d often described as the \u201cwhite supremacist handbook,\u201d and the manifesto of Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist dubbed the \u201cUnabomber\u201d who emailed or hand-delivered explosives to academics, business executives, and others over a 20-year period.\n\nLaw enforcement located Kolts at Chadwell Supply in Tampa, the building maintenance company where she worked as a laborer, and took her into custody. Chronister said that she admitted to building the bombs and said she wanted to use them against people. Police said that they don\u2019t know yet if she had a particular target.\n\nThursday wasn\u2019t the first time that authorities had visited the Kolts residence, however. Chronister said that Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Department received a call from a publisher in August 2018, expressing concern that Kolts had been ordering a significant number of domestic-terror related reading material and manifestos.\n\n\u201cShe had become consumed with the Columbine and Oklahoma killings,\u201d said Chronister. At that time, Kolts had no diagnosis or history of mental health problems. After speaking with her and her parents, deputies felt confident she wasn\u2019t a danger to herself or anyone else at that time. \u201cFast forward a year later, again, thank god these parents called us,\u201d Chronister said. \u201cShe was on our radar, but never reached the level of threat at that time. It was just feeding her infatuation with mass shootings and mass killings.\u201d\n\nFemale bombers, mass shooters and domestic terrorists are rare in the U.S., but Kolts\u2019 case does recall two similar recent incidents involving young women. In April, an 18-year-old woman who was \u201cinfatuated\u201d with Columbine triggered a panic in the Denver-area, forcing school lockdowns, after FBI said that she had traveled from Florida to Colorado with the intent of committing a mass shooting. After a brief manhunt, she was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot in the foothills of Denver. Last month, an 18-year-old waitress in Oklahoma was arrested after bragging to her colleagues that she wanted to shoot up her former high school \u201cfor fun.\u201d Police found an AK-47 and a 12-gauge shotgun in her bedroom.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s an entire online subculture, mostly on Tumblr, consisting of young women who are obsessed with the 1999 Columbine school shooting and who fawn over mass shooters like they were pop stars.\n\n\u201cWhile this case is certainly alarming, it\u2019s not to demonize another individual struggling with mental health,\u201d Chronister said on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s to highlight the importance of speaking up when you see something that isn\u2019t right, and what can be prevented when you do. Who knows the amount of harm that could have been done , or how many lives could have been lost, had these parents not found the courage to call the sheriff\u2019s office and seek help.\u201d\n\nCover image: Courtesy of @HSCOsheriff", "description": "\u201cShe had become consumed with the Columbine and Oklahoma killings\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d979acbf533e80009ab543f/lede/1570218776663-Screen-Shot-2019-10-04-at-35207-PM.png?crop=0.5441xw:0.4894xh;0.2295xw,0.2561xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
