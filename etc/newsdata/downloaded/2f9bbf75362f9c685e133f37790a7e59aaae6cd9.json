Cohn helped Trump and his father sue the federal government, claiming without evidence that the government's suit, based on evidence of explicit discrimination against black rental applicants, was an effort to force the Trumps to rent to, in Trump's words, \"welfare cases.\" (The Trumps eventually had to drop their suit and settle the initial one on the government's terms.)\n\nDuring his search for an attorney general, President Trump made clear he wanted Roy Cohn Redux: A fixer with the shamelessness of Michael Cohen, but with the pedigree to garner Cohn\u2019s brand of respect from the DC establishment and command an army of lawyers and investigators. When his first pick, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, abruptly recused himself from leading the investigation into Russian election interference, Trump was reportedly apoplectic \u2014 and asked in front of numerous White House officials, \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d\n\nIn current Attorney General William Barr, the president appears to have found his man.\n\nBefore Barr ever took control of the Justice Department, it was clear that he was expected to focus on Trump\u2019s needs more than the country\u2019s. In 2017, Barr was invited todiscuss joining Trump\u2019s legal defence team. In 2018, he sent an unsolicited 20-page memo to the Justice Department and lawyers close to Trump about the special counsel\u2019s investigation, arguing that the probe relied on a \"fatally misconceived\" theory. At his confirmation hearing, Barr hemmed and hawed when Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked whether the White House had already asked him to launch an investigation into anyone before declining to answer the question.\n\nOnce in office, he claimed to Congress with no evidence that \u201cspying did occur\u201d against the Trump campaign in 2016 and launched a third probe of the FBI investigation into Russian interference \u2014 attempting to enlist foreign governments in an effort that has the potential to undermine our intelligence agencies and legitimize conspiracy theories. At the close of the Mueller investigation, Barr gave a news conference in which he misled the public about the special counsel\u2019s findings, repeating \u201cno collusion\u201d as if he were reading it off the president\u2019s Twitter feed and insisting that any obstruction of justice should be ignored because \u201cthe president was frustrated\u201d.\n\nRecent news has revealed the extent to which Barr has debased his office in order to please his patron, from the Justice Department\u2019s decision to ignore damning sections of the whistleblower report to its shuttering of the probe in just three weeks. At the conclusion of Trump\u2019s now-infamous call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Trump said he would instruct Barr to follow up on his attempts to have the foreign government investigate Joe Biden\u2019s family \u2014 demonstrating that Trump, at least, expected the willing participation of his attorney general in an international shakedown. Even as Barr's actions in the Ukraine scandal were being scrutinized this week, he moved the department to join a lawsuit shielding Trump\u2019s tax returns from legal scrutiny in New York state.\n\nAmericans should know that this behaviour is not normal. During the Obama administration, I served at the Department of Justice with conscientious men and women who had worked under both Republican and Democratic leaders. In some cases, I knew their party affiliations; in many others, I didn\u2019t. It would have been unthinkable for anyone to bring personal politics to bear on their work, or to act as a hired stooge for political authorities.\n\nThe tone was set at the top: President Obama famously told new US attorneys, \u201cI appointed you, but you don\u2019t serve me. You serve the American people. And I expect you to act with independence and integrity.\u201d Attorney General Eric Holder spoke about the privilege of going to work at the Justice Department in order to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d Leaders in every division took seriously their oath to support and defend the Constitution, and to \u201cbear true faith and allegiance to the same.\u201d\n\nFor political appointees like me who had worked on the Obama presidential campaign, there was a sense of sanctity about justice \u2014 about ensuring that opportunity and equality could be made real for communities too often let down and left behind. I was moved by the women and men who made that effort their life\u2019s work, and inspired each time I walked through the entrance of the Robert F. Kennedy building, where the stone etching reads, \u201cThe place of justice is a hallowed place.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice is the only Cabinet agency named for an ideal. In a country that sets its course through lofty values and high principles, it speaks to what is best about us, what connects us to one another and what inspires us to build a more perfect union.\n\nBarr has undermined that ideal and betrayed that institution. It's time for him to go.", "description": "Government officials are supposed to work for us, but Barr does not.
