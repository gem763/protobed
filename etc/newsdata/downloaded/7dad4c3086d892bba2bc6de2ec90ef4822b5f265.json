Like really, unless you\u2019re carrying out an assault. \u2026 You can\u2019t hunt with it. \u2026 Who\u2019s going to attack your house, a (expletive) army?\u201d\n\nThe 66-year-old actor, writer and director said he also hopes for an additional focus on mental health to prevent future mass shootings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably horrible, what\u2019s happened. I think the biggest problem, seriously, is not so much guns. It\u2019s that every one of these people that have done these things in the past 30 years are friggin\u2019 crazy. Really crazy! And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve dropped the ball: mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cThat to me is our biggest problem in the future, is insanity coupled with isolation.\u201d\n\nStallone is now in production on his next project, pairing up with the former \u201cRaging Bull\u201d Robert De Niro for \u201cGrudge Match,\u201d about two aging boxers.\n\n\u201cPeople think it\u2019s going to be some geezer brawl. Really? OK, they\u2019re in for a surprise. I\u2019m telling you. I\u2019ve been working on the fight, the choreography. He\u2019s taking it deadly serious. Because no one wants to be shown up,\u201d Stallone said of De Niro. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a \u2018Rocky\u2019 fight. This will be \u2018Rocky 7,\u2019 with me fighting \u2014 with Rocky fighting the \u2018Raging Bull.\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sylvester Stallone says that despite his \"Rambo\" image and new shoot-em-up film \"Bullet to the Head,\" he's in favor of new national gun control legislation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ryan Pearson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2013/02/02/sly-stallone_c0-131-429-381_s1770x1032.jpg?2eea9bab18ff1b455dd64d917aadebda4571862e", "published_at": "2013-02-02"}
