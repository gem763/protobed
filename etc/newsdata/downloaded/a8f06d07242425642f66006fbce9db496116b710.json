Indeed, as according to the Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s market data says that the product has processed a mere ~70 BTC in volumes for its first trading session, paling in comparison to, say, the CME\u2019s Bitcoin market.\n\nThis leaned into theories tendered by CNBC analysts that Bakkt won\u2019t be the \u201ctipping point\u201d for the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Yet they still asserted that it will be important for the growth and viability of this asset class in the long run.\n\nBakkt Not the Best Thing Since Sliced Bread\n\nAccording to CNBC\u2019s latest episode of \u201cFast Money\u201d, Bakkt is not the best thing since sliced bread, despite what you might have read on Twitter just weeks or months ago. However, the exchange doesn\u2019t come without its benefits.\n\nBrian Kelly, the chief executive of BKCM, argued that regulated and large-scale investment products like Bakkt will \u201ctamper down the volatility\u201d in Bitcoin markets. Volatility, of course, is what industry leaders like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee will drive adoption.\n\nAs the NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange launches bitcoin futures trading, @BKBrianKelly breaks down what it means for the cryptocurrency. pic.twitter.com/ronORISSXn \u2014 CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) September 23, 2019\n\nSteve Grasso, the director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel & Co. Inc., echoed this tacit optimism. He said that this product will give cryptocurrency traders with access to Bakkt \u201cmuch more confidence\u201d, and will overall \u201cgive credence to the whole Bitcoin story.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Medium of Exchange Narrative\n\nWhile the consensus on the \u201cFast Money\u201d panel was that Bakkt will at the very most entice institutions in and marginally improve liquidity, Kelly went on to bring up a very important point. One that many have forgotten over the recent news cycle.\n\nTouching on the fact that Starbucks is involved in Bakkt, with the coffee giant being an investor in the crypto exchange, the CNBC contributor argued that these new Bitcoin futures will help BTC\u2019s medium of exchange narrative:\n\n\u201cThe way that this product is structured, you can go into Starbucks with Bitcoin \u2014 they have it on their books \u2014 you can pay with BTC, they can hedge out any of the volatility, then they can have cash at the end of the day. Bakkt gets the medium of exchange [narrative] out there.\u201d\n\nWhile this may not make any sense, Starbucks accepting Bitcoin has been something that has been confirmed to some extent.\n\nThe Block broke the news earlier in 2019 that Bakkt is actually working closely with Starbucks, one of the world\u2019s largest restaurant chains. Per their source, the coffee giant has managed to secure a substantial stake in Bakkt in return for \u201ccommitment to allow Bitcoin payments in store in 2019\u201d.\n\nBakkt has also been looking for developers to build out a mobile application. While little is known about this facet of the recently-launched startup, many suspect that it will be a wallet and payment mechanism that will allow users to spend Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd if what Kelly said is correct, futures will play a key role in this aspect of the Bakkt ecosystem.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "On Sunday, a momentous occasion took place for the Bitcoin industry: The Intercontinental Exchange-backed Bakkt launched its much-awaited Bitcoin futures", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1496515682-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
