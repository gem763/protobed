This would often be sold via distributors, particularly in overseas markets.\n\nPenfolds was key to the turnaround. Tamara Dean\n\nBut there are several problems with the model.\n\nFirst, it ties up a lot of capital, which means there is constant pressure to turn this year\u2019s harvest into cash so it can be reinvested.\n\nSecond, investor returns can jump wildly depending on whether the market is undersupplied or oversupplied. This boom-and-bust cycle mentality memorably resulted in Treasury destroying $35 million worth of unwanted wine in the United States in 2013, after the company had let its stockpiles get too high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThird, the use of distributors reduced the control the winemakers had over their product, and ate into their margins.\n\nFinally, for an industry ostensibly hung up on labels, the constant need to generate cash meant winemakers hadn\u2019t paid enough attention to crucial consumer sector strategies such as segmentation, branding and marketing.\n\nClarke set about building a new model. The powerful Penfolds brand was the symbol of a strategy built on focusing Treasury on premium wines that could deliver better margins and more consistent shareholder returns.\n\nAlmost immediately, Clarke changed what he described at the time as Treasury\u2019s ridiculous 30-year strategy of releasing its sought-after Penfolds wines in May, and then trying to sell them to retailers before the financial year ended in June.\n\nRadically, Clarke introduced a strategy whereby each [Penfolds] vintage was allocated over a five-year period and released slowly.\n\nInstead, Penfolds would be released in October, so sales could be spread across the year.\n\nBut more radically, Clarke introduced a strategy whereby each vintage was allocated over a five-year period and released slowly across the world; it was another way to tilt Treasury\u2019s portfolio away from the commercial wine category, where private label brands were flooding the market, and ensure steady growth in premium wine sales.\n\nTo make Treasury less capital intensive, Clarke shifted away from the wine sector\u2019s \u201cown everything\" model. By March 2015 he had begun to reshape the group\u2019s production and supply chain, selling production infrastructure and vineyards in Australia and the United States.\n\nToday, only a third of Treasury\u2019s production comes from company-owned grapes. The other two thirds are either grown in leased vineyards or under contract. And Clarke has boosted Treasury\u2019s return on capital employed from 6.8 per cent in the 2015 financial year to a sector-leading 14.9 per cent in 2019\n\nClarke cut $50 million of costs from Treasury\u2019s bottom line in his first year on the job, and the group\u2019s cost of doing business as a percentage of sales has fallen almost 300 basis points over the past five financial years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the key initiative in his first years on the job was not shrinking but growing, through the $525 million deal to buy most of the British and US wine assets of global booze giant Diageo, announced in October 2015.\n\nThe acquisition had a simple rationale: It immediately doubled Treasury\u2019s net sales of luxury and masstige wine, and in a stroke meant that 75 per cent of the group\u2019s gross profit would come from top-end plonk.\n\nThe $486 million capital raising to pay for the deal saw 89 per cent of institutional shareholders take up their entitlement, with the shortfall snapped up quickly.\n\nWithin just 18 months, Clarke had won the market\u2019s confidence, as demonstrated by the 108 per since rise in Treasury shares from Clarke\u2019s arrival on March 31, 2014 to the completion of the Diageo deal on November 11, 2015.\n\nUnder Clarke\u2019s premiumisation strategy \u2013 which was complemented by asset sales and exits of commercial wine \u2013 the group\u2019s earnings before interest and tax margin surged in five years from 12.1 per cent to 23.4 per cent. Bottles costing more than $10 now account for 70 per cent of sales, up from 43 per cent five years ago.\n\nWine made in the Napa Valley will be sold under the Penfolds label.\n\nAnd Clarke is going further to increase premium wine production, and the power of his top brands. Wine made in Napa Valley and in France is to be sold under the Penfolds brand.\n\nCentral to Treasury\u2019s margin expansion has been Clarke\u2019s growth strategy in Asia, where booming sales of Penfolds in China have helped lift underlying earnings from the region from $73.1 million in the 2015 financial year to $239.5 million in 2019. Margins rose from 34.1 per cent to 39.2 per cent over the same period.\n\nThere were several elements to Clarke\u2019s success in China.\n\nAs in Australia and in the US, Clarke has worked to cut out distributors \u2013 who take a cut of margin, of course \u2013 and take product direct to market, establishing closer ties with key retailers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has been supported by heavy investments in advertising and marketing, including prolific spending on what Clarke calls key opinion leaders and so-called pull-through promotions, which typically involve giving away a wine glass or two with a bottle of plonk, a strategy that allows Clarke to avoid discounting Treasury's own product.\n\nClarke\u2019s success has made Treasury China\u2019s number one importer by value and volume.\n\nBut its growth strategy has not been without controversy. In May 2018, The Australian Financial Review\u2019s then China correspondent Angus Grigg reported allegations that Treasury was facing a glut in China of its cheaper wine brands.\n\nIn addition to Treasury\u2019s direct-to-market approach to distribution in China, the company also used what Clarke described as a \u201cportfolio approach\u201d to drive sales: Chinese retailers who wanted to get their hands on a shipping container filled with lots of the top-selling Penfolds brand also had to buy other TWE brands.\n\nSpeaking to the AFR in Melbourne last month, Clarke explained the strategy was designed to ensure Treasury didn\u2019t end up with all its eggs in the Penfolds basket.\n\nBut it also led to persistent claims Treasury effectively forced its less popular brands on retailers who really didn\u2019t want them, inflating its Asian sales in a process known as \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d.\n\nIn May this year, the claims were repeated by US fund manager Angela Aldrich from Bayberry Capital Partners at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York.\n\nThe allegations grate with Clarke, who has repeatedly presented a three-point defence to the claims.\n\nFirstly, Treasury\u2019s use of that five-year cycle to allocate wine means it doesn\u2019t dump stock in any one year. Secondly, its direct-to-retail approach means it couldn\u2019t channel-stuff even if it wanted to, as retailers always want to keep stock levels low. Finally, shipments of wine and depletions from inventory are in balance, in China and across the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s another area where Clarke has battled, it is around his executive team, a fact he conceded on Monday as he announced his retirement.\n\n\u201cOn occasions, we\u2019ve made mistakes with some of these people changes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shock dismissal of chief operating officer Robert Foye in January, for reasons Clarke still won\u2019t disclose, came amid a string of executive departures.\n\nClarke last month told the Financial Review that he had effectively been running two executive teams in preparation for the possible demerger of Treasury\u2019s commercial wine business. That deal is off the table for now at least, so the executive ranks have been trimmed.\n\nHe reinforced this message on Monday, saying Ford would inherit a top-notch executive team.\n\n\u201cI feel very comfortable that we have the strongest ever leadership team in place,\u201d he told investors. \u201cChange is a good thing in a high-growth company and is necessary to displace your competition.\u201d\n\nThe next big change at the top will be Clarke himself, although he won\u2019t disappear completely. He will remain as an adviser for at least a year, with a special focus on mergers and acquisitions.\n\nMike Clarke\u2019s final vintage is yet to come.", "description": "The outgoing Treasury Wines chief executive tipped the winemaking model on its head to turn the business around.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9472%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2370%2C$y_319/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4e405f0be4800a577456d45c601585cfe91415ff", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
