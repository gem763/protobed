In the funniest sketch of this season\u2019s Saturday Night Live premiere, Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and a very vocal donkey welcome you to the beautiful part of New York state that inexplicably has confederate flags, where they invite you to search the ground for dozens of their tiny, hard, rotting apples. If you\u2019re lucky, they might even have some big soft apples still in season, by which they mean on the ground. Woody Harrelson costars as troubled farmhand Hank, who tends to the farm\u2019s animal prison and lives in fear of those mean teen boys who run the hayride. Where did those boys come from, and how do they just dominate Hank like that? The only thing more fun than all of the above? Eating all those apples, which again, you love enough to plan a mini-vacation around picking them yourself.\n\nRelated", "description": "Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Woody Harrelson star in a Saturday Night Live sketch riffing on apple picking.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/30-SNL-Autumn.w1200.h630.jpg"}
