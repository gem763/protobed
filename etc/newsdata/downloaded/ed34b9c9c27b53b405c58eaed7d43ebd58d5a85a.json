California\u2019s authority to set its own pollution standards dates back to the 1960s, when the state passed laws to deal with its crippling smog problem. The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 codified that special authority, as long as the state could show a compelling need for standards stricter than the federal government\u2019s. Congress has repeatedly reaffirmed that right, and in 1977 it said other states could legally opt in to California\u2019s standards. Thirteen have now done so.\n\nOver time, strategies adopted in California to control smog-producing pollutants became standard across the country. So, too, with carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. California\u2019s decision in 2002 to add greenhouse gases to the list of pollutants it wanted to control \u2014 a decision approved by the Obama administration seven years later \u2014 arguably accelerated the push for zero-emission and low-emission vehicles like plug-in hybrids. (Tailpipe emissions are now the nation\u2019s single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.)", "description": "To dismantle the Obama climate legacy, he\u2019s taking on California, the auto industry, the Clean Air Act and public opinion.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/opinion/18trumpcalifornia/18trumpcalifornia-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
