Some visitor services, including campgrounds and entrance stations, will reopen utilizing recreation fee revenue.\"\n\nThe statement adds that the recreation fees will help park maintenance crews to deal with sanitation issues and pay for additional staff to protect the park from the kind of damage caused by visitors when park rangers were made scarce by the shutdown.\n\nHowever, some facilities will be closed.\n\n\"Oasis Visitor Center, Cottonwood Visitor Center, and Black Rock Nature Center will remain closed for the duration of the lapse in appropriations,\" said the statement. \"Entrance stations will be open to provide safety and resource protection messages to arriving visitors, but entrance fees and camping fees will not be collected.\"\n\nOn Tuesday park officials said few rangers were on hand to prevent off-road driving, leading to the destruction of the park's namesake trees.\n\n\"While the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree National Park do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,\" the park said in a statement.\n\n\"Law enforcement rangers will continue to patrol the park and enforce the closure until park staff complete the necessary cleanup and park protection measures.\"\n\nIn a tweet, park officials said the closure will \"allow staff to address sanitation, safety, and resource protection issues in the park that have arisen during the lapse in appropriations.\"\n\nFor the past several days, volunteers have stepped forward to help clean the park, which covers nearly 800,000 acres in the Mojave and Colorado deserts east of Los Angeles and draws 4 million visitors annually.\n\nThe announcement is only the latest park closure prompted by the government shutdown, which has resulted in overflowing toilets and trash bins.\n\nParts of Yosemite National Park are closed, as well as much of Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks.", "description": "Reversing an announcement made earlier this week, park officials said recreation fees will be used to keep the popular park open and to mitigate sanitation problems and environmental damage.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/08/gettyimages-1077222832_wide-f5fc64dd0a0b2d9a8dc2cff807ac23b92b1ac75b.jpg?s=1400"}
