Anta reported 28% growth in net income for the first half of 2019, beating analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nAnta\u2019s continued rally comes in defiance of attacks by short sellers Blue Orca Capital LLC and Muddy Waters Capital LLC, which issued critical reports less than six weeks apart earlier this year questioning the company\u2019s accounting and corporate governance. Investors shrugged off the allegations -- which the company said were untrue and showed a lack of knowledge about business operations -- and sent its stock to a historic high.\n\nAnta Jumps After Fighting Back on \u2018Misleading\u2019 Short Sell Attack\n\nThe Jinjiang, Fujian-based company has ambitions to become a global sportswear giant to rival Nike Inc. and Adidas AG. Last December, it agreed to pay $5.2 billion for Finland\u2019s Amer Sports Oyj, which makes Atomic ski equipment and Saloman ski boots. Wilson\u2019s subsequent investment in Anta was due to the fact that he had also been pursuing Amer, Anta said.\n\nWilson\u2019s 0.59% stake in Anta is now valued at HK$1.03 billion, up a third from the HK$778 million he paid at the end of May.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Dong Lyu in Beijing at dlyu3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Jeff Sutherland\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The billionaire founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc. has made $32.3 million in three months off his investment in Anta Sports Products Ltd. as the Chinese company\u2019s shares soar despite multiple short-seller attacks.Dennis Wilson has seen his stake in China\u2019s biggest sportswear maker gain", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qGwpqSgc6RUcK7Up2EJ8FQ--~B/aD0xMjYzO3c9MTk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/9b57f58bd81a925f8caee8b34bb1e0e4"}
