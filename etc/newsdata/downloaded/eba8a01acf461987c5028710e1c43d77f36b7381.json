He resigned as chief financial officer of Electricite de France (PA: ) three years ago after warning that the French government\u2019s determination to have EdF build the Hinkley Point C reactor in south-west England could bankrupt the company.\n\nFast forward three years and, while bankruptcy may still seem fanciful given the French state\u2019s backing for its national champion, the flawed economics of the project are once again standing in the harshest of spotlights after EdF warned of yet more overruns to the project. It now expects up to $3.6 billion in additional costs and warned that it\u2019s more likely than ever that the project will be delayed.\n\nEdF\u2019s shares fell 6.6% in early trading on Wednesday to a new two-year low of 9.97 euros. EdF was worth 107 billion euros back in 2010 when the British government announced the sites where it wanted to build a new generation of nuclear plants. It\u2019s now worth 30 billion ($33 billion).\n\nThis year alone, it has fallen nearly 28%, while most of Europe\u2019s biggest energy suppliers have posted double-digit gains. At 21 times earnings, according to data compiled by Investing.com, it\u2019s still one of the more expensive stocks in a peer group which trades largely in the teens.\n\nThe timing of the announcement is particularly painful for the company, coming only a couple of weeks after it was faced with potentially high costs for fixing faulty welds at its reactors across France.\n\nThe folly of locking U.K. energy consumers into financing such a project is now painfully apparent. Nor is this hindsight: the British parliament was warned repeatedly back at the start of the decade that, while renewable costs would plummet as various technologies matured, there was no such falling price curve to be hoped for in nuclear, whatever technological advances the new generation of plants brought. The U.K. guaranteed EdF a price of 92.50 pounds per megawatt-hour for Hinkley Point C in 2012. Last week, it auctioned offshore wind power projects at a strike price of as low as \u00a339.65/MWh.\n\nEdF may get some consolation from the fact that its bad news is being buried Wednesday under bigger concerns about global growth and the U.S.-China trade war after President Donald Trump\u2019s harsh anti-China and anti-Iran rhetoric at the UN on Tuesday. The benchmark was down 1.3% at 384.60, while the was down 1.5% and the U.K. was down 0.9%.", "description": "StockBeat: EdF Sags Under the Weight of Hinkley Point Fiasco", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC3L1FJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
