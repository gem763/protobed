But the cone represents the area in which the center of a storm is likely to pass.\n\nHurricane Irma forecast Issued at 11 a.m. Sept. 7, 2017 Three days before U.S. landfall 120 hrs. 96 hrs.

The radius of the circles is determined using the most recent five-year record of forecast errors, so there is a two-thirds probability the storm\u2019s actual position will fall within the cone. But one out of every three times, the center of the storm will fall outside the cone.\n\n211 nautical miles 159 107 78 63 45 29 211 nautical miles 159 107 78 63 45 29 211 nautical miles 159 107 78 63 45 29 211 nautical miles 159 107 78 63 45 29\n\nAs forecast models improve and errors decrease, the circles making up the cone become smaller. This season, the circle at the first 24-hour forecast point will have a radius of 43 nautical miles (49 land miles), compared with 67 nautical miles (77 land miles) in 2008.\n\nCircle radius for storms in the Atlantic basin, 2008 vs. 2018 ...and the one-day projection has improved from 67 nm to 43 nm. ...the three-day projection has improved from 170 nm to 103 nm...

The track guidance can be displayed as a \u201cspaghetti plot,\u201d which is another way to examine potential tracks of the cyclone\u2019s center. However, these plots may not always capture the true forecast uncertainty. All lines in a spaghetti plot aren\u2019t created equal: Some represent very simple forecast techniques, while others are from state-of-the-art weather forecast models.\n\nPredicting a Changing Path\n\nForecasters\u2019 ability to predict a storm\u2019s path has steadily improved over the years. Still, their ability to predict a storm\u2019s intensity hasn\u2019t progressed as much, because more complex factors are at play.\n\nAverage forecast track errors for Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes nautical miles 400 1970s 350 1980s 300 2000s 250 1990s 2010-\u201917 200 150 100 50 0 24 120 96 12 72 48 0 36 FORECAST PERIOD (HOURS) Average forecast track errors for Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes nautical miles 400 1970s 350 1980s 300 2000s 250 1990s 2010-\u201917 200 150 100 50 0 36 120 24 96 72 12 0 48 FORECAST PERIOD (HOURS) Average forecast track errors for Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes 400 nautical miles 1970s 350 1980s 300 2000s 250 1990s 2010-\u201917 200 150 100 50 0 96 72 48 0 24 12 120 36 FORECAST PERIOD (HOURS) Average forecast track errors for Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes nautical miles 400 1970s 350 1980s 300 2000s 250 1990s 200 150 2010-\u201917 100 50 0 12 0 48 72 36 120 24 96 FORECAST PERIOD (HOURS)\n\nSeveral days ahead of predicted landfall, the cone can put large swaths of territory in a storm\u2019s crosshairs. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma was on track for a U.S. landfall. As the storm moved closer to shore, different parts of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts braced for a direct hit as the cone evolved.\n\nPopulations at risk of an Irma landfall as forecasts progressed 3 days out 4 days out 5 days out 1 day out 2 days out Shoreline county population in the cone 17.6 million 16.1 million 16.4 million 8.5 million 11.0 million Populations at risk of an Irma landfall as forecasts progressed 5 days out 1 day out 4 days out 3 days out 2 days out Shoreline county population in the cone 16.1 million 16.4 million 11.0 million 17.6 million 8.5 million Populations at risk of an Irma landfall as forecasts progressed 3 days out 5 days out 1 day out 4 days out 2 days out Shoreline county population in the cone 8.5 million 11.0 million 16.1 million 16.4 million 17.6 million Populations at risk of an Irma landfall as forecasts progressed 5 days out 4 days out Shoreline county population in the cone 11.0 million 16.4 million 3 days out 2 days out 16.1 million 17.6 million 1 day out 8.5 million\n\nThink Outside the Cone\n\nForecasters warn the public not to focus entirely on the cone. \u201cHazards can extend well outside the cone,\u201d said Michael Brennan, branch chief of the NHC\u2019s hurricane specialist unit. For instance, this Hurricane Irma forecast, issued three days before Florida landfall, doesn\u2019t encompass the full footprint of the strong winds that Irma brought to the U.S.\n\nForecast cone 3 days before U.S. landfall Actual storm windswaths: Tropical storm-force winds (\u226539 m.p.h.)

But given the uncertainty, they urge residents to study their other visual tools. One new graphic this year displays the \u201cearliest reasonable\u201d arrival time of tropical-storm-force winds. Other maps detail the potential for storm-surge flooding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to steer people toward the hazards,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cThe hazards are what kill people.\u201d\n\nSource for Graphics: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Census Bureau\n\nAugust and September mark peak hurricane season in the Atlantic basin.
