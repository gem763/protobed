It has been negative since July.\n\nKansas City Fed vice president and economist Chad Wilkerson said in prepared remarks the decline in activity \"was driven by further deterioration in durable goods production, as nondurable manufacturing expanded slightly for the second straight month.\"\n\nThe seasonally adjusted month-over-month indexes measuring production, shipment volume, new order volume and average employee workweek all declined. The ones that measure order backlog, the number of employees, prices received for finished product and prices paid for raw materials all improved.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted month-over-month composite index measuring what survey responders expect in six months was two, down from five the month before. The Kansas City Fed said this is this measurement's lowest reading since March 2016.\n\nThe future seasonally-adjusted month-over-month indexes for production, shipment volume, new order volume, order backlog, number of employees and prices paid for raw materials all declined. The ones measuring average employee workweek and prices received for finished product improved.\n\nThe Kansas City Fed's district includes Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nebraska, the western part of Missouri and northern part of New Mexico.\n\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 11:14 ET (15:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
