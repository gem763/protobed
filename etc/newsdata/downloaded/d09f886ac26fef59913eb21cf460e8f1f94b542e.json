Just 15% of adults live in a household where someone would gain immediately.\n\nXiaowei Xu, a research economist at IFS and an author of the research said: \"Given promised spending increases and growing demographic pressures, taxes are likely to have to rise over the next decade.\n\n\"Promising \u00a310 billion to \u00a320 billion of tax cuts is, therefore, a major commitment.\n\n\"If you are going to spend that much cutting taxes for those on high incomes or supporting low earners, you could find much better ways of doing so than the policies proposed by the prime minister.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s tax proposals will overwhelmingly benefit high earners, according to research from the IFS.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cd27c2e22af5ecc4370e8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
