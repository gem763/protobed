The ruling overruled a motion to dismiss the fraud claims from Burkle\u2019s Yucaipa Companies against the Weinstein Co., according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYucaipa filed the suit against Lantern Entertainment in the summer of 2018, after the latter completed a $289 million deal for The Weinstein Company assets.\n\nRon Burkle\u2019s suit details the work he and his company put into Lantern, which is now Spyglass Media, to assist the Texas-based company in their purchase of the Weinstein assets. Burkle claimed fraud and a breach of contract related to that sale he felt squeezed out of.\n\nAs the first investor to attempt to buy Weinstein\u2019s assets outside of bankruptcy, Burkle's initial attempt at a deal fell apart. Burkle then put in work with Lantern in exchange for equity in the acquisition of the Weinstein Co., which the suit claims never came to fruition.\n\nBurkle\u2019s first swing at the Weinstein Co. made room to compensate creditors and other victims of Weinstein, the infamous Hollywood producer who has spent the last few years in and out of court battling sexual assault charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeinstein and his brother Bob ran Miramax and The Weinstein Company, production houses that brought movie fans Oscar-winning films like \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d and \"The Aviator,\u201d before collapsing due to Harvey\u2019s alleged illicit behavior.\n\nYucaipa\u2019s suit claims that in exchange for helping Lantern with the deal, Burkle was promised 2% of the purchase price along with an opportunity to invest $50 million. Lantern revealed emails in court as evidence that they were not intending on frauding Burkle, but the judge was not in agreement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"Defendants rely on emails to indicate there was no intent to defraud,\" Kleifield said. \"However, regardless of whether there was fraudulent intent for that one promise, Plaintiff raised multiple allegedly false promises for this single cause of action. And, where a plaintiff includes many acts that comprise a single cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer that addresses fewer than all of the allegations that comprise the cause of action.\"\n\nThis case will move forward to jury trial in Oct. 2020.", "description": "Burkle fraud lawsuit in Weinstein buyout to move forward says judge.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/harvey-1-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
