Pete Buttigieg gave a thoughtful answer about not being able to give blood as a gay man. Joe Biden did very Joe Biden-y things.\n\nHere are the five key moments you should know about.\n\nWarren\u2019s got jokes\n\nThe Massachusetts senator likely secured the night\u2019s most memorable moment with a perfectly-delivered joke.\n\nMorgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign Board of Directors, asked her what she would say if an \"old-fashioned\" supporter told her they think marriage should only be between one man and one woman.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to assume it is a guy who said that,\" Warren said. \"And I'm going to say, 'Well, then, just marry one woman. I'm cool with that.'\"\n\nThen she took a long pause and deadpanned, \u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nShe walked away to roaring laughter and loud applause.\n\nBiden talks about\u2026 bathhouses?\n\nAs the former vice president neared the end of his time on stage, he delivered an aside about hurtful stigmas gay men had to deal with in the recent past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not strange. That\u2019s the generic point,\u201d Biden said to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper, who is gay. \u201cAnd the more people know that, the more they understand it. Remember, Anderson, back 15, 20 years ago? We talked about this in San Francisco. It was all about, well, you know, gay bathhouses. It was all about round-the-clock sex. Come on, man. Gay couples are likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Cooper cut in to end the conversation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave it there, Mr. Vice President,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nChris Cuomo makes an ill-advised pronoun joke\n\nWhen California Sen. Kamala Harris took the stage at the town hall, she alerted Cuomo: \u201cMy pronouns are she, her, and hers.\"\n\nThe CNN host felt his was a good time to crack a joke.\n\n\"She, her, and hers? Mine, too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe later apologized for mocking the practice of sharing one\u2019s pronouns, which is a helpful way to respect people\u2019s gender identities.\n\n\u201cWhen Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's [sic], I said mine, too,\u201d Cuomo tweeted. \u201cI should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete talks blood donation\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, is the first gay man to mount a major presidential campaign. At the forum, he was asked about the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s blood donation policy that forbids men who\u2019ve had sex with a man in the last year from giving blood.\n\n\u201cIn South Bend we run a Mayor\u2019s Office blood drive, it\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019ve traditionally done. And I inherited it when I became mayor,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd I remember the moment when I realized, unlike most initiatives that I spearhead, I can\u2019t lead by example on this one because my blood\u2019s not welcome in this country. And it\u2019s not based on science; it\u2019s based on prejudice.\u201d\n\nHe added that as president, he\u2019d have the FDA revise its rules \u201cbased on evidence, based on individual risk factors and without regard to the prejudice that has driven the current policy.\u201d\n\nBiden kinda, sorta mimes kissing Anderson Cooper\n\nThis is a convoluted one to explain, but: Biden embraced CNN\u2019s Cooper, sidling up next to him, to mime President Barack Obama apparently kissing his vice president in 2012 to show his appreciation for his veep\u2019s decision to publicly support marriage equality.\n\nBiden was talking about a 2012 interview during which he expressed support for same-sex marriage, ahead of Obama doing the same. He said some folks were worried Obama would be upset that Biden had jumped the gun on the issue.\n\n\u201cI went in on Monday, and all the national press is saying Biden\u2019s gonna really get nailed when he walks in and sees the president every morning. He got up, and he walked over to me. He said, \u2018Well, you told me,\u2019 and he gave me a kiss,\u201d Biden said as he walked toward Cooper, seemingly intending to mime a kiss with the CNN host, but not actually doing so. \u201cI swear to God.\u201d\n\nCover: Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
