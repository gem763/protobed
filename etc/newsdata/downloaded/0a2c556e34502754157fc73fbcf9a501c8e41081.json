The promotional video and poster for the event advertised the night to be just as wild as the DiCaprio film, including a pop-up casino.\n\nBut it was the wildly offensive \u201cmidget-tossing\u201d event that found the hotel in hot water.\n\n\u201cIf that won\u2019t keep you on your toes the whole night, sign up for our FREE MIDGET-TOSSING!!\u201d The event description said. \u201cHit the target and receive a FREE DRINK!!\u201d\n\nFollowing intense backlash from the public for the offensive content, the Great Northern Hotel has removed the video, ABC reports. However, the event is still live on Facebook and includes \u201cmidget-tossing\u201d in the description.\n\nThe Facebook event is filled with people calling the pub out on the wildly offensive event. So, although it\u2019s a terrible thing to see, at least we can appreciate that everyone in the Facebook community was quick to call out the derogatory language and totally fucked up event.\n\nThe term \u201cmidget\u201d is considered derogatory and offensive, and according to Dwarfism Awareness Australia, the word should be avoided. But that doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how inappropriate the tossing event is.\n\n\u201cIt still appears that dwarfism is the last disability that people seem to think it is OK to mock and it is just wrong\u201d Paralympian and former national secretary for Short Statured People of Australia, Alicia Jenkins said.\n\nThis is the second time the pub has done a Wolf of Watt St event, but it appears last year\u2019s event wasn\u2019t as controversial.\n\nAlthough it is unclear whether people of short stature are actually going to be tossed at the event, but regardless, the concept is still offensive.\n\n\u201cWe know that in the past unfortunately after events like this there have been people in the community that have been picked up and thrown in local bars and have been injured significantly\u201d Sam Millard, the president of Short Statured People of Australia said. \u201cSo these kinds of things might sound like a joke but they do have real world consequences.\u201d\n\nThe event has also been condemned by the NSW Minister for Disability Services Gareth Ward, who has a disability of his own.\n\nThe Great Northern Hotel have removed the promotional video, but have not commented on or cancelled the event, which still promotes \u201cmidget tossing.\u201d The event is being promoted by Newcastle Live, where the promotional content is still active at the time of posting this article.\n\nIt is important to educate yourself on inclusive, respectful language. Dwarfism affects approximately one in 25,000 Australians.\n\n\u201cAcceptable words to use are dwarf, little person, person with dwarfism, short stature. But most would like to be called by their name rather than their condition,\u201d Dwarfism Awareness Australia explains.\n\nAs a general rule, if you\u2019re unsure if the language you\u2019re using is offensive, just use peoples names. Being inclusive and respectful doesn\u2019t need to be difficult.\n\nEvents like the \u201cWolf of Watt Street\u201d are offensive, and frankly just shit. If you can\u2019t have a fun night out without being a dick to somebody else, you mustn\u2019t be a very fun person.\n\nThis isn\u2019t it. Don\u2019t be that guy. If you see hate-speech like this in your local or online community, call it out. Let\u2019s be better than this.\n\nREAD MORE Taco Bell Revealed 2 NSW Stores Are Coming Which Is Huge If You Have A Queso The Munchies", "description": "Newcastle's Great Northern Hotel has been ridiculed for a wildly offensive \"midget-tossing\" event at their Wolf of Watt Street party.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/wolf-of-watt-st.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
