It\u2019s great that you can pick a side with five kids and six regulars for a cup tie and not have to worry because you have someone like Milly in the team. He\u2019s still very ambitious, that\u2019s his nature, and he has a few more years still left in the locker.\u201d\n\nSheffield United v Liverpool: match preview Read more\n\nKlopp says the club are talking to Milner about a contract extension, though there is nothing to report at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s only September, no one is getting nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need to worry because he just loves what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s fine with his career at this stage. When he started out he was the best young player of his age group. He grew up the hard way, playing for a number of different clubs, and now he is older he has become really calm. I think he likes it here and from the club\u2019s point of view he is great to have around; he can play in five different positions.\u201d\n\nMilner arrived at Anfield on a free from Manchester City in the last few months of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 reign and, given his service over the last four years, must count as one of the club\u2019s shrewdest signings, though Klopp believes Jo\u00ebl Matip has also proved an excellent acquisition for negligible outlay. The centre-back, expected to return to the side at Sheffield United on Saturday, was also picked up on a free and has established himself this season as Virgil van Dijk\u2019s regular partner.\n\n\u201cIn a world of big transfer fees, signing a player that good for nothing is one of the best pieces of business we ever did,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen too often but Jo\u00ebl has always been an incredible talent. He was playing for Schalke at 18 and that\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nLiverpool youngsters shine but James Milner steers them past MK Dons Read more\n\nAlisson is close to a return after missing most of the season with a calf injury. Klopp confirmed the goalkeeper was ready to resume full training from next week. \u201cHaving Adri\u00e1n playing so well makes everything easier,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to rush Alisson back and we wouldn\u2019t want to anyway.\u201d A reintroduction after the October international break seems likely, when Klopp will also be hoping several of his outfield players will return unscathed from far-flung fixtures.\n\n\u201cWe just found out Brazil are playing Senegal in a friendly in Singapore,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are now friendlies being played on the other side of the world and we have no influence on it. We are not the only ones, I know \u2013 the more international players you have the more you will be affected by this. You just get the message that this is happening and you have to deal with it.\u201d", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool are \u2018not nervous\u2019 that James Milner could talk to other clubs from January and identified Jo\u00ebl Matip as one of the club\u2019s shrewdest signings", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0087912474c476b0b801764fd9ea3c63b12855e7/233_0_3729_2238/master/3729.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bfee73f572aa930f66d2270210cf4c5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
