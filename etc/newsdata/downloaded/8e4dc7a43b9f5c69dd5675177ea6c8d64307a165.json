Dick Durbin. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Senate Democrats rush to join impeachment push\n\nThe number of Senate Democrats who support the House opening an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has nearly doubled in less than 24 hours.\n\nPrior to revelations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son, only 12 Senate Democrats supported impeachment \u2014 five of whom are presidential candidates.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut by the end of Tuesday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, 22 Senate Democrats had endorsed the House moving forward on impeachment.\n\nWhen asked whether he supports an impeachment inquiry, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Pelosi is \"handling this appropriately\" and has his support. He said he had spoken with Pelosi twice Tuesday morning.\n\nDick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said in an interview that an official impeachment inquiry for documents and testimony will \"make it clear that is the constitutional authority of the House of Representatives.\"\n\n\"I know that the Trump White House will stonewall us \u2014 they have already and that means this matter will be taken up right there,\" Durbin added, pointing to the Supreme Court building.\n\nDurbin joined Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the No. 3 and No. 4 Senate Democrats, who had already said they supported an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) , Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Angus King (I-Maine) announced that they too support the House moving forward on impeachment. In their statements announcing their position, several senators said Trump's actions left the House with no choice but to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Donald Trump administration's violated the law,\" Duckworth tweeted. \"The House of Representatives should use its constitutional authorities to investigate this cover up and swiftly decide if impeachment is warranted.\"\n\n\u201cIf the president used foreign aid to induce a foreign nation to investigate a political opponent, he plainly violated his oath of office,\" Whitehouse said in a statement. \"We must know if these reports are true, so I am pleased the House will pursue the necessary evidence to understand exactly what took place.\"\n\nTrump said Tuesday that his administration will release the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president Wednesday. In addition, the Senate Intelligence Committee will hear from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and intelligence community watchdog Michael Atkinson, according to the committee's top Democrat , Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.\n\n", "description": "\"I know that the Trump White House will stonewall us,\" Durbin added.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/11/13/c571c81a44d0976f319af5faca71/190924-dick-durbin-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
