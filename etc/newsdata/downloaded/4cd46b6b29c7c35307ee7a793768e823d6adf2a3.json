Great story, right?\n\nWell, we can\u2019t have great stories in 2019, and thanks to the good folks at the Des Moines Register, they\u2019ve helped throw cold water on even this one.\n\nPhew.\n\nAfter what the Register deemed a \u201croutine\u201d social media background check while working on a feature on King, the reporter (Aaron Calvin) uncovered \u201ctwo racist jokes\u201d on social media. And by \u201croutine\u201d they mean going back seven years in King\u2019s Twitter feed to dig up something he wrote as a 16-year-old.\n\nThe Des Moines Register, in its explanation as to why it reported on the seven-year-old tweets, reasoned, \u201cShouldn\u2019t [the tweets] be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King\u2019s cause or were planning to do so?\u201d\n\nWell, keep this in mind: When the donations started rolling into King\u2019s Venmo account (which appeared on the sign), no one knew how much money he had raised. It initially got up to around $6,000, and he could have kept it all \u2013 no questions asked, no Des Moines Register profile, nothing. But he didn\u2019t keep it. Instead, he decided to keep enough to buy a single case of beer and donate the rest to the University of Iowa's Stead Family Children's Hospital.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, in looking out for the generous folks donating money to King\u2019s cause, the Register deemed it necessary to inform readers about the \u201cmurky\u201d past of a guy who\u2019s broke enough that he needs to ask for beer money via a cardboard sign yet decides, voluntarily, to donate $5,975 of $6,000 raised \u2026 a guy who eventually wound up turning a joke into $1 million for a children\u2019s hospital.\n\nThat\u2019s some public service.\n\nThanks to the \u201croutine\u201d check, King\u2019s reputation has been tarnished, Anheuser-Busch has publicly severed ties with him and, oh yeah, let this be a warning to those of you out there considering charitable endeavors: do so at your own peril.\n\nIt's unclear exactly why digging seven years into the past of someone who's not under any sort of critical investigation is warranted. But hey, if that's the game then ...\n\nTurns out Calvin, the Register reporter, has some skeletons of his own in his Twitter closet. Courtesy of what can only be assumed was a \u201croutine\u201d social media background check, the Washington Post uncovered old Calvin tweets that \u201cused a racist slur for black people, made light of abusing women, used the word \u2018gay\u2019 as a pejorative, and mocked the legalization of same-sex marriage.\u201d\n\nYep, welcome to 2019.
