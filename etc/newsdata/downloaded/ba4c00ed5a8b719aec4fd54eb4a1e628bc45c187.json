He was a key player in the underworld in SA, and was deeply connected in intelligence networks.\n\nTwo Montenegrins hiding in Joburg\n\nThe reports quote one of the arrested Montenegrins as admitting to being part of this criminal grouping and revealing the identity of his alleged bosses, who hail from Montenegro's capital Podgorica.\n\n\"Police in Johannesburg broke the international drug smuggling chain a few days ago, and one of the arrested Montenegrin citizens revealed that Mihailo Pavicevic from Podgorica and Matija Kascelan from Kotor were allegedly behind (sic). They are being tracked, but are believed to be still hiding in Johannesburg,\" reads the report, translated from Serbian.\n\n\"The identity of the 20 arrested has not been disclosed, but the two fugitives are said to be in their 40s and have lived in Johannesburg for some time. They had a registered import and export company,\" it continues.\n\nIt said it was believed that the twenty were sailors who were recruited from the Balkans to transport cocaine to Europe.\n\n'Fake news'\n\nPolice spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said that the reports amounted to fake news. No arrests of this nature had taken place.\n\nSources in the Hawks and Crime Intelligence also knew nothing about this alleged breakthrough, suggesting it never occurred.\n\nOver the past two years there has been a spate of apparent hits in Johannesburg involving Serbians linked to organised crime syndicates.\n\nThe attacks have been brazen, all taking place in broad daylight. In most cases, the hitmen, riding motorbikes, used semi-automatic weapons and appeared to have had military training.\n\nTo date, no arrests or prosecutions have been made but police have established a task team to get to the bottom of the murders.", "description": "The SA Police Service says reports in Serbia and Montenegro that an international organised crime syndicate had been arrested in Johannesburg, are fake news.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7955/e3cbb32e71b1489c9eceeaa24916f71d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
