Police are recommending that prosecutors charge Amiot, who has no permanent address, with first-degree arson. A criminal complaint is expected to be filed mid-week, he said.\n\nThe blaze started in a shed outside the synagogue and spread into the building early Monday, fire Chief Shawn Krizaj said. No accelerants were found.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

That firefighter is still recovering from a concussion and doing well, Krizaj said.\n\nMayor Emily Larson said the city continues to offer \u201cour heartfelt condolences\u201d to the Adas Israel congregation and the entire Jewish community.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very, very difficult week for this community,\u201d Larson told reporters.\n\nPhillip Sher, past president of the synagogue, would not speculate on a motive. \u201cWe\u2019re not out for vengeance. All I can find out of this event is sadness for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nSher said it was \u201cextremely sad\u201d for the congregation not to have a home for the Sabbath on Saturday. The charred ruins were released to the congregation on Thursday, and the congregation is exploring how to remove the building, he said.\n\nPolice previously have had \u201cmultiple contacts\u201d with Amiot, but nothing that rose to the level of arson, the police chief said. Authorities are unaware if Amiot has had previous contact with the synagogue. He remains in jail, and it is unclear if he has an attorney who could speak for him.\n\nAccording to its website, the Adas Israel Congregation is an Orthodox/High Conservative Jewish congregation with 75 members. Construction of the synagogue was completed in 1902.\n\nEight of 14 Torah scrolls, the holy books of Judaism, that were in the synagogue were saved.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A fire that destroyed a historic synagogue in northeastern Minnesota doesn't appear to have been a hate crime.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/minnesota-synagogue-fire.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
