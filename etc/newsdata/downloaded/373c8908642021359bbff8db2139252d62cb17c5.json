After that? Then the proper dreaming can start.\n\n\u201cThe key was just to keep going,\u201d she said of a match in which she lost her way several times, hitting 45 winners alongside 36 unforced errors and benefiting from nine double faults by Pliskova, whose serve is her biggest weapon. \u201cI knew there would be massive portions out there against Karolina when I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I\u2019m just so happy.\u201d\n\nKonta entered the second week for the first time on the back of maybe her most consistent run in a grand slam tournament, her 92% hold of first serves second to Serena Williams\u2019s 93%. When her serve clicks, she wins more often than not.\n\nWhile Pliskova had the cushion of six wins from seven against Konta, they have split their two meetings on this surface. When she lost against Pliskova on the grass of her home town tournament in Eastbourne two years ago, Konta broke down in tearful frustration mid-match because she could not get her serve to do as she wanted. Coming into the fourth round for the third time, she had no such worries and was on song at the start.\n\nIn little over a quarter of an hour Konta was 3-1 up and she again had the support of the actor Tom Hiddleston in her team\u2019s box courtside. Taylor Townsend, author of the feelgood comeback story of this US Open, has Kobe Bryant as her main cheerleader but Hiddleston is probably the biggest British star to lend glitter to the cause since Sean Connery was in Andy Murray\u2019s box when he won here in 2012.\n\nCelebrities aside, the tennis business on Louis Armstrong was entertainment enough for a capacity crowd basking in the sunshine. The third seed Pliskova was a pre-match favourite over the world No 16, and those odds were lengthening as Konta served for the first set \u2013 but she lost nine points in a row and had to force the tie-break, where both had a 7-7 log this season. Pliskova held her nerve to steal a set that had been in Konta\u2019s firm grasp moments earlier.\n\nAt the start of the second Pliskova challenged an out call, which was overruled to hand her two break points, and Konta handed it to her with a wild forehand. A match that had started so promisingly for her had turned from a Sunday afternoon stroll into climbing the north face of the Eiger in flip flops.\n\nPliskova served a double-fault to return the favour but, just as Konta clutched at the lifeline, Pliskova broke her again. Konta was back on the Eiger, sliding backwards, as Pliskova struck the 10th of 16 aces to lead 3-1.\n\nThe contest took another twist when Pliskova dropped serve to give Konta parity in the sixth game, and the British player was energised for the first time in more than half an hour. She broke again and for the second time in the match the set was on her racket. This time she got the job done and took the match to a decider, where she brought an impressive 16-3 winning career record, compared to Pliskova\u2019s 17-10.\n\nKonta rediscovered her game during another dip in Pliskova\u2019s level, holding from love-30 to stay on serve in the third. When Pliskova served her eighth double fault of the match in the fourth game, she followed it with her 14th ace in a quirky hold.\n\nNothing was certain from one shot to the next. After two hours and six minutes of see-sawing tennis Konta, behind in the cycle, served to stay in the tournament. She did so, to love, adding a third ace. Seven minutes later she was serving for the match after breaking Pliskova for the fifth time.\n\nKonta, nor normally ruffled by off-court activity, complained to the chair when a whistle from the crowd mid-shot cost her a point at 3-3, then she hit long to hand Pliskova an unexpected break point. She saved with a cool, killer forehand, hit long on her first match point \u2013 and was relieved when her opponent replied in kind after two hours and 20 minutes.\n\nSerena Williams took a tumble in the second set of her 6-3, 6-4 win over the world No 22, Petra Martic, but she finished strongly and will be ready for a quarter-final on Tuesday against China\u2019s Wang Qiang.\n\nWang became the first Chinese player to get this far in the tournament since Peng Shuai lost to Caroline Wozniacki in her semi-final run five years ago. Wang was too good for Ashleigh Barty, beating the French Open champion 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 22 minutes.", "description": "Johanna Konta became the first British woman in the US Open quarter-finals since Jo Durie in 1983 by beating Karolina Pliskova, and is \u2018hoping to go one or two more steps better\u2019", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6466e338f6b419e186b39018358c27bbc365f503/0_123_3308_1985/master/3308.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=394c821eef5a62395d62889397746eb7"}
