Many buildings that had not been flattened had walls or roofs partly ripped away.\n\nWhile its winds had diminished to a Category 2 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity, Dorian expanded in size and picked up speed on Tuesday. Forecasters said it would come \u201cdangerously close\u201d in the next 36 hours to Florida\u2019s east coast, where more than a million people have been ordered evacuated.\n\n\u201cIt was a horrific sight,\u201d Bahamas opposition leader Philip Brave Davis told reporters following a flight over Abaco in a U.S. Coast Guard aircraft.\n\n\u201cCommunities are cut off and roads are underwater still,\u201d Brave Davis told reporters at Nassau airport after returning from the flight, together with Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis in a Facebook Live video.\n\n\u201cPeople need mostly food, security and shelter,\u201d Minnis said.\n\nIn the Freeport area of Grand Bahama island, people on jet skis and boats tried to rescue hundreds of people whose homes had flooded on the low-lying island, a CNN correspondent said.\n\nBahamian officials said they had received a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of calls for rescue.\n\nThe CNN correspondent said he had spoken to a man whose wife had died of hypothermia after being trapped in their flooded home for hours and others who said they had watched people swept away.\n\nThe Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said storm surges in Grand Bahama were 12 feet to 18 feet (3.7-5.5 m) above normal tide levels.\n\nEXTREME DAMAGE\n\nThe NHS said in a 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) advisory that Dorian had sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (175 kph) and was moving northwest at 5 mph (8 kph), as it churned about 105 miles 170 km) east of Vero Beach, Florida.\n\nHurricane-force winds had expanded to 60 miles (95 km) from the storm\u2019s core. \u201cDorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days,\u201d the NHS said.\n\nThe exact toll of the devastation in the Bahamas will not be clear until the storm completely passes and rescue crews can get on the ground, said Theo Neilly, the Bahamian consul general in Washington. Dorian has battered the Bahamas for the past three days. \u201cWe expect it to be very devastating and the damage to be extreme,\u201d Neilly said.\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.\n\nThe Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas may require food for 14,500 people and Grand Bahama for 45,700 people, the U.N. World Food Programme said in a statement. The preliminary estimates were based on an assessment by representatives from Caribbean countries, the WFP and other organizations.\n\nHurricane Dorian is shown from the International Space Station more than 200 miles above the earth as it churns in the north-western Caribbean near the United States mainland in this photo taken September 2, 2019.

Dorian could drive seawater inland as it approaches, with parts of the northern Florida and Georgia coasts seeing as much as 7 feet (2 m), said NHC Director Ken Graham.\n\nAfter days of warnings to flee a storm that at its peak was rated at the top of the scale of hurricane strength, many residents of Florida\u2019s coast remained unsure whether to wait it out or evacuate.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a mandatory evacuation, but everyone I talked to is staying, and I don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m going to be ready and packed up in case I need to get on the road if they close those bridges,\u201d said Linda Cassano, a 53-year-old beautician who lives on Jacksonville Beach as she stocked up on water and food.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cWhat deterred me is everything was open, the garbage man came today, the post office was delivering, so those things kind of make you indecisive.\u201d", "description": "Hurricane Dorian carved a path of destruction through the Bahamas and relief officials on Tuesday were preparing for a humanitarian crisis after one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the islands killed at least five people, with the scale of the disaster as yet unknown.", "authors": ["Dante Carrer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425852974&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821QR"}
