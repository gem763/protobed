Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) may not be statistically the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. But on Tuesday night she was treated as such, pummeled by her competitors on a familiar front: her refusal to say whether taxes will go up on middle-income Americans as part of her plan to expand Medicare to cover every American.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard working middle class families, costs will go down,\u201d Warren assured.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has clashed in the past with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) over health care policy, quickly pounced on Warren\u2019s remark. Asked about dubbing the Senator\u2019s past comments \u201cevasive,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cYou heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why people in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nQuestions surrounding health care policy have provided the starkest divide among the Democratic presidential field since the informal start of the primary. And the same held true on Tuesday evening as the dividing lines mirrored those of past debates, with Warren and Sanders holding firm to their plans to expand Medicare to every American, and Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) staking out more moderate positions.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work,\u201d Klobuchar said during the exchange, echoing Buttigieg with a jab at Warren\u2019s reputation as the candidate with a \u201cplan\u201d for everything. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is a plan is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nQuestions about cost have dogged Medicare for All proposals among the Democratic presidential field. But while Warren has studiously avoided saying that her plan would result in a tax hike, Sanders has conceded the point, but argued that any increase in the middle class tax bill will be offset by lower health care costs.\n\nThough Warren doesn\u2019t say so as explicitly, the same argument undergirds her proposal. \u201cThe problem we have got right now is the overall cost of health care,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cYou can try to spin this any way you want.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this,\u201d Buttigieg told Warren.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571187567/191015-markay-pete-warren-tease_jgwwh9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
