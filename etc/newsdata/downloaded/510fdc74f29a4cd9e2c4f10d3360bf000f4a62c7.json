In the meantime, the facts of the case are instructive.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the woman, of Nigerian descent, has been diagnosed with a \u201c\u2018moderately severe\u2019 learning disorder and a mood disorder.\u201d There was, according to the Times report, no evidence that the unborn 22-week-old fetus was \u201cimpaired.\u201d\n\nIn short, the proposed compulsory abortion was to be the late-term destruction of a healthy child.\n\nIn her ruling, Lieven opined, \u201cI think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll.\u201d The woman\u2019s mental suffering would be worse, she asserted, if the child had to be removed and put up for adoption.\n\nThe woman\u2019s close family ties and pledges of support were blithely dismissed. This abortion was not only opposed by the woman, but also by the woman\u2019s mother, the child\u2019s grandmother, and a midwife, who stated that she would look after the child.\n\nLieven decided, however, that the dual task of looking after both her daughter and her grandchild would be too much for the grandmother. In effect, the judge determined that a compulsory abortion was the preferable course of action, better even than the child\u2019s potential adoption.\n\nNot surprisingly, the British judge\u2019s decision sparked outrage.\n\nSir Edward Leigh, a British member of Parliament, denounced Lieven\u2019s decision to impose mandatory abortion as a practice characteristic of China\u2019s communist regime. \u201cThe government should take urgent action to ensure this barbaric practice is eliminated from this country and from all countries,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Trump administration officials to intervene and offer a safe haven and alternative care for the mother and child in the United States.\n\nThis British controversy is, however, emblematic of a recurrent and even more troubling problem; namely, the episodic British assertion of statist supremacy and the usurpation of the fundamental rights of individuals and families in the provision of health care.\n\nThe most recent\u2014and most graphic\u2014example was the 2018 case of toddler Alfie Evans and his parents, Tom Evans and Kate James.\n\nBritish medical authorities, backed by the courts, determined that Alfie\u2019s medical condition (a neurodegenerative disorder) was terminal, and declared that they, and not the parents, had the right to determine the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d\u2014in this case, to die a \u201cdignified\u201d death.\n\nIn the course of the process, British officials denied the right of the parents to seek alternative medical care, including travel to an Italian hospital, to preserve and protect the life of their child.\n\nThe parents\u2019 right to try for a different outcome, even if highly doubtful, was denied. Millions around the globe were shocked by the case.\n\nThe case went to Britain\u2019s Supreme Court. In an April 20, 2018, four-page decision in the case, the three-judge panel of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled, \u201cIt is therefore clear law that the parents do not have the right to use the writ of habeas corpus to acquire the custody of their child if this will not be in his best interests.\n\n\u201cThe decisions of the trial Judge clearly amount to decisions that the parents have no right to direct Alfie\u2019s future medical treatment.\u201d\n\nIn the final paragraph of their decision, the judges ruled, \u201cThe hospital must be free to do what has been determined to be in Alfie\u2019s best interests. That is the law in this country.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile British cases of care denials, as well as this latest case of coercive abortion, highlight the key issue in modern health policy: Who is going to make the key decisions in health care, including the most difficult decisions over life and death?\n\nPerhaps no one has framed the alternatives better than professor Paul Krugman of the City University of New York, a champion of an American version of a \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care system.\n\nWriting in The New York Times, Krugman declared: \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve been lectured on the evils of big government and the glories of the private sector. Yet health reform is a job for the public sector, which already pays most of the bills directly or indirectly, and sooner or later will have to make the key decisions about medical treatment.\u201d\n\nKrugman added, \u201cMoreover, it\u2019s neither fair nor realistic to expect ordinary citizens to have enough medical expertise to make life-or-death decisions about their own treatment.\u201d\n\nKrugman\u2019s statist approach\u2014the transfer of \u201ckey\u201d decisions in health care to \u201cthe public sector\u201d\u2014is now embraced by almost half of the Democrats in the House of Representatives and leading Democratic senators.\n\nHouse and Senate versions of so-called \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation would not only abolish the existing Medicare program, but also outlaw any private or job-based coverage and restrict private consultations with physicians for services outside of the government system.\n\nFederal officials would henceforth determine what health benefits and medical services Americans would or wouldn\u2019t have access to in the new national program. Taxpayer funding of abortion, however, would be mandatory.\n\nIn the new dispensation, your \u201cbest interests\u201d could be a problem. If government officials know best what\u2019s good for you, they presume, you then have no need for health care alternatives. Government officials, well-schooled in \u201cprogressive\u201d ethics, will take \u201cgood\u201d care of you. Yeah, right.", "description": "After doctors in Britain\u2019s single-payer health system recommended that a mentally disabled woman undergo an abortion, a judge ordered the woman\u2014an unidentified Roman Catholic\u2014to have an abortion against her will.\u00a0\n\nIn her June 21 decision, Justice Nathalie Lieven\u2014a judge in Britain\u2019s Court of Protection, a panel that handles cases involving the mentally disabled\u2014declared, \u201cI have to operate in her best interests, not on society\u2019s view of termination.\u201d", "authors": ["Robert E.
