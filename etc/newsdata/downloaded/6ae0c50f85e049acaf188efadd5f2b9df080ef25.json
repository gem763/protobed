New York Times asks the candidates", "language": "en", "text": "This tweet from the New York Times is a few days old but it\u2019s been making the rounds Tuesday in advance of the Democratic debate. We hadn\u2019t even noticed, but the Times has apparently rounded up most of the Democratic candidates and asked them 18 questions on camera. Question No. 18 was if anybody deserved to have a billion dollars, and it\u2019s no surprise that got millionaire Bernie Sanders shouting and getting spittle all over the lens.\n\nAt least two of the candidates seem to realize this is America.\n\nEconomy: We tracked down nearly all the 2020 Democratic candidates earlier this year and asked them the same 18 questions. Question no. 18: \u201cDoes anybody deserve to have a billion dollars?\u201d Watch the video and explore more about the candidates. \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) October 11, 2019\n\nBeto, Bernie, and Warren are t h e w o r s t . \u2014 AnnaZ (@AnnaZ) October 15, 2019\n\nThis is not a serious question . To imagine, or suggest that these puppets would dare bite the well-manicured hands that feed them, AND make their campaigns possible. I would say this laughable, but the dishonesty of it is too cruel to be funny. \u2014 MarcoPelli (@Marcopelli1) October 15, 2019\n\nMotivation is the key to success, that\u2019s what makes the worlds greatest inventions.
