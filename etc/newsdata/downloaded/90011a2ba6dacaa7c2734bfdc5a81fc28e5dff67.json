Amusingly, the choice of date now means the leaders of Britain\u2019s political parties will learn their fates on Friday 13th \u2014 another inauspicious date to follow the failed Halloween Brexit of October 31st.\n\nAt last the deadlock in parliament is broken, Brexit now has a chance to succeed. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 29, 2019\n\nThe bill will now go to the House of Lords, the revising chamber, where it will be reviewed before becoming law, firing the starting gun on the winter 2019 general election campaign.\n\nAssuming there are no further roadblocks preventing the bill from passing, Britain will have its first December general election since 1923 and the first winter election since the 1970s. The winter is generally avoided for elections as bad weather can discourage voters from going to the polls, and makes the business of campaigning \u2014 which often involves sustained periods outside, knocking on doors canvassing.\n\nDespite the theoretical power the House of Lords enjoys, it is broadly unlikely they will prevent the election from going ahead.\n\nThe Prime Minister met with Conservative Members of Parliament immediately after the vote Tuesday night, delivering a pep-talk to prepare them for the coming General Election campaign before returning to his official residence, 10 Downing Street.\n\nWhy does this election matter?\n\nWhile Brexit remains the defining political issue for the United Kingdom, one of the key issues that have informed progress \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 over the almost three and a half years since the 2o16 referendum is the composition of Parliament.\n\nWith the majority of members in the present house being dead set against a full, clean-break Brexit and many opposing even a Brexit with a withdrawal agreement, parliament has consistently voted against Brexit in recent years. The issue has become so pronounced with the composition of the parties, informed by defections and expulsions in recent months, the government has become basically unable to govern.\n\nUnder normal conditions, this situation where the official government is constantly defeated in the chamber while the opposition is able to pass legislation would have led to a general election almost immediately \u2014 a balance in the constitution against dead governments. Yet the passage of a new law passed by the David Cameron government to appease then Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg neutered this, formalising for the first time that elections should be exactly five years apart and requiring a Parliamentary supermajority to call one early.\n\nThis stipulation gave the rough coalition of opposition, anti-Brexit parties the upper hand in Parliament because an early election relied on the support of the opposition, rather than being merely a decision for the Prime Minister.\n\nWhile a normal opposition leader would leap at the chance of an election to put their policy platforms to the people and take control of the country, Jeremy Corbyn became the first in British history to refuse that chance, leading to accusations that he was running scared from the British people who, it is claimed, he knew would not put him into office.\n\nThis left the United Kingdom in a peculiar situation where it had a government unable to govern, a shadow government frustrating Brexit from the opposition benches, and no opportunity to address the balance by voting in a new parliament that might better represent the views of the British people.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nWhile Boris Johnson will hope to win a decisive victory and hence control Parliament to pass his Brexit deal, the possibility remains that the British people will not respond well to his vision and deliver another hung Parliament, with no party claiming overall control.\n\nPrevious polling has highlighted the danger the to Prime Minister\u2019s electoral prospects at having failed to deliver Brexit \u2014 as he repeatedly promised \u2014 by October 31st. In Early October a Comres poll suggested that if Boris managed to deliver any Brexit \u2014 deal or no deal \u2014 by the end of the month, he could expect a decisive election victory afterwards. But if he delayed Brexit, if even slightly, the result would be inconclusive, with another hung parliament.\n\nThese results are by no means certain, however. Polling remains an imprecise art, with pundits and pollsters having misjudged the 2015 and 2017 general elections, and the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nOne route out of an electoral defeat remains open to Mr Johnson \u2014 an accommodation or alliance with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Reckoning that due to old animosities and party loyalties the Conservatives have no chance taking Brexit-voting Labour-held seats in the midlands, north, and Wales, Mr Farage offered an alliance to Boris Johnson where the two parties would not fight each other in seats where one or the other stood a good chance of winning against anti-Brexit candidates.\n\nThe pact would have the impact of not splitting the pro-Brexit vote between two parties and potentially allowing an anti-Brexit party to slip through, but will likely be seen as unacceptable to Tory strategists. The party considers itself a national force and contests every seat in every election in Great Britain regardless of the chances of success \u2014 to be the first Tory leader to concede particular areas to a competitor party would be a significant blow to the notoriously proud Boris Johnson\u2019s standing and legacy.\n\nIn earlier developments:\n\nMembers voted on a date:\n\nOpposition parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for the election, should it take place, to take place on December 9th rather than the 12th as proposed by the government. As Breitbart London reported earlier in the day, this was for a number of reasons including, it is claimed, to help the turnout of students in university towns on election day.\n\nBecause the election is so close to Christmas, it was thought the commencement of the seasonal holiday for students would mean many students would have already gone home, and consequently might be less likely to vote.\n\nAs it happened, Parliament voted against the date change 315 to 295 \u2014 a rare victory for the government.\n\nTen Tory rebels reinstated\n\nAn early attempt at a show of strength from Prime Minister Boris Johnson was to expel 21 members of parliament from the party who had voted against the government on key Brexit votes. This move was bitterly criticised in the mainstream media as it saw some favourite figures including the bitterly anti-Brexit campaigners Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond.\n\nNow ten of those expelled have had the Tory whip restored, with Alistair Burt, Caroline Nokes, Greg Clark, Sir Nicholas Soames, Ed Vaizey, Margot James, Richard Benyon, Stephen Hammond, Steve Brine, and Richard Harrington. Why these members, in particular, have been welcomed back and not others is not presently clear\n\nRichard Benyon, for instance, has already confirmed he will not be contesting the next election. On the other hand, Amber Rudd has subsequently voted with the government but has not been welcomed back yet.\n\nThis story is developing and more follows", "description": "Britain's members of Parliament have voted for the nation to\u00a0have a snap general election, its third in less than five years, on December 12th.
