To make matters worse, he was alone. Parker hadn\u2019t told anyone about his plan to take a short hike in the Mount Nebo area northwest of Brisbane, Australia on Sunday and a quick check of his cellphone confirmed that calling for help wasn\u2019t an option. There was no service in the deep rocky gully where he was now lying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Only way I\u2019m going to get rescued is self rescue,\u2019 \u201d said Parker, a seasoned hiker with years of experience volunteering for Australia\u2019s State Emergency Service. \u201cI knew where I was located there was no way they were going to be able to find me.\u201d\n\nIn what one doctor has called an \u201cincredible story,\u201d Parker crawled for two days, hauling his broken leg over about two miles of rugged terrain, before he was spotted Tuesday local time by a rescue helicopter and airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of any such survival effort with two broken limbs,\u201d Nicola Ward, an orthopedic surgeon who is treating Parker at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Queensland, said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe saga began early Sunday when Parker, a longtime member of a Brisbane bushwalking club, grabbed his hiking gear and a backpack full of supplies and headed out alone on the three-hour trek around Cabbage Tree Creek. If everything went according to plan, he anticipated being home by lunchtime.\n\nAbout 1 hour 40 minutes into the hike, Parker reached the waterfall, and soon after, he started the familiar climb. But this time, the normally solid rocks \u201cjust slipped and gave way,\u201d Parker said.\n\n\u201cI caught myself the first time as I started to slide,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had too much momentum and over I went.\u201d\n\nOn the way down, Parker recalled hitting a ledge and bouncing off the rock before landing in roughly three to four feet of water.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I didn\u2019t sustain a head injury, I think, is quite amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nWithout a personal locator beacon, Parker said his cellphone was his only means of contacting someone for help. But as he put away the phone after checking for service, he accidentally dropped it into the creek.\n\nThat\u2019s when Parker decided that he had to move if he was going to be found.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t told anybody where I was going,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no way of contacting anyone to tell them where I was or how I was or anything like that, so it was the worst possible scenario.\u201d\n\nUsing hiking poles and bandages as a splint because the \u201cwhole bottom of my leg came loose,\u201d Parker said he set his sights on an area about two miles away where locals often exercised. Then he started crawling.\n\n\u201cI had to carry my leg and legs are very heavy when they\u2019re not connected to anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d get about a meter, a meter and a half each time before I had to stop and take a break.\u201d\n\nAlong the way, Parker rationed his food \u2014 a handful of nuts, a protein bar and some lollipops \u2014 and pain medication. At night when the temperature dropped, he donned the thermal clothing he packed, trying and failing to get comfortable on the rocky ground.\n\n\u201cI was getting very emotional thinking this is not a nice way to die, just lying here, waiting, waiting,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t know was that people were looking for him.\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t show up for work on Monday, his boss called his ex-wife and she alerted his sisters. Parker said one person remembered him mentioning that he wanted to go to the creek over the weekend and relayed the information to his ex-wife. On Monday, his family started searching with help from his bushwalking group, ABC reported.\n\nThe next morning, Queensland Government Air joined the effort, dispatching a helicopter to the area.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, a rescue crew officer spotted a man \u201claying in a creek bed, under quite heavy tree canopy and waving a coloured object,\u201d according to a timeline provided to The Washington Post. Footage of the rescue shared to Facebook showed a man in a blue collared shirt and tan pants strapped to a board being lifted into the waiting helicopter.\n\nThe man was \u201clucky to be found,\u201d officials wrote in the Facebook post.\n\nEarlier today the QGAir Brisbane Rescue Helicopter, Rescue 500,was tasked to the Mt Nebo area to search for a bushwalker who had been missing since Sunday. The bushwalker had fallen from a waterfall and had sustained serious injuries. He was located by QGAir crew under a tree in a small clearing nearing the end of our first search. Our patient crawled to this position over 2 days in significant pain and was lucky to be found. He was winched to the helicopter and flown to hospital for further treatment.

It made a difference between getting out in this condition and probably not.\u201d\n\nWard, the orthopedic surgeon, said Parker sustained \u201csignificant injuries\u201d in the fall. In addition to breaking his wrist, the bones that make up Parker\u2019s ankle joint were fractured. His leg was \u201cdead weight and useless,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEach on their own I think would render a normal person incapable of getting out of the bush,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s done extremely well.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s idea to fashion his hiking poles into a splint was \u201cgenius,\u201d Ward said.\n\nA hospital spokesperson told The Post that Parker is expected to remain in their care for two more weeks. It will likely be another eight to 10 weeks before he can start putting weight on his leg, Ward said Wednesday, noting that the avid hiker may not return to \u201c100 percent normal function.\u201d\n\nBut Parker said that won\u2019t stop him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident that I\u2019ll get back out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI may not choose to do some more extreme stuff in the future moving forward, but it is my nature to be adventurous and want to give things a go.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Only way I\u2019m going to get rescued is self rescue,\u2019\u201d Neil Parker said. \u201cI knew where I was located there was no way they were going to be able to find me.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AZ535RWZ4MI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
