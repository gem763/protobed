REUTERS/Stringer\n\nHANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it has developed a new chip that specializes in machine-learning tasks and which will be used to enhance services for its cloud computing division.\n\nCalled Hanguang 800, the company\u2019s first self-developed AI chip is currently being used within Alibaba to power product search, automatic translation, and personalized recommendations on the e-commerce giant\u2019s web sites.\n\n\u201cThe launch of Hanguang 800 is an important step in our pursuit of next-generation technologies, boosting computing capabilities that will drive both our current and emerging businesses while improving energy-efficiency,\u201d Alibaba CTO Jeff Zhang said in a statement.\n\nAlibaba has no immediate plans to sell the chip as a standalone commercial product, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nOverseas tech giants such as Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc are also developing their own custom chips, aiming to improve the performance of specialized AI tasks at company-operated data centers.\n\nThe chip was developed by DAMO Academy, a research institute Alibaba launched in late 2017, and T-Head, the company\u2019s specialized semiconductor division.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s foray into the chip sector comes amid efforts by Beijing to promote China\u2019s semiconductor industry and reduce the country\u2019s reliance on foreign imports of core technologies.\n\nAlibaba also released its first core processor IP in July based on RISC-V open-source chip architecture. RISC-V gives firms a potential alternative to the dominant architecture of Britain\u2019s Arm Holdings Inc. Arm, a unit of Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, charges licensing fees for its use.\n\nIn cloud computing, Alibaba towers over rivals in China, commanding 47% of the market for cloud infrastructure services in the first quarter of 2019, according to research firm Canalys.", "description": "Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it has developed a new chip that specializes in machine-learning tasks and which will be used to enhance services for its cloud computing division.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433605084&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O06M", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
