It will also fuel speculation that Mr. Trump put private pressure on the Pentagon to deny Amazon the deal.\n\n\u201cThe National Defense Strategy dictates that we must improve the speed and effectiveness with which we develop and deploy modernized technical capabilities to our women and men in uniform,\u201d Defense Department Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy said in a statement. \u201cThe DoD Digital Modernization Strategy was created to support this imperative. This award is an important step in execution of the Digital Modernization Strategy.\u201d\n\nStill, the Pentagon made clear that no \u201csingle supplier\u201d can meet all of its information needs, suggesting there will continue to be roles for other companies in the future that \u201ccontinues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment as the department\u2019s needs are diverse and cannot be met by any single supplier,\u201d the Defense Department said.\n\nThe JEDI contract \u2014 which could last up to 10 years and ultimately be worth $10 billion over the life of the deal \u2014 will cover the storage and processing of huge amounts of classified Pentagon data, and Microsoft will now be linked in an unprecedented high-tech partnership with the U.S. military. The cloud, its proponents say, will enable the immediate sharing of data to battlefields around the world and would greatly aid the U.S. military in virtually everything it does.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft were the only two companies left in the running by the time of Friday evening\u2019s announcement. Oracle Corp, which initially expressed interest in the deal, filed a lawsuit earlier this year alleging behind-the-scenes dealings between Amazon and the Pentagon. A judge last summer dismissed that lawsuit, and the Pentagon has vehemently denied giving any preferential treatment to Amazon.\n\nIBM also initially bid on the contract.\n\nA host of lawmakers and even Mr. Trump have raised questions about whether the Defense Department structured the contract in a way that favored Amazon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They\u2019re saying it wasn\u2019t competitively bid,\u201d Mr. Trump said in July. \u201cAnd I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what\u2019s going on because I have had very few things where there\u2019s been such complaining.\u201d\n\nShortly after the president\u2019s comments, Defense Secretary Mark Esper launched an internal review of the JEDI process. Earlier this week, Mr. Esper recused himself from the final decision, citing a conflict of interest related to his son\u2019s employment with a company that bid on the contract. That left Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist to make the final call on the award.\n\nThe Pentagon also said it conferred with its inspector general before making the announcement.\n\n\u201cAll offers were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement.\n\nIn its own statement, Amazon maintained it would\u2019ve been the right choice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised about this conclusion,\u201d an Amazon Web Services spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion. We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.\u201d\n\nWhile the White House has denied that Mr. Trump involved himself in the Pentagon\u2019s bidding process, his distaste for Amazon and its founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, is common knowledge. Mr. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, one of the president\u2019s frequent media targets.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
