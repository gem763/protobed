In 2013, the ACT legalized same-sex marriage -- but it was struck down by a decision by Australia's highest court, which ruled that the ACT legislation was inconsistent with the national law.\n\nBut attitudes are changing. In 2016, the Australian Parliament passed an amendment allowing marijuana to be legally grown for medical and scientific purposes for the first time in Australia.\n\nIn neighboring New Zealand, possessing marijuana for personal use is still illegal, although the country is set to hold a referendum on legalizing it next year\n\nIf New Zealand does legalize marijuana, it will be only the third country in the world after Uruguay and Canada to do so. Nine states in the United States and the District of Columbia also allow recreational marijuana use, and the drug has been decriminalized in many parts of Europe.", "description": "", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925030125-cannabis-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
