When he gets his Irish up, this is the Ed Markey you're going to see,\" said Larry DiCara, a former Boston city councilor who volunteered on Markey's 1976 congressional campaign. \"I suspect Joe has been surprised at how many people are sticking with Eddie. This is not go ing to be one of those steamroller situations as people may have suggested before.\"\n\nEarly polling put Markey behind Kennedy by 14 percentage points in a match up, leading some pols to privately speculate Markey m ight retire rather than risk losing his seat.\n\nThe opposite has occurred.\n\nOn the morning of Kennedy's Senate campaign launch , Markey pulled the classic challenger\u2019s ploy \u2014 he called on Kennedy and his two lesser-known rivals, businessman Steve Pemberton and attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, to join him in a climate change debate.\n\nWhile Liss-Riordan and Pemberton accepted the debate invitation, Kennedy did not . Markey, after all, co-authored the \"Green New Deal \" and has put climate change front-and-center in his Senate campaign.\n\nSen. Ed Markey is facing Rep.

Even behind the scenes, Markey\u2019s campaign took an aggressive posture.\n\n\"Three of the candidates have AGREED to correct the mistake of the national party by holding a stand-alone climate debate first and soon. The proposal reflects the urgency of the climate crisis,\u201d Markey campaign manager John Walsh wrote in response to Kennedy's team, according to emails obtained by POLITICO. \u201cEd, Shannon, and Steve have agreed to a climate debate . \u2026 Does Congressman Kennedy agree to join us, or do you continue to reject the principle and urgency of a stand-alone climate debate to be held first?\u201d\n\nMichael Goldman, a political consultant who advised Kennedy's father and grew up with Markey in Malden, said Markey\u2019s forceful approach is a necessity.\n\n\"They're not blind to where they are,\" Goldman said. \"He's got to run the insurgent campaign because he is the underdog. That's the whole key to this race. The incumbent has to run as an insurgent. He has to be the aggressor. It turns everything on its head.\"\n\nEven though he's been in Congress since the Gerald Ford in the White House , Markey does not have all the advantages an incumbent usually enjoys. Kennedy holds a double-digit lead in the polls, and Markey's name recognition and public approval ratings hover around 40 percent \u2014 less than ideal. Additionally, Markey and Kennedy are virtually tied when it comes to money. Both men are starting with a little over $4 million in their campaign accounts.\n\nMassachusetts Playbook Our must-read rundown of what\u2019s up on Beacon Hill and beyond.

We're starting from behind, but we have the best candidate,\" said Walsh, a former chair man of the state Democratic Party, who joined Markey\u2019s campaign in late August.\n\nKennedy drew an early distinction in the race around corporate PAC money but Markey has sought to use it against him. Kennedy first pledged to stop taking that kind of cash several weeks ago and criticized Markey for not doing the same. But Markey's campaign sa id the senator also stopped taking corporate donations last month \u2014 he just didn't announce it.\n\nThen Markey turned the tables. He hit back at Kennedy's criticism with a 30-second video featuring a clip of Kennedy pledging not to take corporate PAC money, followed by a list of corporate PAC donations Kennedy accepted before he took the pledge. The list was superimposed over a grainy photo of the congressman.\n\n\"I put it out just to set the record straight so that it would be very clear, in fact, the real story about that issue,\" Markey told reporters at a picket line in Lawrence, Mass. , on Saturday. Both he and Kennedy spoke at the event.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5b/fa/2653f6504e8385303289e907d617/19928-ed-markey-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
