You have to give credit to Japan, they attacked us minute after minute.\n\n\u201cWe have to dust ourselves down and get better.\u201d\n\nIreland had claimed the lead through Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney \u2013 both of which came as a result of some smart kicking from fly-half Jack Carty \u2013 but failed to capitalise on their bright start as the Japanese set about eroding their opponents\u2019 lead.\n\nAfter three first-half penalties from Yu Tamura took the score to 9-12, the hosts landed the killer blow on the 60-minute mark, Kenki Fukuoka dotting down near the left-hand corner to cap off a bruising team effort.\n\nA fourth Tamura penalty extended Japan\u2019s lead before Fukuoka came within metres of a second following an interception in his own half.\n\nIreland head coach Joe Schmidt was magnanimous in defeat as he praised the hosts for their resilient performance.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Japan, what a furious and intense effort it was,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew it was potentially coming. They are a tremendous side and did really well.\u201d\n\nJapan captain Pieter Labuschagne said afterwards: \u201cWe are really happy, it is difficult to put it into words, just proud of every boy. That was a great game (against South Africa), but we came into this tournament with a new goal and knew what we wanted to do. We backed ourselves going into this game.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank each and everyone for coming out to support us, you were amazing.\u201d", "description": "Ireland\u00a0captain Rory Best admitted that his men were left \u201cchasing shadows\u201d in their shock World Cup defeat by Japan, adding that the side had been unable to provide \u201cthe right answers\u201d to the hosts\u2019 ferocious and spirited display.
