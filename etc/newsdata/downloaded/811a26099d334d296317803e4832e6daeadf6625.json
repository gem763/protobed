Are England too deep in the tournament for Jones to consider altering his back-three, or is now the right time with Elliot Daly failing to convince under the high ball?\n\nThe midfield is also up for debate. Will England revert to the combination of George Ford and Owen Farrell at 10 and 12, despite Henry Slade's key assist for Jonny May's second try against Australia?\n\nEngland's pack seems to almost pick itself, after outstanding performances from Sam Underhill and Tom Curry, but one area to address is who will partner Maro Itoje in the second row.\n\nDoes Jones return to partnering Itoje with his Saracens team-mate George Kruis, or continue with Courtney Lawes after his 15-tackle effort against the Wallabies?\n\nWith all these selection issues up for debate, it is over to you to select your starting England XV to take on New Zealand.", "description": "England take on New Zealand in the first semi-final of the Rugby World Cup on Saturday and there are a number of selection dilemmas facing Eddie Jones.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Ben Coles", "Paul Hayward", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213724254-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkOwR0iP77jSmoq9t8DUmdipGGXKrrnJaUW27AZWqTq0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
