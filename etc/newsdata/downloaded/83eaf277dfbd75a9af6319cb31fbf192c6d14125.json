About 60 people work for People\u2019s Vote at offices in Millbank, but the shape of the campaign in its current form is now uncertain.\n\nOne senior supporter said there had been a \u201cclash of egos and personality\u201d between Rudd, the brother of the former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd, and Mandelson. But they said there were also disagreements over how \u201cremainy\u201d the campaign should be and how far it should be linked to a wider realignment of politics, rather than just a vehicle through which to push for a second referendum.\n\nPrivate emails leaked to the Mail on Sunday suggested Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, another former New Labour communications adviser, had been attempting to work together against Rudd this year. In one email, Campbell said: \u201cI do not see how this gets done without a public battle and it should happen soon and be fast and brutal.\u201d\n\nAnother People\u2019s Vote insider said the dispute was about Mandelson and Campbell taking a stand against Rudd, who they accuse of trying to take control of the campaign and get rid of senior staff.\n\nIt comes at a time when MPs linked to the campaign are trying to win over soft-Brexit Tories, such as Oliver Letwin, Philip Hammond and David Gauke, to their cause in parliament, without scaring them off by turning into the pro-remain campaign of a referendum.\n\nPeople\u2019s Vote MPs were shown a presentation by the campaign in recent weeks, known as Project Marshall, suggesting that any remain campaign would need to target 60% of the vote share by changing the minds of former leave supporters, and not just appeal to people who are already passionately pro-EU.\n\nA People\u2019s Vote spokesman said: \u201cThe People\u2019s Vote campaign this weekend organised one of the biggest marches in British history [and] a letter-writing campaign that has attracted 150,000 signatories in just a few hours, while we will carry on working closely with MPs standing up against Boris Johnson\u2019s imposition of a hard Brexit in these crucial days ahead. All of us on this campaign, frankly, have better things to do than worry about who chairs the board of Open Britain \u2013 which is just one of the organisations that make up our brilliant campaign.\u201d", "description": "Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd wrangle over future remain campaign", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f64842c18317b586543d62ea6cdbc23a5dbb17ee/0_169_3500_2103/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee16debc07c75f697f07818b9cb72971", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
