Justice Kavanaugh, who vigorously denied the allegations, was confirmed by a 50-48 Senate vote largely along partisan lines.\n\n\u201c[W]e are all human beings, we all have pasts,\u201d said Justice Sotomayor, an Obama appointee who is by some reckonings the most liberal member of the court. \u201cNow, whether things occurred or didn\u2019t occur, all of that is irrelevant. It is yesterday, today is today and moving forward, I have to work with him. And because I have to work with him, my measure of him has to be what he is doing as a justice now,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Sotomayor spoke at a conference of judges in the federal judiciary\u2019s 10th Circuit, a six-state region based in the Mountain West that she oversees for the Supreme Court. She drew applause by praising a home-field favorite, Justice Gorsuch, whom President Trump elevated from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017.\n\nSeatmates at the court, she and Justice Gorsuch often have been seen chatting amicably or exchanging laughs on the bench. They also have teamed up to promote iCivics, a civics education program originally started under retired Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor \u2019s sponsorship. The two, she said, are slated to do a video together on civics for a judicial conference in October.\n\n\u201cThere is common ground in selected areas,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important not to forget that because those agreements are important in building bridges that help you in the future, perhaps, in slowing things down.\u201d\n\nBoth are also authors. Justice Sotomayor has been touring to support her new children\u2019s volume, \u201cJust Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, Be You,\u201d while Justice Gorsuch has been giving interviews about \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It,\u201d which presents his views on constitutional principles, judicial methods and the experience of his Supreme Court confirmation.\n\nJustices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nJustice Sotomayor did offer veiled criticism of her colleagues when an audience member asked if it was problematic that the Supreme Court draws the overwhelming majority of its law clerks from a handful of law schools\u2014those of Harvard, Stanford and Yale universities.\n\nShe and Justice Clarence Thomas \u2014both Yale Law graduates\u2014have made particular efforts to recruit law clerks educated at other institutions, Justice Sotomayor said, but she noted that as a whole, the Supreme Court hadn\u2019t confronted how narrow the pipeline to the highest echelon of the legal profession has become.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we\u2019re nine fiefdoms,\u201d she said, referring to the separate chambers of each justice. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t interact in the hiring practices of each other. It\u2019s a very sensitive discussion, and one that I don\u2019t believe my colleagues are willing to have as a collective,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "description": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that despite sharp ideological differences with Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, and the controversy that marred the latter\u2019s confirmation, she was working to build relationships with the Trump appointees that could moderate the Supreme Court\u2019s shift to the right.", "authors": ["Jess Bravin"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105966/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
