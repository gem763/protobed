We do not take gays. Cancel your booking.\"\n\nValllim replied to the owner's message, accusing him of homophobia.\n\nThe radiologist, who said he has never experienced something like this before, shared his experience on social media last year and received widespread support.\n\n(Image: CEN)\n\nSocial media user 'Lara' commented: \"I am a lesbian who has lived in Croatia my whole life and while I am aware most of my country hates me, I am still sorry that you could not experience the country's nicer parts.
