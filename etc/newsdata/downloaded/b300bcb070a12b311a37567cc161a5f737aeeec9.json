Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.\n\nA different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.\n\nGaynor's nomination to the post was expected. He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.\n\nBefore becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.", "description": "Trump nominates Peter Gaynor to be FEMA chief: White House", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8Q02S_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
