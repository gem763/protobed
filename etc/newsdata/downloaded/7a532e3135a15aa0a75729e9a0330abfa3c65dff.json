The proposal doesn\u2019t state how the new mining center will be powered, though.\n\nHowever, in 2013 a new hydroelectric plant was constructed further down the river that Old Rainbow is based on, and used to generate electricity. Hopefully the data center will be powered by this hydroelectric renewable energy.\n\nAs it happens, when plans for this new power plant were announced in 2009, the FERC demanded Old Rainbow\u2019s owners to find a new use for the building or to take it out commission.\n\nCredit: Creative Commons \u2013 Wikipedia Rainbow Dam, Missouri River, Montana\n\nThe Old Rainbow power plant, located in Montana, completely ceased operations in 2013 and since then has been the focal point in a series of discussions over what to do with it. Montana\u2019s locals however, are hesitant to demolish it because of its cultural and historic value to the local community.\n\nImportantly for some locals, the plan to turn the building into a cryptocurrency mining farm means it will remain largely unchanged. The proposed data center will have \u201cminimal impact and maintain the historic character of the building,\u201d the proposal states.\n\nH/T \u2013 The Block", "description": "A US power plant that's more than 100 years old, and is of significant historical value, is being saved from demolition by cryptocurrency.", "authors": ["Matthew Beedham", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fpower-plant-cryptocurrency-blockchain-cryptocurrency-old-rainbow-bitcoin.jpg&signature=fa427024ea31f008661c7e55f1a7d33c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
