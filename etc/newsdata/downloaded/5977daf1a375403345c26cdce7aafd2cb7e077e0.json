REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nThe U.S. Treasury sanctions targeted the Iran Space Agency, Iran Space Research Center and the Astronautics Research Institute, according to a statement on its website.\n\n\u201cThe United States will not allow Iran to use its space launch programme as cover to advance its ballistic missile programs,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.\n\nHe said Iran\u2019s Aug. 29 attempt to test a space launch vehicle underscored \u201cthe urgency of the threat.\u201d\n\nAn Iranian rocket exploded on its launch pad at Imam Khomeini Space Center in northern Iran before its scheduled launch last Thursday. The explosion followed Iran\u2019s failed attempt to launch a satellite in January.\n\nThe sanctions, part of a years-long U.S. pressure campaign to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons, are the first imposed on Iran\u2019s space agencies, according to the State Department. The United States fears long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads.\n\nThe Iran Space Agency develops satellites and launch vehicle technology, and works with the Iran Space Research Center on day-to-day tasks as well as research and development, according to the State Department. The two have also worked with a sanctioned liquid propellant ballistic missile organisation, Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, the State Department said.\n\nThe Astronautics Research Institute has managed the space vehicle launch project, according to the department.\n\nTehran denies its space activity is a cover for developing weapon launches.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter a photo of what appeared to be the site of the failed Iranian satellite launch.\n\n\u201cThese designations should serve as a warning to the international scientific community that collaborating with Iran\u2019s space programme could contribute to Tehran\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon delivery system,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a 2015 multi-national nuclear deal with Iran, saying it did not go far enough.", "description": "The United States imposed sanctions on Iran's civilian space agency and two research organizations on Tuesday, saying they were being used to advance Tehran's ballistic missile programme.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425890785&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821UX"}
