The pair said they were writing \u201cto express our concerns about TikTok \u2026 and the national security risks posed by its growing use in the United States\u201d.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cTikTok reportedly censors materials deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist party, including content related to the recent Hong Kong protests, as well as references to Tiananmen Square, Tibetan and Taiwanese independence, and the treatment of the Uighurs.\n\n\u201cThe platform is also a potential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on US-based social media platforms.\u201d\n\nBut in September the Guardian revealed how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is using the app to further Chinese foreign policy aims abroad. Leaked documents showed how TikTok had instructed its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square or Tibetan independence, or which may be critical of China.\n\n\u201cWith over 110m downloads in the US alone, TikTok is a potential counter-intelligence threat we cannot ignore,\u201d Schumer and Cotton wrote.\n\n\u201cGiven these concerns, we ask that the intelligence community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-based content platforms operating in the US and brief Congress on these findings.\u201d", "description": "Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton urged inquiry, noting app reportedly censors material such as Hong Kong protest content", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9f74510ad61b0b22176e9950b53fc1ec98f909/0_278_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5bced92d075a0dbc72f2fe4693d56974", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
