Joe McCarthy believed there was a Soviet agent lurking under every bed and began naming some without much proof. Critics were correct to lambast him, but today\u2019s Democrats would embarrass even McCarthy.\n\nAny Joseph R. McCarthy Award would have to be awarded to Hillary Clinton, and then perhaps retired. No figure in politics today or in any rationally imaginable future is likely to channel the late senator as well as Mrs. Clinton.\n\nSince dreaming up the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d as the source of her husband\u2019s troubles in the 1990s, the woman has developed into quite a conspiracy buff. What\u2019s more, she has managed to set the tone for an entire party, which has come to blame its every misfortune on Russia. Mrs. Clinton lost to Donald Trump in 2016 not because most voters found her and her views unlikable, but because Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was and is in cahoots with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin. Mrs. Clinton set out to \u201cprove\u201d the existence of the conspiracy by using campaign cash to pay other presumably more trustworthy Russians to dig up or make up dirt on her opponent and to persuade her fellow Democrats that the Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative could be used to weaken or even bring down a president they disliked.\n\nDemocrats in Congress and their friends in the progressive media loved labeling political opponents as Russian \u201cagents,\u201d \u201cassets\u201d or \u201cdupes,\u201d and set about doing so with a vengeance that would have made the staunchest McCarthyite proud. Congress launched numerous investigations and an independent counsel was appointed to gather evidence both of collusion and the supposedly pivotal role Vladimir Putin played in helping the forces of darkness steal the 2016 presidential election. Since they knew, after all, that not even the most deplorable among us would have voted for Mr. Trump over Hillary if we were thinking rationally, they charged that voters had been duped by Kremlin-inspired social media propaganda.\n\nAt one point, a Republican congressman observed that he was checking the labels on the vodka he enjoyed to make sure it wasn\u2019t from Russia lest he be accused of being a Russian puppet. The attorney general of the United States was condemned for attending a program at The Heritage Foundation also attended by Moscow\u2019s ambassador to the United States. As a former NRA president, I was personally attacked and labeled a Russian agent for leading a gun group to Russia to talk guns and attending a \u201csecret\u201d meeting in Moscow in 2015 with that country\u2019s deputy prime minister. My \u201cmeeting,\u201d like Attorney General Jeff Session\u2019s at Heritage was also part of a much larger meeting, hosted in this case by the Russian Shooting Federation.\n\nWhen no one was able to demonstrate any collusion, one might have expected Democrats and the media would move on, but instead they have doubled down and now claim virtually everything that happens in Washington is orchestrated by the Russians.\n\nThat poor Mrs. Clinton is delusionally fixated on Mr. Putin\u2019s ability to manipulate and control the politics of this country through dupes, assets and agents is obvious, but her remarkable ability to persuade fellow Democrats that anyone who disagrees with their views is an agent of a foreign power and a borderline traitor is remarkable. McCarthy\u2019s charges though closer to being true than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s never garnered such support. Even though labeling the Senate Majority Leader \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d raised few eyebrows, Mrs. Clinton and her fellow witch hunters may finally have gone too far. Last week, without any evidence whatever, she denounced Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic congresswoman and presidential wannabe, a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nOne might have expected Democratic leaders to denounce this baseless and mean-spirited attack on a combat-tested veteran, but most, with the exception of Sen. Bernie Sanders and a few minor wannabes remained silent, even as many in the media rushed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defense. An MSNBC panelist went so far as to suggest that Hillary\u2019s charge should be taken seriously since Ms. Gabbard \u201chas never denied being a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nIn the interview where Mrs. Clinton slandered Ms. Gabbard, she felt compelled to repeat her belief that in spite of all evidence to the contrary, she continues to believe the worst of the president of the United States, declaring that while \u201cI don\u2019t know what Putin has on him, whether it\u2019s both personal and financial \u2026 I assume it is.\u201d\n\nAs far as Mrs. Clinton, her fellow Democrats and the media are concerned the conspiracy that dominates their thinking explains all, a view best articulated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a White House meeting. Pointing at the president she charged \u201cAll roads lead to Putin.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for responsible political leaders of both parties to say \u201cenough\u201d and dismiss Mrs. Clinton and her fellow conspiracy buffs\u2019 rants.\n\n\u2022 David A.
