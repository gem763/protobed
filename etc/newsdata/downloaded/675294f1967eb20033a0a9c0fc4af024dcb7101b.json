(Sept. 2) AP\n\nJulie Andrews is opening up about how therapy has helped her.\n\nThe veteran actress stopped by \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" Monday to promote her new memoir, \"Home Work,\" and revealed the role that therapy has played in her life.\n\n\"Sadly, I'd separated from my lovely first husband and separations were always inevitable and the marriage was over,\" the actress told the late night host. \"My head was so full of clutter and garbage and believe it or not, it was (film and theater director) Mike Nichols who really tipped me into wanting to go to therapy because he had been \u2026 He was so sane and so funny and clear. He had a clarity I admired so much, and I wanted that for myself and I didn't feel I had it.\n\n\"I went and I got into it, and it saved my life in a way,\" she said.\n\nColbert asked the \"Sound of Music\" actress why she chose to share her experience with therapy.\n\n\"Why not, if it helps anybody else have the same idea?\" Andrews said. \"These days, there's no harm in sharing it. I think everybody knows the great work it can do. Anybody that is lucky enough to have it, afford it, and take advantage of it, I think it would be wonderful.\"\n\nJulie Andrews' new book: 5 things we learned about 'Mary Poppins' and 'Sound of Music'\n\nAndrews, 84, also told Colbert \"Mary Poppins\" was the \"best film I ever made.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Andrews discussed working with Dick Van Dyke on the iconic musical film.\n\n\"We hit it off from day one,\" Andrews wrote of Van Dyke. \"He was dazzlingly inventive, always in a sunny mood, and he often made me roar with laughter at his antics.\"\n\nShe also admitted that at the time of filming, she was still learning how to act in front of a camera. \"If I happen to catch the film these days, I'm struck by the seeming lack of self-consciousness on my part; a freedom and ease that came from total ignorance and flying by the seat of my pants (no pun intended!),\" she wrote.\n\nAnother revelation from the memoir? Andrews wasn't \"wildly impressed\" with \"The Sound of Music\" at first.\n\nShe said that she attended the Broadway production with her husband, and although they \"loved the music \u2026 the show seemed rather saccharine to us.\"\n\nAndrews wrote that she would be \"forever grateful for the nudge over the fence\" to participate in the movie, which won the Academy Award for best picture and earned her a best actress nomination.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/julie-andrews-says-therapy-saved-her-life/4060963002/", "description": "Julie Andrews got candid about therapy when she stopped by \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" Monday night.", "authors": ["Anika Reed", "Published A.M.
