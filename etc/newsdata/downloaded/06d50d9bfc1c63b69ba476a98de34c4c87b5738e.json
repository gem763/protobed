He did not address the risks or financial market tensions that central banks in Europe and Japan have confronted as a result of their negative rate policy, or the larger issue that negative rates have not secured higher growth or higher inflation for those economies.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term,\" Trump tweeted. \"We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet... The USA should always be paying the ... lowest rate. No Inflation!\"\n\n\"It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of (Fed Chairman) Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing,\" added Trump, who has repeatedly noted that rates are negative in Germany, Europe's trading powerhouse.\n\nThe president's comments precede a week in which the world's major central banks, including the Fed, are expected to lower rates or otherwise loosen monetary policy in what is widely seen as a move to protect the global economy against risks partly rising from Trump's trade war with China.\n\nBut the quarter of a percentage point cut expected by the Fed is not likely to satisfy Trump, who has called on Powell and the Fed to quickly and dramatically cut rates as a way to boost slowing U.S. economic growth ahead of his re-election bid next year.\n\nLast month, however, Trump told reporters at the White House that he did not want to see negative rates in the United States, and analysts on Wednesday said the still-growing U.S. economy would be put at risk if the Fed pursued them.\n\nWhile perhaps appropriate in \"recessionary\" conditions, zero or negative rates in a growing economy with record-low unemployment \"may ultimately create the next financial crisis - people taking on more risk than they would otherwise because money is even cheaper,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump has bragged about his use of debt as a real estate investor. As far as managing the federal government's affairs, interest on outstanding U.S. Treasury securities will be nearly $400 billion in the current fiscal year and rise to more than $914 billion by 2028, according to the Pew Research Center. \u200b\n\nStill, interest accounts for about 8.7% of all federal outlays, down sharply from the mid-1990s when it accounted for more than 15% of spending following an era of ultra-high interest rates in the 1970s and 1980s, the Pew data showed.\n\nA White House official who asked to speak on background said in response to the president's tweets that \"the president is looking at every tool available to lower the national debt and we ask Congress to join us in cutting back on wasteful spending.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ENEMY\" POWELL TO SPEAK NEXT WEEK\n\nTrump handpicked Powell as head of the U.S. central bank, but quickly soured on his by-the-book approach and insistence on Fed independence.\n\nThe president last month referred to him as an \"enemy\" on par with the head of the communist-led Chinese government and kept up his personal line of attack on Powell and the Fed in his tweets on Wednesday: \"A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of 'Boneheads.'\"\n\nOn Friday, Powell said the Fed would act appropriately to help maintain the U.S. economic expansion and that political factors played no role in the central bank's decision-making process.\n\nHe will hold a news conference next Wednesday at the end of the Fed's two-day policy-setting meeting.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates in July for the first time in more than a decade. Financial markets expect the Fed to again lower its benchmark rate, currently at 2.00-2.25%, when it meets Sept. 17-18.\n\nStory continues", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on the \"boneheads\" at the  Federal Reserve to push interest rates down into negative territory, a move reluctantly used by other world central banks to battle weak economic growth that risks punishing savers and banks' earnings in the process", "authors": ["Howard Schneider"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QWcQsSLUPtUEJnWUzTONEQ--~B/aD0yMDIxO3c9Mjc4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/b8eedd50-d48d-11e9-87ba-c7f1e611b59c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
