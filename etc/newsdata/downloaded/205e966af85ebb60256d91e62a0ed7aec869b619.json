Whatever her reasons for saying the things she has said, it is not for the defendants to say why that is.\n\n'The victim was happy to be in the room with these two men and consented to what took place in that room.\n\n'When asked by officers what happened, the victim said 'nothing' and then 'oh god, nothing bad'.\n\n'Is that her conscience? Things were taken out of her hands.\n\n'She then says 'they were all great guys'.\n\nJLS shot to fame on X Factor in 2008 after finishing runners-up to Alexandra Burke and went on to sell over ten million records.
