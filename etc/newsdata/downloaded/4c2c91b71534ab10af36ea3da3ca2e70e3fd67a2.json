They got completely soaked and things got even worse when they were caught by a huge gust of wind sending the bags everywhere.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAngela writes: \"I watched the whole thing happen in slow motion from the plane - I felt so sorry for them scrambling around trying to pick up Her Majesty's soaked clothes.\"\n\nWhen they returned to London Angela decided to search for a new alternative to the Queen's luggage situation, popping into House of Fraser to see if they had anything suitable.\n\nShe bought a number of lightweight cases on wheels - which they still use today.\n\nAngela writes: \"I'm happy to say that this has been a successful and very welcome change.\"\n\nThe cases are packed very carefully to check the weight is similar on both wheels to ensure they don't topple over.", "description": "The Queen doesn't travel light, and a 10-day Roy Tour can require up to 30 outfits including back ups for every engagement in case something goes wrong on the day", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Afp", "Tim Rooke Rex Shutterstock", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9541204.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-ROYALS-CHRISTMAS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
