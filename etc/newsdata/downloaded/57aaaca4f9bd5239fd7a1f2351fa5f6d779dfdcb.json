Rallies have so far failed in early May and late July. Prices are close to knocking on the prior high of early May so now is the time to start building a long position.\n\nUTX is above both the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been moving up from late December and it has made a new high this month before prices have - the OBV line often leads prices.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line and looks poised to turn higher.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of UTX, below, we can see that aside from a \"temporary\" decline in December of last year, prices have made a large consolidation pattern between $120 and $145. The pattern is $25 high so a breakout on the upside should propel UTX to at least $170 (adding the $25 to the top of the range). Because the consolidation pattern is so big I would expect the (eventual) breakout to carry further than $170.\n\nPrices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is close to a new high and the MACD oscillator has turned up to a new buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of UTX, below, we can see an upside price target of $173.43. A trade at $143.60 will refresh the uptrend.\n\nBottom line strategy: These three charts all tell a bullish story. Traders could go long UTX at current levels and on strength above $144. Risk a close below $133. The $173 area is our first potential upside price target.", "description": "Let's look at a strategy based on our series of three charts....UTX", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "How To Plan For", "Handle The Approaching Breakout On United Technologies", "Let'S Look At A Strategy Based On Our Series Of Three Charts.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Debra Borchardt", "Bob Lang", "Peter Tchir"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/907a2deb-8b88-11e9-a5aa-8d9453642677.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
