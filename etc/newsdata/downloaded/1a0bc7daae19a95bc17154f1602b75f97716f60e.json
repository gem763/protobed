Him. Us. is the groundbreaking HIV campaign from GMFA \u2013 the gay men\u2019s health project \u2013 and it is returning to London and across the country this month.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s predecessor was targeted for black gay and bisexual men, but this time the aim is to increase representation of South Asian men specifically.\n\nThe campaign was created by and stars a team of passionate South Asian gay and bisexual men who are looking to make positive and effective change in their communities.\n\nThey say there is a chronic lack of representation of South Asian gay and bisexual men in health campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing South Asian and same-sex attracted can be a delicate balancing act,\u2019 says Alexander Leon, one of the campaign\u2019s project leads.\n\n\u2018We educate our community while showcasing some of its less celebrated members\u2019 (Picture: GMFA)\n\n\u2018For me, the clash of trying to observe cultural norms while navigating an emerging queer identity was a deeply isolating experience.\n\n\u2018It seemed impossible to stay true to my authentic self while maintaining a meaningful relationship with my loved ones whose culture or religion sometimes dictated intolerance.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s more, as I began to come into my own as a gay man, it became achingly evident that there was meagre representation of South Asian gay and bisexual men in LGBTQ+ social spaces and media.\u2019\n\nAlex says that the new campaign highlights an important inequality faced by gay and bisexual South Asian men, but that\u2019s not all.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an ingenious double whammy,\u2019 he adds. \u2018We educate our community while showcasing some of its less celebrated members.\n\n\u2018Me. Him. Us. is important because it delivers a crucial message on HIV prevention to a demographic who sorely need to hear it.\u2019\n\nHe says that the choice to place campaign ads in LGBTQ+ social spaces around the country sends a clear message to any South Asian men feeling isolated by the combination of homophobia and racism: \u2018You, your identity, your life and your choices are valid.\u2019\n\nIan Howley, Chief Executive of LGBT HERO, the parent organisation of GMFA said: \u2018It\u2019s important that South Asian men have a platform to create personal and social change in our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For far too long, these men have been an afterthought, or used in a tokenistic way. This version of Me. Him. Us. puts South Asian gay and bisexual men front and centre of a national campaign. That\u2019s really important.\n\n\u2018For far too long, these men have been an afterthought, or used in a tokenistic way\u2019 (Picture: GMFA)\n\n\u2018Me. Him. Us. will continue to work with black, South Asian, and other minority groups within our community to create effective campaigns that highlight the inequalities these men face while increasing representation within our community and in the wider population.\u2019\n\nThis campaign is so important because South Asian gay and bisexual men are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV, and at a later stage too.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we increase the need for frequent testing for HIV and STIs for South Asian gay and bisexual men,\u2019 adds Ian. \u2018At LGBT HERO we recommend that all sexually active men, no matter their background, are tested for HIV at least every six months.\u2019\n\nSince the campaign was launched this week, Alexander has been blown away by the overwhelmingly positive reaction:\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been so heartening to see the reaction online to the campaign,\u2019 Alexander tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Gay and bisexual South Asian men are so rarely represented in the media, whether LGBT-specific or mainstream, and I\u2019m so honoured to be a part of a campaign which is pushing the envelope on diversifying representations of same sex love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The message of the campaign is landing.\n\n\u2018HIV testing and awareness is profoundly important to our community, and with campaigns like Me. Him. Us catering to specific sub-sections who are particularly at risk, the message is going to those who need to hear it the most.\u2019\n\nMORE: Woman completes 10k obstacle race with hi-tech \u2018pirate leg\u2019 after breaking her ankle\n\nMORE: Couple spends 37 years and \u00a315,000 transforming beautiful garden that now attracts thousands of tourists\n\nMORE: Skin infection cellulitis makes baby look like she has a black eye\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "South Asian gay and bisexual men are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV - the Me.
