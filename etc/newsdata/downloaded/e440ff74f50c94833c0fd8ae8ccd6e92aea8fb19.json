Sgt. Matthew Slaydon and his wife, Annette, did not hold back their tears when 50 community members cheered as they stepped into their new house in Bayfield.\n\n\u201cI plan on living the rest of my life here, and I plan on paying this forward,\u201d Slaydon commented during the Walls of Honor event. \u201cI\u2019ve got so many people that don\u2019t have any scars, but they\u2019re so horribly wounded still, that I want to share this with.\u201d\n\nThe mortgage-free home was donated by the Gary Sinise Foundation along with other donors and specially designed to meet all of Slaydon\u2019s needs.\n\nThe house will give him independent mobility so he can enjoy every inch of the property, according to his wife.\n\n\u201cMatt\u2019s going to be able to wander this property on his own, which is something he hasn\u2019t done in 12 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important, as we sit here and say thank you today, that you can really understand what a difference this is making in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nDuring his third deployment in Baghdad in 2007, a roadside bomb filled with nails and wood screws exploded two feet away from Slaydon, which caused him to lose his left arm and left eye. He now lives with bilateral blindness.\n\n\u201cThrough his recovery process, Matthew was inspired to keep going because of his sense of duty, his family, and his military brothers and sisters. His wife, Annette, was by his side through the entire process,\u201d the foundation\u2019s website stated.\n\nOn Thursday, the foundation tweeted a photo of Slaydon and his wife inside their future home:\n\nYesterday, U.S. Air Force (Ret.) TSgt Matthew Slaydon and his wife Annette attended a Walls of Honor event for their future specially adapted smart home as part of the Foundation's R.I.S.E. program. Attendees wrote messages on the Slaydon's home framing. https://t.co/YsQg4DKqF4 pic.twitter.com/iJAurvpg0l \u2014 GarySiniseFoundation (@GarySiniseFound) October 24, 2019\n\n\u201cThis house is going to have all this technology in it to be able to help him live a more full and happy life here,\u201d said foundation spokesman Chris Kuban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about helping veterans to help other veterans. We can\u2019t change every veteran\u2019s life, but we can change this veteran\u2019s life,\u201d he concluded.\n\nOnce the house is completed, the Slaydons plan to move from their current home in Phoenix to the new house in May.", "description": "A wounded Iraq war veteran and his wife were welcomed into their nearly-finished smart home on Wednesday in Colorado.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Gary-Sinise-Foundation-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
