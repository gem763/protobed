While the $11 billion sum is large, it's far smaller than the roughly $20 billion that the insurance companies wanted, after paying out billions to California wildfire victims.\n\nThe settlement will require the approval of a bankruptcy court, as PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January and recently entered into a Chapter 11 reorganization plan.\n\nIn a statement about the outcome, the insurance companies \u2014 which banded together as the Ad Hoc Subrogation Group \u2014 said that while their initial claim wasn't fulfilled, \"we hope that this compromise will pave the way for a plan of reorganization that allows PG&E to fairly compensate all victims and emerge from Chapter 11 by the June 2020 legislative deadline.\"\n\nPG&E CEO and President Bill Johnson, who joined the company in April, says the settlement is \"another step in doing what's right for the communities, businesses, and individuals\" that suffered damages from the fires.\n\nPG&E's transmission lines were immediately suspected of playing a role in the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise \u2014 and in May, state fire investigators confirmed that the utility's electrical lines were to blame.\n\nIn June, PG&E announced it would pay $1 billion to 18 local governments and agencies affected by three large wildfires: the 2015 Butte Fire, the 2017 North Bay Fires and the Camp Fire. Butte County and Paradise will receive more than $500 million of that amount.\n\nPG&E still faces a third large group of legal claims from individual plaintiffs, whose cases are pending in federal and state courts.", "description": "The deal, which a bankruptcy court must approve, covers most of the claims from the Camp Fire in 2018 and Northern California wine country fires in 2017.
