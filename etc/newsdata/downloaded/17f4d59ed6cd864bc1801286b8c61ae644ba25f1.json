The court also directed the agency to rethink how removing the protections would impact public safety and low-income consumers.\n\nHere\u2019s why this next phase of the net neutrality fight could play out differently than in the past.\n\nSilicon Valley is distracted: 10 years ago, when companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon were just starting to build Washington operations, net neutrality was a major focus of their efforts. They advocated for equal treatment of all online traffic, arguing that the broadband providers that own internet pipes should not be allowed to slow down, block or charge extra for competitors' content.\n\nToday, net neutrality is the least of Silicon Valley\u2019s worries. Tech companies are facing much larger regulatory threats to their businesses \u2014 ranging from antitrust investigations spurred by calls to break them up, to proposals to end a \"safe harbor\" provision that has protected them from liability for user-contributed content.\n\nWhile they still support the concept of net neutrality, the biggest tech platforms also don\u2019t necessarily need the protections they once championed. Google\u2019s YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon, for example, have enough market leverage on their own when negotiating with the major ISPs like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter.\n\nYes, but: Tech workers still care deeply about net neutrality, and the next generation of internet platforms like Vimeo and Etsy will likely be pushing for rules.\n\nPower of streaming: Video streaming services are much more robust and popular now, which may change the business dynamic between the tech companies and telecom companies.\n\nTrying to compete with the tech giants, ISPs have launched their own streaming services.\n\nThat means that, in some cases, the telecom giants may be arguing for dual business interests \u2014 for control over traffic on their own broadband networks and against discriminatory behavior by other network operators. ( Yes, but: The telcos' own streaming services are still relatively small compared to the tech industry's properties.)\n\nThe telcos' own streaming services are still relatively small compared to the tech industry's properties.) Other new streaming services, like those being launched by Apple and Disney, could bring those companies off the sidelines of the debate.\n\nFight moves to the states \u2014 and Congress: The court confirmed states' ability to pass their own rules governing how broadband providers treat web traffic within their borders, opening the doors for some progressive states to implement rules that may go even further than the Obama-era rules that the Trump FCC reversed.", "description": "A court ruling means the long net neutrality battle could fan out to the 50 states.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/5XBCMz2Wp9OoRCs7ueHwKXn7YJ0=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/10/02/1569974664093.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
