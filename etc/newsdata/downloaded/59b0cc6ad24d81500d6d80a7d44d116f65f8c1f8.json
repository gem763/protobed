The challenger turns to the president and charges: \u201cYou asked the Ukrainian president to investigate your opponent\u2019s son\u2019s shady business dealings.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cyou released the transcript of your phone call last year with him in which you said, \u2018there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then you said, and I quote, \u2018Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, arriving at his rhetorical crescendo, the nominee declares victoriously, \u201cHorrible? What\u2019s horrible wasn\u2019t me as vice president using the threat of withholding $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees that Ukraine needed to stay solvent to get the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating my son\u2019s client fired. No, what\u2019s horrible is a president of the United States using the power of his office to dig up foreign dirt on a political opponent.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t quite work, does it? In fact, it would, if you will, trump Joe Biden\u2019s long history of verbal blunders as the gaffe of all gaffes of the entirety of his four-and-a-half decades in Washington.\n\nDemocrats \u2014 from high-ranking party operatives to rank-and-file primary voters \u2014 know this, which is why the transcript released by the Trump White House on Wednesday dooms Biden\u2019s 2020 chances, not Trump\u2019s.\n\nAt The Root Of Trump-Zelensky: Hunter Biden\n\nFirst of all, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky made it very clear in this July 25 phone call that he was already going to be having his new government investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s client firm, the private Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma; he was not the least bit vague with Trump.\n\n\u201cSince we have won the absolute majority in our parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person,\u201d Zelensky told the president. \u201cHe or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty, so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.\u201d\n\nZelensky then asked, \u201cif you have any additional information that you can provide to \u03bcs, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as Zelensky told the assembled press as he met with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday, \u201cnobody pushed me,\u201d that there was no pressure imposed on him from Trump.\n\nBut secondly and more importantly, it will give much more attention to what is at the root of the Trump-Zelensky conversation \u2014 Hunter Biden\u2019s continual self-destructive shenanigans and his father\u2019s susceptibility to his son\u2019s wishes.\n\nA New Yorker article in July originally entitled \u201cFather and Son\u201d by investigative staff writer Adam Entous manages to be sympathetic while delivering tremendously damaging information about the son\u2019s money-making and the father\u2019s judgment.\n\nOn Hunter\u2019s dealings with a suspect Chinese private equity fund in 2012, Entous writes, \u201cWhen I asked members of Biden\u2019s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the vice president, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. \u2018Everyone who works for him has been screamed at,\u2019 a former adviser told me. Others said that they were wary of hurting his feelings. One business associate told me that Biden, during difficult conversations about his family, \u2018got deeply melancholy, which, to me, is more painful than if someone yelled and screamed at me. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve hurt him terribly. That was always my fear, that I would be really touching a very fragile part of him.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf Joe Biden was that sensitive to candid counsel when he was in his late 60s, how will he be as a 78-year-old president 16 months from now?\n\nIn late 2015, according to Entous, \u201cAmos Hochstein, the Obama administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter\u201d with the then-vice president about Hunter\u2019s relationship with Burisma, \u201cbut did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u2018Dad said, \u201cI hope you know what you are doing,\u201d and I said, \u201cI do.\u201d\u201d\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter\u2019s scolding of his out-of-control brother Billy\u2019s embarrassing antics working for the government of Libya was tougher than that. In the heat of his 1980 re-election campaign Carter admitted: \u201cI am deeply concerned that Billy has received funds from Libya and that he may be under obligation to Libya.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll Do Whatever You Want Me To Do\u2019\n\nEntous also offers that \u201cHunter saw himself as a provider for the Biden family; he even helped to pay off [his late brother] Beau\u2019s law-school debts.\u201d Just how much license did Hunter believe that gave him in generating money?\n\nWhen the already-married Hunter and Beau\u2019s widow embarked on a relationship, according to Entous, he appealed to his father for a public statement of approval.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Dad, Dad, you have to.\u2019 He said, \u2018Hunter, I don\u2019t know if I should. But I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do.\u2019\u201d Entous writes, \u201cA former Biden aide confirmed that Biden agreed to issue a statement because of concerns about Hunter\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe to Hunter: I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do\u201d might well be the Biden presidential campaign\u2019s epitaph.\n\nEntous also tells of \u201cthe Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans\u201d giving Hunter \u201ca 2.8-carat diamond \u2026 estimated to be worth $80,000 \u2026 Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars.\u201d In February of last year, the Chinese detained Ye \u201creportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through.\u201d\n\nAmidst all this, and Hunter\u2019s lingering alcohol and drug difficulties, it\u2019s hard to see how Joe Biden\u2019s soft spot for his son, while understandable, won\u2019t negatively affect his judgment as an extremely elderly president. \u201cHunter said that, in his talks with his father,\u201d Entous discloses, \u201cI\u2019m saying sorry to him, and he says, \u2018I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry,\u2019 and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry. And we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nJoe Biden as president is the antidote? Disclosure of the Ukraine transcript will more than anything else shine the spotlight on the ongoing fiasco of first son-wannabe Hunter Biden. Chances are most Americans won\u2019t agree with Hunter that his father winning the presidency is the recovery therapy he needs.\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
