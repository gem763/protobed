He wrote:\n\nIn the wake of the chants directed at Lukaku, Serie A announced a new anti-discrimination initiative that will start in October, per Football Italia.\n\n\u201cLega Serie A has always been against all forms of discrimination and is strongly committed to countering a heinous phenomenon that, though perpetrated by a few stupid people, damages the whole system,\" Serie A president Gaetano Micciche and CEO Luigi De Siervo said in a statement. \u201cIn October, a national and international initiative will be launched, involving the 20 Serie A teams, with the aim of making every supporter aware of such a delicate and important issue. Each club will be asked to select their own player, who will become part of Serie A\u2019s \u2018Team Against Racism\u2019, a testimonial that will be the bearer of the values \u200b\u200bof respect and equality in the first person. Racism is a cultural problem, everyone\u2019s commitment will be needed, from experts to fans, to spread a positive, consistent and appropriate model for a civilised country like Italy through its stadia.\u201d\n\nLukaku, 26, only joined Inter from Manchester United last month, and he has so far scored in both his Serie A appearances for his new club.\n\nHis former United team-mates, Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, have both been subjected to racist abuse on social media after missing penalties in the Premier League this term.\n\nHarry Maguire made similar calls to Lukaku for social media sites to be better equipped at handling racist abuse:\n\nBut those were not isolated incidents, and nor was the abuse of Lukaku on Sunday.\n\nLast season, 19-year-old Moise Kean was targeted with racist abuse at Cagliari while playing for Juventus, and Blaise Matuidi has suffered similarly at the same stadium:\n\nAs such, it is difficult to argue with Lukaku's assertion that not enough action has been taken to deal with the issue.", "description": "Romelu Lukaku  has said football is \"going backwards\" on tackling racist abuse after some in the crowd  subjected him to  monkey chants while he was playing for  Inter Milan  against   Cagliari   on Sunday at the  Sardegna Arena...", "authors": ["Rory Marsden"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/175/hi-res-efb247cf42803d4a353ca9500619ce8b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
