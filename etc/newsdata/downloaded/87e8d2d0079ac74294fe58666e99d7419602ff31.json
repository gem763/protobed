Jean\n\nAs I approach the first anniversary in my current apartment, I\u2019ve begun to view the spare white walls of my bedroom more critically. Currently, I\u2019ve only managed to hang two prints: a vintage Fiorucci poster and a movie poster that features a young Keanu Reeves. Both are from college and only the former is framed. My need for some new wall coverings might be why once I first spotted Henri Matisse\u2019s Blue Nude print \u2014 while virtually stalking art director Madelynn Furlong\u2019s feed \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stop seeing it. It popped up in photos of other immaculately decorated homes, including the Zoe Report\u2019s senior fashion editor, Aemilia Madden, then travel influencer Olivia Lopez. By the time I realized Caroline Calloway had been hawking cutouts of the print on Instagram \u2014 traced on expensive, star-strewn paper \u2014 I figured we had hit peak Matisse mania.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny, my best friend has this print, too,\u201d said interior designer Sasha Bikoff when I asked her about it. She chalks up its popularity to its versatility: it\u2019s organic yet whimsical, simple but still interesting. \u201cI have a vintage Matisse print in my apartment right now. It\u2019s not the Blue Nude, it\u2019s the dancing one with the little star,\u201d says Abigail Campbell, owner of Brooklyn-based Abigail Bell Vintage. She also points to the print\u2019s adaptability. It can fit in a variety of home design styles, including everything from \u201ca higher-end Danish-style home with lots of plants\u201d to a \u201csuper colorful home with Memphis-style furniture.\u201d Madden, who scored her vintage print on Chairish, says she has seen similar prints appearing increasingly over the last year, \u201coften at caf\u00e9s, spas, and even my favorite yoga studio, Sky Ting.\n\nLumi Tan, curator at the nonprofit art space The Kitchen, says the popularity of the posters are deeply connected to the timing of MoMA\u2019s \u201cMatisse: The Cut-Outs\u201d show in 2014, which had traveled from the Tate Modern, calling it a \u201chuge blockbuster exhibition\u201d in both cities. \u201cThe pared-down shapes and bright colors made the work more accessible to different kinds of viewers, and was coincidentally perfectly tuned into the current clean yet punchy palettes of Instagrammable design aesthetics.\u201d This is particularly clear when looking at a piece like Blue Nude which, while being quite formally complex, \u201chas an immediate graphic impact,\u201d she says. New York Magazine senior art critic Jerry Saltz feels the same way: \u201cThe intensity of the color and the abstract shape fits perfectly into the pixelated packages on Twitter and Instagram.\u201d\n\nAnd while it may seem like everyone has the same print, there are actually a range of options available to suit every budget. The most accessible take on the trend is to go for a simple (and inexpensive) reproduction starting from $20 on Amazon. If you\u2019re looking for something a little bit more special, you could also pick up a print at a museum exhibition, where framed prints start at around $225. These often come already framed, and feel a bit more personal than a regular reproduction since they can serve as a reminder of a trip. Lopez picked up her framed print from an exhibition at the Tate Modern in London. And at the most expensive tier, Campbell and Madden recommended splurging on a vintage print, from as early as the \u201960s, from places like Etsy, 1stdibs, or Chairish, starting from $300. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to have a piece of history documenting where that collection was at a certain period of time,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cOne of my favorite things to collect and find are exhibition posters.\u201d\n\nBut the popularity of the print isn\u2019t just due to a love of all things hyper blue: it also speaks to a desire to celebrate bodies. Lopez says she finds the femininity and the pose of the figure to be \u201cquite inviting to the eye.\u201d According to Campbell: \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of people who are just really interested in pieces that feature the female form, I feel like those pieces always go super quickly when I have them, and I like to think that it has something to do with female empowerment and people just really owning their bodies more.\u201d So if you bought a butt vase or boob bath mat in the past, the Matisse print\u2019s sensibility might also be right up your alley, but is ostensibly a more sophisticated, timeless choice. According to Saltz, when it comes to feminine beauty, \u201cno one can really beat Matisse.\u201d\n\nHenri Matisse Blue Nude Vintage 1991 Lithograph Print And here is a vintage print at a slightly higher price point. $390 at Chairish Buy\n\nHenri Matisse 1970 Vintage Poster We also love this exhibition poster from the Grand Palais in Paris from 1970. $725 at Chairish Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
