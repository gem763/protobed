The kitchen receives over 100 children each week, up from around 20-30 when it opened its doors in April.\n\nThe rise in hunger and poverty creates a complex backdrop for the leaders of Latin America\u2019s no. 3 economy, who are in knife-edge talks with creditors to avoid default on billions of dollars of debt amid economic and political upheaval.\n\nAhead of a presidential election on Oct. 27, officials will head to Washington this month to meet with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a major backer that struck a $57 billion funding deal here with the country last year.\n\nThose talks are likely to weigh on the current administration of President Mauricio Macri and the next one, likely led by left-leaning Peronist Alberto Fernandez, the front-runner to win the vote.\n\nThe Claypole kitchen is far from alone in witnessing rising hardship, with government data showing poverty rates jumped to 35% in the first half of 2019 amid recession and steep inflation, from 27.3% a year earlier.\n\n\u2018A SCOURGE\u2019\n\nAround 13% of children and adolescents went hungry in 2018, according to data from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina, and rising food prices have become a regular target of popular anger in street protests around the country.\n\nPolitical leaders know something must be done, but face a complex juggling act: bolstering growth and spending to ease issues such as hunger, while cutting debt and averting a damaging default that would shut off access to global markets.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t live in peace with such a scourge,\u201d left-leaning Fernandez said in a speech on Monday in reference to hunger, which he described as Argentina\u2019s \u201cgreatest shame.\u201d\n\nFernandez, who has been buoyed by support for populist running mate Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, blames Macri and austerity measures agreed with the International Monetary Fund for the rise in poverty and hunger.\n\nMacri\u2019s running mate, Miguel Pichetto, meanwhile, said on Monday the way to eradicate hunger was to generate employment and attract \u201cbig global companies\u201d to Argentina.\n\nBoth sides have said they would honor the country\u2019s debts with creditors, including the IMF, though neither has laid out a clear plan for how to do so while boosting spending at home.\n\nMost investors expect some sort of losses.\n\nIndeed, Moody's Investors Service anticipates holders of Argentina dollar bonds will need to write off here 10% to 20% of their investments, while Fitch Ratings believes the government will write down local and dollar debt.\n\n\u2018JUST NO WORK\u2019\n\nHunger and poverty are not new in Argentina, but have risen abruptly over the past two years amid a series of economic shocks that have rattled the grain-exporting nation, famed for its rich arable land and cattle.\n\nThe issues have become a lightning rod for anti-government protests and marches, with the hardships of the poor brought into sharp focus as the government has been locked in talks with creditors about repayments on around $100 billion in debts.\n\nDriving the problem is stubborn inflation, a tumbling peso and a slump in domestic production and consumption, which have hurt spending power, incomes and jobs.\n\n\u201cThere is just no work,\u201d said 46-year-old Isabel Britez, a volunteer at the Los Piletones dining room in Buenos Aires, who said that was the main message she heard from people eating at the kitchen, which serves around 2,000 meals a day.\n\nMacri, looking to revive his election hopes, has rolled out plans to bolster jobs, including tax cuts for employers. He also announced a freeze on some food prices earlier this year.\n\nSergio Chouza, an economist at the University of Avellaneda in Buenos Aires, said food prices have rocketed nearly 60% over the past year, with basics such as dairy up as much as 90%.\n\n\u201cThat results in a deterioration of diets and pushes many people below the poverty line,\u201d he said.\n\nMORE NOODLES, LESS MEAT\n\nPoverty is a key reason for Macri\u2019s fall from grace. His economic austerity, part of the $57 billion funding deal agreed with the IMF last year, reined in deficits but hit growth and voters\u2019 wallets.\n\nMacri was defeated heavily in a primary election in August. Since then, he has announced lower taxes for the middle class and higher subsidies for the poor along with food aid. The Senate approved an emergency food law last month.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we underestimated the impact of the economic situation on the elections. (The poverty issue) affected the vote for Mauricio,\u201d Eduardo Amadeo, a Macri ally and member of Argentina\u2019s house of deputies, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe reforms we launched have stabilized the economy and we have tried to reduce the impact from the devaluation in August on people\u2019s wallets,\u201d Amadeo said.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Social Development listed official measures to deal with the crisis, but declined to comment further on poverty rates.\n\nIn the meantime, even as soup kitchens flourish, some volunteers say meals are getting more meager amid tight funding conditions and as food donations dry up.\n\n\u201cPreviously, people donated some meat and chicken; now we only get noodles and rice,\u201d said Lorena Nievas, who works at the Abrazando Hogares soup kitchen in the southern Patagonian city of Puerto Madryn.\n\nFor many residents, however, there is no choice.\n\n\u201cI have people from the street who come in for their lunch and snacks here. It\u2019s all the food they get,\u201d she said.", "description": "In the hard-up neighborhood of Claypole on the outskirts of Argentine capital Buenos Aires, Elena Escobar makes her way to the local Caritas Felices soup kitchen to serve food to street children who scrape by from meal to meal.", "authors": ["Nicol\u00e1s Misculin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
