They've never had a soda or watched TV, yet they've somehow scored their own reality show.\n\nThe kids, who range in age from six to 21, are starring alongside their parents, Kim and Barry Plath, in TLC's new six-part series, Welcome to Plathville, which premieres on November 5.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSmall screen stars: TLC's new six-part series, Welcome to Plathville, chronicles the lives of Kim and Barry Plath and their nine children, who range in age from six to 21\n\nStrict: The couple has raised their children without any access to television or social media\n\nThe couple and their children \u2014 Ethan, 21, Hosanna, 20, Micah, 18, Moriah, 17, Lydia, 15, Isaac, 13, Amber, 10, Cassia, eight, and Mercy, six \u2014 live a sheltered life without all the trappings of the 21st-century world.\n\n'We\u2019re 11 people in the family: mom, dad, and nine children ranging in age from six to 21,' Kim explains in a trailer for the new show. 'We have limited technology. We have limited computers. They don't play video games.'\n\nThe family's matriarch is a naturopath who majored in music therapy in college, while her husband works as a transportation planner.\n\n'We\u2019ve structured our lifestyle here so that we can retreat to our piece of heaven on earth,' explains Barry, who is originally from Minnesota.\n\nThe couple has turned their sprawling land into a protected environment for their children that is free from the influence of social media and the outside world \u2014 forcing them to come up with creative ways to entertain themselves.\n\nIdyllic? The kids have grown up riding horses and running around their property barefoot\n\nSecluded: The family lives on a 55-acre farm in southern Georgia that is cut off from the outside world\n\nTheir parenting tactics seem to be met with mixed reviews.\n\n'Nothing against my parents, but, you know, I don't agree with everything they say and think,' admits Moriah, their second oldest daughter.\n\nThe teen, who loves singing and dancing, has a desire to travel and looks forward to being able to spread her wings.\n\nBarry says Moriah is 'opinionated,' though he doesn't elaborate.\n\nHer older brother Micah, however, seems to be more adapted to farm life. He raises beef cows and enjoys being active. In his free time, he works on his truck in their autobody shop.\n\nTeamwork: The older children, who live a relatively sheltered life, help tend to the farm\n\nWhose that? The Plath kids are clueless when it comes to notable figures in sports and entertainment, including Justin Bieber and LeBron James\n\n'I've grown up without a TV. I don't think I need one,' he says.\n\nWithout having any access to social media or television, the kids are clueless when it comes to notable figures in sports and entertainment, including Justin Bieber and LeBron James.\n\nIsaac, the couple's youngest son, says he loves soccer, basketball, and football, but he doesn\u2019t know who one of the most popular NFL players of all time is.\n\n'Do you know who Tom Brady is?' a producer asks him, but the name of the famous Patriots quarterback doesn't ring a bell.\n\n'I don\u2019t think so,' Isaac responds.\n\nNow that's a fort! The siblings are forced to come up with creative ways to entertain themselves while living on the farm\n\nMoving on: The couple's eldest child, Ethan, 21, recently married his wife Olivia, 21, and they allow sugar, television, alcohol, and social media in their household\n\nAnd while Lydia says she has 'heard of Spider-Man,' she can't elaborate on who he is when pressed.\n\n'Um, something that I don\u2019t know,' she admits.\n\nWhile some would find their upbringing strange, Kim and Barry's three youngest kids \u2014 Amber, Cassia, and Mercy \u2014 say they 'love the farm.'\n\nThe unconventional parents firmly believe their kids are more connected to each other and real-life than those who have grown up with access to television and cellphones.\n\n'We've never had any carbonated sodas around,' the dad boasts in the preview clip. 'They know what a Coke is, but they don't know what a Coke is. Can you believe that? That is so off the wall.'\n\nLearning curve: Olivia has taken it upon herself to introduce her husband to new things, including the workout machines a the gym\n\nWow: Kim and Barry have never given their children soda, and adult Ethan has his first sip of Coca-Cola on the show. 'That's really good,' he says\n\nHowever, it seems like change is coming.\n\nEthan recently married his wife Olivia, 21, who has had a more lenient upbringing.\n\nNow that he is on his own, he has cut back on his parents' strict rules and lives in a household that allows sugar, television, alcohol, and social media.\n\nOlivia has taken it upon herself to introduce him to new things, including soda. In the clip, he can be seen taking his first-ever sip of Coca-Cola.\n\n'That's really good,' he says.\n\nIn another scene, Barry gushes that living with her has been the best six months of his life.\n\nReady to get out: Moriah, 17, doesn't agree with a lot of her parents' rules and wants to spread her wings\n\nInfluence: Moriah has found a friend in her new sister-in-law, who gave her cotton candy to try for the first time\n\nOlivia is also rubbing off on some of her husband's younger siblings, much to her in-law's dismay. She even goes as far as filming Moriah as she gives the teen her first taste of cotton candy.\n\n'I'm addicted,' she says after taking a bite of the sugary treat.\n\nMoriah feels like a bit of an outsider in her family, and she often visits Ethan and Olivia with Micah, as the 18-year-old is free to come and go as he pleases.\n\n'Now that Ethan\u2019s married, there are certain things that just have changed the dynamics of the family,' Barry admits.\n\nOlivia doesn't agree with a lot of her in-law's views, which is causing some friction in the family.\n\nHappy: Kim and Barry's three youngest kids \u2014 Amber, Cassia, and Mercy \u2014 say they 'love the farm'\n\nDrama: Olivia doesn't agree with a lot of her in-law's views, which is causing some friction in the family. They make it clear that they don't want her influencing their kids\n\n'I grew up a different way. I have a different outlook on life, and so I come into the picture and I bring in change and it's caused a hurricane,' she tells Kim and Barry.\n\nHowever, they make it clear that they don't want her influencing their younger children.\n\n'I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your job to parent our children,' Kim tells her.\n\nSome of the older kids fear that their house is becoming divided\n\n'I would love for this relationship to be fixed, but that does not equal me changing as a person,' Olivia tells the family.", "description": "TLC's\u00a0new six-part series, Welcome to Plathville, chronicles the lives of Kim and Barry Plath and their nine children, who range in age from six to 21.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/00/19813970-0-image-a-44_1571269373236.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
