If someone you know is grieving, it can be hard to know what to say \u2014 or perhaps more importantly, what not to say \u2014 to them. Of course, your intentions are good and you want to make things better, not worse. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n\u2014\n\nDear Lifehacker,\n\nThis year has been a very difficult one for me. A close friend passed away and a few other people I know also lost loved ones. I never know what to say or how to act at times like these. What can I say when nothing seems appropriate or it all sounds like cliches?\n\nSigned,\n\nStumbling for Words\n\n\u2014\n\nDear Stumbling,\n\nWe\u2019re sorry to hear that. It\u2019s hard not to feel at a loss for words. When someone you care about or know is grieving, words never seem to be enough. Expressing your care and support, though, could do a world of good for both the other person and yourself.\n\nThough some pay may say that there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d way to help someone grieve, there are definitely things you can say that can do some damage \u2014 even inadvertently. Lifehacker spoke with several mental health experts and those familiar with bereavement to find the best approach for this awkward and tough situation we unfortunately all experience.\n\nWhat to avoid saying\n\nSome phrases and words of advice, even if they\u2019re well-intentioned, could make others feel worse and magnify their grief. In general, try to avoid:\n\nComparing their loss to yours: When someone dies, it makes us think about our own experiences, but saying \u201cI know exactly how you feel \u2014 when my mother/friend/dog died last year...\u201d isn\u2019t comforting. Even though you\u2019re trying to help or connect by empathising, it might feel insulting to the other person, like you\u2019re trying to minimise the pain he or she is feeling.\n\nAndrew Moore, a licensed professional counsellor at the University of Oklahoma HSC, tells Lifehacker that even if there are similarities to your experiences, their experience is still unique to them. Every death is also unique. According to clinical social worker Stuart Strauzer, a more appropriate response may be to acknowledge \u2014 without direction and empathy \u2014 that this is a difficult time, e.g., \u201cThis must be very difficult, and I can\u2019t truly understand what it must be like right now.\u201d Then give more comforting words or gestures of support (see below).\n\nTalking about the afterlife or adding religious remarks: Unless you know and share the other person\u2019s beliefs, saying things like \u201che\u2019s in a better place now\u201d or citing Bible verses could really be offensive or, at the very least, not meaningful. Joanna Parker, MA, CT, LPC of Duke University Medical Centre has provided us with Duke\u2019s handout of helpful and less helpful phrases. In the less helpful section: \u201cIt was God\u2019s will\u201d and \u201cGod never gives us more than we can handle.\u201d\n\nAlso, avoid saying things like, \u201cat least they\u2019re with their husband/wife/father/mother/child in heaven.\u201d Again, the grieving person may not believe in heaven and either way, this isn\u2019t helpful.\n\nMinimising the person\u2019s pain or trying to \u201cfix\u201d the pain: Other unhelpful remarks include: \u201cWe all have to deal with loss,\u201d \u201cTime heals all wounds,\u201d \u201cThings always work out for the best,\u201d and \u2014 I can\u2019t believe people actually say this, but it\u2019s on the Duke handout \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re young enough to have more children.\u201d\n\nContacting them about funeral/wake/memorial arrangements: This should go without saying, but when a person loses someone they\u2019re close to, try not to bother them by asking about the arrangements for the deceased. Chances are they\u2019re swamped planning the service, cancelling phone plans and closing bank accounts and answering a simple question you could answer yourself via a Google search for an obituary isn\u2019t fair to them.\n\nIf you can\u2019t find an obituary \u2014 or it hasn\u2019t been posted yet \u2014 you can contact a friend of the family who may be at least a little more removed from the situation and can help you.\n\nTelling them to look on the \u201cbright side\u201d: When someone close to you dies, you probably aren\u2019t seeing a bright side, so having someone tell you to look on it is not at all helpful. Examples of \u201cbrightsiding\u201d can include: \u201cat least s/he isn\u2019t in pain anymore,\u201d or \u201cthink of all the other wonderful things you have in your life right now.\u201d\n\nBoth may be well-intentioned, but both should be avoided. Of course you\u2019re glad your loved one is not in physical pain, but someone pointing that out isn\u2019t going to make you feel better. And sure, you might have just started a new, great job or have an exciting trip planned, but again, pointing out the positives in someone\u2019s life isn\u2019t as helpful as you think it is.\n\nTelling them how to feel or how they will feel: Again, everyone processes the loss of a loved one differently. Saying \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t feel that way\u201d could make the other person feel ashamed or guilty. Clinical psychologist Jeffrey DeGroat tells Lifehacker:\n\nThe process of grief is complicated and involves many feelings: sadness, anger, anxiety, and guilt, just to name a few. So, while you may be experiencing sadness, someone else may be experiencing anger. Rather than trying to tell this other person not to be angry, simply encourage them to discuss their thoughts and feelings, while also expressing your thoughts and feelings to them.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t give the person a grieving timeline, saying \u201coh, you\u2019ll feel better in two weeks.\u201d Even if that was your own experience with grief, that doesn\u2019t mean it translates to others. Not only that, but it puts pressure on them to feel as though they need to heal in a set timeframe.\n\nAlong the same lines, it\u2019s not helpful to tell someone that losing a loved one will \u201chit you when you least expect it.\u201d Saying that not only minimises their current state of grief, but also tells them that it\u2019ll get worse at some point in the future, which isn\u2019t what they need to hear.\n\nWhat you can say to help\n\nBe authentic in your expressions of compassion, Moore advises, however simple they may be. What you say does not matter as much as how you say it. Here are a few good fallbacks:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s completely unoriginal, but that doesn\u2019t really matter here. If you knew the person who passed away, you could add in meaningful memories. When my previous boss died this year, I told his family, whom I was also close to, how he had been my mentor when I was just a kid out of college and one of my biggest supporters. I\u2019m not sure if it helped them, but probably most families would appreciate your recognising their loved one and their loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call/text you in a few days to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d This and other offers to help (\u201cIs there anything I can do for you?\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m here for you if you need anything\u201d) simply remind the person that you care and will continue to do so.\n\nBut please, please don\u2019t repeatedly check in with the person, demanding \u2014 or even expecting \u2014 a response. One way to do this is by sending a text saying, \u201cI just wanted to get in touch to see how you\u2019re doing and let you know I\u2019m thinking of you. I know you\u2019re dealing with a lot, so please don\u2019t feel obligated to respond.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to be lost for a while. You don\u2019t have to have the answers right now.\u201d Samantha Light-Gallagher, whose husband was killed in the line of duty in 2010, says this was one of the many things people said that helped her at the time. It gave her permission to mourn and flounder if she needed to \u2014 and breathe.\n\nAcknowledging that grieving can be a potentially long process may be helpful to the person, along with saying things like, \u201ctake all the time you need.\u201d\n\nWhat may or may not be appropriate to say\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d This simple question gives the bereaved space to tell their story, says Moore. You have to be mindful when you use it, though. For people close to you who you think would like to talk about their situation and feelings, this would be great \u2014 provided you ask when you both have time to really talk (or, in your case, listen).\n\nDepending on the circumstances and your relationship with the other person too, this could be a terrible question. A few years ago when my friend passed away, I asked his mum how she was feeling \u2014 out of sheer not knowing what else to say \u2014 and the look on her face has haunted me ever since. That look \u2014 the one of a parent who just lost her child \u2014 is one I hope you never see.\n\nChances are, if someone just lost a loved one, they\u2019re not OK \u2014 and that\u2019s OK. And they probably are sick of either a) telling people exactly that; or b) pretending they\u2019re fine. So you\u2019ll have to use your best judgement when deciding whether or not to ask a grieving person how they\u2019re doing and proceed with caution.\n\nExpress yourself in other ways\n\nAlthough fumbling for something to say is better than ignoring the topic (Light-Gallagher says sometimes people would just look at her and not say a word, so she learned to start small talk to ease the tension), sometimes your presence is all that matters. If you\u2019re speechless, sometimes that\u2019s exactly the right thing to say \u2014 nothing, Strauzer says.\n\nAcknowledge the loss and show your support in other ways. You could offer to bring dinner over one night or do grocery shopping, help with childcare, or other errands. A simple hug might do.\n\nYou can also send them gift cards for food delivery services like Grubhub or Seamless, or car services like Uber and Lyft. And there\u2019s always cash or Venmo; even the most basic funerals are expensive as hell, so if the grieving person footed the bill for that, they may appreciate that type of support.\n\nIf they\u2019re not the type of person who needs funds for themselves, you can consider donating money to a charity in the deceased\u2019s name \u2014 whether it\u2019s related to the cause of their death to something else they would have appreciated.\n\nFinally, remember that everyone feels awkward during these situations; the most important thing you can do, still, is to express your sympathy and give the bereaved a chance to talk or ask for help if they need it. And because death has a \u201cripple effect\u201d on the people around the deceased, be sure to take care of yourself, too.\n\nLove,\n\nLifehacker\n\nThis story was originally published on 9/6/12 and was updated on 9/17/19 to provide more thorough and current information.", "description": "Grief is awful, but it can also be awkward.
