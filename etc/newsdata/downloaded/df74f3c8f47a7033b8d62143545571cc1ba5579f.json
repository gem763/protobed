But after Donald Trump withdrew the US and reimposed sanctions, Tehran increased its uranium enrichment and stockpiles and threatened further breaches of the agreement.\n\nMacron has reportedly been trying to launch a $15bn credit line to pre-purchase Iran\u2019s oil, but it is not clear if the US would allow such a move or sanction any company or country that sought to buy Iranian oil.\n\nIn pulling out of the nuclear deal last year, the US vowed to drive Iran\u2019s oil exports to zero to pressure Tehran into renegotiating the deal struck with Barack Obama. Tehran is unlikely to settle for any deal that does not allow it to export a minimum 700,000 barrels a day. Current sales have fallen to 300,000 a day.\n\nTrump has been unclear how he would renegotiate the nuclear deal, and it is likely Macron is proposing a three-stage process involving commitments by both sides that ends with an extended nuclear deal, and wider pledges. The French president has the conditional backing of the UK and Germany for his efforts.\n\nFrench diplomats are meeting the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Paris on Monday to discuss outlines of the deal. France has said its objective is \u201cto have a sequence where there are commitments on both sides\u201d.\n\nThe talks are being held against the backdrop of an Iranian threat to take a third as yet unspecified step away from the nuclear deal as early as Thursday or Friday. Tehran said this planned third reversible step would be outlined in the middle of this week. The announcement is likely to coincide with a visit to the UK by the US vice-president, Mike Pence.\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, on Friday gave an update on Iran\u2019s two previous steps away from the deal. It announced that just over 10% of Iran\u2019s uranium stockpile was now enriched up to 4.5%, above the 3.67% limit stipulated in the 2015 deal.\n\nIt also said Iran\u2019s total stockpile of uranium, which under the accord should be no more than the equivalent of 300kg of uranium hexafluoride, now stood at roughly 360kg.\n\nIn a sign of the scale of Macron\u2019s diplomatic ambition, the French president spoke to Rouhani about the need to end the conflict in Yemen where the US has accused Tehran of trying to use the Houthi rebellion to seize de facto power, and so weaken Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe US has insisted the nuclear deal can only be revived if Iran renegotiates the terms of the accord, gives wider undertakings about ending its \u201cregional aggression\u201d and curtails its ballistic missile programme.\n\nTrump has blown hot and cold about a summit with Rouhani, and faces conflicting advice from within his own administration. Israel and Saudi Arabia are both implacable foes of any compromise with Iran. The Iranian government spokesman on Monday suggested Rouhani could meet Trump if it served Iran\u2019s interests, while cautioning there was no need to meet an \u201cagitator\u201d in the current circumstances.", "description": "Tehran says gap is closing on views after phone conversation between Macron and Rouhani", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd044b3ac25f5d692553cacb8a6c7afa05885365/0_150_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2fc9241dfe9ebe0edc1f7789843131e2"}
