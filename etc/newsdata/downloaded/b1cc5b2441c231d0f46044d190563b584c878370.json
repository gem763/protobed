Vaping groups had filed suit against the ban, contending that it would hurt retailers and adults who use the products.\n\nThe vaping industry is also battling a more extensive ban of all vaping products in Massachusetts.\n\nDr Howard Zucker, the New York state health commissioner, called the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is undeniable that the vaping industry is using flavoured e-cigarettes to get young people hooked on potentially dangerous and deadly products. While the court\u2019s ruling temporarily delays our scheduled enforcement of this ban, it will not deter us from using every tool at our disposal to address this crisis.\u201d\n\nSymptoms of the illness include coughing and breathing trouble that can become severe enough to require that patients be attached to ventilators. Some also have nausea, vomiting and fever. Many have vaped THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis; some have vaped both THC products and nicotine. Some say they have vaped only nicotine.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Many of the ingredients in the products are unknown.\n\n\u201cI wish we had more answers regarding the specific harmful products or components that are causing these illnesses,\u201d Dr Schuchat said.\n\nShe added: \u201cI think we have the feeling right now that there may be a lot of different nasty things in e-cigarettes or vaping products, and they may cause different harms in the lungs.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, the injury to the lung tissue looks like a chemical burn, the same kind of damage that occurs from industrial accidents where chemicals spill and people inhale poisonous fumes, experts in lung pathology from the Mayo Clinic reported earlier this week.\n\nTheir findings were based on studying samples of lung tissue from 17 patients, ages 19 to 67, who became ill after vaping. Most reported vaping THC.\n\nDuring the briefing, Ms Schuchat was asked if THC vaping products could be considered safe if purchased from dispensaries in states that license them.\n\nShe replied: \u201cWith all the data I\u2019ve been seeing, I don\u2019t know what safe is now.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Illnesses and deaths linked to vaping have continued to increase around the United States, now totalling 1,080 cases and 19 deaths, health officials said.", "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/08/vaping-deaths.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
