I don't understand. It's just b******t.\"@jameshaskell, @JohnSmit123 & @miketindall13 defend Jaco Peyper after the referee was omitted from the #RWC2019 semi-finals after posing for a photo with Wales fans. pic.twitter.com/BCJ6ROiKOh \u2014 SportsJOE (@SportsJOE_UK) October 23, 2019", "description": "Former England star James Haskell has hit out at World Rugby's decision to exclude South African referee Jaco Peyper for this weekend's Rugby World Cup semi-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2845/bde116fba18d4feeb2c39cea2025cf96.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
