She split with a husband who struggled with her ambition. She started dabbling in the research that would establish her as one of the nation\u2019s foremost experts on consumer bankruptcy law. And she found her voice, developing the speaking style that has made the senator from Massachusetts a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHouston is where Liz Warren became Elizabeth Warren.\n\nNow she had been asked to eulogize longtime UH law professor Eugene Smith, who, as head of the faculty hiring committee in 1978, had been an early Warren champion, urging colleagues to look past her limited teaching experience and what some perceived as her second-rate Rutgers Law School degree.\n\nSmith, who died of complications from the polio he contracted as a child, had specifically requested that Warren speak at his funeral. But what she said inside a small campus chapel stunned her former colleagues.\n\nWith a smile on her face and humor in her voice, Warren described how Smith had invited her to his office one day just a few months after she had been hired. He shut the door and lunged for her, she said, and as she protested, he chased her around his desk before she was able to escape out the door.\n\n\u201cEveryone was slack-jawed,\u201d recalled John Mixon, a retired UH professor who had been close friends with Smith and Warren. Among those listening: Smith\u2019s ex-wife and his three adult sons.\n\nIn the pews, people exchanged glances. Some at UH disliked Smith \u2014 he\u2019d kept a bottle of Scotch in his desk and often told dirty jokes, one colleague remembered later \u2014 but \u201cMean Gene,\u201d as he was known, was generally regarded as harmless. Diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, Smith walked hunched over, his arms increasingly useless as he aged. Some wondered whether it was physically possible for Smith to have done what Warren described.\n\n\u201cTo have this image of him chasing her around the desk, it was just comical, and she told the story without rancor,\u201d Mixon recalled.\n\nHer account wasn\u2019t entirely new to him. While Warren had not shared all the specifics, she had gone to Mixon looking for help when she said Smith came on to her that day in early 1979.\n\nFour decades later, Mixon recalls with mixed feelings what he told her: Say nothing. \u201cMy advice was that she was brand new in the business,\u201d Mixon said. \u201cHe was an established old-guard professor with a lot of power. And if she tried to get him, she would be the one in the long term to suffer because she would become known as a troublemaker.\u201d\n\nWarren nodded, and as he advised, she said nothing. Not when Smith continued to flirt with her. Not when he commented on her appearance. Not when she packed up her office in the spring of 1983 to move on to bigger and more renowned schools.\n\nWarren said nothing until she returned to UH to eulogize a man who had been both a promoter and tormentor, a man who, as she put it in an interview, \u201cno longer had any power over me.\u201d\n\nAt Smith\u2019s funeral, Warren told the story in an entertaining way. Two decades later, she would recount it again in a 2017 interview on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d presenting it as her own sobering #MeToo experience with sexual harassment.\n\nBy then, the times had changed, and so had she.\n\n\u2018Testing her\u2019\n\nThe University of Houston Law Center was in a period of transition when Warren interviewed there in 1978.\n\nAt the time, the law school had just one full-time tenured female professor, but the number of female students was soaring. The faculty was trying to inject the place with new blood \u2014 younger, fresher faces.\n\nWarren was almost 29, and she knew the campus. A decade earlier, she had dropped out of college to marry her high school sweetheart, Jim Warren. She followed him to Houston, where he had been hired to work as a computer engineer for IBM. She took undergraduate classes at UH \u2014 tuition was just $50 a semester \u2014 until they moved to New Jersey.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Warren in 1970 in a University of Houston photo. She returned there to teach in 1978. (UH) (N/A/University of Houston)\n\nWarren earned her law degree from Rutgers just before giving birth to her second child. She got her foot in the door at UH by offering to teach legal writing, classes viewed by most law professors as grunt work.\n\nGene Smith, who had talked to Warren by phone, met her at the airport, picking her up in his white 1966 Lincoln Continental. His post-polio syndrome was getting worse, and the damaged muscles in his arms were making it harder to drive, but Smith stubbornly refused to give up the car.\n\nHe took her out to dinner with a few others on the hiring committee. They went to his favorite restaurant, a steakhouse called The Stables.\n\nIn a story that quickly made the rounds among the faculty \u2015 and that Warren later retold at his funeral \u2014 Smith ordered a steak, even though his arms were so weak he had trouble cutting it into smaller pieces. The waitress usually helped, but this time, when the steak arrived, Smith pushed the plate over to Warren and ordered her to cut it up for him.\n\n\u201cI guess it was his way of testing her to see how easily she would be manipulated,\u201d Mixon recalled.\n\nWarren just stared at Smith.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you tell I\u2019m crippled?\u201d Smith told her.\n\n\u201cI thought you knew that when you ordered the steak,\u201d she coolly replied.\n\nEveryone at the table laughed, including Smith, who advocated for Warren to be hired.\n\nSitting at that table full of men who smiled as Smith pushed the steak her way, she knew what she would have to endure to teach. \u201cI knew it from the first minute,\u201d Warren said.\n\nShe also knew that as a woman who had graduated from a lower-tier law school, with limited teaching experience and two young children at home, she was not a top prospect.\n\n\u201cI had no other options,\u201d she said.\n\nAs Warren had anticipated, some questioned her academic background. \u201cRutgers isn\u2019t a top law school, and for your first job, it really matters where you went to law school,\u201d said Richard Alderman, a UH professor emeritus who was on the hiring committee that year. \u201cBut when you met her, she had this personality, this energy. \u2026 You knew, just by talking to her, she was going to be successful.\u201d\n\nWarren was hired as an assistant professor, a full-time tenure-track position that included not only legal writing courses but also contracts and commercial law. Warren said she could not remember whether her status as a wife and mother came up in her interviews for the job, but she specifically requested to teach complex financial courses because she thought it might help her be taken more seriously by her colleagues. \u201cI figured if I could manage this, no one would question whether a young woman with two little children belonged,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to personnel records released by the Warren campaign, her pay that first year was $20,500 \u2014 not much more than the $8,000 a semester she had been paid to teach legal writing one night a week at Rutgers. Strangely, the UH faculty candidate profile also asked for her height and weight: 5-foot-7 and 115 pounds.\n\nWhen you met her, she had this personality, this energy. \u2026 You knew, just by talking to her, she was going to be successful. Richard Alderman, a UH professor emeritus who was on the hiring committee\n\nWith her chin-length pageboy, similar to the hairstyle she wears now, she looked younger than 29.\n\n\u201cI was constantly reminded that I didn\u2019t look like a real law professor,\u201d Warren said.\n\nHer colleagues frequently mistook her that first year for a secretary, the school nurse or even a lost student when they saw a woman wandering through the faculty office suites.\n\nIf Warren saw herself as a trailblazer for women in law, she has never acknowledged it. Her mother had long warned her, she has said, about becoming \u201cone of those crazy women\u2019s-libbers.\u201d And according to those who knew her at the time, Warren, then a Republican, did not espouse feminist beliefs.\n\nBut in an interview, Warren recalled being acutely aware of her status as one of the only women on the staff.\n\n\u201cThe faculty members themselves, often the men, treated me as if I were a second-class citizen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a lonely experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren taught at several schools after leaving UH. Here she speaks with a student at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in Philadelphia in the early 1990s. (Leif Skoogfors/Corbis/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Warren in the making\u2019\n\nFor UH law students, Warren was one of their first instructors, teaching contracts, a fundamental course that tends to determine whether a student has a mind for the law.\n\nShe was a practitioner of the Socratic method, cold-calling on students and asking them to discuss the particulars of a case or a legal opinion. She believed it forced students to pay attention, encouraging them to think, engage and analyze ideas.\n\nWarren taught in a large lecture hall that resembled an amphitheater. She had about 60 students in her contracts class. And Warren knew by looking at their faces that she wasn\u2019t connecting with them in the way she wanted.\n\n\u201cShe came in thinking that students were at a higher level of preparation than they were, and she would teach as if they automatically read the cases and knew what she was talking about,\u201d Mixon said.\n\nMixon had won multiple teaching awards, and Warren went to him for advice.\n\nThree days a week, after Warren\u2019s contracts class, they would go to lunch at a nearby Mexican restaurant. Over chips and guacamole, she told him about exchanges with students in which she felt she had struggled, and Mixon would analyze and offer help.\n\nHe suggested she try to read her class better and present ideas in a more approachable way \u2014 not to dumb it down but to use scenarios that would encourage someone who did not yet have the expertise to grasp and engage.\n\nSome people, especially those cowering in the back, \u201cwere scared sh--less of her,\u201d recalled Tracey Conwell, a Houston litigation attorney who took contracts and several other classes with Warren.\n\nShe knew all their names and had no obvious method for how she called on them.\n\nAt one point in the semester, Conwell recalled, a group of her classmates drew up bingo cards with students\u2019 names as they sought to game out Warren\u2019s strategy. \u201cThey tried to see if they could guess who would be called on to speak that day,\u201d she said.\n\nOne day, Conwell remembered, she and Warren sparred over the philosophical meaning of the word \u201cintent\u201d in contract law, and Warren abruptly cut her off. Conwell was so mad she went to the dean to complain. But the next class, Warren gave Conwell a book: \u201cThe Death of Contract,\u201d a controversial 1974 publication that questioned the basis of modern contract law. After that, she said, she and Warren \u201cwere buddies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made clear to me that she was an obviously insightful thinker who had read more than the standard books to arrive at her own concepts about how the law works,\u201d Conwell said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t accept things at face value. She did her own looking to understand how we got to this system we had. \u2026 And that approach, I think, helped her take this really complicated and dreadfully boring stuff and make it really interesting.\u201d\n\nMichael Olivas, a longtime UH law professor who was hired after Warren, recalled sitting in on her classes and being stunned by how good she was. \u201cShe was not Elizabeth Warren yet, but she was Elizabeth Warren in the making,\u201d Olivas said.\n\n\n\nWarren played on a softball team at the UH during the years she taught at the law school. (Courtesy of Jeffrey Harrison)\n\nMany of her students recognize the same techniques and speaking style at work on the campaign trail. Even her raised arms are familiar.\n\n\u201cIt just feels the same when you see her on television and she\u2019s trying to explain something and she says, \u2018Look, it\u2019s like this,\u2019 or she gets very animated and says, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing,\u2019 \u201d said Rita Lucido, a Houston family-law attorney who took classes with Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t look back and think of contracts as this dry subject, because she made such an effort to keep us engaged with her and to make sure it made sense to us not only from a legal perspective but a real-world perspective.\u201d\n\n[Elizabeth Warren: A theater critic reviews her exuberant performance style]\n\nWarren was younger and less stuffy than the men on the faculty. She painted a wall in her office a bright green and hung a large wicker porch swing, inherited from her grandmother, where she would sit and prepare for classes and talk to anyone who came by.\n\nWarren also seemed human. Dona Bolding, who was in Warren\u2019s 1979 contracts class, recounted the time she was shopping at Loehmann\u2019s, the discount department store known for its marked-down designer clothing, and ran into Warren standing in her underwear in the store\u2019s communal dressing room.\n\nBolding said she was \u201cmortified.\u201d But Warren instantly made light of the situation. \u201cOh Miss Bolding,\u201d Warren called out. \u201cI see you love a bargain! \u201d\n\n\u2018The breaking point\u2019\n\nWarren loved her job. To keep it, she realized she would have to maintain a good relationship with Smith, while also deflecting what she described as increasingly inappropriate behavior from him.\n\nHe regularly sat in on her classes, evaluating her talent as a professor. He wrote memos to the law school dean and others as part of the process to determine whether she would be promoted from associate professor to tenured faculty member. He was, in many ways, the gatekeeper to her future.\n\nBut, according to Warren, he was also increasingly a harasser: He commented on her clothes and appearance in ways that made her feel uncomfortable. He told dirty jokes and invited her out for drinks, which she declined. She had to get home to her family, she reminded him, hoping he would get the hint.\n\nWarren thought she was managing him until that day in early 1979 when she said he lunged for her in his office.\n\nI wasn\u2019t afraid of him physically so much as I was afraid of what I knew he could take away from me. Elizabeth Warren, on Gene Smith\n\nShe considered punching him in the face, she said in an interview. But she thought of his evaluations, his sway with the dean and how the school still had not decided whether her contract would be renewed.\n\n\u201cIf Gene wanted to sink me, he could,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he had said, \u2018She\u2019s not very good. Let\u2019s push her out the door,\u2019 I would have been gone. And so, when he chased me around his office, I wasn\u2019t afraid of him physically so much as I was afraid of what I knew he could take away from me.\u201d\n\nWarren already instinctively knew silence was her only real option, even before Mixon told her. \u201cThat kind of thing was in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep your head down and move on. And that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nAs Warren was trying to hang on to her job at UH that first year, her life at home was falling apart. She was trying to balance the pressures of being a new professor, under intense scrutiny, with being a wife and mother. And she was failing.\n\n\u201cMy world was stretched to the breaking point,\u201d she said.\n\nShe would cook breakfast for Jim and her two kids, Alex and Amelia, and then head to school, where she was balancing classes, research and everything else. She would get home around 5, sometimes get dinner on the table around 7 or 8 and stay up past midnight, preparing for classes the next day. And then she would do it all over again.\n\n\u201cChild care nearly brought me down,\u201d Warren often says, until her mother\u2019s sister, Bess Reed Veneck, came to Houston from Oklahoma to help out with the kids.\n\n\n\nBess Reed Veneck \u2014 Aunt Bee \u2014 with Warren's children, Alexander and Amelia, circa 1978. (Warren campaign)\n\nBut Aunt Bee, as the senator calls her, couldn\u2019t fix what was wrong with Warren\u2019s marriage. By Warren\u2019s telling, she and Jim never really fought. He just gave her looks \u2014 when dinner was late or when she was up all night grading exams.\n\nWhen they were on their high school debate team together, Jim had been drawn to her because she was smart and driven, Warren remembered. Now he seemed to yearn for a more traditional wife. But she had become a different person than she was at 19, when they married.\n\n\u201cI think we were both shocked by who I turned out to be 10 years later,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe thought I would be someone else, and truthfully, I kind of assumed that, too. I kept changing and growing almost despite myself.\u201d\n\nTeaching law, Warren said, \u201cwas when the whole world opened up for me.\u201d It was impossible to put her ambitions back into a box and close it away, not even to save her marriage. \u201cI wanted so much to do the work,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to do the work, I wanted to be a good mom, I wanted to be a good wife but didn\u2019t manage all of that.\u201d\n\nI think we were both shocked by who I turned out to be 10 years later. ... I kept changing and growing almost despite myself. Elizabeth Warren\n\nOne night, Warren recounted in her memoir, \u201cA Fighting Chance,\u201d she asked Jim whether he wanted a divorce. She was shocked she said it. But he didn\u2019t appear to be. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied.\n\nJim moved out and into an apartment in southwest Houston, according to public records. She and the kids stayed in the family\u2019s suburban home. The couple separated sometime in early 1979. Warren has never said exactly when, though she later wrote in her memoir that \u201cthere were reconsiderations and some attempts at one-more-try-to-make-it-work.\u201d\n\nHer family watched the kids that summer as Warren traveled to Florida to attend a conservative law and economics retreat. One of the other attendees was Bruce Mann, a professor and legal historian at the University of Connecticut.\n\nBoth have described a moment of instant attraction. It\u2019s unclear when the two officially became a couple, but Warren has said she visited him that fall in Connecticut. And he came to see her in Houston.\n\n\n\nWarren kisses her husband, Bruce Mann, at an event in Columbia, S.C., in June. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nWarren filed for divorce from Jim on Nov. 5, 1979. The divorce was finalized on Jan. 16, 1980. Jim agreed to pay child support that increased by 5 percent a year, as well as contributing to their kids\u2019 college educations, an unusual detail even now, according to Susan Myres, a former Warren student at UH who is now a top divorce attorney in Houston. The agreement, Myres said, reads as if it was written by \u201ca future consumer advocate in the making.\u201d\n\nWhile Warren has been careful to call her ex-husband \u201ca good man,\u201d she has occasionally hinted at bitterness. After their divorce, Jim quit smoking, took dance lessons and got remarried, she wrote in her memoir.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see him much,\u201d she said. He died of lung cancer in 2003 at 58.\n\nWhile Jim had struggled with Warren\u2019s ambition, Mann embraced it. The two were married in July 1980, shortly after Warren\u2019s 31st birthday, and Mann gave up his tenure-track job and moved to Houston, where UH gave him a one-year teaching contract. Warren was awarded tenure and named assistant dean of the law center. But by 1983, she was packing up her office and taking down her porch swing. Warren, her second husband and her two children were heading to the University of Texas Law School in Austin, leaving Houston behind.\n\n\u2018A homecoming\u2019\n\nOn a hot summer day this past July, Warren walked back through the hallways of UH, the place where it all began for her. She pointed out her old office, the classrooms where she taught.\n\n\u201cThis is a homecoming for me,\u201d she later told a crowd of more than 2,000 people who had lined up for hours to hear her speak. This was where she had gotten her first real job. \u201cFull time, tenure track,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still sounds so good to say it.\u201d\n\nForty-one years earlier, she had turned heads for looking so out of place. But this time, people knew her instantly. They ran up to shake her hand. She was Elizabeth Warren, the woman running for president.\n\n\n\nWarren with husband Bruce Mann after addressing the crowd at her reelection victory celebration in Boston in 2018.
