It\u2019s a question that should worry \u2013 and anger \u2013 western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow, merciless strangulation of the former British colony\u2019s courageous pro-democracy movement. Once the grand panjandrums of China\u2019s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations, additional, potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable.\n\nThe malign nature of Beijing\u2019s looming actions may only be intensified by the large-scale demonstrations planned in Hong Kong to coincide with the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s 70th anniversary. Multiple protests and strikes are going ahead despite official bans, pre-emptive arrests, brutal police tactics and media intimidation. But they look destined to end in more damagingly futile violence, similar to that seen at the weekend.\n\nIf Hong Kong\u2019s battle for democracy \u2013 meaning universal suffrage, direct elections, civil rights, free speech and observance of the rule of law \u2013 has not already been lost, it is teetering on the brink. This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests when they began in June have suddenly changed their view on Beijing\u2019s devious efforts to deepen its control.\n\nIt is certainly not because the protesters have miscalculated or somehow blown their chance of change. In promoting their demands they have, for the most part, shown dignity, eloquence, restraint, persistence and admirable innovation, for example through \u201cbe water\u201d pop-up demos, organic ground-up organisation and alternative peer-to-peer social media. These are future paradigms for global protest.\n\nBut after four months of epic struggle, what do the pro-democracy forces have to show? Official withdrawal of the extradition bill that triggered the upheaval is their sole tangible victory to date. Meanwhile, increased violence involving a minority of protesters is playing into Beijing\u2019s hands, feeding its false narratives about malign agitators, terrorists and foreign agents.\n\nWhat the west's dereliction implies for other movements opposed to authoritarian regimes is gravely dismaying.\n\nThe cause is being lost because, firstly, it was always a grievously unequal battle. China\u2019s rulers, initially taken aback by the scale and intensity of its inhabitants\u2019 alienation, are now moving with growing determination to suppress it, not address it. They can do so with increased confidence because the turmoil has not prompted significant copycat protests in one-party mainland China, as some initially predicted.\n\nBeijing is winning because no discernible internal political challenge has emerged to Xi Jinping, China\u2019s paramount leader \u2013 even though his inflexible and complacent approach has made matters worse. Xi, a strongman leader who casts himself as a latterday Mao with a little red online book of political thoughts to match, is not backing off. He\u2019s doubling down.\n\nBeijing is also winning because Hong Kong is no longer quite the vital financial and commercial hub it once was. It was once the primary gateway to China; now the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo and Guangzhou each handle more container traffic than Hong Kong. Beijing is winning because the painstakingly fabricated \u201cone country, two systems\u201d fudge agreed with Britain in 1997 has not lasted the course. Nowadays it is seen from Beijing as less of an asset, more a liability \u2013 an artificial arrangement potentially prolonging mainland exposure to Hong Kong\u2019s subversive ideas.\n\nAt the time of the British handover, there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China\u2019s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and, with it, Beijing\u2019s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems. Such hopes now appear largely misplaced. What Hong Kong shows clearly are the limits to China\u2019s adaptability \u2013 and the Communist party\u2019s undying attachment to political uniformity, not plurality.\n\nUnder Xi, China\u2019s expansive aim is to change the world to suit its purposes rather than adapt to suit the world. It is both too strong \u2013 in terms of its economic and military might \u2013 and too weak \u2013 in terms of its monolithic politics \u2013 to contemplate a compromise over Hong Kong. On Monday police warned ominously of the \u201cextreme danger [of a] very serious violent attack\u201d on national day, appearing to pre-emptively prepare the way for an even fiercer crackdown.\n\nChange will come to China, but not through following western ways | Hans van de Ven Read more\n\nIf Hong Kong\u2019s battle is indeed lost, could the pro-democracy movement \u2013 with the odds stacked against it \u2013 have reasonably expected any other outcome? Yes, it could. Such hopes were not wholly delusional. As a legal guarantor of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, Britain has a duty to stand up to China\u2019s repressive behaviour. But aside from a few carefully phrased diplomatic whinges, it has signally failed to do so. Such weak shilly-shallying is contemptuously dismissed in Beijing.\n\nThe US counts itself a champion of global democratic values, or did so before Donald Trump took office. Congress has made threatening noises but the White House has taken no substantive action. If the US applies punitive measures to China, they concern unfair business practices \u2013 not human rights. In fact, Trump\u2019s ruinous trade war has intensified Beijing\u2019s paranoid sense of a hostile global contest. In such circumstances, any unilateral climbdown, anywhere, is deemed politically unacceptable.\n\nDespite waging a trade war, Trump also frequently praises Xi under the mistaken impression that insincere flattery will render him more amenable. Yet the behaviour of other western governments since the Hong Kong crisis blew up has been no less servile. What this spineless dereliction implies for other, similar pro-democracy movements opposed to authoritarian regimes, such as those in Egypt and Russia, or for China\u2019s persecuted Uighur and Hui Muslim minorities, is gravely dismaying.\n\nIn Washington, London and other capitals, it\u2019s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals, broken umbrellas and bloodied heads. Perhaps it was always thus. Yet if Hong Kong is permanently, definitively lost to democracy, it will be, at least in part, because the west failed to fight for it.\n\n\u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator", "description": "Western governments could have joined the battle against China\u2019s repression, says foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall", "authors": ["Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b868aa799f95ee35270f7559c4253ff4ccd66f/0_185_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dc9d1fb5380ad738ec9110b5e55b3b0e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
