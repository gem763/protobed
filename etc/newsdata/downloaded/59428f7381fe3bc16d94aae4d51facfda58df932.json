Therefore, interested clubs would have had to spend \u20ac60m (\u00a352m) to land Upamecano next summer.\n\nLeipzig are resigned to losing Upamecano (Picture: Getty)\n\nAccording to Kicker, though, Leipzig are ready to accept a lower fee for Upamecano to remove the risk of losing the Frenchman for free when his contract expires in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArsenal have already shown that they are willing to stretch to \u00a355m for Upamecano, a player they feel has the potential to be the bedrock of their defence for the next decade.\n\nThough Leipzig had initially been been keen to tie Upamecano down with a new long-term deal, they are now resigned to losing the youngster.\n\nUpamecano has his heart set on a move away from Leipzig and would be prepared to force his way out of the club.\n\nLast year, Upamecano revealed his ambitions to join a European giant in the future, but failed to mention Arsenal in his list of \u2018dream\u2019 clubs.\n\n\u2018As a youngster, you dream of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, but to get there, you have to work,\u2019 he told Telefoot.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very proud of myself, very happy. I have to keep going in the same direction.\n\n\u2018I have to aim higher. My preference for the moment is Leipzig. Afterwards, we\u2019ll see.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ainsley Maitland-Niles explains how Arsenal assistant Freddie Ljungberg has helped develop his game", "description": "Arsenal have received a boost in their pursuit of Dayot Upamecano, with RB Leipzig ready to sell the defender for a cut-price fee at the end of the season.
