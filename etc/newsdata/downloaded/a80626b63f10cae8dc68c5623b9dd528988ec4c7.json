Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders on difference with Warren: she's a capitalist 'I'm not' Sunday Show Preview: Trump's allies and administration defend decision on Syria Klobuchar takes shots at health and education plans supported by Sanders and Warren MORE (I-Vt.) made a confession.\n\n\n\n\u201cI must confess, I was dumb,\u201d Sanders, 78, told reporters. \u201cDuring this campaign, I've been doing, in some cases three or four rallies a day, running all over the state \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Sanders\u2019s concession was a moment of vulnerability for a candidate who has long portrayed himself as a tireless political warrior, it was also a deeply personal one \u2014 the kind of moment Sanders\u2019s aides and allies believe will help him connect with voters at a time of uncertainty for his candidacy.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not always eager to discuss his personal life. He intentionally kind of avoids the conversations that make it about himself,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cBut we see it as an advantage to talk about it in those terms \u2014 those very human and personal terms.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn recent days, the progressive firebrand, who rarely strays from his core message of political revolution, has talked openly about feeling fatigued on the campaign trail; he has admitted to mishandling his health leading up to the heart attack; and he has used the experience to pitch his signature policy proposal, \"Medicare for All.\"\n\n\n\nBy addressing the matter head on, Sanders\u2019s campaign is hoping to fend off concerns about his health, Shakir said. Aides are cognizant of the political toll that the heart attack could take, and are pursuing a \u201clean-in\u201d strategy that they hope will mitigate doubts in his ability to campaign.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn my view, there\u2019s no avoiding that conversation,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cYou either talk about it now or you talk about it later. If you\u2019re going to have that conversation, I think we all agree, let\u2019s just be open and transparent.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders\u2019s decision to talk more about his personal experiences in the wake of his heart attack comes at a trying time for him, both politically and personally.\n\n\n\nMany recent polls show him losing ground to Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders on difference with Warren: she's a capitalist 'I'm not' Rubio hits Warren's 'crude' and 'vulgar' response to opposition to same-sex marriage Klobuchar takes shots at health and education plans supported by Sanders and Warren MORE (D-Mass.), a fellow septuagenarian and his chief ideological rival. At the same time, his daughter-in-law Rain\u00e8 Riggs passed away late last week shortly after she was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\n\nSanders underwent a stent procedure last week to treat a blocked artery after he experienced what one of his senior advisers initially described as \u201cchest discomfort\u201d during a campaign event in Las Vegas. Days later, after Sanders was discharged from the hospital, his campaign revealed that he had suffered a heart attack.\n\n\n\nSome of Sanders\u2019s allies believe that his experience in the hospital helps him bolster his argument for a Medicare for All health care system, a proposal he has touted for years but one that he has cast as more personal in the wake of his heart attack.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it is more powerful, precisely for the reason that he will now speak from direct experience,\u201d said Jim Zogby, a Democratic National Committee member who has endorsed Sanders\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cThat\u2019s the pivot that we\u2019re seeing occur.\u201d\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the political risks the heart attack carries are, to an extent, unavoidable. Polls show that most Democrats are leery about nominating a presidential candidate in their 70s, and Sanders\u2019 recent health event could raise questions about his age and ability to run againstin the general election, let alone serve in the White House should he win.Adding to the potential challenges facing his campaign was his announcement this week that he would slow down his pace on the campaign trail, a remarkable concession given the critical nature of the coming months in the Democratic nominating contest. Candidates typically ramp up their operations in the fall in preparation for the marathon of early primaries and caucuses in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\u201cThere\u2019s the dimension of his age and his health and his capacity to serve. But then there\u2019s the secondary dimension; the campaign is about to hit warp speed,\u201d one Democratic strategist said. \u201cWe\u2019re four months from Iowa and the campaign is only going to increase in velocity.\u201dOthers cast doubt on the notion that the slower pace of campaigning would have a tangible effect on Sanders\u2019s prospects.Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic operative who managed former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign, said that the candidates would likely narrow their focus to a handful of early states in the coming weeks and months, giving some hopefuls a temporary reprieve from the stresses of national campaigning.\u201cThis is the time when your time becomes more concentrated and you\u2019re not flying around place to place, rally to rally,\u201d Trippi said. \u201cWe are moving into the phase where you\u2019re going to see a lot more candidates literally squatting in one or two states.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see it being a big problem,\u201d he added, referring to Sanders\u2019s decision to lighten his campaign schedule.Shakir said that, for now, the campaign is focused on getting Sanders back on the trail while also giving him time to recover. The Vermont senator is still slated to appear at a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday in Ohio.\u201cHis instinct is to turn into a sprinter and do five events a day,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cAnd I understand that desire, but it\u2019s incumbent on us as a campaign that we keep a marathoner\u2019s pace here.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
