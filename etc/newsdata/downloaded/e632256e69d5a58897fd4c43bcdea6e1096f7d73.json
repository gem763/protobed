(Brunel has denied these allegations.)\n\nBut Epstein\u2019s ties to the industry run deeper than previously reported.\n\nThe financier regularly dropped by the New York offices of one of modeling\u2019s biggest agencies\u2014 Next Model Management \u2014 according to sources familiar with the business, and lavished funds on charities connected to Next co-owner Faith Kates and her family. Brunel owned a 25 percent stake in Next with his brother, according to previously unreported court documents. And when Brunel\u2019s relationship with Next soured, he and Epstein tried to expand into deals with the renowned agency Elite Paris.\n\nAs a high-flying money manager in the 1980s, Epstein ran in the same circles as much of the fashion elite. He dated Ford Models star Eva Andersson, a former Miss Sweden, and flew everyone from Naomi Campbell to modelizing billionaire Ron Burkle on his private plane. According to a former associate, he partied around the globe with a group of playboys including Brunel, Spectrum Models co-owner James Rowan, and Fabrizio Lombardo, a close friend of Harvey Weinstein.\n\nOn Wednesday, the French newspaper Le Parisien reported that authorities in France are seeking Brunel as part of their probe into Epstein, and that they recently interviewed two women who say they were Brunel\u2019s victims in the late 1970s and early \u201980s. According to police, Brunel was in Paris this summer before he took off. He may be in Brazil.\n\nLess public, however, was Epstein\u2019s relationship with Next model-maker Faith Kates. The 61-year-old Kates founded the business in 1989, and built it into one of the most respected agencies in the industry. Her partners at the time included Brunel and Lorenzo Pedrini, a former male model who appears in Epstein\u2019s little black book of contacts. Spectrum Models co-owner Joel Wilkenfeld later merged his agency with Kates\u2019 budding shop.\n\nThrough an attorney, Kates denied any business or financial relationship with Epstein. Her attorney said she had seen him \u201conce or twice a year\u201d over the last decade.\n\nRegarded as a key player in the industry, Kates built Next into an empire with offices around the globe. The agency now represents musicians, actors, and social media stars, with a portfolio boasting beauties like Alexa Chung, Petra Nemcova, Miranda Kerr, Molly Sims, and Milla Jovovich.\n\nThe Long Island native is also known for her philanthropy, especially with the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.\n\nAccording to one bio for Advertising Week, Kates has raised more than $30 million for ovarian cancer research, partially through \u201cSuper Saturday,\u201d an annual shopping fundraiser in the Hamptons that she invented with designer Donna Karan and the late Harper\u2019s Bazaar editor Liz Tilberis. The guest lineup has included Kelly Ripa and husband Mark Consuelos, Barbara Walters, Blake Lively, Christy Turlington and Edie Falco.\n\nKates is also no stranger to speaking out on modeling-industry issues and in service of her talent roster. In 2017, as the #MeToo movement was picking up, Kates discussed sexual harassment in the fashion sector by shutterbugs and agents.\n\nAt the time, she told Women\u2019s Wear Daily that she didn\u2019t hear much about abusive behavior but when incidents have occurred, she would call the offending photographer herself. \u201cI think Next is pretty powerful and the girls don\u2019t get hit [on] that much anymore. I think the ones that do are the ones that don\u2019t have great representation. We have a voice,\u201d Kates told WWD.\n\n\u201cIf you think ever that somebody\u2019s bothering you on the set, you call us and somebody will be there in 15 minutes,\u201d Kates claimed she tells her models. \u201cWe do what we can do to protect our people.\u201d\n\nKates met Epstein through a mutual friend in the 1980s, a lawyer for the talent agent told The Daily Beast in a letter. She claims to have lost touch with him in the early 1990s and to have been reacquainted with him about 10 years ago, after his release from prison.\n\n\u201cMr. Epstein informed Ms. Kates and everyone else he knew that the reason he served a year in prison was because he was caught with a prostitute who, unbeknownst to him, was underage, and that even though he was innocent, he accepted a plea deal and agreed to serve a year in jail with work release solely to avoid the risk that he could be sentenced to 25 years in prison if he went to trial and fought the charges,\u201d the attorney said.\n\nHe added, \u201cGiven the relatively light sentence Mr. Epstein received and the fact that my client never personally observed any inappropriate conduct by Mr. Epstein, she had no reason to disbelieve him.\u201d\n\nFour former Next employees told The Daily Beast they saw Epstein in their offices, or answered phone calls from him, in the years between Next\u2019s founding in 1989 and Epstein\u2019s incarceration in 2008.\n\nTimothy Priano, a makeup and hair agent who worked with the company, recalled being pulled into a meeting with Epstein and Kates at the New York offices in the late 1990s. Another employee said the money man was \u201cin and out of our office constantly\u201d in the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cI would only see him come in and go straight to her office with the door closed,\u201d that person said. \u201cIt was always like, \u2018Get Jeffrey Epstein on the phone.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother woman who worked at the New York office recalled answering the phone when Epstein called. She didn\u2019t recognize his name, and probably would not have remembered him at all, if another employee hadn\u2019t turned to her and remarked, \u201cOh, it\u2019s that creepy guy.\u201d\n\nKates\u2019 attorney said Epstein would drop by her offices to say hello \u201con occasion,\u201d but never took meetings there or had any business or financial relationship with Next.\n\nEpstein was also reported to have dated Next model Alina Puscau, a Playboy covergirl and former Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel. In a May 2005 article, the New York Post called Puscau \u201ca Romanian stunner\u201d who \u201cused to date reclusive billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d The report continued, \u201cEpstein, who handles Leslie Wexner\u2019s fortune, helped land her a gig modeling for Wexner\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret brand, we hear, and paid for her to live in high style.\u201d\n\nOne friend of Puscau reportedly told the Post, \u201cWithout Jeffrey she would never have gotten the Victoria\u2019s Secret job.\u201d Puscau declined to comment for this story.\n\nEpstein also dated another Next model who later became a real estate agent, according to a former employee of the company, and her name appears in Epstein\u2019s flight logs. (A third Next model appears in Epstein\u2019s infamous address book, and was listed in Epstein\u2019s butler\u2019s notes under \u201cvisitor\u2019s massage.\u201d She was also in Epstein\u2019s flight logs in 2003, but it\u2019s unclear if she modeled with Next at the time.)\n\nThe model-realtor was photographed with Epstein at a launch party for Radar Online in May 2005, and snapped at a September 2005 event Epstein attended for the film Capote. She also attended a November 2004 gala for the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, of which Kates was president of the board from 1994 to 2011.\n\nNext and Kates say they had no knowledge of Epstein dating, socializing with, or flying on a plane with any of the agency\u2019s models.\n\nTax records for Epstein\u2019s nonprofit, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation Inc., show Epstein donated $50,000 to Kates\u2019 cancer charity in September 2006\u2014two months after he was busted for soliciting teen girls.\n\nAnd in 2012, as he issued a flurry of philanthropic press releases to repair his reputation, Epstein heralded another donation to Kates\u2019 group, declaring \u201cEarly Detection Of Ovarian Cancer Gets Substantial Support From Science Investor, Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\nThe financier bestowed funds on Kates four years later, too, with a $10,000 donation to her latest nonprofit venture, The Women Global Cancer Initiative. As The Daily Beast reported, Epstein provided the funds through his secret charity, Gratitude America Ltd.\n\n\u201cMr. Epstein\u2019s name was on a list with hundreds of other donors Ms. Kates solicited to make donations to her cancer charities,\u201d an attorney for Kates said. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Epstein was well known for his philanthropy, donating over $30 million through his private foundations to numerous charitable causes between 1998 and 2018.\u201d\n\nEpstein also recently funded a nonprofit where Kates\u2019 son, Dylan Kogan, worked. In 2017, Gratitude America sent $25,000 to the Junior Tennis Champions Center (JTCC) in College Park, Maryland, where Kogan worked as a \u201cSummer Community Outreach Assistant Manager\u201d in 2018. According to social media posts, Kogan coached at JTCC in 2017, too.\n\nTennis center CEO Raymond Benton told the Diamondback, a student newspaper at The University of Maryland, that his organization returned Epstein\u2019s total of $35,000 in donations with a check that was cashed by mid-May. Benton said Gratitude America gave JTCC $25,000 in August 2017 and $10,000 in July 2018.\n\nBenton did not return The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment, nor did Will Hopton, JTCC\u2019s Director of Marketing. Of the JTCC donation, Kates told The Daily Beast , \u201cMy son volunteered in high school and I believe they gave back the donation.\u201d\n\nKates was not the only modeling industry insider Epstein targeted in his quest to repair his reputation. Another beneficiary was Eva Andersson, his model ex-girlfriend, who founded the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai hospital in 2011. A year later, Epstein issued a press release publicizing his financial support of her effort. And, as The Daily Beast revealed, Epstein also donated to Harvard\u2019s Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, of which Andersson\u2019s daughter, Celina Dubin, was a member.\n\nEpstein also teamed up with Jean-Luc Brunel, one of Next\u2019s founding partners, in a close relationship that is now under scrutiny. Brunel\u2019s name was kept out of the press at the time of Next\u2019s formation, after multiple models accused him of sexual assault in a 1988 60 Minutes feature. (Brunel denied these allegations.)\n\nBut according to previously unreported court documents, Brunel and his brother, Arnaud, were 25 percent owners of the fledgling agency. Next also employed Arnaud as a consultant and paid him a $30,000-a-year salary, plus 3 percent of the company\u2019s annual revenue. In court documents, Kates said the brothers \u201cbasically had control of the Florida Next office.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Next sued the brothers, accusing them of \u201craiding\u201d the agency\u2019s Miami offices to set up a rival agency of their own. In an affidavit, Kates claimed Jean-Luc and Arnaud solicited her models and staff to join their new agency\u2014located just one block from Next\u2019s Miami headquarters\u2014even as Jean-Luc continued to hold a 25 percent stake in Kates\u2019 company.\n\n\u201cUnless the defendants are stopped by this Court, they will continue to raid plaintiff\u2019s office, pirate plaintiff's employees and models, and divert all of the business from plaintiff to themselves,\u201d Next\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nThe parties settled later that year, and Brunel went on to open New York and Miami outposts of his French agency, Karin Models.\n\nAsked about her relationship with Brunel, Kates told The Daily Beast: \u201cHe was a minority partner 30 years ago and after two years left the company, I haven\u2019t seen him since then.\u201d Court documents, however, show the Brunel family apparently worked for the company for at least five years. They are included on the company\u2019s partnership agreement in 1989, and Arnaud\u2019s name appears on official company documents until 1994.\n\nThe split between Brunel and Next did not seem to strain the Frenchman\u2019s relationship with Epstein. Between 1999 and 2005, Brunel flew on the financier\u2019s private plane more than 20 times, and was such a regular at his Palm Beach estate that staff recalled him whipping up his own meals in the kitchen. When Epstein was arrested in 2008, Brunel visited him nearly 70 times in jail.\n\nOne of Epstein\u2019s first public accusers, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), claimed in legal filings that Brunel was one of many powerful men whom Epstein forced her to sleep with in her years as his \u201csex slave.\u201d She also accused Brunel of using his agency to find foreign girls, obtain visas for them, and \u201cfarm them out to his friends, including Epstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the girls came from poor countries or poor backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money,\u201d Giuffre said in a 2015 affidavit. \u201cJeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim.\u201d\n\nA former Karin employee told The Daily Beast he frequently arrived at the New York office to find women waiting for him, saying Brunel had sent them. The women said Brunel had promised them test shoots and housing but\u2014to the former employee\u2019s knowledge\u2014they never worked a single day in the industry.\n\n\u201cOf course I surmised something is going on, because why, if you\u2019re in this business, why are you going to waste your time with people who are not right for the agency and the image of the agency?\" he said.\n\n\u201cJean-Luc had a problem of the chase,\u201d he added. \u201cThe chase and the conquer.\u201d\n\nAnother former Karin employee told The Daily Beast that the company was barely profitable, and paid for any extra expenses with influxes of cash from Brunel\u2019s brother and their business partner, Etienne des Roys. Soon after the two financiers pulled out in 2003, Brunel\u2019s operation collapsed: The Paris office filed to revoke Brunel\u2019s claim to the Karin trademark in 2004, and in 2005, he changed the name of the agency to MC2.\n\nSimilar to Giuffre\u2019s allegations, a former MC2 bookkeeper told the FBI in 2010 that Brunel had flown in teenage models from around the world to be housed in Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side apartments. She claimed the girls were loaned out to wealthy clients for up to $100,000 a night, and were not paid if they refused to be \u201cmolested.\u201d Brunel has denied these claims and says the woman was fired from his agency for embezzling company funds.\n\n\u201c A booking agent told her Epstein was 'one of the most important people in modeling.' \u201d\n\nAs Brunel\u2019s businesses struggled in the early 2000s, Epstein seemed to be trying to diversify. In 2004, he tried and failed to purchase the American arm of Elite Models, according to the New York Post. The next year, he extended a $1 million line of credit to Brunel to invest in a new agency with Elite Paris. Epstein\u2019s attorney, Darren Indyke, registered the new company to 457 Madison Avenue\u2014the same address as the financier\u2019s investment firm.\n\nBut this plan, too, was short-lived: According to court documents, Elite Paris called off the experiment after news began surfacing of Epstein\u2019s arrest. In fact, Brunel later sued Epstein, claiming rumors and news reports about his behavior had tarnished the agent\u2019s reputation and cost him millions of dollars in lost business. The suit was still making its way through the courts when Epstein died.\n\n\u201cI strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of,\u201d Brunel said in a statement when he filed the lawsuit. \u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager.\"\n\nWhen Epstein failed to make inroads in the modeling industry, he relied on his other business connections. Multiple aspiring models have accused Epstein of assaulting them after claiming he was a scout for Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014the iconic lingerie brand owned by Epstein\u2019s top benefactor and client, Les Wexner.\n\nThere is no evidence that Epstein ever served as a formal scout for Victoria\u2019s Secret or L Brands, its parent company. Representatives for L Brands told The New York Times they do not believe Epstein was \u201cever employed by nor served as an authorized representative of the company,\u201d and sources said they quickly notified Wexner when they learned Epstein was trying to involve himself in catalog scouting.\n\nStill, in 1997, model and actress Alicia Arden says Epstein invited her to his hotel room to audition for the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog. When she arrived, she says, he grabbed her and tried to undress her until she ran away. Another accuser, former model Elizabeth Tai, said she was introduced to Epstein by a booking agent who told her Epstein was \u201cone of the most important people in modeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that this man is in charge of Victoria\u2019s Secret and he\u2019s going to change your life,\u201d Tai told the New York Post.\n\nUpon arriving at his New York mansion, Tai says, she tried showing Epstein her portfolio. Instead, he began taking off his clothes and laid down naked on a massage table. She escaped by throwing a vibrator at his head and running out the door.\n\nThree other models testified at a recent court hearing that Epstein used his modeling industry connections to lure them in. Another woman testified that Epstein had told her from a young age that she could become a model, while a second, Marijke Chartouni, said a friend promised her Epstein could use his connections to the art and fashion world to help her. Both women say Epstein sexually assaulted them.\n\nA third woman, identified only as Jane Doe 3, said a friend first mentioned Epstein to her as a caring man who could help with her modeling career. When she eventually met him, at his New York home, she says he sexually assaulted her. Afterwards, she says, she became depressed and stopped going to castings. Five months after moving to New York City to pursue her dream of modeling, she left.\n\n\u201cI buried this deep within me, and all of the new occurrences that have come up in the media is what brought it back up for me,\u201d she testified. \u201cAnd I feel sickened and saddened that it took so many years, and God knows how many victims, for this to finally come out, but I\u2019m thankful it did.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019m just angry that he\u2019s not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his actions.\u201d", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s connections to the modeling industry included regular visits at a leading agency, and donations to charities linked to its influential co-owner Faith Kates.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Kate Briquelet", "Lachlan Cartwright", "Gender Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567820151/_190906-Epstein-tease_xdexzt", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
