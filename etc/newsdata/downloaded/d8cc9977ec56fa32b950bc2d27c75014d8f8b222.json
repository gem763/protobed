McConnell\u2019s schedule includes two cannabis-related lunches with executives and advocates, one of which will take place in Newport Beach, Calif., and a tour of at least one cannabis-related company in the area.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether McConnell\u2019s California Wednesday and Thursday schedule signals a shift in his thinking about cannabis banking reform, the people said. McConnell\u2019s Washington office did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nRead: Cannabis companies have secret formulas to determine when the U.S. may allow pot sales\n\n\u201cI think this is absolutely positive that McConnell is meeting with stakeholders in the cannabis market,\u201d PI Financial analyst Jason Zandberg told MarketWatch over the phone. \u201cThe U.S. market needs the banking act to flourish, without it \u2014 there are legitimate companies that are following the rules that are facing major obstacles. Banking legislation would be a huge positive catalyst.\u201d\n\nThe cannabis industry representatives will attempt to convince McConnell that reform is necessary because the current legal regime unfairly penalizes businesses that obey federal laws, such as hemp farmers producing the crop for legal CBD products, according to a person familiar with the lobbying strategy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to see that Leader McConnell is coming to see how a regulated market is an improvement over prohibition,\u201d National Cannabis Industry Association executive director Aaron Smith told MarketWatch in an interview. \u201cRight now the priority is banking, which affects [McConnell\u2019s] constituents in the hemp and CBD industry, as well as legal cannabis businesses here in California. That\u2019s really our primary ask \u2014 common-sense policies around banking and public safety, and we\u2019re hopeful [McConnell] will see the need for that and move forward along with Chairman [Sen. Mike] Crapo.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s visit to the Golden State comes weeks after the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, a bill aimed at giving banks and credit unions additional clarity around servicing cannabis companies that wish to open accounts for things like paying bills. Because marijuana is illegal at the federal level, financial institutions can encounter legal problems, and cannabis companies \u2014 including those that operate cannabidiol, or CBD, businesses \u2014 face difficulties banking.\n\nLarge amounts of cash sloshing around the cannabis sector makes pot companies the target of robberies and other crimes, lobbyists in favor of the SAFE Act have said.\n\nUp until recently, McConnell appeared to be a major roadblock to the Senate taking up the bill, and has said in the past that marijuana is hemp\u2019s \u201cillicit cousin, which I choose not to embrace.\u201d The hemp industry holds a significant amount of power in Kentucky, McConnell\u2019s home state, and a new provision in the SAFE Act grants specific protections to hemp farmers.\n\nCheck out: Cannabis Watsh \u2014 All of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Cannabis industry\u2019s lobbying on track to hit a new record\n\nCrapo, an influential Republican senator from Idaho, told Politico in September that he wanted to hold a Senate Banking Committee vote on a cannabis banking bill. Progressive groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for American Progress and others have criticized top House Democrats for moving forward with a bill that doesn\u2019t address social-justice issues tied to decades of cannabis prohibition.\n\nETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -0.95% , which tracks a basket of cannabis stocks, has lost nearly half its value in the past 12 months, while the broad S&P 500 index SPX, +0.91% has gained 1.6%.\n\nAdditional reporting by Victor Reklaitis", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a longtime opponent of reforming marijuana laws, is spending more time than usual thinking about cannabis on a trip...", "authors": ["Max A.
