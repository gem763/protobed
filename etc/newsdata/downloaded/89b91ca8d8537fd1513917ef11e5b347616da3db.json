He was giving up five inches and 74 pounds on Donald. Prior to Freeman's punch, Donald was basically lifting the Falcons running back up off the turf and pushing him backward.\n\nIt could've been a case of Freeman's long-simmering frustration boiling over.\n\nThe Falcons are headed for their sixth defeat in seven games, not something anybody expected of a team with the pieces to at least challenge for a wild-card berth. Gerald Everett added further insult Sunday as he celebrated his eight-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter.\n\nWith his day over, Freeman tied a season-low by running for 19 yards on seven carries. He also caught two passes for six yards.\n\nHe was the second player to be ejected Sunday.
