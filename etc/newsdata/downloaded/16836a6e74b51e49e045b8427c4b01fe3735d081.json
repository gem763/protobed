Tragically, their concerns were mostly ignored.\n\nDuring the early morning hours of Sept. 5, the members of Black September used stolen keys to break into the apartment where the Israeli team was staying. They had been scoping out the apartment and surrounding areas for weeks preparing for their attack.\n\nISRAELI'S NETANYAHU RIPS JEREMY CORBYN OVER IMAGES SHOWING POLITICIAN LAYING WREATH AT TERRORIST GRAVESITE\n\nTwo Israelis were murdered during the initial stage of the attack, and the remaining nine were taken hostage and later murdered during a failed rescue mission.\n\nTragedies like the Munich massacre cannot and must not be forgotten.\n\nFirst, we must honor those who were killed. But we must also learn how to keep such attacks from happening again.\n\nThe attack on representatives of the Jewish state of Israel terrified the world, but didn\u2019t generate the outrage it warranted. The Olympics at first continued but were eventually suspended for just 36 hours, under public pressure.\n\nNor did the massacre prompt sufficient tightening of security measures around the world to prevent other deadly terrorist attacks in the years ahead.\n\nAs has often happened in history, Jews and the state of Israel tend to become the targets of a \u201cfirst try\u201d to find out what kind of damage can be caused around the world. Even today this is seen with a global rise in anti-Semitism and a lack of leadership to take action to stop it.\n\nWe are also seeing this with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. This blatantly anti-Semitic movement has the goal of destroying Israel, a vibrant democracy and close U.S. ally.\n\nWhy should we pay attention to what is happening in Israel? Because if we don\u2019t stand up for Israel when it faces these kinds of attacks today, America will be next.\n\nThe danger of complacency in the face of attacks on others was described by Martin Niem\u00f6ller, who was a submarine officer in the German Navy in World War I and later became a Lutheran pastor. At first he supported Nazi leader Adolf Hitler but then became a fierce opponent and was imprisoned in concentration camps from 1938 to 1945, narrowly escaping death.\n\nBlaming himself for not opposing Hitler sooner, he made remarks after World War II translated into several versions in English as a poem. The best-known translation states:\n\nFirst they came for the communists, and I did not speak out \u2013 because I was not a communist / Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out \u2013 because I was not a socialist / Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out \u2013 because I was not a trade unionist / Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out \u2013 because I was not a Jew / Then they came for me \u2013 and there was no one left to speak out for me.\n\nThese moving words tell us how necessary it is to learn from one\u2019s mistakes and to keep certain parts of history from ever repeating themselves.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis anniversary of the Munich massacre must remind us that we should be vigilant to the suffering of others.
