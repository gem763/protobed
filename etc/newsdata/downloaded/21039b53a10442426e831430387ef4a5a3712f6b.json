The 54-year-old, who is also a former US ambassador to NATO, is appearing voluntarily.", "description": "Kurt Volker's meeting with the committee comes after an emotional day in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3125%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_120/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4e4d18d6ce8cfb92841cdde7afd8f6c9935ec399", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
