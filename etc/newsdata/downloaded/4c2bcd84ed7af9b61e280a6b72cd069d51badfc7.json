Red Bull look very strong on the long runs, but let's see if their tyres will last - that's the name of the game.\"\n\nFor Verstappen, it was remarkably only his second career pole position.\n\n\"To come out on top is incredible,\" he said. \"We know Ferrari is quick on the straights, but to come back like this... A big thanks to the team.\n\n\"It will be a bit different to start from first instead of second! So, I will give it all and we have a good race car so if something happens at the start, I think we can get it done.\"\n\nLeclerc said: \"The start will be very important - our top speeds are very good so I hope we can take it on.\"\n\nVettel said: \"I made a mistake on my first run and I was confident on my second but a double yellow (flag) meant I had to slow down. The car was good. It's a long race so let's see - I feel we have the speed and with a good start we can see!\"\n\nCarlos Sainz was seventh ahead of his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris and the two Toro Rossos of Daniil Kvyat and Pierre Gasly.\n\nVerstappen was soon on top of Q1 as both Williams men dropped out, with Hamilton leading in Q2 from Bottas.\n\nOut went local hero Sergio Perez of Racing Point, by just 0.008 seconds, along with Renault's Nico Hulkenberg and Daniel Ricciardo along with the two Alfa Romeos of Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi.\n\nAfter the opening Q3 runs, Verstappen was on top ahead of Leclerc and Vettel, clear proof that Ferrari's power advantage was less effective in the thin air at 2 250 metres, the altitude of Mexico City, where the Red Bulls revelled in their own aerodynamics and superior tyre performance.\n\nHamilton was fourth, Albon fifth and Bottas sixth, all of them within four-tenths of the pace-setting Dutchman, before the action resumed with a final and dramatic flurry.", "description": "Max Verstappen took pole while Valtteri Bottas crashed heavily in the final seconds of the qualifying session for Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9524/c025d36941d040cd8b4c0699002d97a4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
