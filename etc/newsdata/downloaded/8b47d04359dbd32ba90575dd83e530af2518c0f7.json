Then I found a barber\u2019 | Jamie Jackson", "language": "en", "text": "The former England striker talks about homesickness in Liverpool, falling asleep during G\u00e9rard Houllier\u2019s meetings and picks his favourite player from the \u2018golden generation\u2019\n\nEmile Heskey exudes a Zen-like calm whether discussing criticism of his goalscoring or recalling crying. The former Liverpool and England striker is at the Alderley Hotel in Cheshire to discuss his new book, Even Heskey Scored. The title was chosen because, he laughs, this is \u201cwhat everyone said\u201d.\n\nYet if his career numbers are low for someone who played most of his career as a No 9 \u2013 seven goals from 62 caps, 110 in 516 Premier League games \u2013 his 53 assists in the top flight is a clue to his real worth. The figure stands at only two fewer than the vaunted master-creator Paul Scholes. And when Heskey\u2019s seventh place in the all-time appearance chart is factored in, alongside a 21-year, seven-club career that ran from 1995 to 2016 and took in Leicester City, Liverpool, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic, Aston Villa, Newcastle Jets and Bolton Wanderers, there is further evidence of why he was so successful.\n\n\u201cI play for the team; it wasn\u2019t anything that really bothered me,\u201d Heskey says of his strike return. \u201cI know forwards will go out and if [the team] score five and they don\u2019t, they are fuming. I don\u2019t care. I still got to the top 1% or whatever of the game.\u201d\n\nHe offers a response to critics. \u201cYour son is eight,\u201d Heskey says. \u201cSo if I tell you by the age of 24 he would\u2019ve represented England youth all the way through, would have made his debut at 17 and gone to three cup finals in four years for his hometown team [Leicester], then been sold for a record to Liverpool \u2013 one of the biggest clubs in the world; then he\u2019d go on to win the treble [FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Cup] that first season, represent England at two World Cups, in the European Championship, and play in one of England\u2019s most memorable games to date, winning God knows, six or seven trophies by the age of 24, how would you feel?\u201d\n\nThe international match cited is the 5-1 victory over Germany in Munich in September 2001, Heskey scoring the fifth, before performing a mock DJ-style celebration.\n\nThis highlight has top billing in what was, as he says, an impressive career. Heskey was only 18 when he was in the Leicester side that beat Crystal Palace in the 1996 First Division play-off final, drinking a full bottle of champagne afterwards, which, he writes, \u201cfinished me\u201d.\n\nHeskey had made his debut in the previous season under Mark McGhee but by now Martin O\u2019Neill was manager, the Irishman proving a particular influence on Heskey. \u201cAll he asked was: \u2018Son, be quick. Get it and run.\u2019 Martin allowed me to be free and G\u00e9rard [Houllier, at Liverpool] taught me about football. I tell people, and they laugh \u2013 with G\u00e9rard you were in a meeting for hours: pitch black watching video for hours. I used to fall asleep I was so tired.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Heskey causes panic in the Germany defence during England\u2019s famous 5-1 win.

I can\u2019t remember him coaching. But when you go on that pitch you knew everything.\u201d\n\nYet Steve McClaren, Eriksson\u2019s successor, caused bemusement when recalling Heskey, via phone, for the first time in three years in September 2007. \u201cHe said, I\u2019ve spoken to Michael [Owen] about you.\u2019 It\u2019s like \u2013 thank you but why would you?\u201d says Heskey. \u201cI\u2019d played how many seasons in the Premier League \u2013 it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know me. I probably have to thank Michael for getting me back into the national team.\u201d\n\nAfter Alan Shearer retired in 2000 Heskey\u2019s pace and presence made him Owen\u2019s strike partner for three years until Wayne Rooney\u2019s emergence. He expresses surprise at Owen\u2019s recent spat with Shearer - which centred on loyalty and their time together at Newcastle United \u2013 given how close they were, \u201claughing and joking all the time with England\u201d.\n\nWhen Heskey joined Liverpool in March 2000 the club paid a record \u00a311m for him. By then Heskey had claimed two League Cups \u2013 in 1997 and 2000 \u2013 and been given his England debut by Kevin Keegan in a 1-1 draw with Hungary.\n\nYet homesickness marked his beginnings on Merseyside. \u201cIt lasted six months,\u201d says Heskey. \u201cI had to grow up very quickly because I had kids, I had a girlfriend. I literally laid on the floor and started crying. I was like \u2018What have I done? I don\u2019t know if I have done the right thing\u2019. But the weirdest thing was I\u2019d go to training and I would be all right.\n\n\u201cThen like a drop of a hat I found a barber, I found friends, a routine. Yes, it was a tough time but it was weird, I was silly and, looking back, you think: why didn\u2019t you just go and sit with mates?\u201d\n\nThe other mention of tears relates to an O\u2019Neill rollicking. \u201cI would\u2019ve been a teenager,\u201d Heskey says. \u201cHe just laid into me at Southampton away, at full-time. I was crying, but I [had] missed a few chances.\u201d\n\nHeskey\u2019s honesty and self-awareness are striking and denote a particular type of intelligence. \u201cI\u2019m a people\u2019s person,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand them [and] I\u2019ve got a calming nature as well.\u201d He laughs. \u201cEven though I can lose the plot sometimes. I got sent off once in a friendly. Before, on the phone, I had a full-on argument where I\u2019m telling this guy \u2018I am coming for you\u2019 and I guess that had something to do with me getting sent off.\u201d\n\nHeskey, now 41, played with a glittering array of footballers that included Scholes, David Beckham, Rooney, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell and Steven Gerrard. While he nominates the latter as the most talented and Campbell his toughest opponent, he rates Cole the \u201cfinest\u201d footballer of England\u2019s so-called golden generation.\n\nIn the book there is an intriguing picture of Cole as an incessant \u201cchain-smoker\u201d who could still keep Cristiano Ronaldo in \u201chis pocket\u201d. Heskey laughs again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it feels like to smoke but I couldn\u2019t imagine that it helps you a lot,\u201d he says.\n\nHeskey is thoughtful on the issue of racism. His paternal grandfather was from Antigua, his maternal side from the nation\u2019s other island, Barbuda. He writes of how his father, Tyrone, and mother, Albertine, arrived in Leicester aged 10 and had to deal with ugly discrimination which included having to read a sign that stated: \u201cNo Black, No Irish, No Dogs allowed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emile Heskey has not ruled out a career in coaching.\n\nWhile Heskey himself was \u201cchased from a bar\u201d as a teenager, this season Manchester United\u2019s Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham and Kurt Zouma and Reading\u2019s Yakou M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 have all been abused on Twitter.\n\nHeskey, too, still experiences racism. \u201cRecently I was at an airport on the way to France and I sat down there with my drink. A woman was there with her bag on the chair. She picked it up and left. You just take it with a pinch of salt and you move on,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t let it affect you.\u201d\n\nHeskey has seven children \u2013 Jamaal, Micah and Liyah with his former partner, Kylee, and Jaden, Reigan, Milanna and Mendes with his wife, Chantelle. All will have been amused to watch the YouTube clip of him meeting Rod and Emu when their father was 11. \u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d Heskey says. \u201cI was on television with one of the biggest stars back then. But he kept calling me Emily.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, of the future? Heskey may have no \u201cburning desire\u201d to coach yet he says: \u201cI do want to have a go.\u201d With his relaxed demeanour and deep well of experience Heskey would surely be an asset to the game.\n\nEven Heskey Scored is published on 16 September 2019 by Pitch Publishing (\u00a319.99)", "description": "The former England striker talks about homesickness in Liverpool, falling asleep during G\u00e9rard Houllier\u2019s meetings and picks his favourite player from the \u2018golden generation\u2019", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f40c5a7ec163d9ca25c0800477a4230238d3d1dc/0_57_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d068a29e69f9a16b3c9a9a959bdc344", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
