This one \u2014 the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, also known as Vector \u2014 has a history of handling anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox.\n\nIts past raised concerns among some Russians who said on social media that they distrust the official reassurances, prompted in part by failures in the past of officials to convey the true dangers of such situations.\n\nRead more: A gas explosion ripped through a Russian lab storing deadly diseases like smallpox, anthrax, and Ebola\n\nNikolai Krasnikov, the town's mayor, visited the site Monday and told media that the situation was under control and there was no biological threat. Vector and Russia's consumer protection watchdog also said that no biologically hazardous substances were present at the time of the blast.\n\n\"No work with biological materials was carried out in the building,\" Vector said in an online statement.\n\nA statement from Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, also known as Vector, about a gas explosion on September 16, 2019.

Officials at the time suppressed news of the disaster.\n\nA hazmat worker protecting against the Ebola virus in Dallas, Texas.

There are labs that work in open conditions but there are also closed facilities. In closed facilities they maintain special leak-tightness\u2026 They introduce very high safety measures there\u2026 If the explosion was in such facility it could be very dangerous.\"\n\nVector is one of two places in the world to store the live smallpox virus. The other sample of the deadly pathogen is stored at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nVector was founded in 1974. In the 1970s and 1980s it was actively involved in developing biological weapons.", "description": "A gas explosion hit a research lab storing anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox in Koltsovo on Monday.
