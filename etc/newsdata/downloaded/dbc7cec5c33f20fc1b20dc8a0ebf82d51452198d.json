force Johnson to seek new Brexit delay", "language": "en", "text": "London (AFP) \u2013 British MPs voted on Saturday to demand Boris Johnson delay Brexit while they further consider his EU divorce deal but the prime minister defiantly insisted Britain will still leave on October 31.\n\nIn a day of high drama in the House of Commons, MPs declined to give their backing to the agreement Johnson struck with the EU this week until the legislation needed to ratify it has passed.\n\nIn doing so, they triggered a law requiring Johnson write to EU leaders by the end of the day asking to delay Brexit, to avoid the risk that Britain crashes out in less than two weeks.\n\nOutside parliament, tens of thousands of people marching to demand a new referendum that might reverse Brexit erupted into cheers at the vote.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really good, that\u2019s one step away from Brexit,\u201d demonstrator Philip Dobson told AFP.\n\n\u201cReject Brexit\u201d, \u201cPut It To The People\u201d and \u201cStop This Madness\u201d read some of the placards at the march, where many protesters also waved EU flags.\n\nThe vote is a blow to Johnson, who has previously said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than prolong the tortuous process of ending Britain\u2019s 46-year-old membership of the EU.\n\nBut Johnson responded with characteristic defiance, sparking outrage among opposition MPs \u2014 and fresh uncertainty about what happens next.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so,\u201d he told MPs, who met on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War.\n\n\u201cI continue in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from officials that Johnson would send his letter, but a tweet from his Conservative party said: \u201cThe prime minister will not ask for a delay.\u201d\n\nBrussels urged Britain to explain its plan as soon as possible, while French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said a new delay to Brexit was \u201cin nobody\u2019s interest\u201d.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party opposes the deal, said: \u201cThe prime minister must now comply with the law.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Pointless\u2019 delay \u2013\n\nSecuring the deal at Thursday\u2019s EU summit was a personal victory for Johnson, a figurehead in the 2016 Leave campaign who has vowed to deliver Brexit on October 31 come what may.\n\nHe had spent 48 hours frantically trying to persuade MPs to back it, and won support from many of the eurosceptic Conservative MPs who rejected a previous divorce agreement.\n\nBut parliament \u2014 like the frustrated public \u2014 is still bitterly divided over how and even if Britain should end decades of integration with its closest trading partner.\n\nMPs voted by 322 to 306 to back a motion by former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin that \u201cwithholds approval (of the deal) unless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d.\n\nThe failure to get a clear vote for the text triggers a law requiring Johnson ask the EU to delay Brexit for three months \u2014 or to another date of their choosing.\n\nIf he refuses, he is likely to face a court challenge.\n\nBefore the vote Johnson warned another delay \u2014 the third \u2014 was \u201cpointless\u201d, adding: \u201cNow is the time to get this thing done.\u201d\n\nHe said he would introduce legislation next week to implement his deal, with a first vote as soon as Tuesday.\n\nThe government also wants another vote on the deal on Monday, but this may not be possible.\n\nThere is a chance the deal could pass, and Britain could still leave the EU on October 31, but there remains strong opposition to the agreement among MPs.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), object to customs arrangements they say would create new barriers between the province and mainland Britain.\n\nThe Labour party fears the deal paves the way for a loose trading agreement with the EU that would cost jobs and lead to a bonfire of regulations.\n\n\u201cWe will not back this sell-out deal,\u201d Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\n\u2013 Second referendum calls \u2013\n\nAs MPs voted in parliament, they could hear shouts and cheers from protesters demanding a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d outside.\n\n\u201cThe first referendum was jumping on a train without a destination,\u201d said Douglas Hill, 35, on the march with his Estonian wife.\n\n\u201cNow that we have a destination, we need to have a second referendum.\u201d\n\nMPs could try to hijack the legislation on the Brexit deal next week with a motion to call a new referendum, although previous attempts have failed.\n\nburs-ar/phz/dt", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British MPs voted on Saturday to demand Boris Johnson delay
