When pressed again by BBC journalist Andrew Marr, Johnson added: \u201cThere was no interest to declare.\u201d\n\nThe scandal worsened Sunday as Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party was opening its annual party conference in Manchester following a tumultuous week for a leader who has only been in the job since July.\n\nIn just the last few days, the U.K. Supreme Court declared Johnson\u2019s attempt to suspend Parliament illegal and he cut short a trip to the United States, racing home to face the House of Commons, where lawmakers greeted him with cries of \u201cResign!\u201d He then lost a vote on a normally routine matter \u2014 a request to adjourn for a week so that Conservatives could attend their conference.\n\nComplicating things further, questions were raised about the 55-year-old Johnson\u2019s links to Arcuri, now 34, who set up a cyber firm in East London after moving to the capital seven years ago.\n\nYet even as the British leader visited North Manchester General Hospital on Sunday to talk about his government\u2019s plans to build 40 hospitals, his efforts failed to change the subject.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear, I am very, very proud of everything that we did and certainly everything that I did as mayor of London,\u201d he said, adding that the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, \u201ccould possibly spend more time investing in police officers than he is investing in press officers and peddling this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nThe independent office, which oversees police complaints in England, was asked to consider if there were grounds to investigate Johnson for misconduct in public office. The authority said Friday it had a \u201cstatutory duty\u201d to record the matter because Johnson served as police commissioner during his 2008-2016 tenure as London\u2019s mayor.\n\nThe probe is the latest sign of animosity that has consumed British politics since the country narrowly voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Three years later, Britain and its politicians remain bitterly divided over how, or even whether, to leave the 28-nation bloc.\n\nJohnson took power two months ago with a \u201cdo-or-die\u201d promise that Britain will leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 \u2014 even if there\u2019s no divorce deal outlining Britain\u2019s commercial relations with the other 27 EU nations. His foes in Parliament are determined to avoid a no-deal exit, which economists say would plunge Britain into recession.\n\nIn unusually heated debate Wednesday, Johnson referred to an opposition law ordering a Brexit delay as the \u201cSurrender Act\u201d and said postponing the country\u2019s departure would \u201cbetray\u201d the people. He also brushed off concerns that his forceful language might endanger legislators as \u201chumbug.\u201d\n\nOpponents accused him of fomenting hatred in the country with his populist, people-versus-politicians rhetoric.\n\nAs tempers smoldered, Johnson rejected the notion that he himself had played a role in whipping up tensions.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been a model of restraint,\u201d Johnson said Sunday. \u201cBut I think everybody should calm down.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied wrongdoing Sunday over his links to an American businesswoman who allegedly received money and favorable...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS270_bojo09_ZG_20190929184348.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
