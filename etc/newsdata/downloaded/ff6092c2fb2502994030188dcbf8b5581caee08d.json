She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook.\n\nWaters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services.\n\n\u201cIt would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\u201d Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on its Instagram platform.\n\nBIPARTISAN CRITICISM\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2.4 billion users given the past scandals.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s internal model was for a long time was \u2018Move fast and break things.\u2019 Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system,\u201d said Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat.\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook would insist on U.S. regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits. He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign-off.\n\nLibra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have abandoned the project.\n\nFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nRepresentative Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you\u2019re up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?\u201d\n\nThe 35-year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a \u201crisky project\u201d and that he was not sure it would even work. During his testimony, the price of bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar tumbled to a five-month low.\n\nFACEBOOK HAS \u201cWORK TO DO\u201d\n\nCalm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip-ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who complimented him on his short haircut.\n\nThe CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook\u2019s mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the \u201cideal messenger\u201d for the Libra project and that the company has \u201cwork to do to build trust.\u201d But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThe vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project, sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers.\n\nOn Oct. 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group\u2019s governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots.\n\nLawmakers also touched on other hot button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March, still pending, alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nRepresentative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat, hammered Zuckerberg, saying she viewed Facebook\u2019s efforts to address civil rights abuses as insufficient, calling them \u201cappalling and disgusting.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans did offer support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project, arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating.\n\n\u201cI have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,\u201d said Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. \u201cBut if history has taught us anything, it\u2019s better to be on the side of American innovation\u201d", "description": "Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded on Wednesday that the company's planned digital currency Libra was a \"risky project,\" but sought to reassure skeptical U.S. lawmakers that it could lower the cost of electronic payments and open up the global financial system to more people.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444262881&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M21L", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
