The Grand Prix itself is on Sunday October 27.\n\nWhat time does it start?\n\nQualifying starts at 7pm BST and the race starts at 7.10pm GMT. Remember, the clocks go back one hour on Sunday morning.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nSky Sports F1 have exclusive coverage rights in the UK this year and indeed for the next few. Their qualifying coverage begins at 6pm BST and their race program starts at 5.30pm GMT.\n\nChannel 4 have highlights for this round, too. Their qualifying coverage begins at 10.45pm BST on Sunday, with race highlights starting at 11pm GMT on Sunday.\n\nYou can also keep up to date throughout the race with Luke Slater right here at Telegraph Sport.\n\nWatch the Mexican Grand Prix through Now TV for \u00a39.99.\n\nWhat do we know about the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez?\n\nCircuit length: 4.304km\n\n4.304km First grand prix: 1963\n\n1963 Laps: 71\n\n71 Race distance: 305.354km\n\n305.354km Race lap record: 1.18.741 (Valtteri Bottas, 2018)\n\n1.18.741 (Valtteri Bottas, 2018) 2018 winner: Max Verstappen, Red Bull\n\nMax Verstappen, Red Bull Number of corners: 17\n\n17 Overtaking chances: At the end of the long pit straight is the best chance, as it's one of the biggest braking zones on the circuit. Failing that, going into the tight turn four also presents an opportunity. However, the middle and end of the lap is quite tight and twisty and following closely is difficult. Passing is, naturally, even more difficult.\n\nWhat are the odds (top six)?\n\nCharles Leclerc 7/4\n\n7/4 Lewis Hamilto n 13/5\n\nn 13/5 Sebastian Vettel 10/3\n\n10/3 Max Verstappen 4/1\n\n4/1 Valtteri Bottas 17/2\n\n17/2 Alexander Albon 50/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nFor the past couple of years, Red Bull have been the quickest at this track in both qualifying and race trim but since returning from the summer break, the Milton Keynes-based team have fallen a bit behind Ferrari and Mercedes and I find it difficult to see them overhauling both teams enough to claim pole position.", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000145004366-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oLxVMM-N2Dh3uu4C0ivbnMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
