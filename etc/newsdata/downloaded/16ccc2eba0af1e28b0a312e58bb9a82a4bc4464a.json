(NASA/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThere is no powerful El Ni\u00f1o lurking in the tropical Pacific Ocean to add extra heat to the oceans and atmosphere, but the relentlessly accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, plus natural climate variability, have helped to push 2019 toward record warmth anyway.\n\nThrough September, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Wednesday was the hottest such month on record globally, the year ranks as the second warmest since instrument records began in the late 19th century. The odds slightly favor that 2019 will end up being the second-warmest year, coming in behind 2016. However, it\u2019s possible it will slip slightly in ranking to third or fourth warmest, according to NOAA projections.\n\n\n\nSeptember 2019 global temperature departure from average compared to previous Septembers. (NOAA)\n\nMatching analyses by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and NASA, NOAA found that September featured exceptional warmth worldwide, particularly in North America and the Northern Hemisphere overall.\n\n[Earth just experienced its hottest September, as 2019 heads for the record books]\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, the average global land and ocean surface temperature was 1.69 degrees above the 20th-century average, which was 0.22 degrees behind 2016, and just 0.02 degrees above the third-warmest year, which was set in 2017.\n\nIn keeping with human-caused global warming trends, all of the top 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2005, with the exception of one \u2014 1998 \u2014 when an unusually intense El Ni\u00f1o provided a major natural boost to global temperatures, added on top of long-term human-caused warming.\n\nAccording to NOAA, there\u2019s a 0.11 percent chance that 2019 will wind up as the warmest year on record, but a greater than 99.9 percent chance of a top 5 warmest year. The most likely range is between the second and fourth warmest year on record, the agency stated in its monthly climate report.\n\nThe NOAA analysis found that 7.93 percent of the world\u2019s land and ocean surfaces had a record warm September, but not a single land or ocean area had a record cold September.\n\nThe annual temperature rankings display a snapshot of climate change. However, global warming is not linear, meaning not every year is warmer than the year before it. Instead, scientists put far more emphasis on long-term trends of 30 years or more, and in that case, the sharp increase in global average temperatures clearly stands out.\n\nThis year has featured increasingly clear signs of global warming impacts worldwide, from a rare ice melt event in Greenland to lightning striking sea ice multiple times just 110 miles from the North Pole, deadly heat waves in Europe, and tropical cyclones that have intensified at some of the fastest rates ever observed.\n\nAs another indicator of the warming climate, Arctic sea ice extent declined to its second-lowest level on record in mid-September. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the 13 lowest ice extents in the satellite era have all occurred in the last 13 years. Sea ice extent bottomed out at 811,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 average minimum extent, meaning a chunk of ice roughly the size of Alaska and Colorado was missing from the top of the world due to unusually high air and sea temperatures.\n\nIn the midst of this near-record warm year, a youth-led social movement has sprung up to push for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as many studies show the window to avoid the most damaging future impacts is closing quickly.", "description": "With the warmest September on record, the Earth could be headed for its second-warmest year.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "October At Pm", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather", "Climate Science For Capital Weather Gang.
