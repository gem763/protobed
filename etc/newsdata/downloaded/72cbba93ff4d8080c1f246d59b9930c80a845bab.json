A declaratory order in terms of what constituted hate speech was needed, it was argued.\n\nMojapelo did not agree with either party, saying an order made by the court applied nationally.\n\nThe NMF agreed with the judge, saying it had been persuaded by Mojapelo's reasoning.\n\nIt argued, however, that the case was of national importance and should go on appeal.\n\nThe SAHRC's representative, advocate Itumeleng Phalane, said she would oppose the application for leave to appeal the court's decision.\n\nMojapelo said that he did not believe another court would come to a different conclusion and dismissed AfriForum's application.\n\nMore to follow.", "description": "AfriForum has been denied leave to appeal Deputy Judge President Phineas Mojapelo's ruling that the gratuitous display of the apartheid-era flag amounts to hate speech.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4094/0de8dbeadd114def9175a7152fd1bacf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
