(Film and TV rights haven't been sold for the book.)\n\nThe big picture: There's more concern than ever about the power of big tech companies \u2014 and an interest in stories that expose their influence.\n\nLast year, \"Silicon Valley\" creator Mike Judge told an interviewer that the tech industry's controversies had give the HBO show \"a second wind.\"\n\n\u201cI definitely agree that in general there\u2019s a huge mainstream interest in Silicon Valley that we haven\u2019t seen even in the days of 'The Social Network,\u2019 \" said Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, the author of the 2016 life-at-Facebook memoir \"Chaos Monkeys.\"\n\nin general there\u2019s a huge mainstream interest in Silicon Valley that we haven\u2019t seen even in the days of 'The Social Network,\u2019 \" said Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, the author of the 2016 life-at-Facebook memoir \"Chaos Monkeys.\" \"It\u2019s central to our national conversation, but before it was just a super-interesting sideshow,\" he said.\n\nFlashback: 2010's \"The Social Network\" came out in a kindler, gentler era for tech platforms, when Facebook was much smaller and the idea that Silicon Valley's products might be addictive and invasive was only a distant rumble.\n\nNow, other books from reporters covering the industry are coming thick and fast:\n\nThen, there are the tell-alls.\n\nFacebook investor Roger McNamee just published Zucked, a winding reflection on how the social giant had lost its way.\n\nJessica Powell, who used to lead Google's communications team, wrote a \"satirical novel based on my experience working at both a startup and one of the biggest tech companies in the world\" called \"The Big Disruption.\"\n\nYes, but: It's still less common for expos\u00e9s to be written by tech insiders, given that there are many financial incentives to keeping their jobs and status in the Valley. \"The code of silence is still there,\" said Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez.\n\nWhere books go first, movies can follow.\n\n\"Bad Blood,\" the bestselling Theranos expos\u00e9 from the Wall Street Journal's John Carreyrou out last year, is also being made into a movie set to star Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nA script about Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel called \"Frat Boy Genius\" topped 2018's prestigious Black List of unproduced screenplays, which also included a script about disgraced data firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a question of, \u2018How did we get here?'\u201d Christopher Cantwell, one of the creators of AMC's \"Halt and Catch Fire,\" said in 2016 about Hollywood's increased interest in the tech industry.\n\nCantwell's show, set during the PC revolution and rise of the Internet and loosely based on real companies, premiered in 2014 shortly after HBO's \"Silicon Valley.\" The following year, Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin's \"Steve Jobs\" movie hit the theaters.\n\nOur thought bubble: As you read this, a screenwriter in an apartment somewhere in Santa Monica is hoping to knock out the first five pages of her Jeff Bezos vs. the National Enquirer screenplay before lunch.\n\nThe bottom line: It's a great time to tell a story about Silicon Valley's inner workings \u2014 but maybe not the best time for its companies to have their stories told.", "description": "It's the golden age of Silicon Valley exposes with intense interest from book publishers, TV producers, top editors and tabloids.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Rfgkfw1tXR8XqPDh1AbFXWCD1Ks=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/02/08/1549589737918.png", "published_at": "2019-02-08"}
