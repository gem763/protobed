(Picture: ITV)\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions crowned Twist And Pulse the winner in a spectacular final, but not everyone was entirely on board with the decision.\n\nThe dancing duo \u2013 made up of best friends Ashley Glazebrook and Glen Murphy \u2013 managed to win over some stiff competition in the likes of Stavros Flatley and sand artist Kseniya Simonova.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only highlights either, with Alexa Lauenburger and her dancing dogs proving a highlight, while Bello and Annaliese Nock provided another masterclass daredevil routine.\n\nUnlike the traditional Britain\u2019s Got Talent show, the winner was decided by votes from superfans in the audience, instead of the viewing public.\n\nStavros Flatley lost out to Twist And Pulse (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\nAs Twist And Pulse were announced as the winner, some viewers weren\u2019t exactly supporting the superfans in their decision.\n\nKsenyia or Alexa should have won. Their talent was in another league. Superfans suck. #BGT \u2014 Kel\ud83c\udf08 (@Kel_elizabeth) October 5, 2019\n\nWhat a disappointment! Wanted the dancing dogs to win! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Well their my winners anyway!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\udc36 #BGTChampions #BGT #BGTTheChampions \u2014 Carly Marie \ud83d\udc51 (@xcarly_mariex) October 5, 2019\n\nIf #BGTChampions was voted for by us viewers, then the finalists and the winner would of been different.\n\nSo so different! The whole thing was a bit of a disappointment for me tbh just my opinion! #BGTTheChampions #BGT \u2014 Vicki \u2b50\ufe0f (@x__Vickii__x) October 5, 2019\n\nWho tf are these 'superfans'? They clearly arent superfans when they get it so wrong every time, should have been a public vote, they ruined the show #BGTTheChampions #BGT \u2014 Nameless (@8um8njdHg4SSaqc) October 5, 2019\n\nWhat an Absolute Joke !! ' Superfans ' aka a bunch of clueless social media teeny boppers. Doc Act and Sand Lady not to even \u2026 Clearly this just shows \u2026 Our Nation has lost any ability to make any sort of sane decision #BGTChampions#BGT \u2014 Sully (@Sulsters_inc) October 5, 2019\n\nWho are these super fans on @BGT the champions??!? Because the German girl with the dogs was the clear winner but didn\u2019t even get in the top 3, but the sand woman did, this country in imploding \ud83d\ude44#BGTChampions #BGTTheChampions #BGT \u2014 Normal Life ? \ud83d\udc7e\ud83d\ude37 (@NormalLife7) October 5, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were some happy citizens though.\n\nTwist and Pulse are hands down my favourite dance act on #BGT so glad they finally won! \ud83d\udca5 \u2014 Eleanor Prince (@ElJPrince) October 5, 2019\n\nSpeaking on the show after their win, Glen said: \u2018I am absolutely speechless, I can\u2019t thank you guys enough. I\u2019m holding back everything right now!\u2019\n\nAshley said: \u2018Literally feel amazing. I\u2019ve said it before, things like this don\u2019t happen to me and my best friend Glen, so we\u2019d just like to say thank you so much!\n\n\u2018This means the world to us, honestly.\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions is available on ITV Player.\n\nMORE: When were Britain\u2019s Got Talent: The Champions winners Twist and Pulse first on the show?\n\nMORE: Britain\u2019s Got Talent\u2019s Simon Cowell dancing to Stavros Flatley in Champions final is a total mood", "description": "Some viewers aren't happy with the superfan votes on the final of Britain's Got Talent: The Champions.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/erwerwrwe-e16a_1570314440.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
