The new Galaxy Note 10 comes with a unique version of Your Phone, dubbed \u201cLink to PC,\u201d built into the handset that went on sale last week. Your Phone has not been working on the Note 10 and other devices for at least 12 hours today, before Microsoft confirmed it was able to restore access to the service.\n\nWhen Your Phone does work, it allows Android users to mirror their phone screens to a Windows 10 PC, alongside text messages, photos, and notifications. The screen mirroring is the most impressive part, as you can fully control a Note 10 from the Your Phone app and launch and run Android apps. Microsoft is expected to bring this same screen mirroring functionality to more handsets in the coming months, but right now it\u2019s exclusive to the Galaxy Note 10.\n\nUpdate, August 27th 3:30AM ET: Microsoft has now resolved the Your Phone outage after a 14-hour outage.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s new Your Phone service lets you mirror an Android phone to a Windows 10 PC, but it\u2019s experiencing issues.
