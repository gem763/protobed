However, just because a view is universally held doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is correct.\n\nFor example, I remember my days as a sell side analyst where peak oil supply was considered inevitable, creating near euphoric conditions in the sector as capital readily flowed searching for that last barrel. At one point it got so bad that junior explorecos with nothing but cash on their balance sheet (known as a blind pool) were being spun out of income trusts and being given a multiple on that cash by analysts.\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, there are similar signs.\n\nTake cannabis stocks, which have been trading at ridiculous multiples despite having few if any underlying assets or profit to speak of. I recall being pitched on a private company last year issuing equity at a $400 million valuation with an underlying land asset probably worth only $5 to $10 million that just 6 months earlier had raised equity to insiders at a $20-million valuation. When I asked how they were going to fill in that $380-million air pocket, I was told \u201cacquisitions.\u201d\n\nWhile professional investment managers tend to do a good job of avoiding these speculative areas of the market, they too are not immune to groupthink. Today, many are crowding into the segments of the market that are based on the global disinflationary theme of falling interest rates and contracting global economic growth.\n\nThis shift is evident by the latest Global Fund Manager Survey by BofA Merrill Lynch which is currently showing a massive overweight position into defensive sectors and concurrently those benefiting from falling interest rates. For example, the Capped Consumer Staples index, Capped REIT index and Capped Utilities index are up 24 per cent, 18 per cent and 17 per cent over the past 12-months, respectively and are all setting new all-time highs.\n\nAt the same time those areas that depend on a strong global economy such as energy and emerging markets have been heavily sold down by money managers to lows approaching a two-standard-deviation event.\n\nThe MSCI emerging market index has only returned one third of the S&P 500\u2019s return over the past 12-months, while energy stocks have been destroyed with the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index selling off a whopping 49 per cent in the past 12-months.\n\nHere in Canada, those with sensitivities to interest rates such as Canadian preferred shares have also been pummelled with the Horizons Active Floating Rate Preferred ETF (HFP) and the iShares S&P/TSX Canadian Preferred Share ETF (CPD) down 20 per cent and 15 per cent respectively in the past 12-months and testing new all-time lows.\n\nOverall, from a bigger picture, fund managers have reduced equity positions, increased fixed income slightly while taking cash levels to near historical highs. There is no doubt a lot of fear out there about the state of the global economy and this is playing out in how investors are positioned, with everyone finding safety in cash at the same time.\n\nWhile many are complaining about the lack of opportunities, those brave enough to take a contrarian stance might just be rewarded. Rebalancing by trimming back from those areas setting new highs into those areas heavily oversold isn\u2019t usually enough to qualify one as contrarian, but in these markets it can be an effective move. At the very least, you\u2019ll be acting like a good, old-fashioned portfolio manager avoiding groupthink by taking a balanced approach to investing.\n\nMartin Pelletier, CFA is a Portfolio Manager and OCIO at TriVest Wealth Counsel Ltd, a Calgary-based private client and institutional investment firm specializing in discretionary risk-managed portfolios as well as investment audit and oversight services.", "description": "Martin Pelletier: There is a lot of fear about the state of the global economy and this is playing out with everyone finding safety in cash at the same time", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/money-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
