A struggle ensued which left Matsuoka\u2019s face injured.\n\nSato confessed to the crime when he was finally arrested on September 17, 16 days after the assault. Admitting he was an obsessive fan (\u201csasaeng\u201d in Japanese), he explained how he had tracked her down using the photo. He even figured out which apartment was hers by analyzing the direction of the light and the type of curtains in the picture, he said.\n\nSato was indicted for the crime on Tuesday.\n\nAlso on rt.com 33 killed after man sets Kyoto anime studio on fire (VIDEO)\n\nLike this story?
