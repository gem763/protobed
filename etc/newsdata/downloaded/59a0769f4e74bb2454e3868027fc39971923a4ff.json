There is no cooling off. You are jumped on very quickly.\"\n\nMs Gallagher said that following the recording, Mr Dymond was \"put in a homeward-bound taxi within two hours of telling a researcher that he was really upset and that 'life was nothing without Jane' and said 'I wish I was dead', or words to that effect\".\n\nShe claimed the family had seen \"no evidence\" that Mr Dymond was given any welfare checks by any qualified mental health staff.\n\n\"We presume this was left to a medically unqualified researcher,\" Ms Gallagher, of Doughty Street Chambers, said.\n\nMr Dymond's death came amid growing scrutiny over the duty of care reality TV shows have to participants.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMs Gallagher said the family has now requested internal ITV interview notes from Jeremy Kyle, the assistant producer, a researcher, and the aftercare and polygraph teams.\n\nThey have also asked for the unedited recording of the show, which ITV's barrister, Simon Antrobus, agreed to provide.\n\nMr Antrobus told the inquest that the aftercare team had seen Mr Dymond.\n\nThe full inquest had been due to take place on November 21, but Ms Gallagher successfully contested it should be adjourned.\n\n(Image: Darren Cool)\n\nShe said the family had been declined legal aid and that their legal team was the only one without funding - an issue which they would be challenging.\n\nAt the opening of Mr Dymond's inquest in May, detective sergeant Marcus Mills, of Hampshire Police, said his death was a suspected suicide.\n\nA further inquest review is due to take place on November 21, while the full inquest is scheduled to begin on April 27 2020, and last four days.\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free phoneline open every hour of the day on 116 123.
