But critics argue that climate change defence should not be a business model\n\n\u201cThe island is going to be placed where the British empire\u2019s fleet once was,\u201d says Anne Skovbro, looking out from her office in a 19th-century customs house over Copenhagen\u2019s harbour.\n\nShe points out the mooring posts where tall ships once docked, the old masting crane that marked the harbour\u2019s outer edge, and the patch of sea where Horatio Nelson is supposed to have held a telescope to his blind eye as his ships set the city\u2019s medieval centre ablaze.\n\nArtist\u2019s image of how Lynetteholm will be positioned in Copenhagen harbour. Photograph: Danish Ministry of Transport and Housing\n\n\u201cFrom defending ourselves from the British, we now have to defend ourselves from the water,\u201d says Skovbro, clearly relishing her role as urban planner leading the development of Copenhagen\u2019s harbour.\n\nThe planned island to which she is referring, Lynetteholm, is perhaps the most developed expression of an idea that is spreading across the world: protecting cities from rising seas by reclaiming land \u2013 and paying for it by selling the new land off.\n\nThe island, more accurately described as a peninsula, will stretch across the mouth of Copenhagen\u2019s harbour entrance, leaving only a channel for ferries and cruise ships that could be closed off in cases of storm surges.\n\nThe reason the idea works (and the reason it can\u2019t be repeated in many other cities) is that the harbour is formed by a narrowish channel between the island of Amager and the mainland. There is already flood protection along the inner coast of Amager, and the southern entry to the harbour is narrow and easy to close off. The \u00d6resund Strait also has a very small tidal range.\n\nThe island and sluice should therefore protect against storm surges for decades. Once the sea level rises to the height of the waterfront in the inner harbour, the sluice would need to be replaced by a lock system.\n\nAs well as hopefully obviating the need for grim concrete sea walls like those erected around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, new islands like these mean new real estate. In Copenhagen the rim of the island facing out to sea will have a soft edge for beaches, parks and wetlands; then, beyond a high protective mound, there will be space for 35,000 houses and a similar number of workplaces.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artist\u2019s image of how Lynetteholm will look. Photograph: Danish Ministry of Transport and Housing\n\nWhen the project was announced a year ago, Denmark\u2019s then housing minister, Ole Birk Olesen, boasted that the protection from sea-level rise would come for free.\n\n\u201cIt will cost around zero kroner,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe will receive payment for disposing of the waste earth. In addition, we will get a free island which we can sell the land from. Selling the land will then finance a sea tunnel.\u201d\n\nSince the island expanded from 190 hectares (470 acres) to 282 this August, the financial case has become stronger still. Whereas building a sea dyke to protect Copenhagen would have cost 750m Danish kroner (\u00a387m), the city government estimates that building the island could yield a profit of 2.7bn kroner, simply from selling the earth.\n\nSea change\n\nThe idea that protecting against climate change could actually be profitable has motivated many other cities to explore similar ideas. Just down the Copenhagen harbour at the Danish Architecture Centre, Bjarke Ingels Group is exhibiting its bold vision of a reimagined New York City coastline.\n\nLaid out on tabletops is a model of Manhattan, its waterfront embellished with new parks and solar-powered high-rise buildings. Monitors flash images of devastation from Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\u201cWe are basically proposing to expand Manhattan a little bit into the Hudson River and make a few new neighbourhoods that are going to create so much value that we can actually finance the parks on the waterfront,\u201d Ingels told the Venice Biennale last year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seawater floods the entrance to the Brooklyn battery tunnel during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Photograph: John Minchillo/AP\n\nThe idea was backed in March by New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who announced $10bn for expanding the coastline as far as 150 metres. \u201cIf there\u2019s not federal money in play, we have to get some private money into it, and there has to be some development,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, faced with the estimated S$100bn (\u00a358bn) cost of combating rising sea levels over the coming century, proposed to reclaim a chain of new islands along the city state\u2019s south-east coast, or else construct a series of Dutch-style polders.\n\n\u201cYou not only protect existing low-lying areas, but you extend out and create more land reclaimed from the sea, which we can use for housing and other valuable purposes,\u201d he said in his annual speech to the nation, arguing that the new land would help offset the expense.\n\nJakarta has also floated a new scheme to protect itself from rising waters, a particularly urgent requirement given that the Indonesian capital is also physically sinking. The plan is a less ambitious version of the much-criticised Great Garuda project: the city would reclaim no less than 2,000 hectares of land along the coast, and sell it to help pay to build a 20km sea dyke at an estimated cost of $18bn (\u00a314bn). With 40% of the city already below sea level, and some areas sinking by 25cm a year, there\u2019s little time for delay.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boys swim in floodwater on the land side of a recently built seawall in Jakarta, Indonesia.

When the Rijnland water board constructed a sea dyke along the coast of Katwijk in 2013, it combined the project with an underground car park for 650 cars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only a dyke, it\u2019s a dune that creates a nice ecosystem, it\u2019s great for tourism and it\u2019s the first dyke on earth that actually generates revenues, because it sells parking tickets,\u201d Piet Dircke of Arcadis, the engineering firm that worked on the project.\n\nNot everyone is convinced, however. Ahmed Aboutaleb, the mayor of Rotterdam, a city widely considered one of the leaders in climate mitigation, just shakes his head.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he says. \u201cSafety and security is not a business model.\u201d\n\nIn the Netherlands, he asserts, no one resents paying taxes towards protection from the sea.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Maeslant surge barrier in Rotterdam. Photograph: Rob Doolaard/EPA\n\n\u201cI think the national investment in reinforcing dykes and levees is now \u20ac1bn [\u00a3860,000] a year, and it happens in the parliament without a debate \u2013 with a hammer.\u201d\n\nHenk Ovink, the Dutch government\u2019s special envoy for international water affairs, is also wary of the idea that cities can get their climate defences for free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always a little bit careful, because all of a sudden everything has to have a business case, and you don\u2019t need any taxpayer dollar at all,\u201d he says.\n\nOvink, a globetrotting salesman promoting Dutch water expertise, is an evangelist for publicly funding flood defences, as the Dutch have done since at least the 13th century when farmers grouped together to form the first waterschappen (water boards).\n\n\u2018No life or body\u2019\n\nSimilar criticism has been levelled at Copenhagen\u2019s plans, with some architects complaining the idea is about little more than generating revenues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an engineering project, it has no life or body, it\u2019s simply a study in how you can earn money,\u201d says Eva Sara Rasmussen, founder of NaTour, a climate-focused landscape architecture and urban planning firm. \u201cThis proposal has not been touched by either God or nature, or by any kind of aesthetic person.\u201d\n\nEarlier proposals had a hard coastline facing the sea and beaches on the sheltered side, something water specialists pointed out repeated mistakes made in land reclamation projects in Dubai and elsewhere.\n\nIllustration of Lynetteholm in Copenhagen harbour. Photograph: Danish Ministry of Transport and Housing\n\n\u201cThe beaches need to be facing the waves. It\u2019s the waves or the currents which determine whether it will be a nice beach or not,\u201d says Jacob H\u00f8st-Madsen, chief operating officer of DHI, the Danish water engineering firm now hired to work on the project.\n\n\u201cIf you look at The World or The Palm [uncompleted artificial island projects off the coast of Dubai], and see what was supposed to be beaches and nice waters, you will see that it\u2019s smelly and not something you would like to touch.\u201d\n\nThe new plans are expected to work with nature, for example ensuring eel grass grows in the shallows. However, with part of Lynetteholm sitting far out in a deep 16-metre channel, gentle sloping coastlines and attractive beaches or wetlands will be difficult to achieve, if not impossible, Rasmussen argues.\n\nSkovbro has little time for the critics. If the city didn\u2019t build an island, it would have to build an ugly dyke, she argues.\n\n\u201cIf the water comes in here, it floods everything,\u201d she says, sweeping her hand over a map of Copenhagen\u2019s inner harbour and its landmark buildings: \u201cThe queen. The parliament. Everything.\u201d\n\nThe geography of Copenhagen has always been formed by its defences, she says, pointing to the informal enclave of Christiania, the Tivoli Gardens and the Citadel, all of which began as a single ring of fortifications. After Nelson burned much of the city\u2019s medieval centre, the Danish parliament funded a second, outer ring.\n\nNow, she says, it\u2019s time for a third.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make a new ring, a flood protection ring,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Danish, we call it a klimaring: a climate ring.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Some coastal cities are reclaiming land as a barrier against rising water \u2013 then selling it off.
