Lou Correa (D-Calif.) said he was concerned about domestic terrorists traveling to Ukraine for training, \u201cand coming back to do God knows what.\u201d Ukraine has a number of paramilitary groups that have drawn the attention of American extremists, according to U.S. counterterrorism experts.\n\nAD\n\nWray responded, \u201cI think you\u2019re onto a trend that we\u2019re watching very carefully. . . . We are starting to see racially motivated violent extremists connecting with like-minded individuals online certainly, and in some instances, we have seen people travel overseas to train.\u201d\n\nLast month, the FBI arrested an Army soldier who had hoped to join a Ukraine militia, following the example of a former U.S. military soldier who had done so.\n\nAD\n\nWray said that U.S. violent extremists still, by and large, lack organizational structure and direction, but that there are now individual terrorism suspects who travel overseas to get training \u2014 behavior similar to Americans inspired by the Islamic State or other groups.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some connection between U.S.-based neo-Nazis and overseas analogues,\u201d Wray said. \u201cProbably a more prevalent phenomenon that we see right now is racially motivated violent extremists who are inspired by what they see overseas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe cited the attack in March on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not working together, but they\u2019re just fueled by each other,\u201d Wray said. For years, the FBI has generally described far-right or racist violent extremists as \u201cdomestic terrorism,\u201d and violent extremists inspired by Islamist militant groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State as \u201cinternational terrorism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWray\u2019s remarks suggest those sort of distinctions are fading, as would-be Nazis and would-be Islamist extremists increasingly behave in similar fashion \u2014 relying on global networks of ideology, rather than operational command.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved into this world where you have terrorists, including domestic terrorists, who aren\u2019t really that organized,\u201d Wray said. \u201cA lot of times they\u2019re communicating with each other in a more informal way online or in some other way inspiring each other. . . . It\u2019s more diffuse and unstructured and undisciplined.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat lack of structure, the FBI director said, \u201cmakes it more challenging, for example, to get human sources or undercovers inserted. If there\u2019s no organization to insert somebody into, that\u2019s a challenge, so that\u2019s part of the different nature of the threat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the past budget year, the number of arrests for both categories was similar: 107 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects, compared with 121 international terrorism arrests. Many of the domestic terrorism arrests are done by state and local law enforcement for guns, drugs or other charges, often because of differences in how federal terrorism laws are applied to individuals inspired by foreign terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, and individuals inspired by domestic terrorists such as the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe FBI has been criticized by some Democrats for not focusing more on domestic terrorists, with lawmakers questioning whether the nation\u2019s premier law enforcement agency has devoted too many resources to Islamist-inspired extremists. Wray and other FBI officials insist they are constantly evaluating threat levels and adjusting personnel accordingly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe number hasn\u2019t dramatically changed, but it\u2019s been troublingly consistent,\u201d Wray said. \u201cCertainly the most lethality in terms of terrorism attacks in recent years here in the homeland has been on the domestic terrorism side.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) pressed U.S. counterterrorism officials at the hearing to say whether they could more effectively fight domestic terrorism if extremist militias in Ukraine were branded foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nWray and the other officials at the hearing demurred, saying that decision was the up to the State Department.\n\nIn a recent case, the FBI arrested a soldier in Kansas and charged him with sharing bombmaking recipes with people he met on Facebook. Prosecutors said he was mentored by a former Army soldier who had gone to fight alongside an extremist group in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nInvestigators say Pfc. Jarrett William Smith, 24, had talked about joining a far-right Ukrainian paramilitary group in 2016 but ended up joining the U.S. Army instead.\n\nAD\n\nSmith has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAccording to court papers, Smith was mentored by ex-Army soldier, Craig Lang, about traveling to fight in Ukraine.\n\nLang was arrested in Ukraine after U.S. authorities charged him and another man with the killing of a Florida couple in 2018, allegedly to rob them for money to finance their travel overseas to engage in more extremist violence.\n\nLang\u2019s journey to Ukraine followed his dishonorable discharge from the Army. In 2016, he allegedly joined the Right Sector, a far-right Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary group dedicated to battling Russian separatists on eastern Ukrainian soil. A year later, he returned to the United States, where he and another former soldier, authorities say, killed the Florida couple in a church parking lot.\n\nHis Ukrainian girlfriend\u2019s uncle, Ihor Skritsky, told Radio Free Europe last month that Lang \u201cdenies any involvement.\u201d\n\nThe United States is seeking Lang\u2019s extradition.\n\nAD", "description": "Christopher A.
