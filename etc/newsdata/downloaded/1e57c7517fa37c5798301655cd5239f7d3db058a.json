This nasty, petty, egotistical, womanizing, isolationist Michigan Senator from 1928 to 1951 did good: His conversion to interventionism helped ennoble American politics and win the Cold War.\n\nJohnny-one-note historians, who reduce history to punchlines, claim Vandenberg\u2019s isolationism ended when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. But Vandenberg delivered his interventionist manifesto, which was so revolutionary it was called the \u201cspeech heard round the world,\u201d three years later on Jan. 10, 1945. That day, this foe of Franklin Roosevelt endorsed Roosevelt\u2019s foreign policy; this zealot for Congressional prerogatives supported expanding presidential power; and this isolationist endorsed America\u2019s participation in the United Nations. \u201cWorld War II has put the gory science of mass murder into new and sinister perspective,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cOur oceans have ceased to be moats which automatically protect our ramparts.\u201d Facing such threats, he said: \u201cThe commander in chief should have instant power to act.\u201d\n\nBorn poor in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1884, Vandenberg became a millionaire publisher of the Grand Rapids Herald. He gained the inside track to incumbency by being appointed to complete a Senate term in 1928, then won three subsequent campaigns. In the 1930s, he was a rare effective Republican opposition voice in Washington. He combatted Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal domestic policy as too expansive, expensive, and centralized. In 1934, he and Senator Joseph Nye condemned America\u2019s participation the Great War as a great betrayal, a scam.", "description": "Arthur Vandenburg was a piece of work in his personal life, but on the public stage, he evolved to became one of the greatest bipartisan forces in the arena of foreign policy.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1491847186/articles/2017/03/04/when-nasty-men-make-great-statesmen/20170302-troy-vandenburg-tease_ecdvsm", "published_at": "2017-03-04"}
