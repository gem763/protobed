He was pushed and during his approach to the conference had a woman shouting \"shame\" at him.\n\n\"I'm just very confused by people having too much time off,\" Mr McGown said. \"I'm just in attendance at the conference because my company is involved in major projects that can help the country move forward.\"\n\nThe activists faced off against police, who said they were forced to arrest more than 40 people who were blocking disabled and wheelchair access to the building and refusing to move on.\n\nA young climate protester was taken to hospital after being injured by a police horse during the volatile blockade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo people were arrested for animal cruelty after assaulting a police horse.\n\nCamila Serra, 23, was taken to the Alfred Hospital in a stable condition after suffering a leg injury during the protest at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nAnother protester said he saw her fall backwards after being struck by the horse.\n\n\"The horses shouldn't be here as they get extremely nervous and have hurt a woman,\" Callum, who did not want to give his surname, said.\n\nTensions increased each time delegates tried to enter the conference. Some attendees turned away when confronted.\n\nProtesters estimate more than 45 people were arrested.\n\nRohan, a legal guide from the protest, said: \"Most of the people arrested have been released with summary offences.''\n\nFour police officers suffered injuries including a dislocated finger and minor head injuries. Some were taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficers used capsicum spray to subdue protesters and were seen placing people in headlocks and pushing them to the ground. Footage showed one woman being pulled by her hair.\n\nProtest organiser Emma Black said: \"Police have been incredibly aggressive but that isn't unexpected. There's a lack of communication on their side.\n\n\"I, for instance, have been hit by a baton.\"\n\nFour police officers suffered injuries including a dislocated finger and minor head injuries.\n\nMs Black said protesters would continue to disrupt the conference despite the violence.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon the group was to be joined by Victorian Greens leader Samantha Ratnam, and federal Greens MP Adam Bandt will attend on Wednesday.\n\nConference organisers say the protest action is based on misconceptions about the mining industry.\n\nThey say the conference will consider the importance of battery minerals, used in the emerging electric car market, and the growing importance of ethical investment for resource companies, they said.\n\nPremier Daniel Andrews said protesting was a democratic right but that violence was not acceptable.\n\n\"That's a difficult balance sometimes, but I'm confident Victoria Police can find that balance,\" he told reporters.\n\n- with AAP", "description": "Newcrest's Ian Kemish says demonstrators are ignorant of the industry's sustainability practices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2558%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_95%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a3c8364230ddeb31f62dce6a66171b4e69f3970f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
