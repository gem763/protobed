We're seeing more and more of them initiated into political activism against China.\"", "description": "Hong Kong protesters determined to press home their demands as Beijing celebrates 70 years of the People's Republic.", "authors": ["Violet Law"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/73b60a852163461b8bbe9e906bb9be96_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
