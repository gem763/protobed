He reached two years sober during camp.\n\nThrough five games this season, Waller has 37 catches for 359 yards -- both far and away his best marks in any season. Among NFL tight ends, he currently ranks second in receptions and sixth in receiving yards.\n\nHe entered this season with 18 catches for 178 yards and two touchdowns in 22 career games (four starts).\n\n\"I'm gonna give you all I got,\" Waller told Raider Nation in a video the team posted to Twitter on Wednesday night.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "From breakout TV star to breakout star on the field, Oakland Raiders tight end  Darren Waller is now breaking the bank.The fifth-year pro, who spent the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
