It is also giving Eskom bailouts to keep it afloat.", "description": "South Africa's state power firm Eskom said it will cut up to 2,000 megawatts of power from the national grid on Wednesday due to a shortage of generating capacity.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441399336&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0FL-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
