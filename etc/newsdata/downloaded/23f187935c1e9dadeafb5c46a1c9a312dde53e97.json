Jay Murray said.\n\nHe was taken to hospital in critical condition, and the family says he's on life support.\n\n\"I found him and he was lifeless, just laying there. I called 911 right away, I just got scared,\" the boy's uncle said. The family members aren't being named to protect the identity of the child.\n\nThe family believe the toddler was stabbed in the neck while he was sleeping. The family alleges the child's mother and her ex-boyfriend were away from the home when they got into a fight and he assaulted her. They allege he returned to the home and stabbed the boy in his bed. The allegations haven't been proven in court, and no charges have been laid.\n\n\"When I close my eyes, that's all I see,\" the boy's aunt said.\n\nThis is the third violent incident involving a child under 15 in Winnipeg in a matter of days, and the second involving a toddler. A 14-year-old girl was stabbed and killed on Saturday. Hours later, a baby was one of four people shot in a targeted shotgun attack.\n\nNeighbours say the community sees a lot of violence, but they've never heard of a child being caught up in it in this way. (Gary Solilak/CBC)\n\nWhen CBC News spoke to the family Wednesday afternoon, the boy had already received two blood transfusions and was still in critical condition.\n\n\"That's my son's friend \u2014 they're close, they love each other,\" his uncle added.\n\nMurray said no one is in custody at this point, and police believe the assailant is known to the family of the boy.\n\nAngel Thomas, a neighbour and longtime resident of the North End, told CBC News a commotion and some screams could be heard Wednesday morning.\n\nThomas said it was shocking to learn that a three-year-old was hurt.\n\n\"[I feel] guilty, like I could've done something, but I couldn't,\" Thomas said. \"I've been in this community for a long time, and now I don't want to be here.\"\n\nWill Proulx, a father of two who lives down the block, said he was \"heartbroken and overwhelmed\" to learn about the assault.\n\n\"To hear that a three-year-old just down the street is \u2014 wow.\u2026 My chest is actually pounding right now to hear that.\"\n\nViolent crimes involving children\n\nAn 18-year-old woman was also stabbed but survived the attacked that killed the 14-year-old girl on Saturday.\n\nA 14-year-old girl died after being stabbed at a Halloween party in Winnipeg on Saturday night. (Travis Golby/CBC)\n\nThat incident happened at a Halloween party in the Tyndall Park neighbourhood, and two arrests have been made: a 16-year-old girl and 18-year-old woman are charged with second-degree murder and attempted murder.\n\nThe teen was one of three people who were victims of homicide that night, bringing the city's total for the year to 36.\n\nOn Sunday, a baby was among those taken to hospital after a daytime shotgun attack at a home on Flora Avenue.\n\nThe baby is expected to survive, but police said in a news release they couldn't provide an update on the infant's condition.\n\n\"It's very unusual for one of these incidents to happen, let alone three within a close proximity to each other,\" Murray said.\n\n\"I'm at a loss for words here in how to describe this.\"\n\nAnyone with information that could help with the investigation in the case of the assault on the three-year-old is asked to call the major crimes unit at 204-986-6219 or Crime Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).", "description": "The family of a three-year-old boy who was critically injured after an early morning assault in Winnipeg's North End say he's fighting for his life.", "authors": ["Rachel Bergen Is A Journalist For Cbc Manitoba", "Previously Reported For Cbc Saskatoon.
