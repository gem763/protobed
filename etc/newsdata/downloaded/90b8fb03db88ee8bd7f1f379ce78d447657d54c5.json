I\u2019m so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD. I urge you to hang on just a bit longer and ask for help if you need it. Because things can turn around. I promise. \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 10, 2019\n\n\"This month, 6 years ago, I tried to take my own life,\" she tweeted. \"I\u2019m so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD.\"\n\nFor those reading and possibly dealing with mental illness, Jamil added a note of hope.\n\n\"I urge you to hang on just a bit longer and ask for help if you need it. Because things can turn around. I promise,\" she added.\n\nEMDR -- known as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing -- is a type of psychotherapy that works to negate negative associations patients link to their trauma by tackling the emotions and symptoms rather than the trauma itself.\n\nJamil posted a screenshot of her tweet to her personal Instagram account and acknowledged that wealth and privilege can play a role in obtaining mental health treatment. However, she insists there are other options.\n\n\"Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to access affordable therapy. But if you can\u2019t, in the mean time, there are helplines ( @crisistextline @giveusashoutinsta ) and community groups online around the world and friends and family who might surprise you as to how supportive they can be,\" she explained.\n\nShe continued, \"It\u2019s not something you have to tolerate on your own. You have nothing to hide or be ashamed of. I feel you. I\u2019ve been there. And it\u2019s a process of radical self forgiveness, patience and care that will help you out. It feels like the pain, nightmares and exhaustion will never end sometimes, but they can. And they will.\"\n\nIt was a brave message that others in her social circles appreciated.\n\nSinger Dan Reynolds wrote, \"You are such a powerhouse we are lucky to have you in our world.\"\n\nA fan added, \"Proud of you, grateful for you, inspired by you.\"\n\nIf you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741-741.", "description": "Thursday was World Mental Health Day and Jameela Jamil opened up about her personal struggle with mental illness.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jameela-jamil-gty-ps-190325_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
