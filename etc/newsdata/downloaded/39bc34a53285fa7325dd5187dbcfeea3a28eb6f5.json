Recreational drug use.\n\nIt has been revealed that London does more coke than Berlin, Barcelona and Amsterdam combined \u2013 with 23kg consumed on a daily basis to the value of \u00a32.75million, according to a study by King\u2019s College London.\n\nI\u2019m shocked at how normalised we\u2019ve allowed this habit to become. People get up in arms about their sweet potatoes coming in plastic wrapping but then don\u2019t think twice about about snorting coke on the weekends.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to bash people for their moral inconsistencies but if you\u2019re an environmentalist fighting the good fight, you have to be tough on yourself.\n\nRecreational drug use isn\u2019t just a personal risk, it is contributing to the destruction of our planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Narco-deforestation\u2019 is devastating \u2013 throughout Central America, drug traffickers cut down rainforests to cultivate coca plants (which is used to make cocaine).\n\nThen there is a second wave of deforestation as the drug is hiked up in price and gives a juicy profit to those making it, who in turn buy bio-diverse forests and transform these into agricultural land \u2013 so they can make more cocaine.\n\nIn Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala alone, drug trafficking is responsible for up to 30 per cent of annual deforestation, a study in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed in 2017.\n\nThese numbers are terrifying and sickening in equal measure. Would you still take coke if you could see the rainforest fires burning every time you snorted a line?\n\nIt\u2019s an age-old adage but it\u2019s true: Fairtrade cocaine is not readily available. There is no organic, farmer\u2019s market, low carbon version of the drug. People who do coke and claim to be environmentalists are hypocrites, because they\u2019re engaging in one of the most environmentally-destructive activities there is \u2013 purely in the pursuit of hedonistic pleasure.\n\nI\u2019ve witnessed the ultimate irony \u2013 my coked-up climate change activist mates ranting at me about the state of the planet.\n\nThe argument in favour of recreational drug use usually runs along the same lines: \u2018I\u2019m taking a risk here. It\u2019s my health and my possible run-ins with the law\u2019.\n\nI can see why this is an attractive way to justify it, but you need to think about your actions in terms of their environmental impact \u2013 as with meat or flying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent Extinction Rebellion protests have helped put climate change into sharp focus, but it\u2019s always worth re-stating: drastic action is needed to halt the climate emergency. It\u2019s in the hands of individuals \u2013 mine and yours \u2013 not just government\u2019s or those of corporations.\n\nAll cocaine users, even just weekend warriors, have to take responsibility for the wider impact of their habit. Supply feeds demand, so you\u2019re a culprit regardless of how often you do it.\n\nWe all need to sacrifice personal pleasure in order to do our bit for the planet and cocaine use can\u2019t slip under the net.\n\nSwap out that juicy steak for a lentil curry, take the train down to Cornwall instead of flying to Ibiza, stop placing your midnight order. The fact it makes you feel good is not a good enough reason to ruin other people\u2019s futures.\n\nI\u2019ve witnessed the ultimate irony \u2013 my coked-up climate change activist mates ranting at me about the state of the planet. Actions speak louder than words. They\u2019re never going to convince anyone doing that, they\u2019re just going to feel like death the next morning.\n\nIt\u2019s all very well if you\u2019ve gone down to the protests and held a placard this week, but if you\u2019ve forgotten about it by Friday night and picked up a gram of coke, you\u2019ve not done your bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSet strong positive example and don\u2019t take cocaine.\n\nMORE: Boris Johnson, right now we \u2018crusties\u2019 are the most united thing in Westminster\n\nMORE: Extinction Rebellion needed to close London\u2019s roads to make our point\n\nMORE: I\u2019ve created a label to stop you from chucking good food away\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A study by King's College London University reveals that London does more cocaine than three other European cities combined.", "authors": ["Dan Burkitt", "Advertising Copywriter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89248138_1570795032.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
