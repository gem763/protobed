Members of the crew have been scratched or burned and I actually quit the show for a while because I thought \u201cwe are messing with things we shouldn\u2019t be, here\u201d.\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by how normal 30 East Drive looks\u2026 it\u2019s home to the world\u2019s most active poltergeist\n\nDespite being pretty fearless when it comes to facing ghosts head-on, Yvette admits she prefers to watch Mary Poppins rather than a horror film when she gets home.\n\nShe told us the scariest movie she had ever seen: \u2018The Exorcism of Emily Rose, I had to go watch a screening of it at the cinema and I swear I had to have a cup of hot sweet tea afterwards I was so scared! I usually like to watch Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks when I go home.\n\n\u2018Movies about the paranormal can mess with your mind, especially doing what I do for a living, and that one was based on a true story about Annaliese Michel and it was just terrifying, so I like to watch Mary Poppins instead!\u2019\n\nYvette has investigated some of the most haunted places in the UK (Picture: UKTV)\n\nYvette, who started off her career as a Blue Peter presenter in her teens, revealed she has also gained a legion of young fans who are interested in the paranormal, and will be hosting a special ghost hunt for kids this weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explained: \u2018I\u2019ve always loved working with children and if I hadn\u2019t gone into presenting Blue Peter I think I would have become a teacher instead.\n\n\u2018Parents were coming up to me saying that their children loved Most Haunted, and I was like \u201creally?\u201d, and then I came up with the idea for my children\u2019s book, Archie The Ghost Hunter, as well as starting ghost hunts for under 16s.\n\n\u2018I am looking forward to seeing the equipment we are going to be using this weekend and hopefully we will contact something in the bowels of the Argos store.\u2019\n\nYvette will be hosting a special Arghost: LEGO Ghost Hunting Live event inspired by LEGO\u2019s new Hidden Side toy range at Argos, Tottenham Court Road on Sunday, 27 October, where she will be entertaining attendees with ghost stories from the surrounding streets of London.
