So that\u2019s really the reason. I\u2019d rather someone think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s going to be in a wheelchair,\u2019 rather than that I\u2019m up in the minibar.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I am human.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Wellness, health and wellbeing tips Show all 6 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.
