(Felipe Trueba/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nGermany\u2019s far-right party made significant gains in elections in two of the country\u2019s eastern states on Sunday, according to preliminary results, but it failed to surpass establishment parties to gain the biggest portion of the vote, as some had predicted.\n\nBrandenburg, which surrounds the capital Berlin, and Saxony, on the country\u2019s eastern border with Poland and a stronghold of support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party, were voting to elect representatives for their state legislatures.\n\nAlthough preliminary results released early Monday showed a surge in support for the right-wing party, it came in second in both states.\n\nAngela Merkel\u2019s center-right Christian Democratic Union won 32.1 percent of the vote in Saxony; AfD took 27.5 percent. The Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democrats\u2019 center-left coalition partner in the national parliament, won 26.2 percent in Brandenburg; AfD took 23. 5 percent.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t as bad for Germany\u2019s traditional parties as they had feared, but still showed a significant shift to the far right, which drew out new voters in an election with greater-than-usual turnout. The drop in support could complicate their efforts to form a ruling coalition. The major parties having ruled out forming coalitions with the AfD.\n\n\u201cOne thing is clear from these results: The AfD came to stay,\u201d Andreas Kalbitz, the AfD leader in Brandenburg, said at an election party. In recent days he acknowledged attending a neo-Nazi rally in Greece more than a decade ago after a leaked report in Der Spiegel. He said he had done so out of \u201ccuriosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitics without us is no longer possible,\u201d he said. The party won a similar proportion of the vote in federal elections in 2017.\n\n[Germany\u2019s far right is set to challenge Angela Merkel\u2019s grip in upcoming elections]\n\nIt was the first vote for representatives in state-level parliaments in eastern Germany since Merkel opened Germany\u2019s doors to more than a million refugees, many of them fleeing the civil war in Syria. While many Germans approved the decision, it has also caused a backlash. Immigration has become a rallying point for the AfD.\n\n\u201cTake your country back,\u201d campaign banners read.\n\n\n\nThe party also has tapped into resentment among the people of the former East Germany, which still suffers from higher unemployment and lower wages and pensions than the West, about 30 years after the country\u2019s reunification.\n\nBut many of those voting said immigration was the most important issue for them.\n\nCottbus, Brandenburg\u2019s second-largest city, lies 80 miles southeast of Berlin, in the heart of Germany\u2019s coal region. At one polling site, a 50-year-old shop assistant and her husband said they cast their ballots for the AfD.\n\n\u201cWe want our country to be open to the world, but only for people who respect our culture and way of life,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing AfD doesn\u2019t mean being Nazi. We are not Nazis.\u201d\n\nThe couple declined to be named, saying they could be stigmatized for voting for the AfD.\n\nProfessor Hans Vorl\u00e4nder, director of the Mercator Forum for Migration and Democracy at the Dresden University of Technology, said the results were \u201cprimarily a win for the AfD, though they didn\u2019t reach their goal to become the strongest party.\u201d\n\nA Christian Democratic loss in Saxony could have threatened the position of Merkel\u2019s anointed successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, at the national level, he said.\n\n\n\nVorl\u00e4nder said the results didn\u2019t necessarily show support for the major parties, but could reflect voters casting their ballots for them in an attempt to block the AfD.\n\nMichael Keil, a 34-year-old business administration student voted for the Green Party, which made gains in Brandenburg and Saxony, despite traditionally struggling to sell its environmental message in a region that depends on coal and industry for jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to vote to counter the AfD,\u201d Keil said. He said people in the former East Germany have little experience of foreigners and \u201cthey just vote on fear.\u201d\n\n[Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte wins backing to form a new government \u2014 this time, without the far right]\n\nA majority in western Germany supported Merkel\u2019s decision to open the country to largely Middle Eastern refugees in 2015, but a majority in the east opposed it.\n\n\u201cWe have two party systems,\u201d Vorl\u00e4nder said. \u201cOne for the East and one for the West.\u201d\n\nThe left-wing Die Linke was previously the anti-establishment party in the East, he said, but now the AfD is filling that role. Exit polls showed Die Linke losing votes in Saxony and Brandenburg.\n\nDietmar Bartsch, a representative for the party in the national parliament, called the results an \u201cunprecedented disaster\u201d for his party.\n\nFor the regions\u2019 newest residents, it\u2019s a worrying trajectory. Sayed Walid, a 25-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan who has lived in Cottbus for three years, said the growth in support for the AfD was a concern.\n\n\u201cIf they win,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to people like us, what the future of the country will be, what the reaction of the people will be.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBritain\u2019s Johnson, Corbyn headed for ferocious Brexit showdown when Parliament returns Tuesday\n\nHungary\u2019s Orban hopes a rabbi can save his country\u2019s controversial new Holocaust museum\n\nA Belgian festival has long featured a \u2018savage\u2019 in blackface.
