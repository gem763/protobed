The 2019 total for what is known as NATO\u2019s common funding is $2.6 billion. The collective defense spending of NATO\u2019s 29 members, by comparison, is estimated at $1.04 trillion.\n\nThe White House did not confirm details of the proposal, which was unveiled formally Tuesday at a weekly meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels.\n\n\u201cThe United States has consistently called for and supported efforts to enhance burden sharing, which have resulted in over $100 billion in total new defense spending since 2016,\u201d a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because consultations among the NATO ambassadors are confidential. \u201cWe also support NATO Secretary General [Jens] Stoltenberg\u2019s proposal to adjust the way NATO allies\u2019 common funding contributions are calculated. We appreciate the work his office has put into developing this plan.\u201d\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUnder the U.S.-backed proposal, American contributions toward NATO\u2019s common funding would drop from 22.1 percent of the total to 15.9 percent, beginning in 2021, officials said.\n\nGermany would increase its share from 14.8 percent to 15.9 percent, matching the U.S. share and allowing both nations to point to a small area of agreement.\n\nNATO nations increase defense spending again amid criticism from Trump\n\nFor Germany, the tiny increase in administrative funding for NATO as a multilateral institution is likely to be more politically palatable than big increases in overall defense spending, said Jeff Rathke, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cIt is a natural fit for Germany to increase its contribution to NATO common funding as an expression of Germany\u2019s international security objectives and the priority it places on sustaining the NATO alliance,\u201d said Rathke, a former U.S. diplomat.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has presided over increases in German defense spending since 2014, despite domestic political opposition to increases that some of Merkel\u2019s opponents say should be spent on social services and other domestic priorities.\n\nGerman defense spending is expected to reach $54 billion this year, but the country still lags well behind a pledge among NATO nations to spend 2 percent of their individual gross domestic products on defense.\n\n\u201cThis was long discussed and was a proposal that came from the German side to get us off the hook for the funding increase,\u201d said Karl-Heinz Kamp, president of the German government\u2019s Federal Academy for Security Policy. The idea was to \u201cshow we are doing something in a demonstrative way that doesn\u2019t cost that much,\u201d he said, describing it as a \u201cpolitical\u201d move.\n\nGermany devoted 1.36 percent of its annual economic output, or GDP, toward defense this year, far short of the 2 percent spending goal. Merkel said last month that her country would reach 1.5 percent by 2024, the deadline that NATO leaders set to get to 2 percent. Germany would need to spend about $23 billion a year more on defense to meet its pledges.\n\nMerkel\u2019s political exit is a kind of vindication for Trump\n\nTrump and Merkel held what both described as a productive meeting last month at the Group of Seven summit in France, and although Trump said they had discussed defense, he skipped a chance to take Merkel to task in front of news cameras.\n\nBut as recently as June, Trump had complained bitterly about German defense spending and NATO participation, falsely telling Fox Business Network that \u201cwe pay for close to 100 percent of NATO.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pay for close to that because Germany doesn\u2019t pay what they\u2019re supposed to pay,\u201d Trump said, noting that only seven nations in the alliance meet their 2 percent commitment. \u201cI got them to pay last year $100 billion more,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cGermany\u2019s taking tremendous advantage,\u201d Trump added.\n\nAlliance members increased defense spending in 2018 for the fourth year in a row, highlighting a slow turnaround amid White House criticism.\n\nThe U.S. military is the juggernaut of the alliance, comprising 69 percent of overall defense spending, even though the U.S. economy forms less than half of the club\u2019s economic might.\n\nSome shifts in NATO common funding have been discussed for months, but the proposal sparked immediate frustration from France and Britain. Those nations, which may be asked to help make up the shortfall from the U.S. reduction, argued that the change would do little to address the broader issue of lagging defense spending in Europe, according to two diplomats familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a touchy alliance subject.\n\nNATO uses the size of countries\u2019 economies to divvy up responsibility for paying into the common budget. But the United States has already negotiated a cap on its contribution, meaning that the current U.S. share of the bill, about $576 million, is actually disproportionately low compared to other countries\u2019. The proposed change would save U.S. taxpayers about $163 million.\n\n\u201cThis is not what burden-sharing means,\u201d said one of the diplomats, who said that what Germany needed to do was speed up its defense spending increases, which would result in billions of dollars toward collective defense. The current proposal, the diplomat said, is \u201cplaying with the figures.\u201d\n\nThe discussion is expected to continue into the fall. If an agreement is reached, it would probably be announced at a December summit of NATO leaders in London.\n\nA NATO spokesman declined to comment on the substance of the discussions, saying that conversations at the gathering of ambassadors are classified.\n\nBirnbaum reported from Brussels.
