Just don't call it QE", "language": "en", "text": "The Fed's sin was that in the process of attempting to normalise its balance sheet, it allowed reserves to shrink $US1.4 trillion, which is half the $US2.8 trillion it held in 2014.\n\nAs hard as it is to believe, $US1.4 trillion ($2.1 trillion) is an inadequate amount. That was proved at the end of last quarter, when corporate tax payments, end of quarter funding pressures, and new US government bond issuance combined to suck cash out of the system, causing a spike in short term funding rates.\n\nFor investors attuned to the Fed buying government bonds as a key element of its many phases of quantitative easing, the central bank's return as an active buyer sparked the fin-twit punditry into action with claims of a 'mini-QE' or 'QE-lite'.\n\nIt's not. QE was built upon massive purchases of longer-dated US Treasuries, with the aim of suppressing long-term interest rates.\n\nThe Fed's as yet-to-be-detailed plan will focus on short-term securities to expand its balance sheet and provide it with a buffer to avoid the calendar-based funding chokepoint seen at the end of the last quarter.\n\nSo what could the Fed unveil at its next meeting on October 29-30? Some economists have suggested the Fed may need to add up to $US400 billion to its balance sheet.\n\nA widely cited Peterson Institute for International Economics analysis co-authored by Joseph Gagnon and DE Shaw director of global economics Brian Sack - who previously did all the Fed's bond buying for QE while at the New York Fed - claimed the central bank should build a buffer of $US250 billion over the next two quarters, and then grow its balance sheet in line with the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe need to address the balance sheet to ensure repo markets don't again run beyond the Fed's control is an added complication for Powell amid expectations US rates will be cut again.\n\nWhile jobless numbers remain low, the slide in US manufacturing activity - thanks to the trade war and strong US dollar - has led traders to price in an 81 per cent chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the October meeting.\n\nSo much for Powell's 'mid-cycle adjustment', the eyebrow raising phraseology he used to describe the first cut in a decade after the late July meeting. Three cuts in as many meetings isn't an adjustment - it looks more like an easing cycle.\n\nThe Fed has lagged other central banks that have been easing monetary policy more aggressively, leaving US rates as some of the highest in the world.\n\nThe Fed has hardly smothered itself in glory over the past three months. Some see it as behind the curve, the board is divided over the next step for monetary policy, it's been forced into a massive emergency intervention in the repo market, and now it needs to quickly fatten a balance sheet that it allowed to get too skinny.\n\nAnd then there is the not insignificant issue of the US President.\n\nPowell says the Fed remains data dependent but there is no escape from the gyre of economic, financial and political uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's trade war and impeachment process,\n\nUnfortunately for Powell, the Tweeter-in-Chief remains a big driver of the data. With low expectation trade talks with China set to restart this week, Powell best prepare for two sets of data: further signs of trade-related economic weakness, and the number of Twitter mentions of \"Fed\" and \"boneheads\".", "description": "The Federal Reserve's bond buying plan isn't quantitative easing but it's a tacit acknowledgement the US central bank got it wrong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4177%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/25ce0f805eb90c12fd44d3f9ca43af55a2a4e639", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
