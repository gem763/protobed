'Trends tend to not be something that we love 10 years down the road.'\n\nThe fashion-forward TV personality added that she loves that women are increasingly opting to have more than one dress.\n\n'They can't decide, they want to have two looks. The appropriate dress to walk down the aisle in and then something a little bit more fun that reflects their personality. Shorter dresses and jumpsuits are really in,' she said.\n\nLucky! The fashion stylist planned a wedding for Texas-based couple Bobbie Case-Akins and Alonzo Vallecillo, who were chosen as part of a competition run by GMA\n\nSo romantic! The couple said 'I do' in a gorgeous Punta Cana destination wedding\n\nAs well as fashion advice, Jessica offered plenty of tips to other couples prepping to host nuptials in far-flung locations, explaining that the most important thing to take into consideration is scheduling.\n\n'Plan ahead because that's when you will find the best travel deals, the best resort deals, and it's a courteous thing to do for your guests because ultimately they'll be taking time off work and you want them there,' she said on Good Morning America.\n\nJessica, who wed her husband Ben Mulroney in 2008, said that hosting a wedding abroad can 'definitely' be cheaper too.\n\nShe advised couples to look for package deals and all-inclusive resorts, in particular deals that come with the price of a wedding planner and alcohol included.\n\n'I know for my wedding the alcohol was a huge expense, but also the wedding planners, that all comes including in your package,' she laughed.\n\nWhen it comes to decoration, Jessica said that brides who are determined to import their favorite flowers should re-consider.\n\n'I've worked with many brides who want to import their favorite flower,' she said. 'There are so many tropical, beautiful flowers, it's less expensive and also they can withstand the climate.'\n\nAnother handy tip was to save money on the professional photographer for the after party by stocking the tables with plenty of disposable cameras, allowing guests to capture the memories.\n\nAll of these tips were put to the test when Jessica was tasked with planning a wedding for a Central Texas-based military couple.\n\nBobbie Case-Akins and Alonzo Vallecillo, who first eloped in a park while wearing jeans, were treated to their dream destination wedding in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, designed and planned by Jessica.\n\nAt work: The Canadian fashion stylist showed off her wedding planning skills, helping to set up the perfect ceremony for the happy couple\n\nBeach vibe: For Bobbie and Alonzo's ceremony, Jessica opted to have a lush green garland with lilac flowers representing Bobbie's favorite colors\n\nAmazing!

Noting that Bobbie's favorite color is purple, Jessica ensured that lilac petals were scattered down the aisle.\n\nFor Bobbie and Alonzo's wedding, Jessica took their desired aesthetic on board.\n\nFor the ceremony, she opted for a bohemian wooden altar with loosely-draped cream fabric and arrangements of greenery with lilac, blush and ivory florals. There were also gold geometric lanterns and wooden chairs with comfortable cream cushions for guests.\n\nFor the reception, guests dined on a signature 'Love on the Beach' cocktail, a mix of peach schnapps, vodka, orange juice, a splash of cranberry juice and an orange wedge garnish.
