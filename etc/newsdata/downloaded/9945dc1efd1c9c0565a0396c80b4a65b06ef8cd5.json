Ms Johns said they had since captured 70 per cent of gas supply, and exported it to offshore customers.\n\n\"This has triggered a dysfunctional domestic gas market and a tripling of gas prices in the east coast,'' she said.\n\nMs Johns said gas-based manufacturing contributed $38 billion to Australia's gross domestic product. The ''wealth transfer'' to gas exporters had already been about $1 billion.\n\nAustralian Energy Market Operator figures showed demand for domestic industrial gas in the last five years had decreased by about 15 per cent, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is industrial demand destruction and jobs,'' Ms Johns said.\n\nShe said gas and energy prices were much lower in the United States and that was why Australian companies including steelmaker BlueScope were making big investments in the US, like the $1 billion-plus expansion of the North Star steel mill in Ohio.\n\nShe also cited the closure of RemaPak, a 40-year-old family-owned manufacturing business in Sydney which went into administration in January after its energy costs ''skyrocketed'' more than fourfold in three years, leaving it unable to compete against importers.\n\nShe said that in May, high gas prices contributed to Dow Chemical\u2019s decision to close a plant in Melbourne.\n\nThree-pronged fix\n\nMs Johns proposed a three-pronged solution to fix the gas market.\n\nShe said the first step was ''the need for a trigger'' on the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism. \"Australian users shouldn\u2019t be subsidising LNG exporters building and operating their facilities,'' she said.\n\nShe said a ''fair price is LNG net back \u2013 minus invested capital and costs''.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second plank was a domestic gas reservation policy with a ''use it or lose it'' mechanism.\n\nThe third element was to ensure that both small and large gas users had ''fair and equitable'' access to pipeline transportation.\n\nStephen Bell, the chief executive of plastics maker Qenos, told the Summit that it seemed absurd for Australia to be talking about LNG import terminals when those boats carrying LNG were sailing past LNG export vessels from Australia.\n\n\"It's strategically stupid,'' Mr Bell said.\n\nGarbis Simonian, the managing director of Weston Aluminium, said it would make sense for the Narrabri gas project of Santos to get up and running quickly because it was relatively close to major population centres of Newcastle and Sydney.\n\n\"The advantage of Narrabri is it's close to markets,'' he said.", "description": "Jeanne Johns says the gas market is \"dysfunctional\" and a use-it-or-lose it policy is needed to stop gas companies banking future supply for LNG plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2667%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_89%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1858c28f4abb1005e0228a47f50fb3d382e59500", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
