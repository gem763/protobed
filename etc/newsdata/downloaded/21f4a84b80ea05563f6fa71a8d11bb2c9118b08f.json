The Melville Millionaire organization and Berk, thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers \u2014@Milshockey\n\nAdams said the player was scheduled to undergo a CT scan of his brain Monday because of the concussion symptoms.\n\nHe said Berkeliev is \"pretty banged up\" and his whole body is sore, but he said his goaltender \"sounded good\" and his \"spirits were high\" when the two spoke Monday morning.\n\nAdams said he was satisfied with the 25-game suspension, but was hoping it was going to be even longer.\n\n\"To me, that was the minimum that he should have got,\" he said. \"So I am pleased that this league did step forward and put a harsh suspension on the player.\"\n\nAdams said a new league discipline committee that the SJHL introduced in the off-season has done a \"real good job\" with suspensions so far.\n\n\"I think it just makes things clearer when there's three opinions instead of one,\" he said. \"And I think the percentage of getting the call right is greater with the three-person committee.\"\n\nAccording to SJHL President Bill Chow, who dealt with suspensions on his own prior to this season, the committee is made up of two people with officiating backgrounds and a third person with an extensive hockey background in Saskatchewan.\n\nChow said it was the committee that decided on the length of this suspension and it determined this wasn't a hockey play.\n\n\"He made no intention to play the puck,\" he said. \"He went strictly to play the body. And you got a goalie that's in a vulnerable position.\"\n\nGood job SJHL! You sent a message that that is not what this league is about. The safety of our goalies/players comes first. \u2014@Anne_Phair\n\nChow said it's the longest suspension that has been handed out in the SJHL during his nine years as president.\n\n\"As for previous to that, I don't know,\" he said. \"But I don't believe there's been one that long for quite a while.\"\n\nAdams said Berkeliev had played his way to being the Millionaires' starting goaltender this season after being the team's backup goalie last year.\n\n\"We just hope it doesn't put him back very long, because this could shake him up for the rest of the year,\" he said.\n\nAdams said there was currently no timetable for when Berkeliev might resume playing.", "description": "Yorkton Terriers forward Greg Mulhall has been suspended 25 games for a hit in a Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League game Saturday night that knocked out Melville Millionaires goaltender Berk Berkeliev.", "authors": ["Kelly Provost Is A Newsreader", "Reporter With Cbc News In Saskatoon.
