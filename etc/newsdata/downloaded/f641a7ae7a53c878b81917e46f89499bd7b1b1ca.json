However, she has since opened up about issues such as self doubt, dry skin and loneliness which are some of the pitfalls she has been experiencing with her pregnancy.\n\nShe even added that she sometimes worries herself with thoughts such as: \u201cWill I still be me when I\u2019m a mother? Will everything be ok? WILL MY KID BE A PRICK\u201d. (sic)\n\nSharing a picture of her baby bump with her followers, she wrote: \u2018Pregnancy is wild y\u2019all. Growing a person is a RIDE. Cellulite everywhere. Like, arse, arms, thighs, even my knees. It is VERY annoying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My skin refuses to retain moisture. We\u2019re talking a THICK serving of Eight Hour Cream all over my face every single night, and still waking up to a bone dry boat. HAIRY BELLY -The luscious locks I was promised refuse to appear. In fact my scalp feels so dry and tight it actually hurts. Again, nothing works to aid this.\n\n\u2018Random loud hiccups at any time of day. Following no pattern, and with no warning- the runs. Maybe 5 times a day, maybe once a week. WHO KNOWS. I\u2019m still taking naps. I NEVER nap.\n\nThe anxiety is real. Will I still be me when I\u2019m a mother? Will everything be ok? WILL MY KID BE A PRICK. Pregnancy is lonely. Oh, the headaches. The headaches.\u2019 (sic)\n\nHowever, while she has been sharing the honest rundown of how difficult pregnancy can be for an expectant mum, she has also shared the more positive aspects and added that she has so far managed to avoid other aspects which can be daunting.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019ve been lucky to avoid vomiting (literally only three times, and one was a truly horrific public experience but that is a hilarious story for another time). Heartburn/indigestion (I think the random hiccups is linked to this but I\u2019ll take them any day\n\n\u2018Constipation- shitting is better than not shitting in my opinion. My leg hair growth has slowed waaaay down. I\u2019ve been lucky to feel the kid for a while now. The kicks are awesome and very pronounced now. #futuredancer.\u2019 (sic)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer followers have praised her for her openness and have been sharing tips, advice and their own experiences in an in-depth discussion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "She is facing anxiety over the imminent birth of her baby.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_85430746_1571913770.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
