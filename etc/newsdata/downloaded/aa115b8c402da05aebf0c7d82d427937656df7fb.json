Tracy Jan explains what\u2019s missing in the conversation about criminal justice reform. And Jason Samenow forecasts the hurricanes of the future.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nSelf-inflicted controversies and squandered opportunities\n\nWhite House officials are touting the summer of 2019 as one of historic achievements for President Trump, offering up a list of more than two dozen accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as White House bureau chief Philip Rucker learned, many of the president\u2019s advisers and outside allies are bemoaning the summer, and what they consider to be a period of missed opportunity and self-sabotage in the final lull before the 2020 presidential vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was not strategic in using this time in trying to build for reelection and trying to broaden his appeal,\u201d Rucker says. \u201cInstead, it seems like everything he did this summer hardened people\u2019s views about him and made him a more polarizing figure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018What happens to people when they get out?\u2019\n\nAround 30 states have occupational licensing laws that make it difficult for formerly incarcerated people to enter or move up in fast-growing industries such as health care, human services and some mechanical trades.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include the very jobs they\u2019re trained for in prison and reentry programs. Reporter Tracy Jan spoke with a formerly incarcerated person wondering whether the country is ready to see him back in a middle-class job, as new legislative efforts to loosen licensing restrictions emerge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a second-class citizen,\u201d Jan says. \u201cYou are not part of mainstream society. And this is like a cross you\u2019re going to bear for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy we can expect more-intense hurricanes in the future\n\nThe Bahamas felt the full force of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s 185-mph winds and 23-foot storm surge this weekend, its largest island sitting in the eyewall of the Category 4 or 5 storm for more than a day.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it slowly makes its way up the East Coast, the deadly storm has those living near water concerned about what future hurricanes may look like, as water temperatures and sea levels rise worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHurricane Dorian is an example of the type of storm we might expect to see with more frequency as we head into the future,\u201d says climate reporter Jason Samenow . \u201cWe\u2019re more likely to see stronger, longer-lasting and more-intense hurricanes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Philip Rucker on what White House advisers and aides are really thinking as the summer winds down.
