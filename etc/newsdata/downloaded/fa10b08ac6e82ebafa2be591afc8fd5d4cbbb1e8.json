Right now, our greatest concern is that the disruption in economic activity in China/Asia will result in a \u201ccold\u201d in the US and other foreign markets.\n\nOur August 19th call for a potential US market breakdown was stalled because of recent news that China and the US would begin talks again attempting to resolve the trade issues. Yet, we know these talks may last many months with no real progress in terms of lifting tariffs or real concrete outcomes. We don\u2019t believe the US is going to remove tariffs or ease up on trade-related factors until we see real progress made by China. This would suggest we are in for a long-haul in terms of real relief in the markets.\n\nOur research team still stands behind our August 19th breakdown call. Our super-cycle research suggests that the US and global markets are poised for a price breakdown and we believe the recent news events have stalled this price move. Particularly, we point to the nearly -1100 point price drop on August 22 through 26, just days before the news that China was willing to engage in new talks with the US about trade. This move would have likely continued to break lower, as we predicted, had the Chinese not announced their intent to try to relieve pressures on the economy and the global economy.

That one statement changed the way the markets perceived the future. Global traders rotated to a perspective of \u201chey \u2013 maybe the Chinese are finally going to negotiate a solution\u201d. We believe this is a stall tactic while the Chinese attempt to work another angle to protect their markets/assets.\n\nHANG SENG INDEX WEEKLY CHART\n\nThe Hang Seng Index Weekly chart highlights the extreme weakness of price over the past 12+ week. A dramatic downturn from $30,000 to $25,725 has transpired and support near a previous trend channel is now acting as a final floor for price. Once this level is broken, we believe the Hang Seng Index could fall to $21,500 or much lower and set off a wave of corporate bankruptcies and bond defaults.\n\nCUSTOM SMART CASH INDEX WEEKLY CHART\n\nOur Custom Smart Cash Index Weekly chart is set up in a similar format. It shows that the peak in value near early 2018 was the true peak in economic activity and price valuation. Everything beyond that peak has resulted in weaker and more contracted price moves. This suggests global traders have already been pulling capital out of the markets in preparation for some type of price correction. It certainly does not align with the most recent \u201cnew price highs\u201d in 2019 for many of the US major Indexes.", "description": "Reading the news this weekend and watching the chaos in Hong Kong, one has to wonder how this violence and disruption in commerce is really affecting the Asian and global markets.
