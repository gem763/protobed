Don\u2019t ask me how, but my guardian football angel must have been sitting on my shoulder when I made my picks because I managed to pitch a perfect game, going 7-0 for a season record of 26-23. That still leaves me three games behind Ed, but at least I\u2019m back barely above the .500 mark as we enter the halfway point of the season. I only wish I could say the same for my Jets, but I\u2019ll have a little more on that at the end of the post.\n\nEd: I didn\u2019t pitch a perfecto, but I did manage to keep my head above water with a 4-3 mark in last week\u2019s picks. My season\u2019s at 29-20, still in good shape but always vulnerable to a bad week of picks. Sort of like the Steelers\u2019 offense \u2014 heeeyyyy-yooo!\n\nJazz: The Jets visit the Jacksonville Jaguars (1:00 pm, CBS) this week and the outlook is not brilliant. After an unexpected win against Dallas, they completely collapsed again last week against the Patriots, with our \u201cstar\u201d quarterback caught on mic saying he was seeing ghosts on the field. Meanwhile, the Jags\u2019 defense has gotten beaten up a bit, but they still have a pass rush\u2026 something we seem unable to stop. At all. Hate to do it but I\u2019ll predict the Jaguars over the Jets 24-13.\n\nThe Steelers host the Dolphins tomorrow night (Monday, 8:15 pm, ESPN) Granted, Miami hasn\u2019t won a game this year and are technically even worse than the Jets on paper. But without Big Ben, Pittsburgh hasn\u2019t exactly been burning up the track either. This could be the opening the Fins need to finally put up a W and\u2026 who am I kidding? Steelers over Dolphins 27-13.\n\nThe Vikings already played on Thursday, so let\u2019s check in on the Packers who visit the Chiefs at Kansas City in the late game tonight (8:20 pm, NBC). This should have been a fun game. The Chiefs are back on top in the AFC West while the Packers are similarly leading in the NFC North. But we recently learned that Kansas City\u2019s QB is out for the week with an injury while Aaron Rodgers is in top form again. Giving this one to the Packers over the Chiefs 34-17.\n\nEd: Steelers at home on Monday night against the Dolphins? That\u2019s about as easy a return as Mason Rudolph could hope for. Pittsburgh\u2019s offense is fifth from the bottom in YPG but they still score twice as many points per game than Miami. Miami gives up 15 more points per game than Pittsburgh, too. Steelers 35-17 over the Dolphins. There\u2019s a mid-range team trying to break out of the NY Jets, but it\u2019s not yet breaking through. This might be a better game than Jazz thinks, but I\u2019ll also pick Jags over Jets 23-17. If Patrick Mahomes was healthy, I\u2019d pick the Chiefs in KC even over the Green Bay team that finally arrived last week at home. Without Mahomes, the Chiefs are competent on offense, but the Pack\u2019s pretty good at holding opponents to lower scores, and they have Aaron Rodgers. I\u2019ll go with Jazz on all three spotlight games and pick The Pack over the Chiefs 31-23.\n\nJazz:\n\nBuccaneers at Titans (1:00 pm, FOX) \u2013 I only found this game interesting because the Titans may be in last place in the south, but that division is so knotted up right now that one or two wins could put anyone, including the Titans, into first place. They\u2019ll get their chance today with a win. Titans over Tampa Bay 27-20.\n\nI only found this game interesting because the Titans may be in last place in the south, but that division is so knotted up right now that one or two wins could put anyone, including the Titans, into first place.

In fact, if it weren\u2019t for the Patriots, their 5-1 record would have them up there respectably matched against almost anyone in the AFC. Meanwhile, the Eagles haven\u2019t been quite as consistent. That will change today, however. I\u2019m going with the upset and taking the Eagles over the Bills 17-12 in a defensive struggle.\n\nBuffalo has been on a bit of a tear.

Broncos at Colts (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 The Broncos looked a lot more promising at the beginning of the year, but now they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s another rebuilding season. The Colts have kept things exciting (probably too exciting for their fans) with a series of close games. They\u2019re still hanging on to first place in the AFC South and they\u2019ll get the job done again today with another close win. Colts over Broncos 24-21 .\n\nThe Broncos looked a lot more promising at the beginning of the year, but now they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s another rebuilding season.

Raiders at Texans (4:25 pm, CBS) \u2013 Houston is a five-point favorite here, though the Raiders have run up a very similar record in their own division. The defenses look fairly evenly matched, but Houston tends to put more points on the board every week so I\u2019ll just go with the favorite and take Texans over Raiders 31-21.\n\nEd:\n\nBuccaneers at Titans (1:00 pm, FOX) \u2013 Tampa Bay has been up and down this season, but that Titan defense has been stingy, coughing up only 16 points a game. Tampa Bay has the #1 rushing defense, though (68 YPG), and Tennessee\u2019s passing offense is sixth-worst in the league. I\u2019ll pick the upset here \u2014 Bucs over Titans 27-14 .\n\nTampa Bay has been up and down this season, but that Titan defense has been stingy, coughing up only 16 points a game.

Eagles at Bills (1:00 pm, FOX) \u2013 Buffalo has the third-ranked defense overall, fourth against the pass, and they\u2019re playing at home against an inconsistent Philly offense and defense. With Darren Sproles and DeSean Jackson both out and a bunch of injuries on defense, the Eagles will limp in and out of Buffalo.

Broncos at Colts (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 The Colts have been impressive at times, especially considering Andrew Luck\u2019s surprise retirement. They\u2019re mid-to-lower range on both sides of scrimmage, but they\u2019re playing at home against a team that\u2019s offense is even more disappointing. The home-field advantage will be the difference here. Colts 21-13 over the Broncos .\n\nThe Colts have been impressive at times, especially considering Andrew Luck\u2019s surprise retirement.

Raiders at Texans (4:25 pm, CBS) \u2013 Neither team started off last week impressively, but only one collapsed in the second half, and it wasn\u2019t the home team. Houston\u2019s better statistically on both sides of the line too. Texans 31-20 over the Raiders.\n\nBefore we get on to the games, I wanted to share one pet peeve that\u2019s been bugging me. At the beginning of last season, the Jets had Teddy Bridgewater on the roster. There were more than a few of us that suggested he should be kept around and perhaps even start while our new rookie, Sam Darnold, got his sea legs under him. It didn\u2019t happen. Bridgewater wound up in New Orleans while Darnold has been climbing an awfully slow learning curve (when he\u2019s not contracting mono).\n\nBridgewater wound up taking the starting QB position with the Saints. This season they are in first place with a 6-1 record. The Jets have won one game, and even that looked like a fluke.
