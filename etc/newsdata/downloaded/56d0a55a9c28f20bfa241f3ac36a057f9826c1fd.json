I guess that shows how ingrained it is in me to hear comments from cars and bow my head and accept that they're part of walking the streets alone. Thanks for your response, Alison.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with the BBC, Ms Broad said she had met with Ms Hernandez to discuss some of the common misconceptions surrounding street harassment and how it should be handled.\n\n\u201cIt really worried me that I experienced this on a regular basis,\u201d the freelance writer and social media manager said.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of attention quite rightly on upskirting and indecent exposure and committing sexual assaults, but what I experience and what most women and children experience on a more regular basis is street harassment.\n\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s catcalls, sexual language, none of it is acceptable.\u201d\n\nMs Hernandez told the broadcaster that she has also experienced catcalling, adding: \u201cI think there\u2019s a particular need to help educate women to make sure that they do reach out for help if it\u2019s really affecting their lives\u201d.\n\nThe police commissioner explained that more needs to be done in order to combat this kind of harassment, suggesting an app on which women could report incidents.\n\nRecalling another incident of catcalling, Ms Broad explained how a man rolled the window down from a passing car \u201cand described precisely how he was going to sexually assault [her]\u201d.\n\nShe said that \"having that playing on my mind every time I see a car and someone shouting, it\u2019s very difficult not to feel very threatened.\"\n\nAccording to children\u2019s charity Plan International UK, 66 per cent of girls and young women have been sexually harassed in public.", "description": "A woman who was catcalled on the street was advised by a police chief commissioner to report the incident to 999 if she felt\u00a0threatened.
