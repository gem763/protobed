However, the witnesses changed their stance toward the prospect of testifying and would now testify only in response to compulsory process under the U.S.-Ireland Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).\n\nThe four witnesses at BOI who were to join a trial in the case against the accused in custody, Mark Scott, were head of BOI\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering team Diane Sands, BOI foreign direct investment team member Deirdre Ceannt, former executive VP and relationship director Derek Collins, and Greg Begley.\n\nSince the case involves the Central Authority of Ireland, the Government submitted an MLAT request to the authority to convince the witnesses to testify through closed-circuit television.\n\nParties involved in the OneCoin crypto pyramid scheme\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Scott is accused of conspiracy to commit money laundering. From 2016 to 2018, Scott laundered almost $400 million in proceeds from OneCoin through a series of private equity funds in the British Virgin Islands with accounts at banks in the Cayman Islands, known as Fenero Funds.\n\nScott also had corporate bank accounts at BOI, through which he allegedly laundered over $300 million in OneCoin fraud proceeds.\n\nIn March, a U.S. District Attorney charged the founders of OneCoin, Konstantin Ignatov and his sister Ruja Ignatova with \u201cwire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering offenses,\u201d wherein they allegedly lured investors to contribute \u201cbillions of dollars in the fraudulent cryptocurrency.\u201d", "description": "Bank of Ireland executives have backed out of testifying before the U.S. Government in the criminal proceedings regarding OneCoin multi-million scam", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wZjI1ZjdkYmI3MjkxNWI5OTJkN2I1NDRjN2UxNjFmMS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
