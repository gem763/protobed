The man in charge of running Donald Trump\u2019s West Wing offered what was effectively a very public confession: the U.S. administration withheld vital military aid to a vulnerable ally, he explained, using it as leverage to convince a foreign country to participate in a political scheme for Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d the South Carolina Republican declared after acknowledging White House wrongdoing.\n\nA day later, a GOP congressional leadership aide told Politico, \u201cMulvaney needs to learn when to stop talking.\u201d That was a sensible observation, which the acting chief of staff ignored.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney insisted Sunday that he did not say that President Donald Trump held up military aid for Ukraine for political purposes \u2014 despite acknowledging the issue at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry during a televised press conference. \u201cI\u2019m flinching because that\u2019s what people are saying that I said, but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Mulvaney told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace of the comments he made \u2013 and then walked back in a contradictory statement \u2013 Thursday.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why Mulvaney thought it\u2019d be a good idea to sit down with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, but whatever his reasoning, the president\u2019s chief of staff was mistaken. Mulvaney was reduced to repeatedly complaining about being quoted accurately.\n\nOn Thursday, for example, the Republican told reporters there were \u201cthree factors\u201d in the administration\u2019s decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine: \u201cthe corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That\u2019s completely legitimate.\u201d\n\nPutting aside how dubious the \u201ccorruption\u201d claim is, Mulvaney insisted on Fox News that the third reason didn\u2019t actually exist. Pressed to explain the dramatic shift, he couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn the same interview, Mulvaney emphasized the fact that he never literally used the phrase \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d That\u2019s true. But during the briefing, ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl told the chief of staff, \u201cBut to be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo.\u201d Instead of pushing back or contesting the characterization, Mulvaney replied, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain why he accepted the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d description of the White House\u2019s policy, Mulvaney nonsensically tried to blame reporters.\n\nThe result is a dynamic in which the acting White House chief of staff, caught up in a scandal that\u2019s likely to lead to his boss\u2019 impeachment, is receiving a fair amount of blame for the entire fiasco. Stuck in a ditch, Mulvaney thought it\u2019d be a good idea to grab a shovel, head to Fox News, and dig deeper.\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney said the G7 summit would be held at one of Donald Trump\u2019s struggling businesses; Camp David would be a poor choice; and the White House held up Ukraine aid for political reasons. Three days later, Team Trump isn\u2019t standing by any of these assertions.\n\nIndeed, asked about the G7 scheme, Mulvaney added yesterday, \u201cAt the end of the day, you know, [Trump] still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put the absolute best show.\u201d\n\nOf course, the sitting American president is supposed to be in the governing business, not the hospitality business.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it\u2019s hard not to wonder how much longer Mulvaney will remain in Trump\u2019s West Wing. That said, The Atlantic reported on Friday that the chief of staff \u201cmay be untouchable: Should Trump fire him and leave him aggrieved, Mulvaney could prove a damaging witness in Congress\u2019s impeachment investigation.\u201d", "description": "A GOP leadership aide said the other day, \"Mulvaney needs to learn when to stop talking.\" It was a sensible observation, which the chief of staff ignored.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_tur_Turinquiry_191018_1920x1080.jpg?itok=plBKvBh2", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
