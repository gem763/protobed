(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nChina\u2019s IP Theft Remains a Thorny Issue in Trade Talks\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Whether the United States and China will sign the first part of a trade deal at the APEC meetings in Chile isn\u2019t yet certain, and one obstacle in the ongoing talks is China\u2019s stance on intellectual property. This is one of the most problematic issues in the trade talks, as Beijing wouldn\u2019t \u201cmove the needle\u201d much to meet U.S. demands, a China expert says.\n\nOptimism surged after the world\u2019s two largest economies announced on Oct. 11 that they had reached a partial trade agreement, in principle, on intellectual property, financial services, and agriculture.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the agreement \u201ca very substantial phase one deal,\u201d that suspended October tariff hikes on Chinese goods. Beijing has agreed to boost purchases of U.S. farm goods and made progress in opening its financial services markets to U.S. banks.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s still a sense of skepticism when it comes to Chinese concessions on intellectual property (IP) rights.\n\n\u201cI think at this point the speculation is essentially that China looks to repackage actions it has already taken over the past year or so to strengthen IP in China,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, Freeman chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Oct. 29.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing hosted by the CSIS, Blanchette said \u201cIP protection is one of the thorniest issues\u201d in the trade talks.\n\nChina has passed legislation to improve market access and strengthen IP protection in the past year. However, there have been issues with the enforcement of these laws. And the issues aren\u2019t just limited to rules and enforcement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got not only state IP theft, but you have a lot of commercial IP theft that\u2019s happening, too. And a lot of it is happening in a sort of ways that are just outside of the regulatory apparatus\u2019 ability to catch it,\u201d Blanchette said.\n\nIt would be very hard to address all the IP issues in the phase one deal, he noted, adding that there would be more discussions at a later phase to \u201csee something meaningful.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier indicated that there could be two or three phases in China trade talks. He said phase two negotiations would start \u201calmost immediately after\u201d the completion of the phase one deal.\n\nBlanchette questions Beijing\u2019s seriousness in protecting foreign intellectual property.\n\n\u201cI think politically speaking, for China, they\u2019re not looking to make\u2014whether in phase one, phase two, or phase three\u2014large concessions to the United States that fundamentally undermine the party leadership\u2019s ability to deliver economic growth and national strength and power,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhich is why we\u2019ve seen again and again China really hasn\u2019t moved the needle in terms of what it\u2019s offering to the United States on the trade war.\u201d\n\nMeeting in Chile\n\nLeaders of the United States and China look forward to signing the phase one deal in mid-November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Chile.\n\nBoth sides are actively working to finalize the agreement for signature before then. However, there are still uncertainties about the timing of a bilateral meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump earlier said that both sides could be ahead of the schedule for inking the deal but didn\u2019t elaborate on the timing.\n\n\u201cWe are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, we\u2019ll call it phase one, but it\u2019s a very big portion,\u201d he told reporters on Oct. 28. \u201cProbably, we\u2019ll sign it. I imagine the meeting is scheduled for Chile.\u201d\n\nThe South China Morning Post, citing a source familiar with the arrangements, reported on Oct. 28 that Trump and Xi were tentatively scheduled to meet and sign the deal on Nov. 17 \u201cif everything goes smoothly.\u201d\n\nHowever, the White House denied such reports, telling The Epoch Times there\u2019s \u201cno meeting to announce at this time.\u201d\n\nChile, the host of the APEC summit, has seen serious violence and riots during the past two weeks triggered by a 4-cent increase in subway fares. At least 20 people have died and more than 1,000 have been injured in the turmoil that has swept the country.\n\n\u201cThis came very unexpectedly,\u201d said Michael Matera, a senior fellow and director of the Americas program at the CSIS.\n\n\u201cThis is being explained as a reaction from the lower-middle classes to very high levels of inequality in Chile, frustration over the inability to access paid education, inability to access a two-tiered health system that is out of reach for the majority of Chilean citizens,\u201d he said at the press briefing.\n\nMore than 1 million people joined the anti-government rally on Oct. 25 in the capital Santiago, calling for social justice.\n\nDespite the unrest, \u201cChilean authorities are saying very clearly the summit is going forward,\u201d Matera said.\n\n\u201cThere may be some minor adjustments to the schedule. That said, we\u2019re going to have to see what happens between now and the 15th of November.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s intellectual property abuses is one of the most problematic issues in the trade talks as Beijing would not \u201cmove the needle\u201d much to meet U.S. demands, says China expert.", "authors": ["Follow Emel On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2019/06/30/xi-jinping-and-donald-trump-in-japan-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
