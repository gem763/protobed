USA TODAY\n\nWith one loss already on its ledger and the Red River Rivalry with Oklahoma up next, Saturday's game against West Virginia was one No. 12 Texas absolutely had to have.\n\nAnd the Longhorns were locked in a pretty good battle in Morgantown, West Virginia, all afternoon, but they put the game away with something all football fans love: a big-man touchdown.\n\nAfter Mountaineers quarterback Austin Kendall threw his fourth (!) interception of the day, Texas went to work up 28-17 with 12:05 to go. On first-and-10 at the 12-yard line the Longhorns reached into the bag of tricks, as QB Sam Ehlinger threw backwards toward offensive lineman Samuel Cosmi. Officially listed as 6-7 and 300 pounds, Cosmi rumbled to the end zone for what was effectively the game-sealer as the Longhorns went up 35-17 with 9:01 to go.\n\nBIG MAN TD LET'S GET WEIRD MORGANTOWN pic.twitter.com/iaaF8wcNmL \u2014 Longhorn Network (@LonghornNetwork) October 5, 2019\n\nThe massive tackle even leveled a West Virginia defender for good measure during his touchdown run. Needless to say, he and the rest of the offensive line were fired up.\n\nWe have a feeling this might earn a \"Piesman Trophy\" nomination later in the year.", "description": "Texas offensive lineman Samuel Cosmi rumbled for a 12-year touchdown on a Longhorns trick play to effectively seal the game vs. West Virginia.", "authors": ["Jace Evans", "Published P.M.
