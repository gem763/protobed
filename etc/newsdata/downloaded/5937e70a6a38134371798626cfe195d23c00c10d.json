They could face each other this week with the Phillies in town for five games. (Kelley L. Cox/USA Today Sports)\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Once the Washington Nationals traded for Hunter Strickland on July 31, in a 30-minute stretch that netted them three new relievers, the jokes and conspiracy theories were the lowest of hanging fruit.\n\nThe Nationals got Strickland to bother Bryce Harper. They got him to troll the superstar who left Washington for Philadelphia in the offseason. They got him because, about two years prior, Strickland plunked Harper to start a brawl that\u2019s etched into the first draft of Nationals history. You may remember Harper, hair flopping all over the place, rearing back and chucking his helmet about 10 feet wide of Strickland. Then they exchanged a flurry of punches on the mound. Then their teammates piled on, and the two players were lost shuffle, heads flung into the mess, hands still high and ready to hit anything that moved.\n\n[Bryce Harper\u2019s fight with Hunter Strickland led to so many memes]\n\nHarper played for the Nationals and Strickland for the San Francisco Giants. Now, in a plot twist, Strickland pitches for Washington and could face Harper again this week. The Phillies, on the outside of the wild-card race, are in Washington for five games between Monday and Thursday. The Nationals are in position to lock up a postseason spot with them in town.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honestly thinking about the Phillies, the team, nothing else\u201a\u201d Strickland said at his locker at Marlins Park this past weekend. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Bryce or whoever else, I need to get outs. I need to get Bryce out if I face him, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d\n\nThe backstory of the fight hardly matters in 2019: Harper hit a pair of home runs off Strickland in the 2014 postseason. After the second one, a moonshot that tied Game 4 of the National League Division Series in the seventh inning, Harper took a long stare before glancing at Strickland while he rounded the bases. Strickland took exception. He went for revenge three years later, throwing a fastball at Harper\u2019s front hip, and that\u2019s when the punches flew.\n\nStrickland was suspended six games. Harper got four. Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo called throwing at Harper a \u201cselfish act\u201d by Strickland. He went even further to suggest that Strickland\u2019s teammates didn\u2019t seem interested in backing him up once Harper charged the mound. Strickland has since called the whole incident a mistake on his part, multiple times, and has worked on settling his temper. He missed two months in 2018 after punching a door following a blown save against the Miami Marlins. He took a look in the mirror in the offseason \u2014 a hard look \u2014 and did sessions with a life coach while dipping into anger management books.\n\nHe believes he has changed for the better. And Harper, a mark on Strickland\u2019s history, is part of that.\n\n\u201cYou just get older, you get more mature,\u201d Strickland, 30, said of what that day taught him. \u201cI realize that I shouldn\u2019t try to take everything into my own hands. It\u2019s unfair to a lot of people to be that way.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a second, nodding, then decided that was how he wanted to answer the question.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I learned from it.\u201d\n\nThe righty is, really, just narrowly focused on pitching better. The Nationals took a risk on him at the deadline, since he missed four months of this season with a Grade 2 lat strain. He does offer another year of team control beyond this one, meaning he should be with the club in 2020, but he was mostly acquired to get big outs down the stretch.\n\nThrough 21 appearances with Washington, his ability to do so has wavered. He has a 5.30 ERA in 18\u2154 innings with Washington. He allowed the St. Louis Cardinals to break a late tie on Sept. 16. He allowed the Marlins to start their comeback Sunday, with a seventh-inning home run, and combined with Wander Suero for another bullpen collapse. Manager Dave Martinez has noted that Strickland is still trying to find the right balance between his mid-90s fastball and secondary pitches. Rust from the injured list could be a part of that.\n\nWhen Strickland falls behind hitters, which he is doing way too often, he relies on his fastball and has found trouble. He has to get more comfortable throwing his slider for strikes, he explained, so batters can\u2019t sit on his heat when ahead in counts. He also needs to locate his pitches better and remember not to put so much pressure on each at-bat. That\u2019s something he did earlier in his career, when he was still trying to prove himself, and has to resist the temptation of getting frustrated.\n\nBut he has learned how to control that. Time has helped.\n\n\u201cWhen you get to the middle of your career, and you\u2019ve been around a lot, you sort of figure out how to ride the wave and make adjustments without overhauling,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cA younger me wouldn\u2019t have understood that.\u201d\n\nSort of like how you view the possibility of staring down Harper this week?\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Strickland said, even cracking a big smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected somehow.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nBoswell: The Nationals are in great shape or they\u2019re a flawed mess, depending on how you look at them\n\nState of the wild-card race: Nationals seem destined for another clash with Brewers\n\nNationals\u2019 Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera should avoid MRI after tweaking right ankle\n\nKurt Suzuki balancing health concerns with urgency of pennant race\n\nAnthony Rendon\u2019s MVP case is gaining momentum but running out of time", "description": "Strickland plunked Harper to spark a brawl in May 2017.
