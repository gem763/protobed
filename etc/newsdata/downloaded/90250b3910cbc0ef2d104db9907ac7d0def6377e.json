However, most people were too afraid to share those experiences because they feared what other people might think.\n\nBy contrast, the three women she featured \"were honest about the way that their pain has shaped who they were. They were also honest about their passion.\"\n\nTheir feelings of desire and lust were so much more compelling, to me anyway. - Lisa Taddeo\n\nThe book features Lina, a housewife who embarks on an affair after her marriage loses all physical intimacy; Maggie, who takes her former teacher to court on allegations they had a sexual relationship while she was underage; and Sloane, whose husband picks out partners for her to have sex with, while he watches.\n\nDesire from a female perspective\n\nWhen Taddeo first set out to write the book, she was handed another writer's work as inspiration.\n\nBut that supposed inspiration, written by a man who'd spent time with swingers and operated a massage parlour, turned out to be \"incredibly male,\" she told Lynch.\n\n\"And I wondered how a book about desire told from a female perspective would look.\"\n\nThat curiosity set Taddeo off on an eight-year journey to write her book. Although she started by interviewing both men and women, she said it was the women whose stories she was ultimately drawn to.\n\n\"Their stories were rendered with such complexity that their self-awareness about their feelings of desire and lust were so much more compelling, to me anyway.\"\n\nWritten by Kirsten Fenn.
