Katie Hill was the talk of Capitol Hill this weekend, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the glaring lack of public statements by women\u2019s rights groups or Hill\u2019s fellow Democrats. Even two years after the explosion of the #MeToo movement, Hill\u2019s unique case proved too complicated for many anti-harassment advocates to address.\n\nHill\u2014one of a record number of women elected to Congress in 2018, and the first openly bisexual representative in history\u2014resigned her seat Sunday after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that she had an affair with a congressional staffer. Hill has denied that but admits to engaging in a three-person relationship with a campaign staffer and her then-husband.\n\nHill claims the now-estranged husband was involved in the publication of nude photos of her in conservative news outlet RedState, complicating what could have been a straightforward story about an elected official\u2019s alleged abuse of power. Some women\u2019s rights advocates said the leak and publication of the photos amounted to revenge porn, the distribution of someone\u2019s nude images without their consent.\n\nSwirling Scandal Forces Rep. Katie Hill to Resign From Congress\n\nHill also leaned in to this narrative on Sunday, vowing to pursue \u201call of our legal options\u201d against those who had \u201cweaponized\u201d her personal images.\n\n\u201cThose of you who know me personally know that I\u2019m a fighter,\u201d Hill wrote in a letter. \u201cNow, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.\u201d\n\nA chorus of voices on social media protested Hill\u2019s resignation, with many suggesting she was being held to an unfair standard because she is a woman or because she is bisexual. Some pointed to Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was indicted for misappropriation of campaign funds\u2014allegedly to finance affairs with two Republican congressional staffers. Hunter has not resigned.\n\nOthers pointed to President Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than 20 women.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has sexually harassed or assaulted dozens of women,\u201d tweeted Jenna Lowenstein, deputy campaign manager for Cory Booker\u2019s campaign. \u201cKatie Hill had, as far as we know, some consensual relationships and an ex with an affinity for revenge porn. Don't let anyone tell you men and women are held to the same standards.\u201d\n\nOthers compared Hill\u2019s resignation to that of Al Franken, the Democratic senator who resigned last year over allegations of sexual misconduct. Some said the allegations\u2014groping in Franken\u2019s case, and what appeared to be a consensual relationship in Hill\u2019s\u2014were insufficient to warrant resignation. (\u201cThe injustice here is so over the top,\u201d tweeted Shaunna Thomas, founder of women\u2019s rights group UltraViolet.)\n\nEven some Republicans jumped to Hill\u2019s defense. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz called the Ethics Committee\u2019s investigation \u201cabsurd\u201d and suggested that the only person with a complaint was the congresswoman\u2019s \u201csoon-to-be ex.\u201d Heather Nauert, a former State Department spokesperson and current White House staffer, said that Hill would not have resigned if she were a man.\n\n\u201cI appreciated her willingness to reach out to both parties to discuss/debate policies,\u201d Nauert added.\n\nMany of Hill\u2019s fellow Democrats, however, were silent on the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a short statement acknowledging Hill\u2019s \u201cgreat contribution to the Freshman Class\u201d but adding that the congresswoman\u2019s \u201cerrors in judgment\u201d made her continued service \u201cuntenable.\u201d None of the women in Hill\u2019s notoriously Twitter-friendly freshman class spoke out publicly.\n\nOne Democratic staffer attributed the silence to lawmakers\u2019 indecision around the issue, telling The Daily Beast that the addition of the revenge porn angle \u201cmakes it, for lack of a better term, messy.\u201d\n\nCarly Mee, a senior staff attorney for the victim\u2019s rights organization SurvJustice, said women\u2019s rights groups faced the same challenge.\n\n\u201cThe hesitation is that in my opinion, is the nuance that she both was wronged and did something wrong,\u201d Mee told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt comes from an inability to say that someone can be hurt and can also hurt others. Someone can victimized and also be a victim.\u201d", "description": "Caroline Brehman/CQ Roll Call/GettyThe resignation of Rep.
