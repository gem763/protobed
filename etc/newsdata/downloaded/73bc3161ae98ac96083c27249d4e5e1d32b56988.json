The loss contributed to a 26% drop in profits from a year ago.\n\nWeWork set to sack 2,000 staff as anger towards founder Adam Neumann grows Read more\n\nThe valuation of its stake in WeWork fell after We, as the company is known, was forced to pull plans for an initial public offering that would have been led by Goldman and JP Morgan.\n\nGoldman initially declined to break out its losses on WeWork, but on a conference call with analysts, Stephen Scherr, the chief financial officer, said Goldman had decided to make the loss public because it had \u201cgot quite a bit of notoriety in the press\u201d.\n\nScherr said the value of its holding \u2013 now $70m \u2013 could still fall further. But the loss was smaller than some analysts had predicted and Scherr said Goldman could still make money on its investment.\n\nOnce the world\u2019s US\u2019s most highly valued private company, WeWork is now facing a cash crunch as it burns through its remaining money. The company is weighing plans to fire 2,000 people, 13% of WeWork\u2019s 15,000 staff.\n\nHad the company successfully launched its share sale, Goldman and JPMorgan were preparing loans worth $6bn. JP Morgan and Softbank, the Japanese investment firm that is WeWork\u2019s largest backer, are now working on alternative financing options.\n\nWeWork\u2019s share sale ran into trouble when it released its sale prospectus to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors balked at its huge losses and a corporate structure that left the controversial co-founder Adam Neumann with control of the company.\n\nWeWork\u2019s share sale was set to follow other less-than-well-received share sales from once highly valued tech firms, including Uber and Lyft. The declining value of Goldman\u2019s stake in Uber and other companies also hit its results.\n\nOn the conference call Scherr said: \u201cRecent market reception to certain companies has been less favorable.\u201d\n\nGoldman\u2019s losses in other publicly traded companies were far larger than its WeWork loss. The bank reported it had taken losses of $267m in the third quarter for \u201cinvestments in public equities, primarily from investments in Uber, Avantor and Tradeweb\u201d. The losses also included Goldman\u2019s stake in WeWork.\n\nGoldman\u2019s profits for the third quarter were $1.88bn, down 26% from the same time last year and below analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue fell 6% to $8.32bn, slightly above the $8.31bn expected. The firm also announced it had set aside $291m for credit losses in the quarter, 67% higher than a year earlier.\n\nShares fell 3% on the news but ended the day up 0.3%.", "description": "Loss in office rental company, which is expected to lay off 2,000 workers imminently, contributes to 26% drop in profits from a year ago", "authors": ["Dominic Rushe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/038d8d7fa0dce0aafaf99bb4a2877f16140095dd/0_449_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa730ccc3a7b87c0d7350979ed0a0fa4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
