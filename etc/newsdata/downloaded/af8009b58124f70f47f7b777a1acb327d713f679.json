Are hotel bathtubs really clean?\u201d \u2014 CS\n\nA: Considering that everything from hotel room remotes to in-room drinking glasses have been called out for their filthiness, it makes sense that the hotel bathtub would seem suspicious. But I don\u2019t bring along a blacklight or germ culture kit when I travel (yet), so I did the next best thing and asked the experts.\n\nRob Dunn, professor of applied ecology at NC State University, reassured me. \u201cYour chances of encountering a microbe that will make you sick in the bathtub while bathing aren\u2019t very high,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are far higher from shaking the hand of the person at the front desk than from lounging in the tub. In short, lounge in the tub and don\u2019t worry about it. But wash your hands with soap and water (though never antimicrobial soap) after shaking hands.\u201d\n\nErica Marie Hartmann, assistant professor at Northwestern University, notes that even if you do encounter some microbes in your hotel bathtub, they\u2019re unlikely to cause any problems for a healthy person \u2014 and you may be more likely to find microbes in your hotel showerhead than in the bathtub anyway.\n\nBoth professors agree \u2014 don\u2019t drink the tub water, and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nAdvice: How to survive a dirty hotel stay\n\n28 loos with views: These are some of the most scenic hotel bathrooms in the world\n\nMore from SmarterTravel\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/10/21/clean-hotel-bathtub-should-take-soak/4048404002/", "description": "Are you drinking the tub water?
