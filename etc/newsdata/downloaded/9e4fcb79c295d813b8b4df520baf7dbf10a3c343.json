Like, 'Oh, my girl needs to be like the other girls, showing her body off'.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n(Image: Getty Images for THR)\n\n\"I didn't realise that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of now, what - about to be four kids?'\n\nThe argument took place before the couple welcomed their fourth child, Psalm, via surrogate.\n\nKanye said: \"A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?\"\n\nBut Kim wasn't happy with his 11th hour criticisms.\n\nShe said: \"So the night before the Met, you're gonna come in here and say that you're not into a corset bust? I'm getting really bad anxiety. What are you talking about?\n\n(Image: E!)\n\n\"I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me in a tight dress.\"\n\nKanye fired back: \"You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.\"\n\nIn the recent interview, Kanye also said he's the \"greatest artist of all time\" and that he will be President of the United States one day.\n\nHe says he'll launch his bid for the White House as early as 2024.\n\nHe said: \"There will be a time when I will be the President of the US and I will remember\u2026 any founder that didn\u2019t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
