I don\u2019t know whether certain members of the crowd were removed after the announcement went out,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe correct steps of the protocol definitely helped and we made a decision at half-time to come out and play the game, which we thought was the right decision.\n\n\u201cEveryone was consulted \u2013 management, staff and players \u2013 and we all made a decision we were happy to go back out and play the game.\n\n\u201cIf anything had happened we would have taken appropriate action.\u201d", "description": "Tyrone Mings has revealed that he first heard racist chanting during the warm-up ahead of England\u2019s match in Bulgaria on Monday evening.
