Rolled out in a two-page memo in April 2016, the plan, now deleted from the Trump campaign website but retrieved through web archives, was a surprisingly detailed strategy\u2014by Trump campaign standards\u2014for forcing Mexico to cut an 11-figure check to the United States.\n\nThe scheme entailed a three-day diplomatic high-wire act touching on creative interpretations of national security legislation, international finance, and the finer art of ransom, all meant to take place during Trump\u2019s first three days in office.\n\nFirst, Trump would issue a threat to change a rule under the USA PATRIOT Act to halt money transfers from undocumented Mexican nationals inside the United States back to Mexico. That money, known as remittances, amounts to roughly $25 billion annually and makes up nearly 3 percent of Mexico\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the World Bank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy decision for Mexico,\u201d Trump wrote in the memo, an orphaned version of which still exists on the campaign website. \u201cMake a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year.\u201d\n\nUpon issuing the threat, Trump would then respond to a (presumably panicking) Mexican government with a promise not to enact the proposed rule change\u2014\u201cif the Mexican government will contribute the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the moral high ground here, and all the leverage,\u201d Trump concluded. \u201cIt is time we use it in order to Make America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThe entire negotiation, Trump said at the time, would take just three days.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nAccording to a former aide, the American people should have known to take Trump seriously, not literally.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of options in the air,\u201d former Trump campaign adviser-turned-critic Sam Nunberg told The Daily Beast. The idea that Mexico would literally pay billions for the wall, Nunberg added, was \u201cfor political fodder,\u201d rather than a legitimate policy proposal.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be paid from them in terms of, they were going to get less money from the United States,\u201d Nunberg said, noting that the campaign toyed with multiple funding sources for the wall, only some of which involved Mexico directly funding a wall.\n\nTrump himself has repeatedly denied that there were any specific plans for Mexico to directly pay for the barrier, despite the call-and-response \u201cWho\u2019s gonna pay for the wall? MEXICO!\u201d being such a staple of his campaign rallies that it\u2019s even been remixed into a slow-jam on YouTube.\n\n\u201cObviously, I never said and never meant, \u2018they\u2019re going to write out a check,\u2019\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday morning. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall indirectly.\u201d\n\nFor a figurative policy, however, Trump\u2019s plan to force Mexico to fund a continuous concrete barrier along the 1,954-mile southern border\u2014which eventually entailed extorting billions of dollars from the Mexican government\u2014became pretty, well, concrete.\n\n\u201cIn terms of specifying how Mexico would pay for the wall,\u201d Nunberg said, \u201cinternally, it was going to come from Mexico one way or the other. It could come from cutting foreign aid that we give to Mexico, it could come from trade, or it could come from, let\u2019s say, the remittances.\u201d\n\nThe specific plan, then, was never meant to be the plan, specifically .\n\nThat might have been a good thing. Had \u201cCOMPELLING MEXICO TO PAY FOR THE WALL\u201d left the planning stages and gone into production, serious legal and logistical problems with the brief would have killed Trump\u2019s proposal in the crib.\n\nFor example, the plan invokes the USA PATRIOT Act to \u201cissue detailed regulations\u201d under 31 CFR \u00a7 130.120-121, using customer identification regulations to block payments from unauthorized residents of the United States to residents of Mexico. But there are no regulations at 31 CFR \u00a7 130.120-121\u2014customer identification regulations are found in a completely different section.\n\nBut even misplaced financial regulations aside, much of Trump\u2019s proposal was already enacted at the time he proposed it. In his plan, Trump declared that he would threaten to issue a regulation redefining \u201capplicable financial institutions to include money transfer companies like Western Union.\u201d But Western Union\u2014and all other similar financial wire couriers\u2014are already categorized as financial institutions under federal law, and have their own separate customer identification requirements.\n\nOther proposed revenue streams for the president\u2019s border wall in the document, including fees on visa applications, surcharges on remittance payments, and cancelling visas entirely, have similarly disappeared from Trump\u2019s agenda\u2014although it\u2019s unclear why. The Border Wall Funding Act of 2017, a bill penned by Alabama Republican and longtime supporter of the president Rep. Mike Rogers, would add a 2-percent tax to all remittances sent to Central and South America \u201cto be expended for improving border security,\u201d nearly exactly what the president proposed as a supplemental measure to the remittance plan. That bill has been stalled out in committee since March 2017, when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment as to why Trump dropped the remittance payment idea, whether the proposal was merely a rhetorical device, or how the president could square his statement that he \u201cnever said and never meant\u201d that Mexico would directly pay for the wall with his own detailed plan for Mexico to pay for the wall.\n\nSkeptics of the plan at the time it was revealed extended from President Barack Obama, who called the proposals \u201chalf-baked notions,\u201d to future White House Chief of staff John Kelly, who reportedly considered the promise \u201cuninformed.\u201d\n\nAlex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, told The Daily Beast that the notion Mexico would ever pay for the wall was extremely unlikely, even by Trump\u2019s newest definition\u2014and Trump almost certainly knew it.\n\n\u201cI suspect that Trump dropped that idea for three reasons: First, it wouldn\u2019t raise enough revenue,\u201d said Nowrasteh. \u201cSecond, remittances don\u2019t go to the Mexican government so the threat wouldn\u2019t carry much weight. Third, it would be very difficult to only tax illegal immigrants through such a tax.\u201d\n\nEven among Trump\u2019s sundry broken campaign pledges\u2014repealing Obamacare, defunding Planned Parenthood, ending birthright citizenship\u2014not enacting a three-day foreign policy blitzkrieg to force Mexico to pay for a border wall is a whopper. Trump, who often campaigns in front of two enormous banners emblazoned \u201cPROMISES MADE\u201d and \u201cPROMISES KEPT,\u201d appears to have forgotten that promise, instead pointing to as-yet-unpassed trade negotiations with Mexico as evidence that Mexico will pay for the wall, one way or another.\n\n\u201cThis barrier is absolutely critical to border security,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday night in the first Oval Office address of his presidency, in which he claimed that \u201ca growing humanitarian\u201d crisis at the border necessitates the construction of a physical barrier to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.\u201d\n\nAfter Congress appropriates $5.7 billion for a wall, the president added, \u201cthe border wall would very quickly pay for itself.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the fact that a border wall would do little to solve any of the problems highlighted in President Trump\u2019s Oval Office speech, and that Trump has a better chance of persuading House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to fund stationing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents along the border with a whip and a chair, the president privately gave up on hoping that Mexico would fulfill its end of the bargain less than a week into his presidency.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall\u2014I am just going to say that we are working it out,\u201d Trump told Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Jan. 27, 2017, according to a leaked transcript of the call. \u201cBelieve it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about. But in terms of dollars\u2014or pesos\u2014it is the least important thing. I know how to build very inexpensively, so it will be much lower than these numbers I am being presented with, and it will be a better wall and it will look nice. And it will do the job.\u201d", "description": "Hint: It was never going to happen in the first place.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1547161540/190109-Bixby-Trump-wall-tease_lpclh1", "published_at": "2019-01-11"}
