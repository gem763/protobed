REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\n\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt\u2019s EGX30 share index climbed by as much as 3.8% on Sunday after the central bank cut key interest rates for the second month in a row and anti-government protest failed to gather momentum.\n\nLocal financial institutions were net purchasers and helped push the index higher for a third straight session.\n\nThe central bank cut interest rates by 100 basis points, with overnight deposit rates lowered to 13.25% and lending rates easing to 14.25%.\n\nThe stock exchange suspended trading on around 70 shares for 10 minutes after they climbed by more than 5% during the first half hour of trading. The index was 3.3% higher as of 1025 GMT.\n\nMohamed Farid, the bourse\u2019s chairman, said on Thursday that recent share losses were not justified, after they had plunged following protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n\n\u201cThe market responded to the rates cut and the passing of Friday safely ... we returned to logic again,\u201d Ibrahim El Nemr, analyst at Naeem Brokerage said.\n\nEgyptian police dispersed a protest in Cairo on Friday, but a huge show of force by security forces prevented protests in central Cairo and other cities.\n\nActivists had called for the demonstrations against Sisi after protests broke out the previous week. A large pro-Sisi rally was also held in the capital on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe market is recovering what it lost unjustifiably last week ... along with the rate cuts which gave investors a positive message about the market\u2019s performance over the coming period,\u201d said Radwa El-Swaify, head of research at Pharos Securities Brokerage.", "description": "Egypt's EGX30 share index climbed by as much as 3.8% on Sunday after the central bank cut key interest rates for the second month in a row and anti-government protest failed to gather momentum.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435144795&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S073-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
