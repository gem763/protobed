The first major Bitcoin (BTC) fork carries around 54,000 transactions per day, about ten times lower than BTC.\n\nBCH Real Usage Remains Relatively Slow\n\nBut at some points, activity on BCH slumps, and the asset has counted fewer transactions than Litecoin (LTC), or even Dogecoin (DOGE). Outside extraordinary events such as tests or dust attacks, the Bitcoin Cash network is relatively idle.\n\nThe low transaction count is even more paradoxical, as Bitcoin Cash aims at on-chain scaling by increasing block size. The potential for large blocks means more difficult propagation among nodes. Unfortunately, some of those blocks depart rather empty of transactions.\n\nSomeone noticed that a recent BCH block only carried five transactions:\n\n$209 billion market cap and no one uses any of this shit! No \ud83d\udc4f one \ud83d\udc4f uses \ud83d\udc4f cryptocurrency \ud83d\udc4f No one!$BCH has a $3.75b market cap. A recent block had 5 fucking transactions! Five! Five transactions in 10 minutes!! How is any of this worth anything?! pic.twitter.com/AjyR0Z9eQp \u2014 \u0e3fully (@BullyEsq) September 26, 2019\n\nGranted, blocks usually carry roughly 100-200 transactions. There may be reasons why a block has left mostly empty \u2013 miners have reserved the block for high-fee transactions or for another reason. In the past, the Bitcoin Cash network frequently mined blocks that only contained a single transaction for the block reward.\n\nTransaction Fees for Most Networks are Negligible\n\nRecently, CoinMetrics noted that only the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks saw significant daily gains from fees. The dollar value of those fees was around $200,000 per day. Other networks had much lower rewards coming from fees, mostly due to very limited usage and no urgent transactions.\n\nThe BCH network also hardly sees congestions, as the current load remains relatively low. In the future, most pure proof-of-work blockchains expect to earn more from transaction fees than from block rewards. But if no one uses the network, miners may decide to switch off their expensive equipment.\n\nIn the past, the Bitcoin Cash network has been \u201cstrip-mined\u201d with extremely fast blocks, to gain rewards during favorable periods. This is one of the reasons there are now 18,025,813 BCH generated, ahead of the mining of 17,960,100 BTC. Both networks will go through a reward halving in 2020, and fees may not offset the diminished block rewards.\n\nTransaction counts are extremely uneven in the blockchain space. Usually, transactions will grow upon extraordinary events, such as protocols using the network without generating economic value. Sometimes, promising projects carry almost no transactions, as in the case of Cardano (ADA) and Tezos (XTZ), despite promises of extreme scalability.\n\nBCH has also shown price weakness, shedding 31% of its price in the past week of relentless selling. BCH traded at $219.39, moving away from the drive to $400. BCH still sees promotion as an easy, everyday mode of payments. Wallets and merchants sometimes allow zero-confirmation payments, which are immediate, but riskier.\n\nWhat do you think about BCH?
