We used to just perform and leave the building and that's it and hope it didn't come out.\"\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond)\n\nIt was particularly disappointing for the boys as they'd worked so hard to keep it a secret so the surprise wouldn't be ruined for the TV viewers.\n\nEvery time a social media follower commented something about the win they'd rush to delete it.\n\nAshley added: \"We wanted to keep it so fans could experience the show the way it's meant to be done rather than spoiling it because it takes the fun out of it.\n\n\"But I don't think it took anything away from the show. It got more people talking so maybe it did create more hype.\"\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond/ITV)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe boys first appeared on BGT in 2010 when they were runners up.\n\nAnd they certainly felt the pressure when they were asked to return.\n\nGlen said: \"We knew we had to up our game and put our all into it so it's shown that hard work does actually pay off sometimes.\n\n\"We were gigging and working. At one point we were on a cruise ship and we were using the gym to rehearse in there after hours when everyone had gone to sleep.\n\n\"We'd just go back into the gym and use it as much as we could. We kind of tried to put in as much time as we could.\n\n\"As short as the routine was, it's kind of gruelling and it takes out of you.\"\n\nTheir next move is doing a pantomime later this year and they're starting their first ever UK tour in February.\n\nAshley said: \"It's our first ever tour and it's ten years of Twist and Pulse. We want to make sure we do something big with our first ever UK tour.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The winner of Britain's Got Talent: The Champions was leaked months before the grand finale aired this weekend", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Tom Dymond", "Tom Dymond Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20468435.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EMB-BGT-The-Champions-The-Final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
