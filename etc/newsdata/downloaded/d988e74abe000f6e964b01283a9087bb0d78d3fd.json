He\u2019s just one of those defenders who makes mistakes and it affects other people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When you play with someone like that it makes you nervous. Your goalkeeper, your full-backs\u2026 you can\u2019t play your own game because you\u2019re always worried he\u2019s going to make a mistake and are half-covering him.\n\n\u2018I think probably for Arsenal the quicker he\u2019s gone the better for everyone.\u2019\n\nThere were goals from Lucas Torreira, Gabriel Martinelli and James Milner, Ainsley Maitland-Niles as well as screamers from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Willock but it was Divock Origi who was the hero for Liverpool as he bagged his second deep into injury time to force a shootout.\n\nAnd Ray Parlour believes Arsenal will be \u2018devastated\u2019 at failing to hold on to a 5-3 lead.\n\nParlour believes Arsenal\u2019s players will be \u2018devastated (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll be devastated,\u2019 Parlour said. \u2018Especially the young players, it\u2019s an opportunity to win at Anfield and they were so close.\n\n\u2018They looked a little bit tired towards the end, Liverpool put the pressure on a bit towards the end, but in a penalty shoot-out anything can happen.\n\n\u2018They were excellent penalties, even the save it was in the corner. It was an excellent game of football, the defensive coaches won\u2019t be too happy though.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarragher added: \u2018It was interesting the Arsenal fans\u2019 reaction at the end, all the players came over and got a great reception. If the result had gone the other way, the Liverpool fans would have done the same.\n\n\u2018You couldn\u2019t be anything but proud of the teams, the great goals, the entertainment for supporters, it was a brilliant game all round.\u2019\n\nMORE: Shkodran Mustafi mocked by Arsenal hero Alan Smith after shocking own goal during Liverpool clash\n\nMORE: Arsenal boss Unai Emery explains Mesut Ozil return for Liverpool clash", "description": "Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal should sell Shkodran Mustafi as quickly as possible and 'the quicker he's gone the better for everyone'.
