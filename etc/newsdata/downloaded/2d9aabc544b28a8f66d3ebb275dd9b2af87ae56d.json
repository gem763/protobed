Even on his sentencing day, she implied, he appeared to be making a play for a presidential pardon by wrongly suggesting that he was merely the victim of overzealous prosecutors who had hoped to prove that the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russian government to tilt the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe defendant is not public enemy No. 1, but he is also not a victim either,\u201d Judge Jackson said.\n\nShe stopped short of giving Mr. Manafort the maximum 10-year term that she could have imposed, adding three and a half years to the nearly four-year term Mr. Manafort received last week in a related prosecution in Alexandria, Va. Explaining why she was not harsher, she cited guidelines intended to limit punishment in overlapping cases and the fact that Mr. Manafort\u2019s effort to tamper with witnesses who could testify against him had been \u201cnipped in the bud.\u201d\n\nHer attitude stood in stark contrast to that of Judge T. S. Ellis III of United States District Court in Northern Virginia, who said last week that Mr. Manafort had \u201cled an otherwise blameless life\u201d in sentencing him to 47 months for eight felonies, a punishment that some legal experts described as startlingly low.\n\nIn an apparent reference to Judge Ellis, Judge Jackson noted that she was bound strictly by the case in front of her. \u201cWhat is happening today is not and cannot be a review and a revision by a sentence imposed by another court,\u201d she said.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman\u2019s total prison sentence is now 7\u00bd years after a second judge ruled in one of the special counsel\u2019s highest-profile cases.", "authors": ["Sharon Lafraniere"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/us/politics/13dc-manafort-promo/13dc-manafort-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
