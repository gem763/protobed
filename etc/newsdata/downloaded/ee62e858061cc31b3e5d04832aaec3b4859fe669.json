The foldable Neo has two side-by-side nine-inch screens with the ability to run multiple apps at once. Microsoft tried to play down the Duo\u2019s status as a phone, calling it \u201cthe first Surface to fit in your pocket\u201d in a blog post while later noting: \u201cAnd, yes, it makes phone calls.\u201d The company is working with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google GOOGL, -2.33% GOOG, -2.36% to bring Android software to the Duo.\n\nThe company said that consumers tend to use different devices for different purposes and that the dual-screen design is meant to offer an all-in-one alternative to that sort of behavior.\n\nSee also: Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11s mean the two-year upgrade cycle is officially dead\n\nThe product releases for this year were largely as expected, as Microsoft revealed its new Surface Laptop 3, Surface Pro 7, and Surface Pro X, as well as Surface Earbuds. Microsoft called this its largest lineup yet as it heads into the crucial season.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 3 is faster than its predecessor and comes in two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch. The new devices have larger trackpads and fast-charging capabilities, which Microsoft says will help them reach 80% battery levels in less than an hour. The company also touted Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s Ryzen Surface Edition processor in the 15-inch model.\n\nThe 13-inch model will sell for a starting price of $999 while the 15-inch version begins at $1,199. Preorders are currently open, and the devices become officially available on Oct. 22.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s announcements around its detachable tablets brought an upgrade to the existing form factor as well as a device with a new design. The newly unveiled Surface Pro 7 is twice as fast as the prior-generation model, according to Microsoft, with both USB-A and USB-C charging and a battery that lasts all day.\n\nThe company also introduced a design change when it rolled out the Surface Pro X, which has a new custom-designed processor brought about in partnership with Qualcomm Inc. Microsoft reduced the bezels on the Pro X, fitting a 13-inch display in the frame of a 12-inch device. The keyboard for the Pro X has a place to dock the pen and charge it.\n\nThe Surface Pro 7 begins at $749, while the Surface Pro X starts at $999. The Pro 7 will be available on Oct. 22 and the Nov. 5 comes starting on Nov. 5.\n\nAlso coming this holiday season will be the Surface Earbuds, which will let users access their Outlook calendars and email accounts via voice. The earbuds have all-day battery life and will sell for $249.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock is off 1.4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, though it\u2019s up 33% on the year.
