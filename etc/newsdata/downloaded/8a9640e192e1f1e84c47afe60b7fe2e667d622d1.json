Mota describes the broken model even more succinctly: Monetise through product, subsidise the advice.\n\nAnd it was this product-focused model that incentivised the misconduct that was so brutally exposed by the Hayne royal commission \u2013 and that AMP and IOOF are urgently working to repair, albeit in different ways.\n\nBut if the supply side is in tatters \u2013 business model broken, community trust ruined, big players fleeing the sector \u2013 the demand picture hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nSitting alongside a population of consumers working later into their life is a growing army of retirees, with ever increasing superannuation balances. If the industry can\u2019t find a new model, Mota and De Ferrari argue consumers will not be able to find the advice they need in an accessible and affordable way.\n\nAs wealth management companies and individual advisers either leave the sector or come to grips with new regulatory settings that have quite rightly eliminated conflicted remuneration and, under legislation finally introduced to federal Parliament just last week, grandfathered commissions, this gap between the advised and the unadvised becomes more stark.\n\nConsumers can either afford to rent the services of an adviser on a recurring basis \u2013 a process that typically starts with a personal financial plan (called a statement of advise) costing around $5000 \u2013 or they cannot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAdvice at the moment is all or nothing,\u201d Mota says.\n\nAnd even if clients can afford the advice, will advisers want to provide it? Mota says as advisers wrestle with the right way to charge clients for advice that has traditionally been heavily subsidised by product commissions, they will need to make decisions about which clients they want to take on. \u201cAdvisers will be more selective as to who they take on as a client,\u201d he says.\n\nSo if fewer Australians will be able to afford or access advice from a smaller pool of full-service advisers, what is the best solution for the rest of the market?\n\nAMP and IOOF are still searching for the right models and products.\n\nDe Ferrari argues that episodic advice built around key life stages \u2013 getting advice specifically around a consumer\u2019s first job, first home, first kids, paying off the mortgage, retirement, drawing down your super \u2013 may provide a framework.\n\nMota floats the idea of breaking advice down into the individual tasks that an adviser might perform as part of a holistic package, such as goal setting, budgeting, investment strategy and product selection.\n\n\u201cWe need to democratise advice and modularise it,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile this is all pretty vague at present, it appears the thinking of both companies is being informed by two key ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, they are focused on developing new models that are aimed at consumers and not advisers, as they\u2019ve done in the past. This is an important change in mindset, and emphasises the move towards the provision of action advice, rather then pushing product.\n\nSecond, both AMP and IOOF see technology playing an important part to make the provision of advice more efficient and cheaper for the mass market.\n\nBut one of the big clouds over the development of any new model is regulation.\n\nThat all-or-nothing structure Mota highlights is in no small part a function of the regulatory settings that split advice into two camps: general advice (which is often little more than product descriptions of varying complexity and quality) and personal advice (which comes with high cost and complexity).\n\nBut how might episodic or modularised models of advice fit into this very black and white regulatory framework?\n\nOne model floating around the wealth sector is a form of financial coaching, which a consumer might dip in and out of as their circumstances change.\n\nPerhaps some of the basics are delivered online (a bit of education about key things to consider, like getting a will, the positives and negatives of salary sacrificing into super) and then more complex bits are done in person (some budgeting and goal setting, for example).\n\nUnder the current regime there is an argument to be made that this might not constitute personal advice given it would stop short of advising on a specific investment strategy or, crucially, product recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not hard to understand why ASIC would argue that this sort of coaching would fit the label of general advice, either \u2013 partly because it would clearly need to be tailored to an individual's circumstances, and partly because ASIC\u2019s own research on the limitations of disclosure released last week suggested consumers struggle to differentiate between general and personal advice at the best of times.\n\nAll of which begs the question: If we might need to find some sort of in-between products and services to bridge the advice gap, do we need something between general and personal advice? Or do we just need more clarity on where the line between those two poles can actually sit?\n\nClearly, much of this will sit with ASIC. But while there\u2019s recognition within the watchdog\u2019s senior ranks of the dramatic changes rolling through the wealth sector, and even some sympathy for those players left standing, ASIC remains focused on enforcement and driving cultural change in a sector that badly needs it.\n\nAs one senior figure in ASIC says, it\u2019s worth remembering the royal commission\u2019s final report is only nine months old.\n\nASIC is looking towards the future, but is determined to do so with a solid base of evidence behind it. Its 2019 strategic plan includes a project to examine unmet advice needs, which includes \u201cexamining the demand and supply of advice, the gaps (if any) between them, and the potential solutions to reducing these gaps\u201d.\n\nThose words \u201cif any\u201d are important.\n\nThere is a clear sense from within ASIC that the advice gap might not be nearly as stark as the industry believes, and that at least some of these gaps \u2013 particularly around retirement planning \u2013 could be fixed with better designed superannuation options.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s stance suggests the industry faces a few challenges to frame its future model.\n\nFirst, it needs ASIC to be convinced that there is a wealth gap. Only then will the industry be able to convince the regulator that it can develop products to close that gap, in a regulatory framework that can prevent consumers being exposed to the misconduct seen during the royal commission.\n\nAnd of course, after all that, AMP and IOOF would face the even bigger challenge of selling these new services to a public that will want to be convinced the lessons of the royal commission have been learnt, and won\u2019t happen again.\n\nDe Ferrari and Mota have been telling their investors this is a two- or three-year journey. Even that might prove ambitious.", "description": "AMP and IOOF are taking their first, tentative steps towards filling the wealth advice gap they say is emerging as the sector hollows out.
