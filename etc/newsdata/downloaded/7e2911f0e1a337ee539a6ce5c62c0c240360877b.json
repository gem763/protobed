A prosecutor said allowing Hinckley to relocate to California for a music industry job would give the government \u201cgreat pause.\u201d\n\nHinckley spent decades living at a psychiatric hospital in Washington after being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting that injured Reagan and three others. But health professionals have said that the mental illness that the 25-year-old Hinckley was suffering from when he shot Reagan has been in full and stable remission for decades. U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman has said he is no longer a danger to himself or others and has gradually allowed him more time away from the hospital and more freedom.\n\nSince 2016, Hinckley has lived at his mother\u2019s home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley lives under a set of 30 conditions Friedman imposed including regular visits with mental health professionals. Friedman gets reports on how he\u2019s doing and, on Tuesday, said he believes some conditions can be loosened.\n\n\u201cSome conditions that are now in place don\u2019t need to be in place,\u201d the judge said, though he didn\u2019t specify which ones.\n\nHinckley\u2019s conditions include living within a 75-mile radius of Williamsburg, attending group and individual therapy sessions, volunteering or working at least three days a week and not speaking with the media.\n\nHinckley\u2019s lawyer Barry Levine said during Tuesday\u2019s approximately 40-minute hearing that he would file a motion seeking reduced conditions, though he didn\u2019t say when or what precisely he\u2019d ask for. He said he ultimately intends to ask that Hinckley be released without any conditions, and he said he would request that \u201cin due course.\u201d He acknowledged after the hearing, however, that getting the judge to grant Hinckley unconditional release would be a lengthy process.\n\nHinckley lives with his older brother Scott as well as his mother, who is in her 90s. According to court records he anonymously sells books online as well as items at an antique mall. Music has long been an interest for Hinckley, who plays guitar, writes music and sings. He participates in music therapy once a month. Under the conditions Friedman has imposed, however, he can\u2019t perform publicly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some talent,\u201d Levine said after the hearing, though he declined to elaborate on the kind of music industry job Hinckley might want.\n\nProsecutor Kacie Weston didn\u2019t go into detail about why the government would be concerned about a move to California for a music industry job. But that kind of move would put him far from a team of mental health professionals he has worked with for years, and Hinckley\u2019s underlying crime had a link to California\u2019s entertainment industry. Hinckley shot Reagan in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster.\n\nIn addition to a music industry job, Hinckley is interested in traveling, Levine said, possibly to visit his sister in Texas.\n\nThe judge said that while he\u2019d consider fewer restrictions, he wants answers about Hinckley\u2019s future. He asked about a plan for where Hinckley would live if his mother needs to move to an assisted living facility or dies. He also noted that Hinckley has benefited from the team of mental health professionals around him but said that some of them are considering retirement. He asked to know more about Hinckley\u2019s care going forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since 1981,\u201d Friedman said near the end of the hearing, adding that he believes Hinckley is ready for the \u201cnext step.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is what the next step is,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, is interested in getting a job in the music industry, possibly in California, his lawyer said at a court hearing in Washington on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jessica Gresko"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/john_hinckley_35637_c0-148-2000-1314_s1770x1032.jpg?f760cbf8a1a693bf4cc7512b7cccde55b4e3da3f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
