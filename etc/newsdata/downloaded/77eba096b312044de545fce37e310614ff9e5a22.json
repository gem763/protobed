His crime? Trying to pay for two pints in a British pub with Scottish money.\n\nA skeptical bartender instead had nudged him toward a credit-card reader on the bar top.\n\n\u201cI wish I had a pound\u201d\u2014an English one, that is\u2014\u201cfor every time I\u2019ve had to explain that they\u2019re okay,\u201d Mr. Swanson said, fishing out a debit card. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll keep this one for the taxi.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s going to keep trying\n\nScottish pounds have been printed in some form since before the country\u2019s union with England over 300 years ago. They are legitimate money, each backed by an equivalent value of Bank of England notes under guard at the central bank in London.\n\nBut merchants in Britain are free to refuse them. And they do.\n\n\u201cHave you got something else on you?\u201d said David Talbot, when offered a Scottish tenner at his west London fruit stall recently. He said other customers would be annoyed to receive them as change.\n\nBrexit is picking at old wounds. Britain voted to leave the European Union, but nearly two-thirds of people in Scotland voted to stay. Now, a narrow Scottish majority favors breaking away from Britain, according to one recent opinion poll, and others show growing support for the idea after the country rejected the idea in 2014.\n\nA wallpaper pattern made from Scottish banknotes.

Scottish comic Kevin Bridges offered up the name \u201csmackeroonies.\u201d\n\nTo defuse some of the tension and help keep Britain together, Scottish lawmaker Alistair Carmichael has proposed a new law to compel people across the U.K. to accept Scottish bank notes, no questions asked.\n\nThe bill is unlikely to be passed\u2014or even discussed\u2014any time soon, since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to suspend the U.K. Parliament as Britain prepares to leave the EU.\n\nMr. Carmichael\u2019s staff said that, like Scottish hero Robert the Bruce, he would try, and try again, once a new session begins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of whether your money\u2019s good or not. It\u2019s also about respect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been grumbling about it for years.\u201d\n\nScotland and England fought a series of wars from the 10th to 12th centuries that set the border they share roughly where it is today. They were formally united in 1707.\n\nAs the British empire began to shrink in the 20th century, Scotland started pushing for a better deal. Referendums in the 1970s and 1990s established some limited autonomy.\n\nMr. Carmichael, who represents the Orkney and Shetland islands off the country\u2019s craggy northeastern coast, reckons the nationalists could lose some of their momentum if the Scots\u2019 southern neighbors took their currency at face value.\n\nLawmaker Alistair Carmichael is pushing legislation to make people in England and other parts of Britain accept Scottish banknotes.

They match the shape and size of English notes, but instead of Queen Elizabeth, they feature Scottish icons like the poet Robert Burns or Robert the Bruce, who, legend has it, was inspired to fight for Scotland\u2019s independence in the 14th century after watching a spider rebuild its broken web over and over.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with bank notes printed by Northern Ireland\u2019s commercial banks, although those are less often seen in England. (Wales uses Bank of England notes.)\n\nThere are around \u00a34.4 billion-worth of Scottish bills in circulation, compared with \u00a370 billion of English pounds.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t \u201clegal tender,\u201d meaning that nobody is required to accept them as payment.\n\nWorse, many people in England\u2014around a third in one recent survey\u2014think they are fake.\n\nDozens of videos on YouTube and Facebook show people trying to pay for things in England with Scottish bank notes or attempting to swap them with English ones at foreign-exchange booths. Small shopkeepers often refuse them outright.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you ever had a Scottish pound rejected?

Squirrel pelts moved easily enough around medieval Russia; less so the 12-foot diameter limestone wheels that served as money on the Micronesian island of Yap, and which are still used today in traditional ceremonies.\n\nScottish notes were briefly designated as legal tender during World War I, when the British government wanted to encourage the use of paper money to prevent hoarding of gold.\n\nBut they lost their status in peacetime, and various legislative efforts in the 20th century to put them on even footing have failed.\n\nJudy Murray and Andy Murray at the practice courts at Wimbledon in July.

A Scottish tabloid photographed him holding up the offending note like it was an expired lottery ticket.\n\nMr. Kerr said he is inclined to support Mr. Carmichael\u2019s bill to expand the use of Scottish notes, though he prefers a public relations blitz over a legal one.\n\nCelebrity is no protection. Tennis coach Judy Murray, mother of Scotland\u2019s former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, took to Twitter this spring when her \u00a310 Bank of Scotland note was turned down in a London cake shop.\n\n\u201cWe only take British ones,\u201d she said the clerk told her.\n\nWrite to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.com", "description": "Despite 300 years of union, pounds from Scottish banks\u2014with icons such as Robert the Bruce and Robert Burns\u2014aren\u2019t legal tender in England; \u2018It does my head in, the number of times people hold up my money and inspect it.\u2019", "authors": ["James Hookway", "James.Hookway Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106656/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
