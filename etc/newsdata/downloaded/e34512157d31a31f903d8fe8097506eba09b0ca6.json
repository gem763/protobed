For millennials, specifically, research suggests that money and work are the biggest factors contributing to their stress.\n\nNow, a recent survey from Mind Share Partners, a nonprofit that works with companies to improve mental health resources, examines the effects that mental health issues can have on employees.\n\nFor the survey, 1,500 people ages 16 and older who are employed at a company with at least 11 employees answered questions online about their mental health.\n\nThe survey questions included how often they experience mental health symptoms (for example, \"sweating, rapid heartbeat, trembling, upset stomach, dizziness, or fainting\"), how it impacts their work and whether they felt like they have adequate mental health support and resources in their workplace.\n\nAccording to the findings, which are published in Harvard Business Review, 60% of people have experienced symptoms of mental health issues in the past year.\n\nFurther, half of millennial (defined in this survey as 23-38 years old) and 75% of Gen-Zer (18-22 years old) respondents have quit a job partially due to mental health reasons. (To put that in perspective, only 20% of the total survey respondents reported doing the same.) For baby boomers (55-73 years old), the number was the lowest, with less than 10% leaving a job for mental health-related reasons.", "description": "A new survey from Mind Share Partners examines how people's experience with mental health symptoms affect the workplace.", "authors": ["Cory Stieg"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106170494-1570553187857woman-studying-in-cafe_t20_a8dnpn.jpg?v=1570553241", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
