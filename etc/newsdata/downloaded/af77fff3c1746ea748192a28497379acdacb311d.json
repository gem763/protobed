I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.'\n\nIt is far from certain that the EU will grant the delay after Emmanuel Macron's office said yesterday before the letters were sent that another extension would be 'in the interest of no one'.\n\nRemain campaigners and opposition leaders immediately cried foul over the PM\u2019s actions as Brexit again appeared destined to end up in the courts.\n\nThe Scottish Court of Session is due to resume a hearing relating to the Brexit delay tomorrow.\n\nBut many pro-EU MPs subsequently claimed victory as they said that ultimately the PM had been forced to ask the EU for a delay despite him having said he would rather be dead in a ditch.\n\nThe government believes the premier has complied with the Benn Act but sources said they accepted they will probably have to defend the approach taken in front of judges.\n\nAny further legal challenge is expected to focus on whether Mr Johnson has frustrated the purpose of the anti-No Deal law.\n\nNot only did the PM not sign the Benn Act extension letter but he asked Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, to submit it for him.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s own letter was then sent directly to Mr Tusk and it set out the government\u2019s intention to push ahead with plans to try to hit the Halloween divorce date.\n\nBoris Johnson, pictured in the House of Commons yesterday, sent three letters to the EU last night\n\nBoris Johnson sent a letter to Donald Tusk last night making clear he does not want a Brexit delay\n\nSir Tim Barrow, the UK's ambassador to the EU, then submitted an unsigned photocopy of the Benn Act letter asking for a Brexit delay along with this cover note\n\nThe unsigned Benn Act letter asks the EU to grant a Brexit delay until January 31 next year\n\nDonald Tusk responded to the letters by saying he would now consider the extension request\n\nThe PM had hoped to persuade MPs to vote for his new Brexit deal yesterday during a special sitting of the House of Commons.\n\nBut he was unable to hold a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the accord after an amendment was passed which forced him to ask the EU for a delay.\n\nMr Johnson is now expected to try to force a 'meaningful vote' on his deal tomorrow afternoon but he could be blocked from doing so by Commons Speaker John Bercow.\n\nRegardless of what happens with Mr Bercow, the government will tomorrow table the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to actually make Brexit happen - with votes expected to take place on Tuesday.\n\nIf Mr Johnson is able to crash his Brexit legislation through parliament and win a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on his deal by the end of this week he could still stick to his \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge.\n\nBut if he fails - and if Brexit gets dragged through the courts - the EU will be forced to decide whether to offer a delay with the potential for an emergency summit in Brussels on October 28 just days before the deadline.\n\nThe EU is likely to keep its powder dry in terms of whether to offer a delay until it has seen whether Mr Johnson can win a vote on his deal.\n\nHowever, France last night signalled its opposition to a further Brexit extension amid a growing feeling on the continent that the UK's departure from the EU must be resolved once and for all.\n\nThe presidential Elysee Palace issued a statement before Mr Johnson sent his letters which said that there was nothing to be gained by prolonging a decision on Brexit.\n\nThe Elysee said that 'a supplementary delay is in the interest of no one'.\n\nMr Macron's office said that given that a deal has now been negotiated 'it's now up to the British Parliament to say if it approves or rejects it' and 'there must be a vote on the fundamentals'.\n\nLast week Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, also spoke out against another delay but Angela Merkel reportedly said that another extension would be inevitable if MPs vote against the deal.\n\nIn his letter to Mr Tusk, Mr Johnson said a further delay to Brexit would be 'corrosive'.\n\nJoanna Cherry labelled the PM's course of action 'pathetic' and then appeared to claim victory\n\nJolyon Maugham claimed the PM was acting like a 'spoilt child'\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor claimed the PM was 'treating Parliament and the Courts with contempt'\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit process? - Could Mr Johnson still get his deal through Parliament? Yes, but time is running out before the October 31 deadline as the European Parliament would also need to ratify it. Without a meaningful vote, support for the agreement has not yet been tested. Though the PM has attracted support from a number of prominent Brexiteer Tories, the DUP is strongly opposed to the deal. - If there is to be another vote, when will it happen? Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said the government wants to hold another meaningful vote on Mr Johnson's deal on Monday. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said he would consider whether to allow the government's plans. Welsh Labour MP Chris Bryant said, in a point of order, that it is not good practice for a Government to keep holding debates on the exact same subject. If a vote does happen, one unnamed Scottish opposition MP has been quoted as saying next week will not be a simple case of the Government just winning a vote on their new deal. \"We'll amend it (over and over). It'll be totally disfigured. A different bill entirely,\" the MP reportedly said. - What about the letters sent last night? Under the terms of the so-called Benn Act, which was passed against the PM's wishes, Mr Johnson was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension if he had not secured a deal by 11pm UK time on October 19. He told the Commons: \"I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\" But the Prime Minister did send two letters to European Council President Donald Tusk. First, there was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn Act, followed by a letter explaining why the Government did not actually want an extension. There was also an explanatory letter from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's ambassador to the EU, which was sent to Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union. - Will the EU agree to an extension? Despite European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker raising doubts over another Brexit delay, the decision needs to be taken by all 27 remaining EU states, not him. However, the EU could set a different length to an extension, either shorter or longer than the three-month one cited in the Benn Act. The EU could decide not to formally respond to such a letter from the PM until it sees if Mr Johnson can get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through Parliament next week. - Will there be an emergency EU summit? If the PM gets the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, there could be a special gathering of leaders on October 28. If the deal needs more time at that stage to get through Parliament, leaders could agree to a short extension.\n\nMaking clear his opposition, the PM said: 'While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister... my view, and the government's position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\n\n'We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbors and friends in this continent our people's share.'\n\nThe Benn Act letter asks the EU to grant a Brexit extension to the end of January next year.\n\nAs well as his wrecking letter, Mr Johnson last night called some of his European counterparts to make clear he does not want the EU to delay Brexit.\n\nA source told the Sunday Times the PM had said: 'This is parliament's letter. It is not my letter. Parliament is asking for a delay. I'm not asking for a delay.'\n\nThe course of action adopted by Mr Johnson after he was defeated in the Commons yesterday sparked immediate fury from his critics as the possibility of a legal challenge grew.\n\nJolyon Maugham QC, one of the people who brought the successful Supreme Court challenge over the unlawful prorogation of Parliament, said: 'The Prime Minister is behaving like a spoilt child who cannot do what he wants and so does gracelessly what he must.\n\n'But ultimately what matters is whether the EU accepts the request for an extension.'\n\nJoanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who has played a leading role in recent Brexit legal challenges including the one being heard tomorrow in Edinburgh, described the PM's approach as 'pathetic'.\n\nShe said there would be 'no need to raise new proceedings' against Mr Johnson because the existing case is back tomorrow.\n\nShe then claimed victory as she added: 'The political reality is that Boris Johnson has capitulated and requested an extension of Article 50.\n\n'The Benn Act and the sword of Damocles wielded by Scottish courts has worked.'\n\nOpposition politicians also responded angrily to Mr Johnson's decision to send three letters to the EU as they also threatened a legal challenge.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Johnson is a Prime Minister who is now treating Parliament and the Courts with contempt.\n\n'His juvenile refusal to even sign the letter confirms what we always suspected that Johnson with his arrogant sense of entitlement considers he is above the law and above accountability.'\n\nHe added: 'Message to Johnson. Nobody, no matter how high, is above the law and has the right to tear up our parliamentary constitution.'\n\nMr McDonnell told Sky News this morning that the PM 'may well be in contempt of Parliament'.\n\nHe said: 'Not signing the letter, he is behaving a bit like a spoilt brat... it flies in the face of both what Parliament and the courts have decided.'\n\nThe shadow chancellor suggested another attempt by the government to hold a 'meaningful vote' after yesterday's one was scuppered was likely to be blocked by Mr Bercow on the grounds that the PM had tried and failed to get his deal through the Commons.\n\n'I am not even sure the Speaker will allow it,' Mr McDonnell said.\n\nMr McDonnell told Sky News this morning that he believed Mr Johnson was 'behaving like a spoilt brat'\n\nNigel Farage told Sky News today that the three letters sent by Mr Johnson were 'not very prime ministerial' but suggested the PM was right to act the way he did\n\nHe said trying to hold the vote again would be 'pointless' and that the government should instead focus on bringing forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill so that MPs can see exactly what the PM is proposing.\n\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford echoed a similar sentiment as he said: 'After being defeated on his extreme Brexit deal earlier, Boris Johnson is now attempting to scheme his way out of due process with childish manoeuvres.\n\n'This is a Tory leader that is simply unfit for the office he holds. Boris Johnson is not above the law and if he does not fully abide by the Benn Act and secure an extension then we will see him in court.'\n\nBut Nigel Farage, the Brexit Party leader, defended the Prime Minister as he suggested sending the three letters was justified.\n\nTalking about the letters, he said: 'Not very prime ministerial but given the behaviour of Remainers in parliament, I think Boris Johnson is right to be pretty angry.'\n\nHowever, Mr Farage then described the PM's deal as 'rotten' as he said it should be rejected and it would be better to have a short extension in order to hold a general election.\n\nToday's fallout following the sending of the letters came after a dramatic day in Parliament yesterday which saw MPs vote in favour of an amendment forcing Mr Johnson to ask for a delay.\n\nThe amendment, put forward by Sir Oliver Letwin, was backed by 322 votes to 306.\n\nYesterday's crunch vote in the House of Commons took place as thousands of pro-EU campaigners demonstrated outside Parliament\n\nSenior politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg were then given a police guard when they left the parliamentary estate\n\nMichael Gove, the minister in charge of No Deal Brexit preparations, was pictured leaving parliament flanked by numerous police officers\n\nAndrea Leadsom, the Business Secretary, was also given police protection as she left Parliament\n\nIt stopped the Prime Minister from having a 'meaningful vote on his draft divorce accord, throwing a major spanner into the works.\n\nThe crunch vote in the Commons was held as thousands of pro-EU campaigners protested outside Parliament.\n\nThere were then ugly scenes as senior politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom had to be escorted off the parliamentary estate with a police guard.\n\nFootage emerged of Mr Rees-Mogg walking with his son in Westminster as campaigners yelled 'shame on you' as police acted as a barrier between the protestors and the politician.", "description": "European leaders are now considering their next move after\u00a0Boris Johnson blindsided Remainers and triggered major outrage last night as he sent the EU three letters in a bid to thwart a Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/08/19949076-0-image-a-35_1571556467087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
