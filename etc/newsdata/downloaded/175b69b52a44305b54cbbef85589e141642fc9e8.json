The debut of the collection will also be accompanied by a series of events at the school, such as talks by comic book authors and artists.\n\nThe collection includes a number of rarities, including Avengers #1, which depicted the first teamup of Stan Lee\u2019s creations in 1963, along with titles that introduced characters like Spider-man, Batman, Black Panther, Iron Man, and more. The university says that it\u2019s \u201cone of the largest collections of its kind,\u201d and that it\u2019s a \u201cphenomenal, transformational gift,\u201d according to associate dean of special collections at University Libraries Elizabeth Sudduth.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Post and Courier says that University archivists have begun going through the collection, a process that is expected to take years. The collection was the life\u2019s work of an Ohio collector named Gary Watson who began buying comics in 1958, and continued until his retirement in 2010. He had resisted the idea of breaking up the collection or selling it privately, and eventually began speaking with officials at The University of South Carolina. He told the paper that he\u2019s \u201cglad someone can take better care of them now.\u201d\n\nThe university notes that while it seems odd that such a collection might end up in the hands of an academic special collection, it\u2019s \u201cprecisely what special collections are really all about,\u201d according to Sudduth. David Shay, a cataloger for the school\u2019s Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, notes that \u201cComics are really reflective of American interests and anxieties,\u201d and that researchers can learn much about the contemporary attitudes on race, politics, and gender from them.", "description": "The University of South Carolina received an unusual gift recently: the entire collection of a comic book collector from Ohio, totaling more than 18,000 comics, books, magazines, and other items, estimated to be worth around $2.5 million.", "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-mPjVRolXwLwr0UyxARtFl-jyXU=/0x172:350x355/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16211995/story_image_05_avengers_cover.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-05"}
