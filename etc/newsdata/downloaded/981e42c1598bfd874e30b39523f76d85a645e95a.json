On Friday, at least 70 people were killed when a mosque in Nangarhar province was bombed.", "description": "European Union officials want a ceasefire in Afghanistan, saying the breakdown in talks presented an opportunity to push anew for a truce.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/wi/afp/11/e4721b_fifty-percent-us-military-veterans-war-in-afghanistan-was-not-worth-fighting-e1563483653612-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
