She was hired in 1940 as an assistant to the founder, Otto Kallir, an Austrian Jew who also had fled Nazi Europe, and after his death in 1978 served as co-director with his granddaughter Jane.\n\nMs. Bachert, who dedicated nearly her entire life to cultivating the legacies of artists who might otherwise have gone unnoticed or underappreciated, once remarked that she developed her \u201cconsciousness of art\u201d only after arriving in the United States when she was 15. \u201cAfter all,\u201d she said, before that time \u201cthere were other concerns.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe was 12 when Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 and initiated his campaign of anti-Semitic persecution. Three years later, according to an account of her life that she gave to the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Archives of American Art, she was expelled from her school because she was Jewish.\n\nJews were banned from the Kunsthalle Mannheim, the art museum in her hometown. Her youth notwithstanding, she said, she understood that modern art, deemed \u201cdegenerate\u201d under National Socialism, had become taboo.\n\nHer father, a lawyer, saw the \u201chandwriting on the wall,\u201d Ms. Bachert said in the 1993 Smithsonian oral history, and sent her and her older sister to the United States, where a relative had agreed to help support them. In New York, Ms. Bachert learned English, completed high school and reveled in the cultural offerings of the city\u2019s libraries and concert halls. She wore out the old-world clothing she had brought from Europe, she said, to spend what little money she had on student tickets to Carnegie Hall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMs. Bachert also frequented the city\u2019s art galleries and worked for Karl Nierendorf, a German gallery owner who at the time was struggling to sell the works of now-celebrated modern artists including Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, before Otto Kallir hired her.\n\nKallir had run the Neue Galerie in Vienna, where he showed the works of artists including Vincent van Gogh and Edvard Munch and championed the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele, among others. In the United States, Kallir encountered an art world where \u201cFrench art was \u2018in\u2019 and German art was \u2018out,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Bachert once told the online art publication NeotericArt.\n\n\u201cIt was also because of the war going on in the 1940s,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was great antagonism to German art.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt Galerie St. Etienne, Kallir, with Ms. Bachert\u2019s help, mounted the first solo shows in the United States of Schiele (1941) and Klimt (1959). Today, both are recognized as giants of modernism and command accordingly giant sums.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2006, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir and art collector, paid a reported $135 million \u2014 the highest price ever fetched by a painting at the time \u2014 for a shimmering gold Klimt portrait of the Viennese hostess Adele Bloch-Bauer. The painting had been the subject of one of the most high-profile restitution claims involving artwork looted during the Holocaust, a story dramatized in the 2015 film \u201cWoman in Gold\u201d starring Helen Mirren. The painting is housed in Lauder\u2019s Neue Galerie in Manhattan, whose name is an homage to Kallir\u2019s Viennese gallery.\n\nGrandma Moses \u2014 her real name was Anna Mary Robertson Moses \u2014 was brought to Kallir\u2019s attention by Louis Caldor, an amateur collector who had stumbled on a sampling of her bucolic folk art at a drugstore in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. Moses had taken up painting well into her older age and pursued her hobby in obscurity until Caldor promised to make her famous.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKallir loved America \u201cas only a refugee can,\u201d according to the gallery, and saw in Moses \u201can artist capable of capturing the authentic spirit of his new homeland.\u201d Galerie St. Etienne gave Moses her first one-person show in 1940, a month before Ms. Bachert was hired, when Moses was 80. Thus began a relationship that lasted until Moses died at 101, so famous that she was often compared to Norman Rockwell.\n\nMs. Bachert became the gallery\u2019s chief contact for Moses and recalled going strawberry-picking with her, as well as assisting her with her autobiography, \u201cMy Life\u2019s History,\u201d which Kallir edited.\n\n\u201cPeople often brand her work as nostalgic. It may be so for them. But Grandma Moses was not nostalgic. She was among the most unsentimental persons I ever knew,\u201d Ms. Bachert once told the Hartford Courant. \u201cShe had so much common sense and knowledge of life, and all that came through in her pictures.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHildegard Gina Bachert was born in Mannheim on April 3, 1921. Her parents survived the Nazi attacks of Kristallnacht before joining their daughters in the United States, where her father, a former lawyer, became blind, and her mother helped support the family as a seamstress.\n\nEven with a scholarship to Oberlin College in Ohio, Ms. Bachert did not have enough money to pursue university studies. She took free classes at Hunter College in New York City while working. Her first job was as a housekeeper and nanny for a doctor\u2019s family. \u201cI lasted three days,\u201d she said in the Smithsonian oral history. \u201cLuckily for art.\u201d\n\nJane Kallir credited Ms. Bachert with assisting the gallery in its efforts to help return artwork looted by Nazis to their former Jewish owners or their heirs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe was someone who had actually lived through part of the Nazi time in Germany and who knew all of these people who had been robbed by the Nazis,\u201d Jane Kallir said in an interview. Speaking of the German and Austrian Expressionist artwork that Ms. Bachert had sought to preserve, Kallir observed that \u201cboth for Hildegard and for my grandfather, this was an important part of their heritage that the Nazis had tried to destroy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMs. Bachert never married and had no immediate survivors. She stayed so long with Galerie St. Etienne, she said, because \u201cI felt fulfilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt that my potential was tapped,\u201d she said in the Smithsonian oral history, \u201cthat I was able to give \u2026 And that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "The Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany dedicated nearly her entire life to cultivating the legacies of artists who might otherwise have gone unnoticed or underappreciated.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zugaAkl91hCun1MOpvyF0xx_2Wo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z5MML3XYDQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
