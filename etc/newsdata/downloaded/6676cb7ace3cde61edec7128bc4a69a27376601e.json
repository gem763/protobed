Max Rose (D-N.Y.) told roughly 150 constituents on Wednesday evening at the beginning of a town hall hearing on transportation, to loud cheers and a smattering of standing ovations from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna follow these facts wherever they lead, no matter the consequences!\u201d Rose continued.\n\nAs one of only 11 Democratic members of the House of Representatives not to openly support the impeachment inquiry, Rose has cut a lonely figure on Capitol Hill in recent days. But as a Democratic member of the House of Representatives representing New York City and opposing the impeachment inquiry into the city\u2019s most loathed son, Rose may have been the loneliest man in American politics.\n\nAt the town hall at the Jewish Community Center on Staten Island, Rose faced constituents for the first time since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump, following revelations that he pressured the president of Ukraine to partner with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in digging up dirt on former vice president and current Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden.\n\nIn the days that followed Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Rose stood, like his Staten Island-based district, as a lone beachhead in the midst of a tide of progressive anger over his does-he-or-doesn\u2019t-he public stance on the impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\n\u201cI have opposed a rush to judgment to date because the American people deserve to know that when this country is in crisis, we\u2019re gonna act responsibly and deliberately, especially when it involves impeachment,\u201d Rose said at the outset of the town hall.\n\nBut, Rose continued, the apparent attempts by the Trump administration to thwart the congressional investigation into the Ukraine scandal is \u201cabsolutely unacceptable,\u201d and attempts by Republicans in Congress to provide cover indicates that they \u201chave chosen to serve their own party\u201d over country.\n\n\u201cYou just want to scream\u2014if I had hair, I\u2019d want to rip it out,\u201d joked Rose, who keeps his head shaved.\n\nAfter Rose announced his support for the impeachment inquiry, \u201cwherever it leads,\u201d one constituent stood up, shout-asking whether Rose had supported Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy whose dossier into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged coordination with the Kremlin helped kickstart public support for the 18-month investigation into the president by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe man, who later handed out pamphlets for LaRouchePAC, the political action committee of late perennial presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, was quickly shouted down by other attendees, who directed him to write his question on a piece of paper that would be drawn from a reusable grocery bag like everyone else.\n\n\u201c Rose has made a slow move toward supporting the impeachment inquiry that illustrates the quandary he and other Democratic members of Congress who represent swing districts face. \u201d\n\nNine months into his first term in Congress, Rose has made a slow move toward supporting the impeachment inquiry that illustrates the quandary he and other Democratic members of Congress who represent swing districts face: Is it better to invite Republican anger over supporting impeachment or to invite Democratic anger over not supporting impeachment?\n\nOf the 11 members of the House of Representatives who hail from New York City, Rose represents the city\u2019s most Republican district\u2014its only Republican district, really. Composed of of the borough of Staten Island and Brooklyn\u2019s suburban-esque southwestern edge, Rose\u2019s district is New York\u2019s whitest (nearly three in four constituents are Caucasian), most conservative (Rose is only its second Democratic representative in 30 years), and sole Trump-friendly (the president bested Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 10 points) congressional district.\n\nRose, who ran on kitchen-table issues like infrastructure improvements, has pointedly denied any role that the political geography of his right-leaning district might play in his stance on impeachment. In an opinion piece published on Sept. 12\u2014before revelations of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky broke the dam on impeachment\u2014Rose wrote that his fellow Democrats were \u201cat risk of repeating a similar bait-and-switch mistake by focusing on impeachment instead of infrastructure, healthcare costs, and putting people to work with livable wages and benefits.\u201d\n\nEven after the White House released the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky\u2014in which the president requested that the newly elected Zelensky \u201cdo me a favor\u201d by investigating unproven allegations of corruption against Biden and his son, Hunter\u2014Rose has carefully danced around coming out in support of the inquiry.\n\nOn Sept. 24, Rose released a carefully worded statement declaring that \u201cthe American people deserve the truth and Congress needs the facts,\u201d calling on the administration to release \u201call documents related to the whistleblower case.\u201d Three days later, as calls for Democratic unity in the impeachment inquiry rose in volume to a roar, Rose released a second statement, refusing to \u201coperate on any false timeline when our national security is at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy constituents\u2014and our country\u2014deserve members of Congress who will review the facts and ensure the American people are fully informed,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThis story is far from over and we must proceed in a deliberate and responsible manner... Under no circumstances will I allow politics to influence my decision regarding this matter.\u201d\n\nRose steadily denied that politics play any role in his initial refusal to come out in support of the impeachment inquiry, and denied on Wednesday that his about-face was the result of political pressure.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I will ever do is base any decision that I make, or any speed with which I make that decision, off of political calculation,\u201d Rose told reporters on Capitol Hill on Friday, calling the formation of the inquiry \u201ca sad day for America.\u201d\n\nBut like the 10 other Democrats who are holding off on joining their colleagues in backing the inquiry\u2014let alone impeachment outright\u2014Rose represents a right-leaning district, one that Republicans are eager to bring back into the fold.\n\n\u201c Talk to any political expert, and they would not say that what I am doing right now is the most politically astute thing that I could do. \u201d \u2014 Rep. Max Rose\n\nRepublican Assemblymember Nicole Malliotakis has already declared her candidacy for the party\u2019s nomination for the seat, and Trump himself has indicated that Rose\u2019s seat is high on his wish list. On Friday, Trump retweeted an attack ad posted by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniels, in which Rose was blasted for seeking \u201cendless investigations.\u201d Trump re-retweeted the same advertisement two days later, promising that Republicans will \u201cwin big\u201d in 2020, particularly against Democratic incumbents in \u201cTrump type districts\u201d who support his ouster.\n\nBut as the chasmic partisan gap on impeachment widens\u2014polling indicates that roughly four in five Democrats support impeaching Trump, while nine in 10 Republicans oppose it\u2014Rose\u2019s refusal to come out in support of the inquiry poses its own problems. While an overly aggressive stance on impeachment could inflame Republicans in his district who still support the president, dodging support for the inquiry could weaken his support among the voters who made him a congressman, or even raise the risk of a Democratic primary opponent from the left. Nearly the entire margin of his 2018 victory came from the more liberal Brooklyn section of his district, which means that losing those voters could be perilous.\n\nRose, for his part, isn\u2019t worried about either possibility.\n\n\u201cTalk to any political expert, and they would not say that what I am doing right now is the most politically astute thing that I could do,\u201d Rose told reporters after the event, asked whether his turnaround was politically motivated.\n\nAs for the president\u2019s tweeted attacks, Rose encouraged him to keep them coming.\n\n\u201cI am not concerned at all by the NRCC or anyone that wants to try and challenge me, because they already tried once and we kicked their ass,\u201d Rose said pugnaciously. Instead of worrying about Trump-won districts, he said, Republicans in swing districts should try to find their conscience, Rose said: \u201cShow some semblance of courage, take a political risk, and join in support for this impeachment inquiry.\u201d", "description": "As one of only 11 Democratic House not to openly support the inquiry, Max Rose has cut a lonely figure on Capitol Hill.
