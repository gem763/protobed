On New Year\u2019s Eve ringing in 2013, several armed individuals stole over $US1.32 ($2) million worth of Apple products from a Paris store several hours after it was closed, taking nearly 40 minutes to move items from the stock room to a getaway car.\n\nIn 2017, three dudes stole up to 313 iPhone X devices that were reportedly in a UPS truck outside of an Apple Store in San Francisco during broad daylight. That amounts to more than $US370,000 ($550,800).\n\nAnd in perhaps the most impressive theft, four people stole more than $US27,000 ($40,193) in iPhones and MacBooks from an Apple Store in Fresno, California by simply running in and grabbing the devices from the display tables. It all happened in under thirty seconds.\n\n\u201cBy supporting or by buying these black-market products, you\u2019re ultimately causing these burglaries to occur because you\u2019re generating this market where people can buy technology cheap,\u201d Whelan said, ABC News reported, \u201cso that makes this group of people want to do this again.\u201d", "description": "Early Tuesday morning, six people broke into two Apple stores in Western Australia by smashing the glass enclosure with a sledgehammer, according to surveillance footage....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Leah Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/cyl8bzvn02hqtt58n5dr.jpg"}
