Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in a tweet, Aug. 9\n\nHarris tweeted about the fifth anniversary of the \u201cmurder\u201d of Michael Brown. Within minutes, Warren followed, saying \u201cBrown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth appear to be echoing a narrative that emerged shortly after Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Brown, 18. The legal definition of murder varies according to jurisdiction, but generally it means killing someone with malice aforethought.\n\nIn November 2014, a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson after finding that witness reports did not match with evidence. On March 4, 2015, the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department issued an 86-page investigative report, based on testimony from 40 witnesses and a review of forensic evidence, on the shooting that concluded \u201cthere is no credible evidence that Wilson willfully shot Brown as he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat.\u201d\n\nThe same day, the Justice Department also published the results of its investigation into the Ferguson Police Department, which highlighted systemic exploitation and racial profiling of black residents in Ferguson, such as racial disparities in traffic stops even though black drivers were less likely to be found with contraband.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHarris and Warren, who are both seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, appear to accept the results of one report and not the other.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere is little dispute about how the tragedy started. In midday, Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, went to Ferguson Market & Liquor. Brown, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 290 pounds, reached across the counter, seized packages of cigarillos and shoved the clerk, who notified police.\n\nWilson initially encountered the pair when they were walking in the middle of the street, and he told them to get on the sidewalk. He then realized they were suspects in the robbery he had heard on the police radio and backed his vehicle, an SUV, to stop them from walking any farther. Brown then reached through the open driver\u2019s window and punched and grabbed Wilson, according to the report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere were numerous witnesses deemed credible by investigators. (Others were found not to be credible because their accounts were inconsistent or did not match the forensic evidence.) We will let their accounts, taken from the Justice Department report, tell the rest of the story. Some testified reluctantly, with one recounting signs on the street where Brown was shot that said: \u201csnitches get stitches.\u201d\n\nWitness 102, a 27-year-old biracial man: \u201cBrown was \u2018wrestling\u2019 through the window, but he was unable to see what Wilson was doing. After a few seconds, Witness 102 heard a gunshot. ... Witness 102 thought that he had just witnessed the murder of a police officer because a few seconds passed before Wilson emerged from the SUV.\u201d\n\n(Brown had tried to grab Wilson\u2019s gun but ended up getting shot in one of his hands, the report said: \u201cAutopsy results and bullet trajectory, skin from Brown\u2019s palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Brown\u2019s DNA on the inside of the driver\u2019s door corroborate Wilson\u2019s account that during the struggle, Brown used his right hand to grab and attempt to control Wilson\u2019s gun.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitness 103, a 58-year-old black man: The witness \u201csaw Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver\u2019s window of the SUV. Witness 103 described Wilson and Brown as having hold of each other\u2019s shirts, but Brown was \u2018getting in a couple of blows.\u2019 Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running.\u201d\n\nWitness 104, a 26-year-old biracial woman: The witness \u201cheard two gunshots. She looked out the front window and saw Brown at the driver\u2019s window of Wilson\u2019s SUV. Witness 104 knew that Brown\u2019s arms were inside the SUV, but she could not see what Brown and Wilson were doing because Brown\u2019s body was blocking her view. Witness 104 saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \u2018hopped\u2019 out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling, \u2018stop, stop, stop.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWitness 102: \u201cWilson then chased Brown with his gun drawn, but not pointed at Brown, until Brown abruptly turned around at a nearby driveway. Witness 102 explained that it made no sense to him why Brown turned around. Brown did not get on the ground or put his hands up in surrender. ... Brown made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug, and then \u2018charged\u2019 at Wilson.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitness 103: He \u201csaw Brown \u2018moving fast\u2019 toward Wilson.\u201d\n\nWitness 104: \u201cWilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \u2018for a second\u2019 began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \u2018balled up in fists\u2019 in a running position and \u2018charged\u2019 at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \u2018tackle run,\u2019 explaining that Brown \u2018wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u2019 Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him.\u201d\n\nWitness 105, a 50-year-old black woman: \u201cWilson told Brown to \u2018get down,\u2019 but Brown did not comply. Instead, Brown put his hands down \u2018in a running position.\u2019 Witness 105 could not tell whether Brown was \u2018charging\u2019 at Wilson or whether his plan was to run past Wilson, but either way, Brown was running toward Wilson. ... Wilson only shot at Brown when Brown was moving toward him.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitness 108, a 74-year-old black man: This man, a reluctant witness, confided to a friend that he \u201c'would have f------ shot that boy, too.\u2019 In saying so, Witness 108 mimicked an aggressive stance with his hands out in front of him, as though he was about to charge.\u201d He did not come forward to police, but detectives tracked him down and he reluctantly \"explained that Wilson told Brown to \u2018stop\u2019 or \u2018get down\u2019 at least ten times, but instead Brown \u2018charged\u2019 at Wilson.\u201d\n\nWitness 104: \u201cWilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained that it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she \u2018would have fired sooner.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWitness 102: \u201cWilson only fired shots when Brown was coming toward Wilson. It appeared to Witness 102 that Wilson\u2019s life was in jeopardy. ... Witness 102 said he wanted to \u2018bring closure to [Brown\u2019s] family,\u2019 so they would not think that the officer \u2018got away with murdering their son.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitness 105: \u201cShe explained that she was coming forward because in speaking with her neighbors, she realized that what they believed had happened was inconsistent with what actually happened. She further explained that she had not been paying attention to media accounts, and had been unaware of the inaccuracies being reported.\u201d\n\nIn the report, Johnson is listed as Witness 101. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, he stood by his story that Brown had \u201cput his hands in the air\u201d but that Wilson approached him with his weapon drawn and shot him. The Justice Department report, citing witness statements, said Johnson did not appear to be in a position to see what happened because he fled as soon as the first shots were fired.\n\nWitness 102: He \"did not see Brown\u2019s friend, Witness 101, at any time during the incident until Witness 101 \u2018came out of nowhere,\u2019 shouting, 'They just killed him!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitness 104: The witness \u201cfirst saw Brown\u2019s friend, Witness 101, when he took off running as soon as the first two shots were fired. She never saw him again.\u201d\n\nThe report added: \u201cOther witnesses who have suggested that Brown was shot with his hands up in surrender have either recanted their statements, such as Witnesses 119 and 125, provided inconsistent statements, such as Witness 124, or have provided accounts that are verifiably untrue, such as Witnesses 121, 139, and 132.\u201d\n\nThe report said the ballistics analysis showed that the officer \u201cfired a total of 12 shots, two from his vehicle and ten on the roadway,\u201d in \u201cthree gunshot volleys.\u201d The autopsy found Wilson\u2019s shots struck Brown \u201cas few as six or as many as eight times,\u201d killing him. But, the report said, \u201cThere is no credible evidence to refute Wilson\u2019s stated subjective belief that he was acting in self-defense.\u201d\n\nWe repeatedly sought comment from the Harris and Warren campaigns but did not get a response. We should note that two other presidential contenders, Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, accurately said that Brown was \u201ckilled\u201d By Wilson in their anniversary tweets.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nOne can certainly raise questions about whether Wilson should have fired as many shots as he did or acted appropriately under the circumstances. The racial profiling by the Ferguson Police Department is well documented and fair game for criticism.\n\nBut Harris and Warren have ignored the findings of the Justice Department to accuse Wilson of murder, even though the Justice Department found no credible evidence to support that claim.\n\nInstead, the Justice Department found that the popular narrative was wrong, according to witnesses deemed to be credible, some of whom testified reluctantly because of fear of reprisal. The department produced a comprehensive report to determine what happened, making the senators\u2019 dismissal of it even more galling. Harris and Warren both earn Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "description": "The Obama Justice Department found \u201cno credible evidence\" that the police officer willfully shot Brown \"as he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat.\"", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4wKlOZaRDETeLTVU0ERI0TPufD8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XLZM67FZTAI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-13"}
