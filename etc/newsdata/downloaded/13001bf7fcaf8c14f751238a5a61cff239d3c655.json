Devis asked for a biopsy and was diagnosed with stage 2 triple-negative breast cancer. Pictured, left and right: Devis undergoing chemotherapy\n\nAccording to a press release, Devis discovered a painful lump in her left breast in March 2019, during her first trimester, that was hard to the touch.\n\nHer doctor sent her to a radiologist, who said the lump was likely a symptom of her pregnancy, but Devis stuck to her guns and asked for a biopsy.\n\n'If I had ignored it, I would have been dead,' she said.\n\nA couple of weeks later, the results of Devis's biopsy came back: a diagnosis of stage 2 triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nOne out of every eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nMore than 268,000 cases are estimated be diagnosed in 2019 and more than 41,700 people will die.\n\nIt is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, behind lung cancer. Breast cancer does also occur in men but the incidence rate is less than one percent.\n\nTriple-negative breast cancer is a rare form of breast cancer in which the cancer growth is not fueled by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, or by the HER2 protein.\n\nDevis was told her baby was likely too young to survive treatment, but she refused to terminate her pregnancy. Pictured: Devis with her newborn son\n\nThis means tumors don't respond to hormonal therapy medicines or medicines that target the HER2 protein, making the cancer more aggressive and difficult to treat.\n\nDevis underwent surgery in April to remove the lump, after which she was told she would need chemotherapy.\n\n'I had parent guilt. I felt bad for already feeling bad,' she told Good Morning America.\n\n'Then, someone tells you the only way out of the situation [is] by doing one thing you're not supposed to do, and that puts your baby in harm's way.'\n\nAccording to a Facebook post, Devis was told her baby wasn't big enough or strong enough to survive the treatment.\n\nDuring the first trimester, chemotherapy can increase the risk of birth defects - because the organs are still growing - or miscarriage.\n\nHowever, during the second and third trimesters, the placenta acts as a barrier as a barrier to let no or small amounts of drugs through to the baby.\n\nEventually she sought treatment at Loma Linda University Cancer Center, where doctors came up with a plan to save both Devis and her son.\n\nDr Gayathri Nagaraj, Devis's oncologist at Loma Linda, told Good Morning America that, with modifications, a pregnant women can undergo chemotherapy during the second and third trimesters.\n\n'She received three cycles of chemo during the second and third trimesters of her pregnancy,' Dr Nagaraj said.\n\n'We took a full week break so she could safely deliver baby Bradley. Now she's completing the remainder of her chemo.'\n\nBradley was born on July 25 weighing six pounds, 11 ounces and with no complications.\n\nShe underwent surgery to remove the lump and then three months of chemotherapy before giving birth to a healthy baby boy name Bradley on July 25.

Photo courtesy of KTLA\n\nA photo went viral of Devis lying in bed with her son - her head bald after chemotherapy treatments - and kissing him.\n\n'My baby boy is my miracle child,' Devis said in a statement.\n\n'It is surreal to remember that my pregnancy had an element of extraordinary fear. I am blessed when I look at my son, and I cannot ask for more than that.'\n\nDr Nagaraj said Devis will begin radiation therapy next month and will complete chemotherapy in November.\n\n'There's no need to wait until the baby is delivered and give your cancer a chance to grow,' she told Good Morning America, referring to chemotherapy during later stages of pregnancy.\n\n'There are risks, but there are benefits. Jade did great. She took all the medical support we offered her and she remains strong. I think this story is worth telling because of all the women her and Bradley would inspire.'\n\nA GoFundMe page has been started to help cover the cost of Devis's medical treatments. As of Monday morning, more than $2,300 has been raised out of a $50,000 goal.", "description": "Jade Devis, 36, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, was diagnosed with stage 2 triple-negative breast cancer, a rare form of the disease, just a few months after learning that she was pregnant.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/20282962-0-image-a-20_1572272620729.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
