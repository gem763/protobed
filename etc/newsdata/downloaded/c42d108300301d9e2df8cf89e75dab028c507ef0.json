Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTurkey's military launched an offensive in northern Syria last week after the White House announced that U.S. troops would not be \"in the immediate area.\"\n\nThe announcement of the U.S. troop withdrawal sparked bipartisan criticism, with lawmakers saying the decision threatened both national security and allies.\n\nTrump said in a Sunday tweet that the Treasury Department was \"ready to go\" with sanctions against Turkey. The president has threatened economic sanctions if Turkey treated Syrian Kurds, which allied with the U.S. in the fight against ISIS, inhumanely.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said Sunday that his department could move forward \u201cat a moment\u2019s notice\u201d with sanctions.\n\n\"We are in daily communications with Turkey, both at the Defense Department, the State Department, on very specific issues. We are ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice to put on sanctions,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cAnd as I\u2019ve said, these sanctions could be starting small, they could be maximum pressure, which would destroy the Turkish economy,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, ISIS has claimed responsibility for at least two attacks since the fighting in northern Syria began.\n\nA Kurdish leader previously said in an op-ed that the U.S. had \"betrayed\" the Kurds and that forces guarding ISIS prisoners would need to be \"redirected\" to combat the Turkish military.", "description": "President Trump\u00a0in a tweet early Monday vowed that \"big sanctions\" on Turkey are coming after\u00a0its military launched an offensive in Northern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
