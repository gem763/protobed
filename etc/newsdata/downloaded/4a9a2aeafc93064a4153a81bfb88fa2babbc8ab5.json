A little part of my soul dies every time I have to buy one of those \u201creusable\u201d plastic bags to carry my groceries because I know full well it\u2019ll end up in the bin eventually.\n\nBut apparently I\u2019m not the only person that feels like a total asshole when I have to grab a plastic bag, because Woolies is bringing back their paper bags after popular demand.\n\nThe bad news? The paper bags will set you back 20c instead of 15c for the plastic ones.\n\nThe good news? They\u2019re reusable and recyclable and you don\u2019t need to feel like a piece of shit for using them when you inevitably forget your own.\n\nThe bags are made of 80% recycled paper, and the 20% virgin paper is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, so you know it\u2019s sustainably sourced.\n\nUnlike the current plastic bags, that can only be recycled in-store, you can simply chuck your paper bag in the recycling bin at home and know it\u2019ll be taken care of.\n\nObviously, they\u2019re still not as good as the truly reusable fabric bags, but if you\u2019re in a pinch and you don\u2019t want to drive all the way home to grab your bags, they\u2019re a great alternative.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our customers bring their own bags to shop, but we know there are occasions when they forget or visit our stores unplanned,\u201d a Woolworths spokesperson told 7NEWS.\n\n\u201cSome customers have told us they would like the option of a paper bag when this happens.\u201d\n\nUnder the trial, selected Woolworths stores will offer the fabric Bag for Good, the 15c plastic bag and the 20c paper alternative. You\u2019re spoilt for choice.\n\nObviously, some people are complaining. Shocking, right? People complaining about something good for the planet?\n\nImage: GiphyBut we\u2019ve got options here, paper, plastic, fabric. The world is your oyster.\n\nPaper bags are currently on trial at 21 stores across the country. If your local Woolies is one of these, your conscience can officially be free of that plastic bag regret.\n\nRouse Hill, NSW\n\nMarrickville Metro, NSW\n\nTown Hall, NSW\n\nNeutral Bay , NSW\n\nDouble Bay, NSW\n\nCairns, QLD\n\nSurfers Paradise, QLD\n\nPacific Fair, QLD\n\nSouth Yarra, VIC\n\nQV, VIC\n\nBurwood Brickworks, VIC\n\nBondi, NSW\n\nRozelle, NSW\n\nCoogee, NSW\n\nPaddington, NSW\n\nRose Bay , NSW\n\nArmadale, VIC\n\nBlack Rock, VIC\n\nHawksburn, VIC\n\nSt Kilda, VIC\n\nHawthorn, VIC", "description": "Supermarket giant Woolworths is trialling the return of reusable paper bags after shoppers voiced their desire for a more eco-friendly choice.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-154734079-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
