While the horror didn\u2019t open to great reviews, it was Aniston\u2019s first starring role in a movie and marked a huge turning point for the actress.\n\n\u201cI really thought I arrived when I did Leprechaun,\u201d she told host Howard Stern. \u201cIt was with Warwick Davis, the guy from Willow was in it. It was a big deal!\u201d\n\nBut while most actors prefer to never watch their early work again, Aniston was forced to revisit the movie when her ex-husband made her sit through it early on in their relationship.\n\nRELATED: Justin Theroux Wishes Ex Jennifer Aniston a Happy Birthday: \u2018Fiercely Loving.
