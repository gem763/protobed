I wish to clarify the Nissan position about that.\n\n\u201cWe have been working together in Europe to define all the risks associated with Brexit coming in and we think we are all really well prepared.\n\n\u201cI think from an operational point of view we have worked in order to prepare for all the different scenarios.\u201d\n\nBut Nissan was unable to make plans for the future due to uncertainty about where models will be built.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
