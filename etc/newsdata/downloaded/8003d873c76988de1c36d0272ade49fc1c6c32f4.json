The vast majority of those endangered malls are in lower-income, less-densely-populated parts of the country, and are anchored by failing chains like Sears, says Ellen Dunham-Jones, a scholar at Georgia Tech.\n\nAs the malls empty out and foot traffic wanes, shoppers outside of large metros will be with few retail options beyond big box stores and a smattering of dollar stores.\n\nThe big dollar chains, Dollar Tree and Dollar General, already have 30,000 locations, primarily in lower-income neighborhoods, across the country \u2014 and each say they're adding 1,000 per year.\n\nYes, but: Other big retailers are eager to capitalize on hollowed-out malls, too. Amazon is reportedly seeking out vacant Sears locations to put new Whole Foods stores. And fewer physical retail choices could mean a greater reliance on e-commerce services in some areas.\n\nWhy it's happening: Growing inequality in the U.S. has dramatically impacted retail. The bottom 90% has only 20% of the wealth, while the top 1% has upped its share to 40%.\n\nAnd Americans' discretionary income is shrinking. Income levels aren't substantially increasing, even as more expenses cut into monthly budgets. People are spending their extra money on smartphones, data plans and Netflix subscriptions instead of clothes, toys and books, says Deloitte's Lobaugh.\n\nThe bottom line: \"If you're living in a neighborhood that's doing well in a prosperous metro area, you're oblivious to what's happening in Tulsa and Dayton,\" says Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.\n\nGo deeper: Dollar stores thrive in distressed pockets of America", "description": "The future of retail will worsen inequality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/xwP7ohs86vGcIMaTM-qF2R7w2Y4=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/01/22/1548187228720.gif", "published_at": "2019-01-23"}
