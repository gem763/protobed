The EU has adopted a similar stance.\n\nJohnson's current plan is thought to include checks on some goods, but not on the border itself.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo\u00a0Varadkar\u00a0say that a Brexit deal is \"possible\" after they sat down for a meeting Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/borisjohnson_07242019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
