Assassins on Mexico\u2019s Heroin Highway", "language": "en", "text": "OCOTITO, Mexico \u2014 On an early spring morning, in the desert of Mexico\u2019s southwestern Guerrero state, a half-dozen rusty pickups speed toward a line of late-model 4x4s blocking the road.\n\nAs armed men leap from the truck beds, the drivers swing across the tarmac, forming an opposing blockade of ancient Nissans and Ford Rangers.\n\nCrouched behind their respective barricades, their elbows propped on hoods and fenders to steady their aim, some 40 men now draw down on each other with every kind of firearm imaginable: bolt-action hunting rifles, automatic shotguns, old-fashioned six-shooters, Uzis and M16s, even a few AK47s.\n\nIt\u2019s just a few hours after dawn in these jagged foothills; the temperature is already in the mid-80s and climbing fast\u2014but the tempers of the men facing off behind their vehicles are rising even faster.\n\n\u201cCobardes! Traidores!\u201d shout those enfiladed behind the big-wheeled, showroom-new 4x4s. Cowards! Traitors!\n\n\u201cCartel assassins!\u201d comes the response in Spanish from the line of old trucks on this forlorn stretch of Interstate 95 \u2013 the so-called Heroin Highway, considered so dangerous that the U.S. State Department lists it as off-limits to American citizens.\n\nAt least half of all the heroin produced in Mexico comes from Guerrero, much of it traveling southwest along I-95 to the Pacific port of Acapulco, where it\u2019s packaged and shipped north. Mexican state and federal police have so far proven themselves unwilling or unable to challenge cartel supremacy in Guerrero \u2013 forcing a growing number of the state\u2019s citizens to fend for themselves.\n\nThe deadlocked gunmen on the highway this morning are citizens from rival factions. They\u2019re \u201ccommunity police\u201d \u2013 those on one side allied with law enforcement and those on the other said to back local drug traffickers. This is what vigilante justice often looks like in rural Mexico, where state authorities provide little more than a fever dream of security.\n\nUp until a few months ago, the United Front for the Security and Development of Guerrero (FUSDEG) and the Union of Organized Peoples and Organizations of Guerrero (UPOEG) were on the same team. But they parted ways last December, over UPOEG leadership\u2019s use of torture and charges of affiliation with organized crime. Now the former allies are at war.\n\nThe night before the highway showdown, there was a palaver over militia jurisdiction in the nearby town of San Juan del Reparo, after which UPOEG allegedly opened fire on a FUSDEG column as it was leaving the village. In the ensuing battle, UPOEG lost two men and FUSDEG lost six, with four more wounded. Of the FUSDEG fallen, one was beheaded and another had his face peeled off\u2014an increasingly common cartel tactic. Scores of prisoners were taken by both sides.\n\nA few hours later, out on the highway, the standoff is about to boil over. As the taunts crescendo and gunfire seems imminent, a wide-shouldered campesino in battered spectacles\u2014his flak jacket reinforced with salvaged sheet metal\u2014steps out with a walkie-talkie from behind the barricade of older trucks. Salvador Alanis, age 37, is the top-ranking security chief for FUSDEG.\n\n\u201cPlease hold your fire,\u201d Alanis calls out. \u201cWe\u2019ve come in peace for the prisoners,\u201d This reporter, in a show of gringo bravado, has followed Alanis out into no-man\u2019s land\u2014holding up a press pass like a talisman in one hand, camera atremble in the other.\n\nAlanis now shouts: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more killing,\u201d although it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s talking to his own troops, or to me, to the UPOEG lines, or himself.\n\nScenes like these are all too common in Mexico. Volunteer police groups like FUSDEG and UPOEG are protected under Mexican law and are active participants in Mexico\u2019s U.S.-backed drug war. Community police units, usually made up of indigenous farmers, operate in eleven Mexican states. Guerrero alone is home to seven individual militias. The volunteers\u2019 basic expenses are partly funded by their respective municipalities, but in some cases kidnapping, extortion, and drug trafficking help to make ends meet.\n\nFUSDEG has chosen to align itself with federal law enforcement, even joining state-funded officers on patrols. On a single day in February, FUSDEG detained 18 people for narcotics trafficking in the town of Petaquillas, and seized 40 kilos of marijuana. UPOEG, on the other hand, is led and financially supported by a wealthy businessman named Bruno Placido\u2014a state congressional candidate with alleged ties to the underworld.\n\nThe ideological schism causes predictable \u2013 and often bloody \u2013 clashes between these proxy militias.\n\nAt the standoff on the highway outside Ocotito, FUSDEG\u2019s security coordinator Alanis is led at gunpoint through the enemy roadblock, then hustled into a clapboard house on the other side, to discuss terms for the prisoners taken by UPOEG the night before. Sitting at a table piled high with seized rifles, yet managing to look defiantly bored, Alanis stares down the rival leadership.\n\n\u201cYou had no right to fire upon us in our own territory,\u201d he tells the UPOEG council. \u201cSan Juan del Reparo has voted\u2014and you must respect the assembly. It\u2019s FUSDEG territory now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have shown up [to the meeting at San Juan] with the federal police,\u201d counters UPOEG commissioner Gaudencio Abraj\u00e1n. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t like the government in our business.\u201d\n\n\u201cPor favor \u2013 that\u2019s no reason to start shooting people,\u201d says the FUSDEG chief. Abraj\u00e1n just shrugs from across the rifle-laden table.\n\nMeanwhile, outside in the blinding, high-desert sunshine, another UPOEG officer lectures some of the men who pulled off the ambush the night before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about this kind of thing happening again,\u201d the officer barks at the volunteers, who hang their heads and smile slyly. Their weapons, like their trucks, are noticeably better than FUSDEG\u2019s, and some of them sport designer apparel.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re in our territory\u2014we can\u2019t retaliate?\u201d says one man in a black t-shirt with silver letters across the chest that read, in English, \u201cI\u2019ve just got to be me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d chides the UPOEG commander. \u201cNo shooting anybody\u2014unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary,\u201d and the killers, still grinning, hang their heads again.\n\nLater that same night, after local human rights workers have arranged a prisoner exchange, the FUSDEG captives are finally united with their families in the state capital of Chilpancingo. Some of those seized the night before are still suffering from untreated gunshot wounds. Others are so traumatized by torture that they weep openly.\n\n\u201cThey disarmed me, they took my shoes. Then they kicked me and beat me with their rifle butts,\u201d says a man who calls himself Angel. His face weathered from years of hardship and manual labor under the sun, he declines to give his last name for fear of reprisal. \u201cBut I was lucky,\u201d Angel says. \u201c[UPOEG members] stabbed two other [FUSDEG members] to death while I watched. They killed them in the road like it was nothing.\u201d\n\nFederal police in body armor mingle with the human rights team in the street while freed hostages hug worried relatives. But the officers don\u2019t provide any assistance to the wounded, and no statements will be taken from the witnesses tonight or in the days to come. Nor will arrests be made in connection with the killings during the ambush, nor in the cases of the beheaded and de-faced victims. UPOEG boss Bruno Placido is still running for office, and the attorney general has yet to question him in connection with the killings, despite concerns voiced in the local press.\n\n\u201cThe drug lords still run the show around here,\u201d sighs FUSDEG\u2019s Alanis, during the prisoner exchange. The security officer hasn\u2019t slept since the night before the unprovoked attack that claimed half-a-dozen of his men, and his eyes are puffed and raw-red behind his bent, poor-man\u2019s glasses. \u201cThe authorities won\u2019t do anything to help us. We\u2019ve known that for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cLos \u00fanicos que pueden salvar a nuestras comunidades de los carteles \u2013 somos nosotros mismos,\u201dAlanis says. The only ones who can save our communities from the cartels \u2013 are us.", "description": "On patrol with the volunteer police force going AK-47 to AK-47 with the narco-gangs in Mexico\u2019s most dangerous state.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492181067/articles/2015/05/13/vigilantes-vs-assassins-on-mexico-s-heroin-highway/150512-kryt-mexico-tease_qltjvx", "published_at": "2015-05-13"}
