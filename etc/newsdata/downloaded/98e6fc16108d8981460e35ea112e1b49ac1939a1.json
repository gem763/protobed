Nader\u2019s committee is one panel participating in an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nMulvaney said Trump anticipated criticism about the decision. Mulvaney said at a White House briefing that \u201cthere\u2019s no issue here on him profiting from this is any way, shape, or form.\u201d\n\nThe head of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington called the announcement \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is now no question that the American government is being used as a public relations and marketing subsidiary of the Trump Organization,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of CREW, in a statement.\n\nTrump in August floated the idea of hosting the G7 at his resort, and Democrats pushed back at the time, saying it could be a violation of the emoluments clause in the Constitution. The clause forbids presidents from personally profiting from foreign governments.\n\n\u201cThe Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution exist to prevent exactly this kind of corruption,\u201d Nadler said in his statement on Thursday.", "description": "Next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit will be held at President Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort in Miami, the White House announced Thursday, as a top official said...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ344_doral0_ZG_20190828171734.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
