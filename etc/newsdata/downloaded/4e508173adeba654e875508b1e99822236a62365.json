It says for myself that I was growing a lot over the last few years.\u201d\n\nAlso, defending champion Caroline Wozniacki beat Daria Kasatkina 6-3, 7-6 (5) and will next face either Bianca Andreescu or Naomi Osaka.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andy Murray\u2019s run at the China Open is over.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/china_open_tennis_73170_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
