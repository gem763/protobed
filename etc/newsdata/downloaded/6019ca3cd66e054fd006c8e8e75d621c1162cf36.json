EU unity confirmed in @Europarl_EN #EPlenary, alongside @JunckerEU. We will remain calm, constructive, respectful. We need real, credible solutions for the island of Ireland. Finding an agreement is difficult, but still possible. pic.twitter.com/bCIBYKwCt7 \u2014 Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) October 9, 2019\n\nIn his address to MEPs, Mr Barnier said the EU side would continue to work in a \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d manner to try to find an agreement.\n\nBut he made clear that Mr Johnson\u2019s blueprint \u2013 which would require the return of customs checks on the island of Ireland \u2013 was not the basis for a solution.\n\n\u201cTo put things very frankly, though, and to try and be objective, (at) this particular point, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe proposal of the British Government as things stand is not something we can accept. It replaces an operational, practical, legal solution with one that is simply a temporary solution.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament (Francisco Seco/AP)\n\nFollowing a series of acrimonious exchanges between London and Brussels on Tuesday, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told the parliament that they would not get drawn into a \u201cblame game\u201d.\n\n\u201cPersonally I don\u2019t exclude a deal. We are, Michel and myself, working on a deal. And we are not accepting this blame game which started in London,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will see in the next coming days how things will develop.\u201d\n\nMr Barnier\u2019s downbeat assessment was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said Mr Johnson\u2019s insistence that Northern Ireland must leave the customs union with the rest of the UK remained an obstacle to progress.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s their position at the moment and that\u2019s one that is a great difficulty for us,\u201d he told the Irish parliament.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Irish Government is concerned, we do want a deal, we\u2019re willing to work hard to get a deal, to work until the last moment to get a deal, but certainly not at any cost.\u201d\n\nIf Mr Johnson is unable to get an agreement, he will face a concerted push for MPs to comply with the so-called Benn Act, requiring him to seek a further Brexit delay from Brussels \u2013 something he has vowed not to do.\n\nThe prospects of an agreement were hanging in the balance after Downing Street accused the EU on Tuesday of making it \u201cessentially impossible\u201d for the UK to leave with a deal.\n\nFollowing a heated telephone call between Mr Johnson and Angela Merkel, No 10 sources said the German chancellor had made clear that a deal was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d.\n\nAngela Merkel\u00b4s spokesman has hit back at Downing Street claims she has made a deal `essentially impossible\u00b4 (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nMrs Merkel\u2019s spokesman hit back on Wednesday, insisting she would work \u201cuntil the last possible point\u201d to secure an orderly British withdrawal.\n\nThe spokesman said that she continued to regard a no-deal Brexit as \u201cthe worst scenario for all concerned\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile there was suspicion among some MPs over Mr Johnson\u2019s plans for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament \u2013 something which has only happened four times in the past 80 years.\n\nPrevious occasions have included the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Suez crisis in 1956 and the invasion of the Falklands in 1982.\n\nFormer attorney general Dominic Grieve questioned why they could not wait until the Monday, and expressed concern they were being \u201cmanipulated\u201d for \u201cpropaganda\u201d purposes.\n\n\u201cDowning Street has become a propaganda department spewing out lies,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World at One.\n\n\u201cSo firstly, it\u2019s deeply corrosive of trust, and secondly, you do have the impression that you\u2019re being manipulated and it is very dangerous activity.\u201d\n\nHowever Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it would be an opportunity for Parliament to demand the Prime Minister complies with the Benn Act.\n\nMr Johnson has repeatedly said that while he will abide by the law, he will be taking the UK out of the EU on October 31, with or without a deal.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to a wind turbine facility in Southampton, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cThe idea that the Prime Minister will break the law yet again is something that needs to be borne in mind here.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is preparing to call an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament following next week\u00b4s crucial EU summit.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/wire-19503972-1570643918-761_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
