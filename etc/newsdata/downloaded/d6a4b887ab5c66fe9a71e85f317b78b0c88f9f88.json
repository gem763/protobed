A review of 1989 court documents by Vanity Fair revealed that Epstein was also paid to help clients track down money that was stolen by fraudulent brokers and lawyers.\n\nRansome first moved to New York in 2006, where she says she was approached by a young woman at a Manhattan nightclub, she told The Telegraph.\n\n\"She found out everything about me very quickly,\" Ransome told The Telegraph. \"I was so broken. I was an open book.\"\n\nRansome said her profile fit exactly the type of girl that Epstein was looking for: \"girls who had nothing.\" He made promises to girls to keep them around, she claimed in the piece. For Ransome, who aspired to get into the fashion industry, Epstein promised entrance to the Fashion Institute, The Telegraph reported.\n\nRead more: How Jeffrey Epstein, the mysterious hedge-fund manager arrested on sex-trafficking charges, made his fortune\n\nRansome said the woman pitched the idea of meeting Epstein, saying \"'there's this amazing guy, a philanthropist, this wealthy guy, he's amazing, he's helped me so much, he's helped me achieve my dreams, he can help you,'\" she told The Telegraph. So she met with Epstein at the movies, describing him as \"charming, charismatic\" during their first encounter.\n\nRansome said she received an invite to Epstein's private Caribbean island a few days later, and she boarded a private plane to Little St. James island soon after, which is when the abuse began.\n\n\"In six months, I never saw him do a day's work,\" Ransome told The Telegraph. \"I never saw him work. He was literally sexually abusing us all day long.\"\n\nAfter months on the island, Ransome said she felt compelled to escape from Epstein, stealing an unattended quad bike and riding to the coast of the 70-acre Caribbean island, where she tried to swim to St. Thomas. However, she was allegedly caught by a team employed by Epstein who convinced her to stay on the island.\n\nWhen Ransome said she later relocated back to New York with Epstein in early 2007, he tried to send Ransome to South Africa to look for a personal assistant for him, insisting that she had to be 18 and found through a modelling agency, The Telegraph reported. However, Ransome said she refused, because she knew what he would do to her, and left New York for good.\n\nIn July, Epstein was charged with one count of sex trafficking and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, which could have carried a sentence of up to 45 years in prison. He was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, where he was being held while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide.", "description": "Sarah Ransome, who spent several months on Epstein's island, said the late criminal financier \"was literally sexually abusing us all day long.\"", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d82ae9e2e22af1c6e4da5d3-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
