Melting, collapse and temperature changes led to these islands being uncovered.'\n\nThe islands range in size between 9,690 and 586,630 square feet.\n\nIce melting in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago (pictured) off the north coast of Russia has revealed land beneath it which has been confirmed as newly discovered islands (stock image)\n\nThe newly found islands are located near the Vylki glacier off the coast of Novaya Zemlya, a remote archipelago in the Arctic Ocean northwest of the Russian mainland, CNN reports.\n\n\n\nGlacier loss in the Arctic in the period from 2015 to 2019 was more than in any other five-year period on record, a United Nations report on global warming said last month.\n\nThe newly found islands are located near the Vylki glacier off the coast of Novaya Zemlya, in the Arctic Ocean northwest of the Russia\n\nRussia has opened a string of military and scientific bases in the Arctic in recent years, with interest in the region growing as rising temperatures open up shipping routes and make hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit.\n\nThis summer's expedition to two existing archipelagos - Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya - involved a crew of 60 people from the Russian Geographic Society and was the first made aboard a rescue towboat instead of an icebreaker due to the changing landscape.\n\nVideo of expedition members encountering an angry walrus that attacked their inflatable landing craft went viral last month.\n\nDenis Krets, commander of the northern fleet's expedition force said: 'The two months this year when we held our expedition to Franz Josef Land can be described as warm.\n\n'We were very lucky because we could land on islands where not every year the shore and the inshore water is free of ice.'\n\nDuring the expedition, the defence ministry announced it had found five new islands in Vize Bay off Novaya Zemlya, a vast mountainous archipelago with two main islands.\n\nDenis Krets, expeditionary detachment commander, senior specialist of the Russian Northern Fleet's search, rescue and emergency group, during a press conference on the results of the Russian Northern Fleet's and Russian Geographical Society's joint expedition to the Franz Josef Land Archipelago\n\nThe islands had previously been seen on satellite images but the expedition was the first to see them.\n\nIt also said it had also confirmed the existence of an island that had been previously mapped as a peninsula of Hall Island, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, west of Novaya Zemlya.\n\nMoiseyev said names for the new islands were 'upcoming'.\n\n'Of course each island will receive a name but first you have to lay out the case for it.'", "description": "The Russian Navy said it has discovered the islands - which haven't been named yet - off the coast of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Arctic Ocean of the country's north coast.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/09/20121964-0-image-a-17_1571906294452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
