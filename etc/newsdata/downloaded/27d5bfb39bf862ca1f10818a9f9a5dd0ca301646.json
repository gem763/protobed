REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Cars front man Ric Ocasek died peacefully over the weekend while recovering from surgery at his family\u2019s home in Manhattan, his wife, the actress and model Paulina Porizkova, said in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\nPorizkova, who announced in May 2018 that she and Ocasek had split after 28 years of marriage, did not elaborate on what kind of operation the 75-year-old rocker had undergone before his death on Sunday. But she said she and the couple\u2019s two sons had been caring for him.\n\n\u201cI found him still asleep when bringing him his Sunday morning coffee,\u201d Porizkova, 54, said in the post. \u201cI touched his cheek to rouse him. It was then I realized that during the night he had peacefully passed on.\u201d\u201dWe appreciate the great outpouring of love,\u201d the Czech-born supermodel said. \u201cWe, his family and friends, are completely and utterly devastated by his untimely and unexpected death and would appreciate the privacy to mourn in private.\u201d\n\nNew York Police have said they were called to Ocasek\u2019s townhouse in Manhattan at about 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) on Sunday by a family member who reported he was unresponsive. He was later pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of death will be determined by the city\u2019s coroner.\n\nOcasek, born Richard Theodore Otcasek in Baltimore in 1944, co-founded The Cars in mid-1970s Boston and served as the band\u2019s chief songwriter, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist.\n\nTheir self-titled debut reached No. 18 on the Billboard album charts on the strength of such singles as \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u201d and \u201cGood Times Roll,\u201d and put the band at the forefront of the just-emerging genre of synthesizer-driven pop rock.\n\nThe Cars scored their first top-20 single, \u201cLet\u2019s Go,\u201d in 1979 and launched a succession of hook-heavy hits throughout the 1980s such as \u201cShake It Up,\u201d often featuring Ocasek\u2019s distinctive vocals.\n\nThe band split up in 1988, and bassist Benjamin Orr died of pancreatic cancer at age 53 in 2000. The surviving members reunited for a final album, \u201cMove Like This,\u201d in 2010. The band was inducted into the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nIn addition to his two sons with Porizkova, Ocasek is survived by four other children from two previous marriages.", "description": "Cars front man Ric Ocasek died peacefully over the weekend while recovering from surgery at his family's home in Manhattan, his wife, the actress and model Paulina Porizkova, said in an Instagram post on Monday.", "authors": ["Dan Whitcomb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430623874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1S1-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
