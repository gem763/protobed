He advertised for a third girlfriend via social media on Thursday\n\nThe notorious playboy said his unusual marriage works because Taesha loves their extraordinary sex lives.\n\n'We're very happy,' he said in 2018. I've been married to my wife for eight years and our relationship - in a fun sense, in a family sense, and in a sexual sense - is like we first met.'\n\n'At the weekends up to 30 other women join us and my wife loves that part of it. She absolutely gets involved with the other girls.'\n\nTaesha agreed, saying: 'I kissed girls when I was younger and have always been curious. I've had my time with jealousy and you get past it.\n\nShe added: 'Trav and I have a very strong marriage and a very strong relationship - we make enough time to spend one on one together. I feel like I'm always the centre of his life.'\n\nWhile Mr Beynon has up to 30 women (some pictured) at his home on a weekend, only two girlfriends live and sleep with him and his wife full time. Those women are asked not to date anyone else and can bring their families to the mansion to visit\n\nBeynon said having multiple girlfriends is less morally corrupt than having an affair.\n\n'Look at all these politicians,' he said, referring to former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce who left his wife of 24 years for his much younger staffer.\n\n'How many people in monogamous marriages are truly happy?'\n\nBeynon said he has a strict selection process in place for choosing his girlfriends and that he is always on the lookout for more.\n\n'There's a process of finding new girls like any relationship,' he said. 'You meet a girl, you court them and vice versa and then if it works out you become more serious \u2013 it's the same process.'", "description": "Tobacco tycoon Travers Beynon, who owns the 'Candyshop Mansion' is on the hunt for a new girlfriend to join his wife and existing two lovers at their palatial mansion on the Gold Coast.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/04/20114154-0-image-a-35_1571888431335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
