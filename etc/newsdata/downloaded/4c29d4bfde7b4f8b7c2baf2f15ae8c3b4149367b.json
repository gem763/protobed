That\u2019s based on the assumption that the slump will be largely contained in the trade and manufacturing industries, he said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s export-reliant economy has seen a sharper downturn in the second half of this year amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China, two of its biggest trading partners. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last week that the city state would be \u201clucky\u201d to achieve positive growth for the year.\n\nEven after easing policy earlier this month for the first time in three years, \u201cwe\u2019re keeping some powder dry and we\u2019ve said as much that, if necessary\u201d the MAS is prepared to use it, Menon, 55, told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Haslinda Amin. There\u2019s still policy \u201cspace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MAS expects growth to come in around the midpoint of an official 0%-1% forecast range this year, then \u201cimprove modestly\u201d in 2020. The central bank, which uses the exchange rate as its primary policy tool, slightly reduced the slope of its currency band at its Oct. 14 decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a robust recovery,\u201d Menon said. The negative output gap -- the estimated difference between the economy\u2019s actual and potential performance -- isn\u2019t expected to widen, though there are risks it could, he said.\n\nFor now, Singapore and many other Asian economies have shown resilience in domestic demand and services industries.\n\nTo date, the \u201ccurrent slowdown is really quite concentrated\u201d in trade and manufacturing, Menon said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it cannot spill over into other parts of the economy -- it could very well do so. That is a risk that we\u2019re seriously taking into account. But as of now, there are no signs of that.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Steps\n\nCentral banks around the world are looking for ways to bolster their economies, turning to unconventional policy tools like negative interest rates and quantitative easing as they run out of policy space. Because the MAS has an exchange-rate policy, it\u2019s not constrained by the zero interest rate level like other central banks, Menon said.\n\nThe MAS has a \u201cfair amount of policy space on the monetary front without having to think about QE,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can, if necessary, bring the exchange-rate path to zero as we have done before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never before had a policy of deliberately depreciating the currency, but we can always recenter the band downward.\u201d\n\nMenon, who has served as MAS chief since 2011, worried that there were \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d placed on global central banks to get their economies out of every rough patch. There should be a better balance between government spending and monetary stimulus, he said, reiterating the sentiment from several global finance chiefs at last week\u2019s International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that every slowdown, every risk or threat on the horizon has to be addressed by a loosening of monetary policy,\u201d Menon said. Fiscal policy has a stronger role to play, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Singapore\u2019s economy may be a few quarters away from a recovery as the decline in trade and manufacturing this year hasn\u2019t really spread to other sectors, the central bank\u2019s chief said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2BK7QKNIKjGidk5TyvL_mQ--~B/aD00OTEyO3c9NzM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6f2cd1d0-f07c-11e9-bbff-f911f5f7df9c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
