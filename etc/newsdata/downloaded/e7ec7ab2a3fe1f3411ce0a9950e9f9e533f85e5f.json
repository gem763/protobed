Tino claims the brothel operated in this area and he secretly-recorded its VIP clientele before delivering the video tapes of their trysts to his Mafia boss. The brothel has since closed down\n\nBut the authors admit Tino, the only person they found who witnessed this alleged tryst, has a criminal record including forgery, fraud and larceny.\n\nLevine and El-Faizy were also unable to track down the then-teenage girl or the porn actress, only identified in the book as 'Tri', to confirm Tino's claim.\n\nThe brothel, which Tino said was frequented by rich and powerful men, has since closed down.\n\nLevine told The Daily Beast: 'There are many people who will label Tino a liar and say his claims are false. I came away feeling the allegations are believable.'\n\nTino told the authors Trump was known to him as 'the real estate guy' who always 'wore a tie and never drank alcohol' at the secret club.\n\nThe convicted gangster claimed Trump would always ask for Tri.\n\nThe authors wrote: 'Most of the women who worked there were porn stars, though not all. Trump preferred a woman who primarily performed live sex shows with her husband, though she acted in the occasional adult film as well.'\n\nTino claimed his Mafia boss, in fall 1982, told him 'The real estate guy is coming. He wants Tri and he wants another girl...for a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois.'\n\n'All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator' by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy is on sale on October 22\n\nTino described how a 'young-looking female' turned up at the club.\n\nHe said, 'Tri asked the girl how old she was. She said she was a teenager.'\n\nThe book, which does not specify whether the girl was above the legal age of consent, says 'the real estate guy' spent an hour in the room.\n\nAt the time this allegedly took place, Trump would have been 36 and married to his first wife Ivana.\n\nTino claimed the secret cameras were placed in the rooms so he could monitor them and prevent the prostitutes being 'roughed up' by clients.\n\nAccording to the authors, Tino then described how he took the video recordings and delivered them to his Mafia boss.\n\nThe book says the whereabouts of the video tapes is unknown and the authors describe how Tino's boss was murdered in 1986.\n\nAuthor Levine told The Daily Beast Tino had spoken to journalists in the run-up to the 2016 election but nobody was able to find porn actress Tri's whereabouts.\n\nLevine said, 'To this day we don't know if the porn star involved in this alleged incident is still alive or whether she is dead.'\n\nAccording to the authors, dying Tino told them he did not want to take what he allegedly witnessed to his grave.\n\nTino said, 'That's why I'm telling you this now. He's the President.'\n\nLevine, who said he and El-Faizy used two private detectives to attempt to locate Tri and the young girl, expects many people will not believe the claims in his book.\n\nIn trying to confirm Tino's story, Levine said, 'Over the months, through dozens of calls only to find that most of the people who associated with Tino are dead - either from natural causes or victims of mob violence themselves - I was able to locate two individuals who confirmed [Tino's] work at the secretive sex den. Both of these individuals specifically remembered him by his mob nickname, 'Blue Eyes.'\n\n'One of the individuals, who is in his late eighties, said of Tino: 'I remember 'Blue Eyes' from the office. He worked for us. He would come by. [-] had him running a place in Times Square.'\n\nThe book also quotes porn actress Alana Evans claiming she knows of three former porn stars who say Trump paid them for sex\n\nIn his search for Tri, Levine added: 'I also conducted interviews with people in the mob-associated porn business specific to the Times Square sex scene in the early 1980s - not one of them knew for a fact what happened to this woman.'\n\nThe book claims to reveal 43 fresh allegations of inappropriate behavior, including 26 instances of unwanted sexual contact.\n\nThese include the claims of Karen Johnson, who said Trump assaulted her behind a Mar-a-Lago tapestry at a New Year's Eve Party in the early 2000s while his then-girlfriend Melania was upstairs.\n\nJohnson told the authors how Trump grabbed her genitals during the party at his beachside club in Palm Beach, Florida, which she attended with her terminally-ill husband who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, and a relative.\n\nShe told them, 'When he says that thing, 'Grab them in the p****,' that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that's where he grabbed me.'\n\nThe book also quotes porn actress Alana Evans claiming she knows of three former porn stars who say Trump paid them for sex.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider about 'All The President's Women', White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the book, denying any allegations of sexual impropriety by Trump.\n\nShe said, 'That book is trash, and those accusations from 20 years ago have been addressed many times.'", "description": "Donald Trump was recorded by Mafia having a threesome with a teenage girl and a porn star in a Mafia-run Times Square brothel in the 80s, book claims", "authors": ["Karen Ruiz For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/18/19894190-0-image-a-16_1571418047203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
