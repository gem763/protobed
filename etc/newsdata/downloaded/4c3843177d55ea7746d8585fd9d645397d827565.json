We must not forget our parents and the people we left in our villages when we arrived in the cities.\n\nWe also must not allow the friends we have made \u2013 who are sometimes interested in nothing but our wealth \u2013 to lead us to forget the essence of what makes a person a human being.\n\nThe burden of repairing our nation and determining its course lies directly with us.\n\nWe must not leave it to someone else or pretend that we do not see that there is something seriously wrong with the ways in which we relate to one another as people.\n\nLet us sweep our yard, for if it is dirty, we will not even know what we have lost.\n\nDlamini is a #FeesMustFall activist\n\nTALK TO US\n\n\n\nDo you agree that there is a need to change our ways to become a whole and healthy society?
