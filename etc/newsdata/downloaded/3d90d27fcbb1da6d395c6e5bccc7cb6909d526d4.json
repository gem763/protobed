She was visiting her husband when royal valet James MacDonald walked in at a rather awkward time, revealed former royal correspondent James Whitaker.\n\n\"When he walked into Philip\u2019s bedroom one morning, royal valet James MacDonald was embarrassed to find Elizabeth in a silk nightgown and Philip naked,\" Whitaker explained.\n\nWhile MacDonald was left in utter disbelief, Philip on the other hand \"didn\u2019t care at all.\"\n\n\"Pyjamas? Never wear the things,\" the Duke of Edinburgh is believed to have added.\n\nThis comes as no surprise especially after actor Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip in popular Netflix royal series The Crown, stripped before getting into bed in one of the show\u2019s scenes, Metro reported.\n\nThe royal pair reportedly sleep in two separate rooms to avoid each person\u2019s snoring, which according to The Sun is an upper class tradition. But every now and then whenever the pair are feeling cosy they share a bed to cuddle.\n\nSources: Express UK, Metro, The Sun", "description": "A royal valet was left red-faced after he walked in on Prince Philip waking up in his birthday suit.", "authors": ["Lesego Mkhize"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9484/ded6074a748544f2afa186433e8fb437.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
