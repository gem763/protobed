He grabs what looks like a beer bottle, at one stage, and pours liquid over the seal's face.\n\nREAD: Men investigated for allegedly beating, stabbing baby seal (Warning: Sensitive content)\n\nThe animal is dangled over the water and tries to escape, before being thrown against the boat.\n\nAt the time, Mang said they had been sickened at the blatant display of cruelty and it was clear the animal had been distressed.\n\nThe fate of the seal was not known as the video was filmed in December 2017.\n\nShe said that there had been a trial-within-a-trial to determine the admissibility of the video, which was posted on Facebook by a man who received the video after being in the same pub as the two men.\n\nMang said the witness was an acquaintance of the men and had overheard them talking about the seal. The video ended up on his phone as it was apparently paired with one of their phones.\n\nHe only noticed it about six months later when clearing his phone out.\n\n\"We are very happy that he (Tredoux) pleaded guilty. I am hoping for a very stiff sentence,\" said Mang.\n\nSentencing was set down for August 7.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
