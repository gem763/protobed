Ms Ziuzina (right) now faces a High Court battle\n\nThey had been celebrating their first anniversary at a restaurant outside the city when the businessman met his death. The couple were trying to hail a taxi by the roadside when Ms Ziuzina returned to the restaurant to find a missing glove.\n\nIt was at that moment that Mr Pring was struck by a vehicle that has never been traced.\n\nA verdict of unlawful killing was later quashed when coroner Elizabeth Earland admitted allowing \u2018hearsay evidence\u2019 and not giving Ms Ziuzina adequate opportunity to attend the hearing.\n\nMs Ziuzina (pictured) will face the High Court over accusations that she arranged to have her husband killed\n\nMr Pring\u2019s family accused Ms Ziuzina of involvement in his death at the subsequent inquest before the Exeter coroner.\n\nThe unlawful killing verdict caused a sensation but the model took immediate legal action.\n\nWhen the verdict was quashed at the High Court eight weeks later, Ms Ziuzina claimed costs and received \u00a340,000 from the coroner\u2019s office.\n\nIn the April ruling, Shaughan Pring, the businessman\u2019s brother, and mother Irene Pring, as executors of his estate, were ordered to pay \u00a325,000 to Ms Ziuzina. She refused to comment.\n\nZiuzina now lives in Marbella, Spain, with Ivan Lister, 48, also from Britain. She won \u00a365,000 from the coroner\u2019s office and the dead man\u2019s family in April this year.\n\nThe amount was roughly a third of her costs, which were thought to be around \u00a3200,000.\n\nHer friend told The Mail on Sunday at the time: \u2018Ganna feels very strongly she has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice \u2013 the first inquest was grossly unfair but the coroner, Mrs Earland, was allowed to quietly retire afterwards.\n\n'Ganna was accused of being a murderer without any evidence and there were huge stories in the papers about her, but when the inquest was quashed and Mrs Earland retired, no one said anything.\n\n'She feels that these awards towards her legal costs are a first step in vindicating her.\u2019\n\nMs Ziuzina's High Court battle comes despite the Ukranian police believing that Mr Pring was the victim of a hit-and-run.\n\nPolice initially investigated Mr Pring\u2019s death as a traffic offence before reclassifying the incident as murder.\n\nBut a subsequent probe says a key witness account of Mr Pring\u2019s death that said a car hit him at high speed with its lights off did not tally with other statements from the scene.\n\nIn fact, police said that Svetlana Dudko, the supposed witness, \u2018was not present at all\u2019. Their report said: \u2018The evidence gathered confirms the fact of a traffic accident.\n\n\u2018At the same time there is not sufficient evidence to consider a deliberate murder using the vehicle.\u2019\n\nHome Office pathologist Gyan Fernando conducted a post-mortem examination in Britain, and found that Mr Pring\u2019s injuries suggested he was \u2018run over by a heavy vehicle such as a truck\u2019.", "description": "Ganna Ziuzina, a Ukrainian who now goes by Julianne Moore, faces claims she had Barry Pring (pictured together) murdered in Ukraine to get his \u00a31.5million.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20014108-0-image-a-114_1571703808519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
