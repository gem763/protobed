'In the morning, before starting your daily skin regimen, take a look at your skin in the mirror. Sometimes a visual examination will tell you everything you need to know. Is it dull or radiant? Are there any visibly dry patches? Run your fingers over your face. Does it feel smooth and supple, or rough and stiff? 'You can do a scratch test as well. Gently draw a finger nail against your cheek. Does it leave a white line? If so, that\u2019s a good sign that your skin is dehydrated. Make sure you double up on the hydrating steps to rescue your skin. Throw in a watery lotion or a pre-essence in addition to a richly hydrating moisturiser like the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream.' - David Khoo\n\nWe've all always been told that the higher sun protection factor you go for, the better off your skin will be long term.\n\nWrong, said David, who doesn't always agree with this fact.\n\n'The higher the SPF rating a product is, the more greasy and difficult to spread it can become, which may subconsciously deter some from using it daily,' he said.\n\n'In a recent survey we conducted with 1,000 women across Australia, we found that only three in 10 women use a sunscreen every day.\n\n'There are consequences to this damage - in a study, we determined that women who use an SPF 24 product intermittently over five days ended up with more sun damage than women who used an SPF 15 product daily.'\n\nSo, he concluded, you're better off using a lower factor regularly than a higher SPF more rarely.\n\nAre sheet masks a waste of time?\n\nSheet masks have become all the rage in recent years, with women across the globe conducting at-home facials with masks bought from the pharmacy.\n\nBut are such products a waste of time and money?\n\n'The jury is out on whether a sheet mask can truly replace a facial, but there is an argument for the fact that a good skin cleanser followed by a sheet mask can come close to deeply hydrating and rejuvenating the skin,' David said.\n\nHe recommends using something like Olay's Skinfusion masks once or twice a week for a hit of hydration, while also tackling fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nVerdict: MIRACLE\n\n'Though jade rollers are relatively unproven, there is some evidence that massaging the skin in particular ways, when used with an anti-ageing moisturiser, can improve absorption and increase the efficacy of the product,' David said (stock image)\n\nAre jade rollers worth our money?\n\nThe latest skincare toy that has tempted many women to part with their money is a jade or rose quartz roller.\n\nThese are used for facial massage and to help apply skincare products more effectively.\n\n'Though jade rollers are relatively unproven, there is some evidence that massaging the skin in particular ways, when used with an anti-ageing moisturiser, can improve absorption and increase the efficacy of the product,' David said.\n\nVerdict: MIRACLE\n\nIs double cleansing a waste of time?\n\nSkincare experts will often tell us that we should be double cleansing - once to remove makeup and secondly to get rid of any impurities.\n\nBut is this a waste of time and precious product?\n\nDouble cleansing can be especially useful if you wear heavy makeup,' David said.\n\nHe recommends you use two separate cleansers for the best benefits.\n\n'To compensate for any loss of moisture or lipids during cleansing, it's good to quickly follow up a double-cleansing routine with a fast absorbing serum or pre-essence,' he said.\n\nVerdict: MIRACLE\n\nWhat are the top five ingredients every woman should be using?\n\nWhen it comes to skincare, it's a complicated world filled with various different ingredients and bizarre names.\n\nBut David said there are five words you should look out for above all others.\n\n1. SPF: The skin scientist revealed that 80 per cent of how your skin looks is determined by lifelong sun exposure - so a good SPF is paramount.\n\n2. Moisture (Glycerin and hyaluronic acid): Words like glycerin and hyaluronic acid are always going to be your skin's best friend, as they help hugely with hydration.\n\n'Ingredients like carob seed extract has been shown to increase your skin's natural levels of hyaluronic acid so that it is better able to hold on to moisture,' David said.\n\n3. Niacinimide: A slightly more technical word, David revealed that niacinimide plays a role in 'over 200 cellular reactions' to help boost cellular energy, reduce the appearance of dark spots and redness and strengthen the skin's barrier.\n\nHe said something like Olay's Tone Perfecting Essence is what you need here.\n\n4. Collagen boosters: 'Peptides like pal-KTTKS, pal-KT and Carnosine are among my favorites and have all been shown in in vitro (cell culture studies) to boost collagen levels so that skin is firmer and smoother,' David said.\n\n5. Antioxidants: Finally, you look for them in your foods. And you should look for antioxidants in your skincare too.\n\n'Your skin is constantly exposed to environmental stress, from UV rays to cigarette smoke and pollution,' David said.\n\n'Antioxidants like Vitamin C, Vitamin E and green tea extract can all help to neutralise these free radicals so that your skin is spared.'", "description": "A leading skincare scientist has revealed the biggest myths surrounding skincare - and explained whether fancy items like sheet masks and jade rollers are really worth your time.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/06/19947212-0-image-a-32_1571548014164.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
