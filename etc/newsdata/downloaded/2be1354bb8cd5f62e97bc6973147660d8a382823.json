Tremendous for the farmers.\"\n\nJapanese officials say the country's total feed corn imports won't increase as a result of the deal, which simply front loads three months' worth of roughly 2.75 million tons of imports.\n\nAs private companies have the final say in how much feed corn they import, the government will only facilitate purchases by subsidizing storage fees, they say.\n\nJapan imports roughly 11 million tons of feed corn per year, of which 95% come from the United States, data by the Finance Ministry show. That is worth about 254 billion yen ($2.4 billion), suggesting three months of front-loading would have a negligible impact on Japan's 6.5 trillion yen ($60.4 billion) trade surplus with the United States.\n\n\"It's not fake, but it's not a fundamental solution\" to address the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan, said one of the officials familiar with the negotiations. \"The whole point is to make Trump happy.\"\n\nSome Japanese officials said they were uncertain whether such sweeteners would have a lasting effect on Trump, who has made it a priority to fix the huge U.S. trade deficit with other countries.\n\nAmong steps he has taken is a threat to slap higher tariffs on vehicles and parts imported from Japan under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, on national security grounds. About two-thirds of Japan's trade surplus with the United States is made up by autos.\n\nFor Japan, the whole point of signing a two-way trade deal with the United States is to avoid the higher tariffs. After several rounds of negotiations, Washington promised Tokyo it will not impose the tariffs while trade talks continue.\n\nTrump said last month he will not \"immediately\" impose the higher auto tariffs, but wouldn't confirm the decision was permanent.\n\nJapan's Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi has said the issue will be dealt with \"in the final stages of negotiations,\" suggesting that talks on the auto tariffs would continue.\n\nJapanese policymakers and lawmakers involved in the negotiations concede that they have little idea how to get assurance from Trump that he will drop his threat of higher auto tariffs.\n\nAnother concern they have is the possibility, albeit slim, that Washington could set import curbs on Japanese automobiles, which would devastate the country's export-reliant economy.\n\n\"It's very hard for negotiators,\" a second official said. \"Trump could change his mind any time.\"", "description": "Deadline looming, Japan struggles to elude Trump tariff threat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
