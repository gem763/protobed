As that spiral has played out, coal companies have denied workers backpay, in addition to voiding union contracts in certain cases.\n\nSome activists say this trend enforces the need for protections for frontline communities \u2014 from those on the coast impacted by sea level rise to workers affected by the transition to clean energy \u2014 laid out in proposals like the Green New Deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany also say the collapse of coal serves as an indictment of lawmakers, including President Donald Trump. The president has kept close ties with coal executives, even as they come under fire for abandoning their workers.\n\n\u201cCoal executives are raking in money even while their businesses fail and the promises they\u2019ve made to mining communities are broken time and time again,\u201d said Bill Price, Appalachian Field Organizing Manager at Sierra Club, in an email to ThinkProgress on Friday.\n\nBlackjewel, the nation\u2019s sixth-largest coal producer, abruptly declared bankruptcy last month, imperiling the jobs of well over 1,000 coal miners in several states including Kentucky. That move impacted roughly a quarter of all miners in southeastern Harlan County, where more than 32% of the population lived below the poverty line as of the 2010 Census.\n\nThe company did not post a payment bond with Kentucky, as is required by state law \u2014 a move that would have covered a month of payroll for impacted workers. When Blackjewel declared bankruptcy, miners say their paychecks bounced; some also say their 401(k) contributions have not been credited to their accounts for months.\n\nFed up, miners camped out on Monday on top of a railroad track in an effort to block the path of a coal train. Many have said they will not leave until they have some guarantee of payment \u2014 allowing them to afford medical expenses, monthly bills, and other critical needs. While the protesting miners are not protected by a union, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) members have expressed solidarity and came to assist their industry colleagues.\n\n\u201cTheir fight is our fight!\u201d the union asserted in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nUMWA on the tracks with the brave miners at #Blackjewel.

Miners have allowed the train company, CSX, to move engines, but not the coal. Workers argue that since they are the ones to have mined the resource, they should be paid for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stand-off is the latest flashpoint for the coal industry, which has largely been dethroned by the rise of cheaper renewables and natural gas. And as coal companies have collapsed, workers have been hit hardest.\n\nCompanies like Westmoreland, which declared bankruptcy last October, have walked away from union contracts, leaving many miners in dire financial straits. Some without any union obligations have simply filed for bankruptcy without paying their workers, leaving money with executives and not with miners \u2014 as is the case with Blackjewel\u2019s Kentucky workers.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a millionaire is refusing to pay these miners for their hard work shows yet again that, for these coal executives, their profits always come before the health and well-being of everyone else,\u201d said Price, the Appalachian field organizer.\n\nThis tension has also spilled into federal politics.\n\nLast week, Appalachian coal miners suffering from black lung came to Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress for help. Their trip coincided with Trump\u2019s visit to West Virginia for a fundraiser hosted by Bob Murray, the head of coal company Murray Energy. Trump has repeatedly fought to keep the coal industry alive, going so far as to push for a government bailout of both coal and nuclear, which is also struggling. But the president has not commented on the protest in Kentucky, or on the trend of companies backing out of paying workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who has deep ties to coal industry executives, has been under pressure to side with the protesting miners, some of whom have questioned his commitment to helping them. On Thursday, McConnell called Blackjewel\u2019s treatment of its workers \u201cshameful and outrageous,\u201d establishing his stance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese miners need to be paid in full for their work,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said in a statement, although he did not indicate what measures he might take to assist that process.\n\nSome activists argue that coal\u2019s decline underscores the need for worker protections in any proposed climate action that might pass the federal government. Many have called for a \u201cjust transition\u201d \u2014 one that would see communities reliant on fossil fuels protected as the industry collapses. Proponents of the Green New Deal, a proposal to rapidly zero-out emissions across the United States, pointed to the Kentucky miner protest to underpin their argument.\n\n\u201cThe coal & mining industry isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d wrote the youth-led Sunrise Movement on Twitter this week. \u201cBut when these companies go under, the workers just trying to put food on the table don\u2019t deserve to suffer the consequences[.]\u201d\n\nSunrise, which supports the Green New Deal, went on to argue that the proposal would \u201cprovide the safe & sustainable green jobs our workers deserve\u201d and shared a link to a fundraiser for the miners.\n\nUnions and labor groups have taken varying stances on the Green New Deal, with some supporting its emphasis on worker protections and others arguing that it is too vague and could harm groups like coal miners. But clean energy advocates say that protecting impacted workers will remain a top priority.\n\n\u201cThese miners deserve what they are owed,\u201d said Price, \u201cand every worker with a job that depends on the fossil fuel industry deserves access to pensions, healthcare, and good-paying, family-sustaining careers as we transition to the clean energy economy.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-693664470.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
