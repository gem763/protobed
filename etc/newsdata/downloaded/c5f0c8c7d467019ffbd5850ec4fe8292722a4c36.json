The clip was eventually shared on Twitter, leaving social media users reeling in disgust.\n\nIn the video he explained the process of how he turned his clippings into a piece of jewellery, Mirror UK reports.\n\nOnce he\u2019d collected enough clippings, the man started by putting them into a blender.
