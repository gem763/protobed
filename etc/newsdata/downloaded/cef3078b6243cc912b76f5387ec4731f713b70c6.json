Elizabeth Warren released a plan Thursday that would \u201cpursue the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal\u201d by raising wages and extending labor rights to all workers.\n\nWhat would the plan do?\n\nWarren\u2019s proposal would extend federal labor and worker safety protections to farm and domestic workers, who are not covered by federal labor laws; bolster collective bargaining rights; increase the hourly minimum wage; and extend overtime eligibility to more workers. Much of her plan describes legislative proposals that she and other Democrats have introduced already in Congress; other parts would go further.\n\nWarren's plan would permit the National Labor Relations Board \u2014 the quasi-judicial agency charged with protecting workers\u2019 union rights \u2014 to impose monetary fines on employers that violate the National Labor Relations Act. (Right now, the NLRB may collect only back pay for workers.) It would also allow the NLRB to compel an employer to bargain with a union absent a union election when the employer has violated the law.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator\u2019s plan includes many components of H.R. 2474 (116), the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a bill she would urge lawmakers to pass. These include imposing restrictions on employers' ability to interfere in union elections and prohibiting state \u201cright to work\u201d laws (i.e., laws that prohibit unions from collecting mandatory fees from non-members to cover their share of collective bargaining costs).\n\nThe senator calls for establishing a broad \u201cjoint employer standard\u201d under federal labor and wage laws that would make it easier to hold businesses \u2014 particularly large chains \u2014 legally responsible for labor and wage violations committed by their franchisees and contractors.\n\nShe would allow workers to form a union through \u201ccard check\u201d (that is, the informal collection of authorization forms) rather than a secret-ballot election overseen by the NLRB. Under current law, workers must secure management's consent to create a union through card check. Warren would target the misclassification of employees as independent contractors by pushing lawmakers to enact a test similar to one imposed in California under a 2018 state supreme court decision that was recently codified into law by the California state legislature and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nAs president, she would repeal three Trump administration executive orders that significantly weaken federal workers' collective bargaining and other rights, and would allow federal employees to go on strike. (They are currently barred by law from doing so).\n\nWarren would also seek to create a European-style system of collective bargaining in which union leaders and managers agree on minimum standards for an entire industry sector rather than negotiate company-by-company.\n\nWarren would sign H.R. 582 (116), the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal hourly minimum wage gradually to $15, up from the current $7.25, and eliminate the lower tipped wage. On her first day as president, Warren says, she would sign an executive order requiring all federal contractors to pay a $15 hourly minimum.\n\nWarren would restore an Obama-era rule that would have given 4.2 million additional workers overtime eligibility. That regulation was enjoined by a federal court in Texas shortly before it was to take effect in December 2016. But recently, the Trump administration substituted a rule expanding overtime eligibility to 1.3 million workers.\n\nOn pensions, Warren favors S. 2254 (116), which would shore up insolvent multiemployer pensions like the Teamsters' Central States Pension Funds and the United Mine Workers' Pensions & Retiree Health Care. Warren would also resurrect the Obama Labor Department's fiduciary rule, which required brokers to consider only the best interests of the client, irrespective of commissions or fees, when providing retirement advice. A federal appeals court struck down that regulation last year.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan includes her proposed S. 3348 (115), which would require corporations with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to allow employees to elect at least 40 percent of the company\u2019s board. Warren would also favor legislation to ban \"no poach\" provisions, arbitration agreements, and class action waivers in employment contracts.", "description": "Sen.
