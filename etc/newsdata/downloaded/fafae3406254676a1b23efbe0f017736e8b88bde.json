Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nWhile the plot thickens, the strands that tie President Donald Trump to his Republican Party are wearing a little thinner.\n\nTwo men who had helped Rudy Giuliani investigate former Vice President Joe Biden now stand under federal indictment, as part of a swampy, alleged scheme to funnel Russian money into political campaigns.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, is blocking witnesses from appearing before Congress and dictating no cooperation with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nDon Emmert/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAnd a presidential directive removing U.S. troops from northern Syria has drawn wide condemnation at an inopportune time for the president.\n\nAbandoning the Kurds, who helped the U.S. defeat the Islamic State, has sparked outrage among prominent evangelicals, who fear a slaughter of both Kurds and Christians could come next. Retiring Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., sent word that he no longer supports Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nAlso notable: Add Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., to the list of Republican lawmakers who won\u2019t say if it\u2019s appropriate for the president to ask a foreign country for help investigating a political rival. And add former national security adviser H.R. McMaster to the list of former Trump administration officials who say Trump\u2019s actions were inappropriate.\n\nTrump has sought to rally his party against impeachment by highlighting and mocking the Democrats\u2019 process.\n\nBut on matters of substance, almost each day brings new reasons for his party to worry about the trail he is blazing.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nHeadlines this week again made it clear that foreign governments are extremely interested in gaining leverage and sway in U.S. politics \u2013 and employing a wide range of tactics to do so.\n\nThe indictment on Thursday against two Soviet-born businessmen based in Florida described a \"foreign national donor scheme.\" Law enforcement alleged the men arrested, both of whom had ties to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, \"conspired to circumvent the federal law against foreign influence,\" specifically funneling money from a Russian donor into candidate campaigns and a pro-Trump super PAC working in U.S. elections last year.\n\n\"These contributions were made for the purpose of gaining influence with politicians so as to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working,\" the indictment said. Relatedly, one of the foreign-born men arrested allegedly met a Trump adviser and sought his \"assistance\" removing or recalling then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. She was later recalled from her post.\n\nWin Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nTrump told reporters Thursday he does not know the gentlemen arrested, but added, \u201cThat is possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.\u201d\n\nPicture or not, the story alone raises serious questions (again) about the extent to which foreign actors, with foreign allegiances, were working to buy and manipulate their way into the good graces of the GOP and the president\u2019s campaign. And, whether having learned that may have been the case, the president cared and will do anything to defend against it happening next year.\n\nThe TIP with Quinn Scanlan\n\nDespite being the last candidate to jump into the large Democratic presidential field, Tom Steyer \u2013 the billionaire former hedge fund manager and liberal activist \u2013 has already qualified for November's primary debate. The other candidates have taken notice \u2013 and they aren't happy for him.\n\nSteyer has already spent an estimated $18.7 million on television ads, according to CMAG, nearly $5.8 million on Facebook ads and about $2.6 million on Google ads since announcing his campaign in July, dwarfing his Democratic competitors in total spending. In just the past week, he's spent more than $2 million on TV ads \u2013 and that\u2019s the entire amount his campaign said on Thursday that he's raised since he became a candidate.\n\nBrian Blanco/Getty Images\n\nIn a fundraising email sent to supporters on Monday, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's campaign said Steyer, \"succeeded in buying his way up\" onto the debate stage. On Tuesday, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., sent a fundraising email that said Steyer's,\"ability to spend millions of his personal wealth has helped him gain in the polls like no one else in this race.\" And in an email sent on Wednesday, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro took a more veiled shot at Steyer, not mentioning him by name, but writing, \"Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have billions in personal wealth to blanket the air with TV ads.\"\n\nThis coming Tuesday, Steyer will make his first debate appearance at Otterbein University in Ohio. Whether and how hard any candidates go after him for using his wealth to support his campaign will be something to watch for, especially considering that among the trio, only Booker \u2013 who will be next to Steyer on stage \u2013 has also already secured a spot in November's debate.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nAt least some of the still-unfounded claims referenced by President Donald Trump on his controversial call with Ukraine\u2019s president in July echoed a year-old effort by a Ukrainian government official to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, according to government documents reviewed by ABC News, public statements from the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others, as well as from newly unsealed court documents.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.
