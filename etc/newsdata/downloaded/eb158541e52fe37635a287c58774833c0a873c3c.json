ABC Is Giving Us Another Season of Holey Moley", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Eric McCandless/ABC\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Holey Moley, here\u2019s some good news fore you: A little birdie tells Vulture that ABC is teeing up another round of the network\u2019s delightfully bonkers miniature-golf-themed game show. The Alphabet today will officially announce that it has renewed the Steph Curry\u2013produced Holey Moley for a second season, with the series set to return summer 2020. Rob Riggle and Joe Tessitore are onboard to return as as the show\u2019s color and play-by-play commentators, respectively, with Jeannie Mai back as sideline correspondent, but there will be at least one tweak to the show\u2019s format.\n\nIn case you\u2019re not familiar with the concept behind the series, our Jen Chaney summed it up in her review, noting the series \u201ccombines the obstacle-course features of [American] Ninja Warrior \u2014 or, more accurately, the defunct ABC series Wipeout \u2014 with mini-golf, resulting in holes that have classic mini-golf obstacles but also zip lines and rolling logs that could knock a less-than-alert golfer out cold.\u201d That won\u2019t change in season two, but rather than trying to squeeze in 12 players during each hour-long show, episodes will now revolve around just eight competitors. The move will allow the hosts to spend more time on each match and let viewers get to know all of the players better. Producers are also planning to introduce an assortment of new holes to challenge contestants, hoping to top season one standouts such as \u201cThe Distractor,\u201d where annoying or famous folks \u2014 like Kenny G! \u2014 tried to mess up players as they made a putt. Curry will return with a small on-camera role as the show\u2019s resident golf pro. Chris Culvenor, Paul Franklin, Wes Dening, Charles Wachter, Michael O\u2019Sullivan, Jeron Smith, Erick Peyton, and Curry are all back as executive producers of the show, which was created by Culvenor via Eureka Productions.\n\nDuring its first season last summer, Holey Moley averaged 3.8 million viewers per episode and notched a 0.8 rating among adults under 50, right on par with the network\u2019s other Summer Fun & Games unscripted series. It also built on its Thursday lead-ins by over 20 percent in total viewers, giving ABC its best summer numbers in the 9 p.m. slot since 2015. ABC hasn\u2019t yet officially announced renewals for its other summer games, but sources familiar with the matter expect most, and likely all, of the network\u2019s game-show lineup to return, including 2019 newbies Press Your Luck and Card Sharks.", "description": "ABC is teeing up another round of Holey Moley, the network\u2019s delightfully bonkers miniature golf-themed game show.
