There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nRegardless, Trump said: \u201cIt was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice-President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent admission added to pressure on Democrats to begin impeachment proceedings. Even some Republicans urged the president to make public the details of his call with Zelenskiy. Trump hinted at such a move.\n\nThe details of the call are the subject of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s behaviour. Against legal precedent, the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share details with lawmakers, citing presidential privilege.\n\nIn what is swiftly becoming one of the most challenging moments of Trump\u2019s presidency, Maguire is due to testify before the House intelligence committee on Thursday.\n\nIt is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It\u2019s another to let him Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nOn Sunday, the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment over Trump\u2019s links with Russia, said administration officials \u201cwill be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation\u201d, if Maguire refuses to provide information to Congress.\n\nPelosi\u2019s statement, made in a letter to Democratic lawmakers, came after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the first-term congresswoman from New York who has emerged as a progressive leader, criticized her party\u2019s unwillingness to pursue impeachment.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2013 it is the Democratic party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It\u2019s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn\u2019t threatened when a president breaks the law. It\u2018s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP\u2019s silence [and] refusal to act shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ours is.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff, the chairman of the committee that will oversee Thursday\u2019s hearing, said on Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cWe may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.\u201d\n\nOn Monday Jim Himes of Connecticut, a member of the House panel, told CNN: \u201cExtorting a foreign leader for the purposes of getting that leader to do your political work, to try to find dirt on your opponent, is extortion. It is using the assets of the United States of America and the public trust for your own corrupt \u2026 ends, certainly political ends.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that the House will move into impeachment mode right away, but this really ups the ante.\u201d\n\nOf Pelosi\u2019s letter, Himes said: \u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard not to read between the lines there about what she means.\u201d\n\nAt the weekend, Biden, among the frontrunners for the Democratic presidential nomination, accused Trump of making a baseless political smear, in an \u201coverwhelming abuse of power\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m hoping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call Lindsey Graham\n\nThe Republican Utah senator Mitt Romney, a longtime Trump critic, said it was \u201ccritical for the facts to come out\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the president asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney [former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has admitted pressuring Ukraine], it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,\u201d Romney said.\n\nEven the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a fierce defender of Trump, said he was \u201choping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call. I think it would be good for the country if we could deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, told Fox News on Monday there can be \u201c10 to 20 people\u201d listening to such calls, and reiterated Trump\u2019s position that leaders need to be able to speak candidly.\n\n\u201cAnd so I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do it, I think, but there\u2019s a lot of other people, lawyers and the such, that may have a problem with it.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings in April 2014, two months after Ukraine\u2019s Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters.\n\nJoe Biden was heavily involved in US efforts to support the new pro-western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden raised concerns that the Ukrainian company was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.\n\nUkraine furore confirms Giuliani as Trump's most off-kilter advocate Read more\n\nTwo years later, Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire its prosecutor general, who was accused by many of being soft on corruption.\n\nTrump has claimed the prosecutor, who had led an investigation into Burisma\u2019s owner, \u201cwas after\u201d Hunter Biden and the vice-president was trying to protect his son. There is no evidence for this.\n\nTrump has insisted he said \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d in the call to Zelenskiy. The two leaders plan to meet at the UN general assembly in New York this week.\n\nTrump called the intelligence community whistleblower \u201cpartisan\u201d before acknowledging he did not know their identity.\n\nThe complaint was based on a series of events including the 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy, the Associated Press reported, citing intelligence officials.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa on Saturday, Biden said \u201cTrump deserves to be investigated\u201d for \u201ctrying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened\u201d. Biden said Trump was motivated by politics, \u201cbecause he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum\u201d.", "description": "Trump\u2019s apparent admission he discussed Biden with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in \u2018congratulatory\u2019 July conversation \u2018really ups the ante\u2019, Democrats say", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt", "Meaghan Winter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/963df5bae64596a877c66895deedb42b0e02fc84/0_126_4695_2817/master/4695.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25c09a3e00dc40bf37c8430c42791340", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
