Researchers now estimate that a typical human body is made up of about 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion bacteria. These are key in harvesting energy from our food, regulating our immune function, and keeping the lining of our gut healthy. Interest in, and knowledge about, the microbiota has recently exploded as we now recognise just how essential they are to our health. A healthy, balanced microbiome helps us break down foods, protects us from infection, trains our immune system and manufactures vitamins, such as K and B12. It also sends signals to our brain that can affect mood, anxiety and appetite. Imbalances in the gut are increasingly being linked to a range of conditions. Last year, scientists at California Institute of Technology found the first ever link between the gut and Parkinson's symptoms. The composition of our gut microbiota is partly determined by our genes but can also be influenced by lifestyle factors such as our diet, alcohol intake and exercise, as well as medications.\n\nResearchers from the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, led by Dr Nicolien de Clercq, professor of vascular medicine, looked at 24 participants.\n\nSixteen volunteers visited their in-laws while eight spent the holidays with their own family.\n\nThe team of academics took faecal samples on December 23 and again on December 27 and studied them for changes in DNA.\n\nIn participants visiting in-laws, there was a significant decrease in all ruminococcus species - suggesting they had experienced greater psychological stress.\n\nBoth groups consumed a similar amount of alcohol and ate the same kinds of foods.\n\nThis, scientists say, means they can rule out those environmental factors causing the change in gut bacteria.\n\nThe study was an observational study and so participants were not questioned about their mental or physical wellbeing.\n\nWriting in the study, published in the Human Microbiome Journal, the scientists said: 'Since we did not score the level of (experienced) stress during Christmas visits, we can only postulate that the difference in biomarker signature between visiting family and in-laws was due to stress.\n\n'Beyond known factors like diet, gender, BMI, age, physical exercise, pets and individual microbiome variations, there are many other yet to be identified factors that may have influenced our outcomes.\n\n'This study relied on a small group of volunteers as participants, and analysis of a greater pool of individuals would help to identify trends in microbiota changes with greater accuracy.\n\n'Participants had to report their food intake, without supervision from the research-team.\n\n'Despite the standardised questionnaires, the embarrassing and confronting nature of facing one\u2019s food intake, especially during Christmas, and the inconvenience of filling out a dietary assessment are likely to have influenced the reporting.'", "description": "Researchers from Amsterdam University looked at how the bacteria in participants' guts changed when they spent the festive season with their own family versus their partner's.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/09/19577916-0-image-a-5_1570782330080.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
