She delivered the infant in a toilet on February 21, 2019.\n\nDetroit police said that the mother covered the newborn with a towel before inflicting multiple stab wounds to its neck, placing its dead body in a purse and then moving it to her bedroom closet on February 21 2019.\n\nPolice attended Agnes Street apartments (pictured) in Detroit, Michigan, the day after the teenager gave birth. They found the remains of a recently born child in the girl's closet. The teenager told police that she had given birth to the baby in a toilet before killing it, stashing it in her purse and later moving it to her bedroom wardrobe\n\nPictured is the entrance to Agnes Street apartments where the girl hid the remains. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was 'multiple incised wounds to the neck'\n\nA police report from February said that the baby had been stillborn though this has now been disproven by the medical examiner.\n\nThe girl returned home and later collapsed, leading her mother to take her to the hospital. Once there, the girl is alleged to have recounted the story and police searched her property on Agnes Street where they found the baby.\n\nThe cause and manner of death was listed as 'multiple incised wounds to the neck,' according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner.\n\nA police report from February said that the baby had been stillborn though this has now been disproved by the medical examiner.\n\nAuthorities have said that she will be tried in juvenile court. Detroit courts can try adults as children but said that this was not an appropriate case.\n\nProsecutors have said that the girl will be able to stay outside of jail with her mother before her first hearing on the 25 October.\n\nPolice are also looking for the girl's boyfriend for the possibility of charging him with having sex with a minor.\n\nFellow Agnes Street resident, Jeffrey Lemons (pictured), couldn't believe that the girl would do something like that. Investigating officers said they ran into issues during the case which is why it took eight months to charge her\n\nNeighbor Jeffrey Lemons told WGTV4: 'I hope she didn\u2019t do that \u2013 that\u2019s the honest to God truth. I can\u2019t believe this girl would do that.'\n\nWayne County Prosecutors Office said that there were 'several issues that arose in the case,' which is why it took eight months to get charge her.\n\nThere was no clarification as to what the issues were.", "description": "Detroit authorities have charged a 16-year-old teenage mother for stabbing her one-day-old baby to death and hiding the remains in her purse before moving them to her bedroom closet.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19581204-0-image-a-51_1570787662570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
