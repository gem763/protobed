The prime minister is set to meet his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, later this week, and the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has also been holding sessions with his officials in Brussels.\n\nBoth sides are still entertaining publicly the possibility of a deal being reached and speaking yesterday, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, said: \u201cI think the deal is possible and very difficult, but possible\u201d.\n\nBut speaking in the European parliament later the same day, Barnier also dismantled Downing Street\u2019s border proposals for Norther Ireland point-by-point, adding: \u201cTo put things very frankly \u2013 we\u2019re not really in a position where we\u2019re able to find an agreement.\n\n\u201cTime is pressing. We are one week away from the European Council summit and just a few weeks away from the date of 31 October.\u201d\n\nVaradkar echoed his sentiment that a deal is, technically, possible. But he also added: \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any change to the EU negotiating position, we signed our guidelines to the council meetings, and they haven\u2019t changed and they certainly cannot change until the summit next week.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Irish government is concerned, we do want to deal, we\u2019re willing to work hard to get a deal, to work until the last moment to get a deal, but certainly not at any cost.\u201d\n\nA deal is not dead, but it is certainly on life support and the talks are on the brink of collapse. Unless there is a dramatic shift in red lines on either side in the next fortnight, Johnson will be forced to concede no Brexit agreement is possible before the Halloween deadline. An extension to the UK\u2019s membership of the EU will then be inevitable.", "description": "With just 21 days remaining, Boris Johnson appears to be on course for a resounding failure in delivering on his pledge to end the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union by 31 October.
