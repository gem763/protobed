Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate, is vowing to \u201cfight\u201d for back pay for illegal aliens.\n\nAs part of Warren\u2019s \u201cEmpowering American Workers and Raising Wages\u201d plan, illegal aliens who have worked illegally in the United States \u2014 sometimes by stealing Americans\u2019 identities and Social Security numbers \u2014 would become eligible to receive back pay for their previous work by amending the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nWarren writes:\n\nEnsuring employers can\u2019t exploit undocumented workers and drive down standards for all workers: The 2002 Supreme Court case Hoffman Plastic Compounds v. NLRB held that an undocumented worker could not receive the backpay he was owed from an employer who had violated the NLRA. That 5\u20134 ruling is wrong and denies millions of undocumented workers redress for illegal firings or other retaliatory conduct by an employer. The case encourages employers to hire undocumented immigrants and exploit them in numerous fields, including construction and manufacturing, which could lower wages for all workers. I will fight to amend the NLRA to end this form of exploitation and ensure that all workers are protected. [Emphasis added]\n\nDespite her platform of populist economic patriotism, Warren has committed to driving up foreign competition against America\u2019s working and middle class in the U.S. labor market by providing amnesty for 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, increasing current legal immigration levels, and decriminalizing illegal immigration.\n\nWarren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k \u2014 John Binder \ud83d\udc7d (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019\n\nAbsent from Warren\u2019s workers plan is a mandate and punishment for employers and businesses who hire illegal aliens over American citizens, as well as a reform to the H-1B visa program whereby Americans are readily replaced by foreign visa workers to increase profit margins for multinational corporations.\n\nWarren has not endorsed mandatory E-Verify \u2014 a system that prevents businesses from hiring illegal aliens over Americans \u2014 though it would decrease foreign competition against Americans, especially those most vulnerable to competing against illegal aliens in the labor market.\n\nIn contrast to Warren is President Trump\u2019s populist-nationalist \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d agenda, which has sought to increase interior immigration enforcement to tighten the labor market and delivered wage hikes for America\u2019s blue-collar and working class. Unlike Warren, Trump\u2019s latest national immigration plan includes a nationwide mandate of E-Verify to prevent Americans from being forced to compete for jobs against illegal aliens.\n\nToday, there are at least eight million illegal aliens holding American jobs in the U.S. economy that would have otherwise gone to American workers and legal immigrants. In most cases, these illegal workers obtain fraudulent work authorization documents or steal American citizens\u2019 identities in order to take jobs.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
