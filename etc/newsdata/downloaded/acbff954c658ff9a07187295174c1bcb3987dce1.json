Any rise could take weeks to feed through to petrol prices.\n\nHow has Iran reacted?\n\nIran has yet to respond to the latest US assertions.\n\nBut Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted on Sunday to deride Mr Pompeo, saying that \"having failed at max pressure, Sec Pompeo's turning to max deceit\".\n\nHe was referring to the Trump administration's stated \"maximum pressure campaign\" which has targeted Iran with sanctions since Washington pulled out of an international agreement to limit the scope of Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nHow did Saturday's attacks unfold?\n\nThe attacks targeted Abqaiq, the site of the largest oil processing plant run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco, and the Khurais oilfield.\n\nKhurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border - still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Smoke billowing from the oil facility in Abqaiq\n\nSaudi Arabia said drones carried out the attacks, which began at 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and sent huge clouds of thick, black smoke into the air.\n\nThe Houthi movement said its forces sent 10 drones towards the facilities and have since warned of further attacks.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries, but the extent of the damage to the facilities is still not entirely clear.\n\nWhy might the Houthis have attacked Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones toward populated areas in Saudi Arabia. The attacks have left at least four civilians dead.\n\nYemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.\n\nAlarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government and imposed a partial blockade on Yemen.\n\nThe UN says the conflict has claimed the lives of at least 7,290 civilians and left 80% of the population - 24 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.\n\nHouthi military spokesman Yahia Sari said on Saturday that operations against Saudi targets would \"only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues\".", "description": "US officials quote intelligence and show satellite images, but Iran denies involvement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1B78/production/_108823070_mediaitem108823069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
