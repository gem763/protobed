Though he was just 18 years old, he left behind a legacy in the world of esports, which included forming connections with superstars like Migos rapper Offset.\n\n\u201cI used to play the game and [Cruz] really got me better at Call of Duty,\u201d Migos told The Washington Post. \u201cHe was telling me a lot of information about esports. He was the one who was telling me like, \u2018Yo, you a big influencer, people would love to watch you play the game, bro.\u2019 He was the first one to tell me that. I wanted to eventually, you know, just bring him a part of something, some way, because he was the first kid to tell me [about esports].\u201d\n\nCruz and Offset met online playing Call of Duty, the former with dreams of professional gaming and the latter simply looking for opportunities to socialise that he was no longer afforded as a world-renowned musician. Cruz introduced Offset to the potential of esports, using examples like Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf winning $4 million at the Fortnite World Cup Finals as an example. The rapper eventually invested in premier gaming organisation FaZe Clan thanks to this influence, but Cruz wouldn\u2019t be around to celebrate.\n\nTwo days after the announcement of Offset\u2019s partnership with FaZe Clan, Cruz reportedly experienced hallucinations and was taken by authorities to a local hospital. After arriving at the facility, Cruz stole a car and fled, driving the vehicle into a nearby lake. His body was found by divers the following morning. The country coroner has since ruled Cruz\u2019s death a suicide, but his family disputes these findings in lieu of a toxicology report.\n\n\u201cHe always put his heart into gaming, to prove everyone wrong who didn\u2019t believe in him,\u201d Cruz\u2019s mother, Catherine Lugo, told The Washington Post. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have to believe in yourself first. I know I can do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe news of Cruz\u2019s passing sent shockwaves through the Call of Duty community, with many, including high-profile friends like Offset and professional soccer player Blas Ramos, posting eulogies for the young player on social media. Despite never meeting many of his acquaintances outside the confines of a competitive video game, Cruz is fondly remembered for his friendly, outgoing attitude.\n\n\u201cHe was always trying to help everyone he could,\u201d Ramos said.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, reach out to Lifeline Australia on 13 11 14.", "description": "Up-and-coming Call of Duty competitor Eric Pedro Cruz, who played under the names \u201cPhilosophy\u201d and \u201cLosophy,\u201d passed away on August 18.
