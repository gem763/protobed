The league's solution seemed to be shutting down discussion altogether.\n\nThe league announced Friday it would not hold any media availability events for the rest of its Chinese jaunt, a day after Beijing prohibited any kind of news conference before or after Thursday's preseason game between the Lakers and Nets.\n\nThe teams were scheduled to play again in China on Saturday morning, U.S. time, before returning to the U.S.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.", "description": "The NBA, which has rarely hesitated to speak out on U.S. political matters in recent years, showed \"no spine\" this week when faced with an opportunity to denounce China's\u00a0alleged human rights abuses, Fox Sports Radio host Clay Travis said Friday.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/travis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
