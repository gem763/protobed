I\u2019ve known some of you for 25 years. I haven\u2019t changed. I\u2019m the same Neil I was last Thursday,\u201d referring to the day before the NOAA statement was issued.\n\nJacobs specifically thanked Kevin Laws, science and operations officer with the weather service office in Birmingham. Laws said he appreciated the remarks by Jacobs, whom he has known for 20 years.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no hard feelings,\u201d Laws said.\n\nThe acting chief scientist at NOAA previously said the agency likely violated its scientific integrity rules when it publicly chastised the office in the unsigned statement, and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire asked the inspector general to investigate.\n\nPast NOAA administrators, a former National Weather Service chief and a former National Hurricane Center director \u2014 among others \u2014 have blasted the NOAA statement as inappropriate, saying they supported the chastised Alabama weather office.\n\nKathy Sullivan, who ran NOAA under former President Barack Obama, said Jacobs\u2019 words won\u2019t fix a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d he created.\n\n\u201cA trust has been shattered and only actions can repair it,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cTrust is like glass: shatters in an instant, with a single blow, and takes a long time to restore.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest general science society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said weather forecasters should not be \u201casked to change a weather forecast in reaction to any political pressure.\u201d\n\nRetired Adm. David W. Titley, an assistant NOAA administrator during the Obama administration and former meteorology professor at Pennsylvania State University, said it seemed Jacobs was stuck between orders from the White House and Department of Commerce and a rebellion by some in the National Weather Service.\n\n\u201cFor some reason he seems desperate to keep his job \u2014 and this results in the pathos we saw this morning,\u201d Titley said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cPersonally, I think his situation is untenable; he should attempt to salvage what\u2019s left of his self-respect. He either stands by the Friday p.m. statement or he does not - but he can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d\n\nPaul Schlatter, president of the 2,100-member National Weather Association, where Jacobs spoke, said he doesn\u2019t envy Jacobs, who he described as a career \u201cweather geek\u201d caught in a tough position.\n\nWeather officials said Birmingham forecasters didn\u2019t realize until reaction appeared on social media that the rumors about Dorian threatening the state started with the tweet from Trump, who apparently was relying on information several days old.\n\nThe office issued a tweet of its own saying Alabama wasn\u2019t at risk.\n\nLaws said Birmingham forecasters working in the agency\u2019s suburban office Sept. 1 were having a quiet morning when the phones suddenly lit up.\n\n\u201cWe got calls about people having surgery and should they cancel. We got calls about \u2018Should I go get my elderly parents?\u2019 There were so many concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nJacobs said Dorian presented forecasters with a \u201cparticularly difficult\u201d challenge and noted that, \u201cat one point, Alabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the Southeast.\u201d\n\nWhile some forecasters had talked about walking out on Jacobs\u2019 speech or staging some sort of protest, there was no demonstration and he received polite applause.", "description": "Struggling to keep his emotions in check, the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration both defended President Donald Trump\u2019s...", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR045_noaa09_ZG_20190910171958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
