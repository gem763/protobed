Jabe Jerram and Dyson Bowditch are making a success of JPMorgan\u2019s capital markets-led push. The bank\u2019s local leader, Paul Uren, moved to a regional role but he\u2019s got JPMorgan to the point where it\u2019s firing across equity, debt and M &A deals. The league tables show it.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Richard Wagner hasn\u2019t pulled his customary rabbit out of the hat this year \u2013 yet \u2013 but his bankers, including Andrew Hunter and Luke Boeg, have picked off lucrative mandates.\n\nCiti\u2019s Tony Osmond is one of the industry\u2019s most respected bankers, while private equity and industrials banker Dragi Ristevski is turning Citi into a sponsor powerhouse, winning high-profile sell-side mandates. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Anthony Miller and Alex Cartel keep the Germans in the race, despite ructions offshore.\n\n1. Michael Stock\n\nStock has become the most talked-about man in Australian investment banking. A polarising figure, the Jefferies country head set up Australia\u2019s newest bank and led from the front with a bunch of mandates more established outfits couldn\u2019t get near. He can\u2019t topple the might of UBS or Macquarie Capital in the league tables, but he has a strong presence and gives his former colleagues at UBS and Credit Suisse plenty to think about.\n\nClient service is his calling card; he is meticulous, strategic and keen for the firm to lead leveraged finance. Most notably, he advised KKR on its successful $3 billion leveraged bid for Arnott\u2019s and Nine, as it seeks to buy out Macquarie Radio.\n\n2. Aidan Allen & Anthony Sweetman\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair co-head investment banking for UBS Australasia and Sweetman is also the bank\u2019s co-country head. They\u2019re jokingly referred to as Australian banking\u2019s odd couple, and their own team jokes that they wouldn\u2019t be out of place on Married At First Sight.\n\nSweetman is the UBS mainstay who has stepped up as long-time colleagues Matthew Grounds and Guy Fowler moved on; meanwhile, Allen won the bank a major role in Woolworths\u2019 proposed $10 billion liquor spin-off. The pair are lucky to have the likes of capital markets whiz Robbie Vanderzeil, industrials bankers Geoff Davis, Nick Brown and Nick Alexander, real estate banker Tim Church and Melbourne head Kelvin Barry on side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Christian Johnston\n\nSome big-name retirements this year have left the Goldman Sachs head of investment banking arguably Australia\u2019s most experienced M &A banker. His strength is keeping on top of his blue-chip client list \u2013 think BHP, Oil Search and Treasury Wine Estates \u2013 but his challenge is bringing through Goldman\u2019s next generation of stars. Insiders reckon Zac Fletcher and Tim Freeman are winning a lot of work and financing banker Chris Champion hustles hard, while Johnston keeps Nick Sims close. The firm\u2019s big money spinner is its special situations team, run by Simon Rothery and David Gribble.\n\n4. Joe Fayyad\n\nAfter two years rebuilding BAML\u2019s Australian investment bank, Fayyad proved it could now play in the big leagues when he helped stitch up Brookfield\u2019s complex $4.4 billion bid for Healthscope.\n\nThat deal, in which BAML was sole adviser to Brookfield, single-handedly put BAML and its big balance sheet back in the conversation. Fayyad and his newly put together senior team \u2013 including Jonathan Denby, Dan Janes, Mark Warburton and Chris Gronow \u2013 have since won work for the likes of Macquarie Group, DEXUS and Aveo.\n\n5. Tim Joyce & John Pickhaver\n\nMacquarie Capital\u2019s strength is the size of its team. Joyce and Pickhaver\u2019s positions as co-heads put them on the list, but the spot could be shared with several of the pair\u2019s senior dealmakers, who increasingly find themselves reporting offshore. The Macquarie team is stable and it is important it dominates the bank\u2019s home market, particularly with new CEO Shemara Wikramanayake watching over the group. TMET banker Darren Keogh, Jeremy Tasker (sponsors), Russell Keating (resources), David Mustow (consumer), Geoff Joyce (M &A) and Marianne Birch (FIG) are top of the class.\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
