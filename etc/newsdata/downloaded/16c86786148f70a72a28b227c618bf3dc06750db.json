And the top-tier \u2014 no longer five candidates, but three \u2014 is becoming more insurmountable.\n\nFor more than a year, Democrats had approached their nominating contest with a widely-shared belief that \u2014 like Republicans in the earliest stages of their primary four years ago \u2014 they, too, might take turns rising and falling in an expansive field. That expectation sustained the campaigns of more than two dozen contenders this year.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the leading band of candidates has contracted unexpectedly early. Heading into the fall, only three contenders are polling above single digits: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nKamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg remain at the periphery, while lower-polling candidates have largely failed to muster sustained, upward movement in fundraising or polling.\n\nAccording to interviews with about two dozen Democratic operatives and consultants, there is little reason to expect any of them will.\n\n\u201cIt was legitimate to say \u2018Top 5\u2019 for a long time, but with the exception of Kamala Harris being at the outer perimeter of the top three \u2026 you\u2019d have to have a strange confluence of events for someone outside those four to win,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a longtime Hillary Clinton confidant. \u201cIt would require all four failing. Like, you would need all four of them to be in a plane crash or something.\u201d\n\nFor every other candidate, Reines said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late in the game to keep saying it\u2019s too early.\u201d\n\nBy this point in the Republican primary in 2016, Jeb Bush was already cratering. Scott Walker had risen and fallen. Donald Trump was in first, still to fend off a surge from Ben Carson before running away from the field.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic primary, by contrast, has been defined by its relative stability, with two full fundraising periods and two sets of debates now done.\n\nAnna Greenberg, a pollster who advised former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s since-aborted presidential bid, said there was no boom-and-bust for Democrats because the primary \u201cstarted so early, before voters really started paying attention,\u201d and because of \u201cthe sheer volume of candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surprising because compared to \u201816 on the Republican side, where it seemed like a number of people had their moment in the sun \u2026 there hasn\u2019t really been anybody who\u2019s taken a meteoric rise,\u201d said Scott Brennan, an Iowa Democratic National Committee member and former state party chairman.\n\nBrennan said he's spoken with several campaigns recently whose advisers \u201cfeel like they\u2019re poised and ready, they\u2019re poised and they're waiting for their moment.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cfor whatever reason,\" he said, \"they haven\u2019t had that.\u201d\n\nIn a spate of campaigning over the holiday weekend, Amy Klobuchar released a plan to address climate change, Sanders previewed his plan to cancel Americans\u2019 medical debt and Beto O\u2019Rourke reiterated his call for stricter gun laws, telling CNN of the nation's recent mass shootings, \u201cYes, this is f----- up.\u201d\n\nOn Labor Day, the candidates fanned out across the country, with Biden heading to Iowa, Warren to New Hampshire, Cory Booker to Nevada and Harris to California. The activity came on the heels of several candidates dropping out after failing to get traction \u2014 and speculation about more to follow \u2014 reinforcing the advantage held by the frontrunners.\n\nLast week, Kirsten Gillibrand became the latest campaign casualty, a week after Jay Inslee abandoned his effort. With five months before Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses, six candidates have already dropped out.\n\nDemocratic strategist Matthew Littman, a former speechwriter for Biden who now backs Harris, described the field as \"mostly settled\" among five candidates, including Harris and Buttigieg in that group. Unlike in 2016, when many Republicans were wary of, if not opposed to, Trump, Democrats are \u201cmostly satisfied\u201d with the range of ideologies and experiences represented by the top tier, he said.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates are SOL, and it has been that way for a couple of months,\u201d Littman said.\n\nFor Biden, Sanders and Warren, the advancing calendar appears likely to compound their advantage, as early fundraising success and staff hiring allows them to begin advertising and to intensify voter outreach.", "description": "'It\u2019s too late in the game to keep saying it\u2019s too early,' a former Hillary Clinton adviser says of the Democratic presidential primary.", "authors": ["David Siders", "Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"}
