He also sent the memo to key congressional offices and a number of outside GOP groups in an effort to discredit reporting from the New York Times alleging that, while at Yale, classmate Max Stier witnessed Kavanaugh \u201cpush his penis into the hand of\u201d a female student.\n\nThe talking points memo, a copy of which was obtained by Yahoo News, was sent to the White House counsel\u2019s office, the White House press shop, the Republican National Committee and conservative-leaning outside groups such as the Heritage Foundation. None of these groups responded to requests for comment by time of publication.\n\nA source close to the effort told Yahoo News that most of the talking points have aided GOP rapid response via Twitter and inspired conservative outlets and writers in their second-day articles, including one that ran in the Washington Examiner. (The Examiner reporter did not respond to a request for comment.) And while it\u2019s unclear if the White House has distilled these points in any of its official guidances, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere retweeted one such article shared by Article III on his personal Twitter account.\n\n\u201cThese [talking points] have been moved far and wide,\u201d the source said. \u201cHow people are using them are up to them.\u201d\n\nArticle III, which was established in May, has taken an aggressive approach to defending conservative judicial nominations. Davis, its president, told the New York Times earlier this year that the organization\u2019s plan was to \u201cput on the brass knuckles and fight back.\u201d\n\nThe talking points, which focus on undermining the credibility of the accusers and those who broke the news of the allegations, are very much in that vein.\n\nThe talking points are separated into categories, the first addressing the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s handling of allegations by Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who said that during a dorm party in the early 1980s, he \u201cthrust his penis in her face,\u201d which forced her to \u201ctouch it without her consent.\u201d Those allegations were first published in the New Yorker in September 2018. The Supreme Court justice denies those allegations.\n\nIn response, the talking points focus on the response from Sen. Chuck Grassley, then the Judiciary Committee chairman, who insisted, based on an FBI and staff investigation, that there was no corroboration of the alleged misconduct or assault by Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the investigation, staff members spoke with 35 individuals, a task that required extensive work during nights and weekends. More than 20 Committee staffers contributed to the investigative efforts,\u201d the memo says. \u201cThe Committee never received any evidence that would corroborate the claims made by Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick or anybody else.\u201d\n\nCritics of the inquiry, including many Democratic lawmakers, have objected that the FBI as well as the committee did a rushed job, declining to contact witnesses who made themselves available for interviews.\n\nAnother segment of the memo focuses on the attempt to discredit Ramirez\u2019s account specifically, pointing toward alleged holes in initial Times reporting, while also arguing that it was \u201cpartisan.\u201d\n\nThe Times report, which was adapted from a new book by the reporters, fell under heavy criticism from both the left and right after it was published. The Times later issued an editor\u2019s note noting that the original article left out the fact that the female student in question, upon being contacted by reporters, did not recollect such an incident \u2014 a detail that was included in the book.\n\nThe talking points memo comes as several Democratic presidential candidates have called for either new investigations into or impeachment of Kavanaugh, joining the voices who claim that the latest allegations prove that the justice lied under oath during hearings on the initial allegation between him and Christine Blasey Ford.", "description": "A conservative group that has aided the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees is now leading the GOP's charge against the most recent allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.", "authors": ["Brittany Shepherd", "National Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NFXpCSclf6uzgQ6H5mYReQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f54f13e0-d8a3-11e9-aff3-7063dbd689fc", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
