Not quite so much anymore. Many mainstream brands are branching out into extended sizing.\n\nOne such brand is Nike (NKE). The swoosh brand is making a firm push into size inclusivity. On its recent earnings call, Mark G. Parker, Nike\u2019s president & CEO, noted the brand\u2019s commitment in the area.\n\n\u201cFrom competition to fitness, to light activity, to play, our more inclusive view on design is opening up new lanes of opportunity for growth. For example, we\u2019re studying the state of our product to serve more body types with our successful plus-size line,\u201d he said.\n\n[Related: Nike earnings, sales top Wall Street's expectations for 1Q 2020]\n\nHawaii Oahu \u2014 NIKE More\n\nNike now features an array of models large and small throughout its site and in ads in its stores. It also includes extended sizes on the same pages as smaller sizes.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love the idea of \u2018plus\u2019 being included in the same section instead of the sad, dark, back corner of the store to which it is usually relegated,\u201d Sarah Chiwaya, who runs the fashion blog \u201cCurvily.\u201d\n\nGrowing market\n\nIt\u2019s not just Nike stepping up to the plate. American Eagle (AEO) recently expanded its jean sizing to accommodate up to a size 24 for women and up to a size 48 for men. And Cornerstone Brands, owner of Garnet Hill and other consumer brands, just launched Ryllace, which offers \u201cpremium casual\u201d clothing in extended sizing.\n\n\u201cThe idea emerged from growing demand in the marketplace for a high-quality product with a focus on premium materials and versatility for the plus-size woman,\u201d said Cornerstone president Claire Spofford.\n\nWith obesity on the rise in the U.S, it makes sense that more companies would cater to bigger body types. In 2016, the average woman was 5\u20193\u201d and weighed 170.6 pounds and the average man weighed stood 5\u20197\u201d tall and weighed in at 197.9 pounds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s up from 163.8 pounds and 189. 4 pounds, respectively. According to NPD, the size of the women\u2019s extended-size clothing market alone is $21.4 billion.\n\nChubstr Editor in Chief Bruce Sturgell More\n\nWith bigger bodies in mind\n\nBruce Sturgell, editor-in-chief of Chubstr \u2014 a lifestyle website centered around the men of size \u2014 is excited about the progress being made in the industry. Sturgell tells Yahoo Finance that while the extended-size market for men isn\u2019t as well developed as the women\u2019s market, the overall industry has seen huge growth over the past few years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift in mainstream culture that says that bigger people are worthy of dignity and deserve the same options as everyone else,\u201d Sturgell said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than simply up-sizing a garment that was originally created using a smaller fit model. Companies are making clothing specifically with bigger bodies in mind, and customers are buying it up. It's a win-win for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
