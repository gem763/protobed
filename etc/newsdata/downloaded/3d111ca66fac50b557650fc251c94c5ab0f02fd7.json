Katie Hill resigns and vows to fight \u2018cyber exploitation\u2019 \u2014 why more women are victims of \u2018revenge porn\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "As many people fixated on her alleged affairs with staffers, outgoing Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) pledged to fight a different factor driving her resignation: cyber exploitation.\n\nThe freshman representative for California\u2019s 25th district announced Sunday that she would resign from Congress, after admitting to a sexual relationship with a female campaign staffer \u2014 which she called an \u201cinappropriate\u201d consensual relationship with a subordinate \u2014 and denying an alleged affair with a male congressional aide, which is under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\n\nBut in the midst of the scandal, the conservative website RedState.com and The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, also published intimate photos of 32-year-old Hill \u2014 an act she deemed \u201ccyber exploitation\u201d and \u201can appalling invasion of my privacy.\u201d Hill laid blame at the feet of her \u201cabusive\u201d estranged husband and \u201chateful political operatives,\u201d and said she would pursue all available legal options.\n\n\u2018Now, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.\u2019\n\n\u201cThose of you who know me personally know that I\u2019m a fighter,\u201d Hill wrote in a resignation letter. \u201cNow, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s case made headlines, but revenge porn plagues millions of Americans. About one in 25 internet users has \u201chad sensitive images posted without their permission or had someone threaten to post photos of them,\u201d according to a 2016 survey of more than 3,000 people published by Data & Society, an independent nonprofit research institute, and the nonprofit Center for Innovative Public Health Research.\n\nSome 2% of men and 4% of women say they\u2019ve been threatened with revenge porn, while 2% of men and 3% of women say they\u2019ve actually been victims of revenge porn.\n\nBut those figures soar for young women: Some 10% women below age 30 have been threatened with the possibility of nonconsensual public image-sharing versus 3% for men under 30.\n\nSome commentators say the use of nude images to shame women in reportedly greater numbers is an extension of a culture of misogyny and domestic abuse. \u201cRevenge porn is fundamentally used to shame, extort and harm women,\u201d Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann, two U.K.-based academics and former hosts of a podcast called RightsUp, part of the Oxford Human Rights Hub.\n\n\u201cPerpetrators of domestic violence and trafficking employ it to control women, to keep them captive, to keep them quiet,\u201d they wrote in The Guardian newspaper. \u201cTrolling tells women (and others) that the digital space, a communal space, is not for their voices. Gendered hate speech online actively restricts the free speech of women.\u201d\n\nGoogle GOOG, +1.97% GOOGL, +1.95%, Twitter, Facebook FB, +0.80% and Reddit have all pledged to honor requests to remove images of revenge porn.\n\nAnother response to the most recent case involving Katie Hill from Charlotte Clymer, the rapid-response press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, drew attention to a gendered double standard and discrimination against Hill\u2019s bisexuality.\n\n\u201cThis is heartbreaking and a reminder that women in elected office are held to entirely different standards than their male colleagues,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe horror of revenge porn and the cruelty of biphobia will not get nearly as much discussion as they deserve.\u201d\n\nSuch nonconsensual pornography is linked to negative mental-health outcomes, social isolation and damage to personal relationships, according to a 2016 article published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.\n\n46 U.S. states and D.C. have passed laws barring nonconsensual pornography. The law in California, Hill\u2019s home state, makes revenge-porn cases hard to prove and categorizes it as a misdemeanor.\n\nForty-six U.S. states and the District of Columbia have passed laws barring nonconsensual pornography. The law in California, Hill\u2019s home state, makes revenge-porn cases hard to prove in court and categorizes the offense as a misdemeanor, Vice News reported last week.\n\nHill\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to MarketWatch\u2019s questions about Hill\u2019s plan to pursue legal options and her vow to tackle the exploitation issue in the future. Politico previously obtained a cease-and-desist letter from Hill\u2019s attorneys to the Daily Mail.\n\nHill retweeted TWTR, -0.79% defenses of herself on Sunday and Monday. One came from writer and lawyer Jill Filipovic, who suggested critics of Hill were missing the point.\n\n\u201cTo everyone being like, \u2018well Katie Hill shouldn\u2019t have taken nude photos!!!!\u2019: you are the reason more women don\u2019t run for office. You are the reason women don\u2019t report the kind of abuse Hill\u2019s ex has inflicted on her,\u201d Filipovic tweeted.", "description": "\u201cThis is heartbreaking and a reminder that women in elected office are held to entirely different standards than their male colleagues,\u2019 said Charlotte...", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU149_hill_ZG_20191028125701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
